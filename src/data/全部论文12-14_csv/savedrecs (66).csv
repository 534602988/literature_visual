In particular, we focus on a borrower's ability to avoid a foreclosure auction by getting a modification, by refinancing the loan, or by selling the property. We find that the outcomes of the foreclosure process are significantly related to: loan characteristics including the borrower's credit history, current loan-to-value and the presence of a junior lien; the borrower's post-default payment behavior, including the borrower's participation in foreclosure counseling; neighborhood characteristics such as foreclosure rates, recent house price depreciation and median income; and the borrower's race and ethnicity.","[Chan, Sewin] NYU, Robert F Wagner Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Sharygin, Claudia] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Been, Vicki] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Haughwout, Andrew] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA",New York University; Urban Institute; New York University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Chan, SW (通讯作者)，NYU, Robert F Wagner Sch Publ Serv, 295 Lafayette St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",sewin.chan@nyu.edu; csharygin@urban.org; vicki.been@nyu.edu; andrew.haughwout@ny.frb.org,,,,,,,26,18,27,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Informal governance mechanisms provided the foundation for the development of insurance law administered by specialist courts. Efforts to tax and regulate the industry frequently met with limited success, both because of inter-jurisdictional competition and because merchants and brokers could to some extent opt out of the formal system.

Expenditure for outbound travel (tourism imports) in five source markets are analysed using econometric models that can capture varying magnitudes of price and income effects depending on the phase of the business cycle. The main reasons why income elasticities may vary across the business cycles are loss aversion, liquidity constraints and precautionary saving, as well as the intensity and time structure of substitution effects between expenditures on tourism imports, domestic tourism and other goods and services. The forecasting results clearly demonstrate that forecasting errors can be reduced by using the suggested approach, which considers possible asymmetric income effects, instead of the mainstream approach applied in most tourism demand studies, which is based on the assumption of constant elasticities across the business cycles.","[Smeral, Egon] Austrian Inst Econ Res, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Smeral, Egon] Modul Univ, A-1190 Vienna, Austria",,"Smeral, E (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res, Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",egon.smeral@wifo.ac.at,,,,,,,21,16,16,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In order to formulate sustainable and efficient transport policies, development of new tools and techniques is necessary. One of the approaches gaining ground is policy packaging, which shifts focus from implementation of individual policy measures to implementation of combinations of measures with the aim of increasing efficiency and effectiveness of policy interventions by increasing synergies and reducing potential contradictions among policy measures. In this paper, we describe the development of a virtual environment for the exploration and analysis of different configurations of policy measures in order to build policy packages. By developing systematic approaches it is possible to examine more alternatives at a greater depth, decrease the time required for the overall analysis, provide real-time assessment and feedback on the effect of changes in the configurations, and ultimately form more effective policies. The results from this research demonstrate the usefulness of computational approaches in addressing the complexity inherent in the formulation of policy packages. This new approach has been applied to the formulation of policies to advance sustainable transportation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that shopping centers with large operating costs are less likely to expand and are more likely to contract. Higher expected revenue per square foot increases the likelihood of expansion and decreases the likelihood of contraction. For small shopping centers the decision to change gross leasable area (GLA) is largely driven by potential revenue, while the decision to change the number of stores is largely a function of cost. We find some support for Grenadier's theory that a larger number of competitors reduces the value of option to wait and increases the likelihood of both expansion and contraction. The market share of competitors reduces the likelihood of increasing the number of stores as suggested by the theory of strategic positioning. Our hypotheses best explain contraction decisions of large shopping centers and expansion decisions of small shopping centers. We find that both expansions and contractions of GLA are less likely for large shopping centers in MSAs with greater uncertainty about real estate prices, indicating that the option to delay has value. Moreover, small centers are significantly less sensitive to cost and revenue; since small centers are likely to have greater idiosyncratic risk than large; this provides indirect evidence for a significant delay option.","[Clapp, John M.; Zhou, Tingyu] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business Adm, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Bardos, Katsiaryna Salavei] Fairfield Univ, Dolan Sch Business, Fairfield, CT 06824 USA",University of Connecticut; Fairfield University,"Clapp, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sch Business Adm, 2100 Hillside Rd Unit 1041, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",john.clapp@business.uconn.edu; kbardos@fairfield.edu; tingyu.zhou@business.uconn.edu,,"Clapp, John/0000-0002-0342-367X; Zhou, Tingyu/0000-0002-2787-9137",,,,,50,4,5,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

If they refrained from drawing all the consequences of their critical stances, this can be attributed to philosophical preconceptions rather than theoretical limitations.","Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, I-50121 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Dardi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",marco.dardi@unifi.it,"DARDI, MARCO/KBD-2040-2024","DARDI, MARCO/0000-0003-0414-7379",,,,,20,1,1,0,2,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Conversely, it also has disadvantages: high purchase price, reduced driving range and insufficient charging system (long charging time and low network coverage). Car purchase behaviour is a well-studied process where explanatory models estimate the discrete choice probability of each alternative of the choice set based on car and consumers (socioeconomic) attributes. Differently, few studies have focused on the identification of the most plausible choice set depending on the individuals' characteristics. This study aimed to evaluate the market potential of EV when such surveys are lacking, by identifying the households to whom the EV would be a plausible choice when buying a new car, despite its current cost and technological limitations. We developed a rule-based screening methodology where alternatives are eliminated from the consumer's choice set using simple non-compensatory rules. In the end, we aim to obtaining a choice set that is closer to the real consumer's choice set based on his socioeconomic traits and mobility patterns. After characterising households according to a set of 19 indicators (e.g., 'Home location', 'Activity time', 'Daily trips', etc.), they are classified according to 5 profiles that correspond to increasing probability of including an EV in their choice set. The latter two profiles delimit the potential market of EV. To accommodate the uncertainty regarding the future of EV related policies, four scenarios concerning different incentive policies were considered. This method was implemented in a case study in Lisbon Metropolitan Area, Portugal. Results suggest that, currently, the diffusion of EV in LMA is very restricted, ranging from 2% to 6.2% of the households, depending on the incentive policies. Even if the price of the EV was not a barrier, it would still be suitable only to 10.4% of the LMA households. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Urban wastes in developing countries are rich in recyclable organic matter and they increase as urbanization increases. A recent project carried out in Dakar analyzed the potential contribution of urban organic waste (OW) to urban horticultural production. A research project was conducted in order to 1) carry out farm surveys to understand local fertilization practices; 2) identify and characterize locally available organic wastes chemically; and 3) carry out experiments with these wastes in greenhouses and farms to evaluate their agronomic potentialities and their implementation in local farmers' practices. Horse and poultry manure are the main OW used by farmers around Dakar; however, these may become less available and/or more expensive in the future. The OW obtained after sifting through other sources of urban wastes (i.e., compost) could provide an alternative and unlimited source of organic matter. However, chemical analyses of this compost show that organic matter and nitrogen levels are weak compared to manure. Experiments were therefore conducted in greenhouses with the two representative soils of the region, a sandy-clay soil (Deck) and a sandy soil (Dior): these showed no significant effect of compost on the early growth of tomatoes compared to treatment without compost, but rather a light-positive effect at the end of the tomato-growth cycle, consistent with the analytical properties of the product. The fertilizing value of this compost is low and will require the addition of other fertilizing inputs. On-farm tests have been carried out on tomato in the same soils, where the agronomic values of treatments combining compost, manure and other local organic inputs are compared. The initial results are now under study (available December 2010).","[N'Dienor, M.; Aubry, C.] AgroParisTech, INRA SAD, Paris, France; [Sall, S.] Univ Gaston Berger UGB, IRD Lemsat, Dakar, Senegal",INRAE; AgroParisTech; Universite Gaston Berger,"N'Diénor, M (通讯作者)，AgroParisTech, INRA SAD, Paris, France.",ndienor1@yahoo.fr; caubry@agroparistech.fr; saidou-nourou.sall@ugb.edu.sn,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,9,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-08-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1021.0,,,,,,263.0,270,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB5GQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343861400022,0

Efforts in this vein often entail the provision of greater mobility, as when high-speed feeder buses are used to carry commuters to and from trunk-line stations. Other efforts have focused on the creation of more favorable land-use patterns, as occurs when households within a Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) are tightly clustered around trunk stations. The efficacy of these mobility and land-use solutions are separately examined in the present work. To this end, continuum approximation models are used to design idealized transit systems that minimize the generalized costs to both the users and the operators of those systems. The assessments unveil how the choice of transit technology for the trunk-line portion of a transit network can be influenced by its access mode. If transit is accessed solely (and slowly) on foot, then the optimal spacings between lines, and between the stations along those lines, are small. This can place capital-intensive rail systems at a competitive disadvantage with transit systems that feature buses instead. When access speeds increase, the optimal spacings between lines and stations expand. Hence, if accessed by fast-moving feeder buses, Metro-rail or bus-rapid transit can become preferred trunk-line options. By comparison, the influence of altered land use patterns brought by TODs tends to be less dramatic. We find that clustering households around Metro-rail stations justifies larger spacings between the stations. Yet, this produces only modest reductions in generalized costs because the larger spacings penalize transit users who reside outside of the TODs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, managers can benefit by taking such decisions with the support of various tools of modeling the behavior of company in the market. In contrast to continuous processes, for which a number of optimization methods was developed and published, batch optimization techniques are not so common. The major obstacle is the complexity of these processes - in which a huge impact on the quality and profitability of the final product have even slight variations in recipes and parameters of the raw materials, additionally their analytical description is very complicated. A further complication is the fact that some of the independent variables are random whose distributions may be different from a normal distribution. In addition, there is the interaction between basic products, additional products and waste in batch processes. The article presents a business model of multi-batch processes in which a part of the independent variables are random. There have been carried out Monte Carlo simulation of the short-term impact of changes in these variables on the objective function: first coverage margin and indicated the possibility to use statistical inference to support management decisions on the example of the real production process.","[Stelmach, Jacek] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Stelmach, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat, Katowice, Poland.",jacek.stelmach@polwax.pl,"Stelmach, Jacek/Q-3593-2019","Stelmach, Jacek/0000-0001-9348-5315",,,,,13,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-43-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,185.0,193,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367244900019,0

In the framework of this research, we examined 5 webpages of the capital cities in the region (Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, and St. Petersburg). To maintain the experimental integrity, the investigated museums were of the same field. There were museum websites of historical museums, art museums, war memorial museums, the historical museums of transport (railway and navy museums), and museums of history (ethnography). As a result, the following research identified the pivotal points that are typical as for the whole region and for the specific countries as well. The research has showed that the museums webpages are not used effective enough as a tool to attract money due to the fact that the website opportunity is mainly considered as an advertisement or PR-tool. The research revealed that it is more common for financially stable museums to use website as an additional revenue tool. As for instance, St. Petersburg museums are likely to use websites as a part of fundraising strategy rather than museums of Tallinn and Riga. At the same time, the research detected the similarity in the problems of Baltic Sea region museum webpages. This helped to elaborate a guideline for museums that set up or update its websites. Since the following research conducted in 2014 was focused on the large museums' problems, in order to give a complete picture it is necessary to investigate the same issues based on websites of provincial and small museums.","[Tolstikova, Irina; Shubinskiy, Maksim; Tolstikova, Anna] ITMO Univ, Ctr Design & Multimedia, St Petersburg, Russia",ITMO University,"Tolstikova, I (通讯作者)，ITMO Univ, Ctr Design & Multimedia, St Petersburg, Russia.",,"Tolstikova, Irina/ABA-1319-2021","Tolstikova, Irina/0000-0003-2804-7102",,,,,5,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,493.0,500,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900064,0

Panel VAR results for quarterly state-level data indicate that price-foreclosure linkages run both ways. Foreclosures negatively impact home prices. The negative impact of prices on foreclosures, however, is much larger. These results suggest the low-frequency association observed between foreclosures and prices is mostly driven by the endogenous adjustment of foreclosures to prices via the strategic choices of homeowners and lenders, rather than through the effects of foreclosures on home prices.","[Calomiris, Charles W.] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Longhofer, Stanley D.] Wichita State Univ, Barton Sch Business, Wichita, KS 67260 USA; [Miles, William R.] Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA",Columbia University; Wichita State University; Wichita State University,"Calomiris, CW (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",cc374@columbia.edu; stan.longhofer@wichita.edu; william.miles@wichita.edu,,,,,,,16,13,19,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,DEC,2013,41.0,4,,,,,709.0,746,,10.1111/reec.12011,0.0,,,38,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,273PU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328549000001,0

In part, this reflects the growing scale and complexity of personal finance markets and how these are increasingly interwoven into the everyday lives of individuals. However, it is also argued that the development of the concept of financial exclusion reflects preeminent neoliberal discourses that emphasise the centrality of individual responsibility, autonomy and consumer participation within markets. In 2004 the then Labour government, in conjunction with academic experts, financial institutions and other organisations, established a project of financial inclusion in relation to three key domains: banking, affordable credit and financial capability. The consequence, it is suggested here, has not been so much to alleviate inequality as to nurture the poor to be precautionary, risk averse financial subjects. This stands in contrast with the virtues of enterprise and risk-taking called up in middle-class investor subjects.","Robert Gordon Univ, Fac Hlth & Social Care, Sch Appl Social Studies, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, Scotland",Robert Gordon University,"Marron, D (通讯作者)，Robert Gordon Univ, Fac Hlth & Social Care, Sch Appl Social Studies, Garthdee Rd, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, Scotland.",d.s.marron@rgu.ac.uk,,,,,,,90,31,35,0,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

A microeconomic analysis is developed to assess the economic sustainability of ancient olive orchards in relation to other local existing types of olive orchards. Results show that ancient olive orchards have a positive net margin, although lower than the thickened and intensive ones. However, a better management and an optimization of agricultural practices of ancient trees can increase extra virgin olive oil production, reduce production costs, and decrease the net margin gap in the ancient orchards compared to the other ones.

Using a new database, the article introduces an epidemiological variable that has not been considered in the literature: territorial pervasiveness of the contagion. This variable is much more relevant than local mortality rates in accounting for the different regional impact of plague. Epidemics, and not economic hardship, generated a severe demographic crisis in Italy during the seventeenth century. Plague caused a shock to the economy of the Italian peninsula that might have been key in starting its relative decline compared with the emerging northern European countries.","[Alfani, Guido] Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr, Milan, Italy; [Alfani, Guido] Bocconi Univ, IGIER Res Ctr, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Alfani, G (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr, Milan, Italy.",guido.alfani@unibocconi.it,"Alfani, Guido/AAF-6090-2020","ALFANI, GUIDO/0000-0001-5534-8694",,,,,80,101,106,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Its prime real estate is part of every major European and US institutional investor's portfolio and London's market has the most developed commercial property derivatives market outside of the US. Yet, no transaction-based index exists for the London office market. The aim of this study is to fill that gap. Using a comprehensive dataset of transactions from Estates Gazette interactive and Real Capital Analytics, this paper analyzes different repeat-sales estimation strategies and noise filters to produce a quarterly index series from the first quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, the index series is measured against IPD's London capital valuation series and the MIT Center for Real Estate New York office market repeat sales index series. Results show that the market turn of the first financial crisis is clearly visible in the transactions-based indices, and that this index leads the capital valuation series by about a year. London's office market seems to have been affected by the crisis considerably earlier than New York's market and correlations between the two markets are low.","[Chegut, Andrea M.; Eichholtz, Piet M.

In order to fill this gap, this article presents a composite indicator measuring the extent of economic integration within the European Union - the EU Index. Existing composite indicators concerned with economic integration (globalization indices) were not designed to capture the specific European dimensions. The EU Index offers a unique basis, as now the national differences can be illustrated by one statistical measure. Large heterogeneities are found between the Member States with respect to overall European economic integration and to various sub-indices. By using cluster analysis, it is also shown that the prevailing economic heterogeneities in the EU are combined with a strong and even growing clustering of its members, thereby challenging present and future steps of European integration.","[Koenig, Joerg; Ohr, Renate] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"König, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",joerg.koenig@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,"Konig, Jorg/0000-0003-0890-0778",,,,,38,49,53,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Econometric sustainability tests are performed using the pooled mean-group estimator and panel unit root tests, respectively. Variants of both test procedures with varying coefficients using penalized splines estimation are applied.

Using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data on producer support from 2010, we identify two major characteristics of Russian agricultural and trade policy (a) reliance on sizeable differences between world and domestic prices to generate two-thirds of agricultural producer support and (b) highly distortionary budget support. We then consider whether the disciplines introduced by WTO accession will constrain or even roll back these distortionary policies, thereby substantially changing the nature of agricultural policies in Russia. Using data from OECD-FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) and Russian Ministry of Agriculture projections, we conclude that the structure of OECD-type producer support in 2020 will be very similar to its current state. Market price support will continue to dominate the Producer Support Estimate, and the projected Current Total Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) will approach the WTO Bound Total AMS (the ceiling on production-distorting support) only in 2018. For the reasons above, we conclude that although WTO accession provides opportunities for important changes in Russian sanitary, phytosanitary, food safety, trade, and tariff policies, membership is not a guarantee of systemic change. In fact, a serious look at Russian WTO commitments makes a minimum-change scenario quite possible and even likely.","[Sedik, David] UN, Food & Agr Org, Budapest, Hungary; [Lerman, Zvi] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Uzun, Vasilii] Russian Acad Econ & State Serv, Moscow, Russia",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration,"Sedik, D (通讯作者)，UN, Food & Agr Org, Budapest, Hungary.",david.sedik@fao.org,"Uzun, Vasily/G-8709-2018","Uzun, Vasily/0000-0002-2728-4600",,,,,33,14,15,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

To pinpoint when in the socialization process the difference arises, we compare the competitiveness of children in matrilineal and patriarchal societies. We find that while there is no difference at any age in the matrilineal society, girls become less competitive around puberty in the patriarchal society.","[Andersen, Steffen] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ertac, Seda] Koc Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gneezy, Uri] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [List, John A.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Copenhagen Business School; Koc University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Chicago,"Andersen, S (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark.",,"Andersen, Steffen/B-1646-2014","List, John/0000-0002-1740-3848; Ertac, Seda/0000-0002-5077-5555",,,,,30,160,177,4,69,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In an experiment, we offered commercial savings products to the microfinance borrowers of Guatemala''s largest public-sector bank. We find that giving these borrowers the opportunity to develop a savings plan and be reminded of saving at the time of loan repayment caused no increase in the opening of savings accounts but led to balances among savers that were two and a half times those in the control. A second treatment arm that proposed a default savings contribution of 10% of the loan payment caused the fraction of clients using linked savings accounts to double, as well as elevated deposits among savers, leading to final savings balances that were more than five times the control. The savings treatments also generate faster pay down of debt and weakly better overall repayment performance, suggesting that simultaneous saving and borrowing can be complementary activities. A theoretical model shows that the simultaneous provision of debt and self-commitment savings products can also help a larger fraction of the population to eventually escape a debt-financed equilibrium.","[de Janvry, Alain; Sadoulet, Elisabeth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [McIntosh, Craig] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California San Diego,,,,,,,,,36,14,22,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

However, this result does not imply that scheduling changes do not affect competitive balance or have no benefits.

This discrepancy causes a crisis of what we call the Rio model of politics'. We approach the problem from the perspective of the concept of societal nature relations' (gesellschaftliche naturverhaltnisse), which can be situated in the framework of political ecology and, in this article, is combined with insights from regulation theory and critical state theory. The empirical analysis identifies fossilist patterns of production and consumption as the heart of the problem. These patterns are deeply rooted in everyday and institutional practices as well as societal orientations in the global North and imply a disproportionate claim on global resources, sinks and labour power. They thus form the basis of what we call the imperial mode of living' of the global North. With the rapid industrialisation of countries such as India and China, fossilist patterns of production and consumption are generalised. As a consequence, the ability of developed capitalism to fix its environmental contradictions through the externalisation of its socio-ecological costs is put into question. Geopolitical and economic tensions increase and result in a crisis of international environmental governance. Strategies like green economy' have to be understood as attempts to make the ecological contradictions of capitalism processable once again.","[Brand, Ulrich; Wissen, Markus] Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Brand, Ulrich; Wissen, Markus] Univ Vienna, Inst Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna; University of Vienna,"Brand, U (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria.",,"Brand, Ulrich/AAW-8593-2020","Brand, Ulrich/0000-0002-5760-4652",,,,,90,72,75,1,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Recent theoretical research concerning asymmetric auctions has determined some properties these bid functions must satisfy when certain conditions are met. Plotting the relative expected pay-offs of bidders is a quick, informative way to decide whether the approximate solutions are consistent with theory. We approximate the (inverse-)bid functions by polynomials and employ theoretical results in two ways: to help solve for the polynomial coefficients and to evaluate qualitatively the appropriateness of a given approximation. We simulate auctions from the approximated solutions and find that, for the examples considered, low-degree polynomial approximations perform poorly and can lead to incorrect policy recommendations concerning auction design, suggesting researchers need to take care to obtain quality solutions.","[Hubbard, Timothy P.] Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Kirkegaard, Rene] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Paarsch, Harry J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Colby College; University of Guelph; University of Melbourne,"Hubbard, TP (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Dept Econ, 5242 Mayflower Hill, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",timothy.hubbard@colby.edu; rkirkega@uoguelph.ca; hjpaarsch@gmail.com,,"Hubbard, Timothy/0000-0002-9290-0246",Canada Research Chairs programme; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Canada Research Chairs programme(Canada Research Chairs); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors are grateful to Patrick L.

Roll-call votes in the fifth and sixth European Parliaments (1999-2009) in the field of irregular migration and asylum were analyzed, and it was found that an abrupt change in voting behaviour of many MEPs, particularly those members belonging to two of its main liberal-leaning parties, the S&D and ELDR, is evidently linked to the change of authority of the EP. Apparently, there is an inverse correlation between the level of decision-making authority and the freedom to vote for a liberal immigration and asylum policy.

However, another aspect has not been paid much attention to so far. Multinational companies could have reduced employment as a reaction to the global recession not in their home country, but mostly in their foreign affiliates. The possibility of multinational companies to choose in which countries they change employment as a reaction on a changed economic situation would have enhanced German economic policy measures. Using the microdatabase direct investment provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank, we analyze the employment changes within German multinational companies during the global recession 2008/9.We find evidence that employment adjustments took place mainly in the foreign affiliates stabilizing employment in Germany.","[Peters, Heiko] Deutsch Bank AG, DB Res, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Weigert, Benjamin] German Council Econ Experts, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Peters, H (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bank AG, DB Res, Taunusanlage 12, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",Heiko.Peters@db.com; Benjamin.Weigert@destatis.de,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,8,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Thus, European neighbourhood countries would seem to be less likely cases of EU-induced policy change. Yet, rather than inertia or resistance, we find that European neighbourhood countries comply with some but not with other EU policies. Our essay investigates such policy-specific variation in the compliance patterns of Georgia and Armenia that give rise to differential policy change.

The most important concerns during the design of the congestion charging scheme were the traffic reduction in bottlenecks, the increase in public transport ridership, the decrease of vehicle kilometres in the city centre, and potential traffic effects on circumferential roads. Comparisons of forecasts and actual outcomes show that the transport model predicted all of these factors well enough to allow planners to draw correct conclusions regarding the design and preparations for the scheme. The one major shortcoming was that the static assignment network model was unable to predict the substantial reductions of queuing times. We conclude that the transport model worked well enough to be useful as decision support, performing considerably better than unaided experts' judgments, but that results must be interpreted taking the model's limitations into account. The positive experiences from the Stockholm congestion charges hence seem to be transferable to other cities in the sense that if a charging system is forecast to have beneficial effects on congestion, then this is most likely true.

But from 1979 through 2004, productivity stagnated with an average annual growth rate of only 0.19%. The hypothesis is that from 1965 through 1979, productivity increased rapidly because of concomitant growth in the utilized capital and energy per worker and the improvements in technology. After 1979, the productivity growth came to a standstill because of a slowdown in investment and stagnation in the utilized capital and energy per worker due to the sharply rising energy prices. The tool chosen to test this hypothesis is an aggregate Cobb-Douglas production function characterized by technical change embodied in the gross investment in new machinery and equipment. The estimation of this model shows energy as a cornerstone of productivity growth independent of capital and new technology.","[Anette Dieck-Assad, Flory; Peralta, Ernesto] Inst Tecnol & Estudios Super Monterrey, Monterrey 64849, Nuevo Leon, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Dieck-Assad, FA (通讯作者)，Inst Tecnol & Estudios Super Monterrey, Ave Eugenio Garza Sada 2501 Sur, Monterrey 64849, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.",fdieck@itesm.mx; peralta@itesm.mx,,,,,,,67,7,8,1,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

However, we still lack analyses on the nature and extent of different state responses to and involvement in new private transnational governance arrangements in particular sectors and in different jurisdictions. This article advances our understanding of the interactions between nation-state and private transnational modes of governance by analysing the role of national government authorities in Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) fisheries certification in Atlantic Canada, known more for the disastrous collapse of Northern cod stocks than good marine stewardship. Focusing on the 2008 certification of Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) fisheries off the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the analysis finds that the implementation and maintenance of MSC certification in this case depended on significant support from government authorities. The delicate legitimacy of both authorities faces a period of uncertainty in this case since some certified shrimp stocks appear to be in decline and perhaps also migrating northward off Newfoundland and Labrador.","Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Sociol, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland,"Foley, P (通讯作者)，Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Sociol, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",pfoley@mun.ca,,,,,,,85,43,48,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The threat effect estimated by Geerdsen is surprisingly large enough so to be comparable with the effect of benefits exhaustion found in studies of finite-duration UI systems. This article re-examines Geerdsen's analysis. Using better data than were available for his study, we cannot confirm his findings. When we use the same sample period as Geerdsen, we find no significant evidence of a threat effect. Using more recent data, some of our estimates of the threat effect are significant, but these estimates are generally smaller than that found by Geerdsen. To explain the difference between our results and Geerdsen's, we show that his estimate of the threat effect is seriously upward biased because of the shortcomings of his data and because of an important error in his code.","[Graversen, Brian Krogh] Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Larsen, Brian] Danish Minist Hlth, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Graversen, BK (通讯作者)，Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Herluf Trolles Gade 11, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",brg@sfi.dk,,"Graversen, Brian Krogh/0009-0002-3202-1765",,,,,23,6,6,0,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

During the morning peak hour, the commuters would choose one of the available transportation modes to travel through the corridors from rural/suburban living Areas to urban working areas. This paper introduces a concept of transportation serviceability to evaluate a transportation mode's service status in a specific link, route, road, or network during a certain period. The serviceability can be measured by the possibility that travelers choose a specific type of transportation service at a certain travel cost. The commuters' modal-choice possibilities are calculated using a stochastic equilibrium model based on general travel cost. The modeling results illustrate how transportation serviceability is influenced by background traffic flow in a corridor, value of comfort for railway mode, and parking fee distribution.

If partial voting is allowed, and if a first preference is to be given n or n - 1 points regardless of how many preferences the voter casts, he/she will be incentivised to rank only one option/candidate. If everyone acts in this way, the bc metamorphoses into a plurality vote... which de Borda criticized at length.

One model that has gained much attention is the so-called self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) model. It has been found very effective for modeling and forecasting nonlinear time series in a wide range of application fields. Furthermore, SETAR model is able to capture nonlinear characteristics as limit cycles, jump resonance, and time irreversibility. In this work the attention is focused on a multivariate SETAR (MSETAR) model where each linear regime follows a vector autoregressive (VAR) process and the thresholds are multivariate. We propose a methodology based on genetic algorithms (GAs) for building MSETAR models. The GA is designed to estimate the structural parameters, i.e. to determine the appropriate number of regimes and find multivariate threshold parameters. The behavior of the proposed methodology has been observed on a simulation experiment involving three artificial data sets.","[Baragona, Roberto] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Commun & Social Res, I-00198 Rome, Italy; [Cucina, Domenico] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat Sci, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome,"Baragona, R (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Commun & Social Res, Via Salaria 113, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",roberto.baragona@uniroma1.it; domenico.cucina@uniroma1.it,"Baragona, Roberto/ABB-9338-2020",,,,,,39,1,1,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The study results show that to perfect the whole nation system should grasp the following four principles: balance an appropriate degree between competitive sports scores and foundational reform system; balance the relationship between national needs and individual needs; balance an independent space and mutual penetration between national macro-control, market economic forces and social self-organizing forces; balance the relationship between advantageous and weak events, between Olympic and non-Olympic events, and accordingly propose the whole nation system in China's future development strategy. The whole nation system originated from the former Soviet Union, later introduced to our country, and has become competitive sports management system with Chinese characteristics. Its main features are: government performs virtually all management powers engaged in the overall management; the country bears most of the economic obligations, dominated by planning mechanisms; administrative method is the primary management means. Thus it is typical government managed system. New China since its establishment, whole nation systems consistent with China's contemporary political and economic system play high efficiency. While after China's reform and opening up, with the transition from a planned economy to a market economy, it increasingly shows the unsuitability for the national economic system, especially curbs the enthusiasm of social participation in sports, because it is too high to strengthen the powers of the government, thus hindering the development of sports. Drawing on the advanced experience from the world powerful nation in competitive sports combined with Chinese facts, China's whole nation system has many drawbacks, but whole nation system has its necessity. At present, our country's competitive sports development mode reform should focus on how to perfect and innovate the whole nation system.","[Guo Kelei] Xianyang Normal Coll, Dept Phys Educ, Xianyang 712000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xianyang Normal University,,,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,8,"INFORMATION ENGINEERING RESEARCH INST, USA",NEWARK,"100 CONTINENTAL DR, NEWARK, DE 19713 USA",,,978-1-61275-049-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,255.0,260,,,,,,6,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BGC89,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322346400050,0

Importance of agriculture is not only in its primary role to ensure food for population, but as well in preservation of rural space, ecological balance and keeping of traditional values. Apart from producing crops and livestock products for human consumption, agriculture participates in development of other industries whose products are needed in performance of agricultural activity, such as machinery industry and agricultural equipment, industry of mineral fertilizers, industry of reproductive material, construction industry and others. By using information's from Central Bureau of Statistics about rural population, indicators of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, the role of agriculture in economy of Middle and Eastern Croatia has been analyzed. In the analysis Croatian Republic has been classified in three NUTS2 regions (Northwestern Croatia, Middle and Eastern (Pannonia) Croatia, and Adriatic Croatia). The share of agricultural production (in which hunting, forestry and fisheries are included) in Gross Value Added of Middle and Eastern Croatia is registering constant growth from 7,768 mill. of kunas in 2005 on 10,484 mill. in 2008 - increase of 25.91%, while in year 2009 decrease of 2,833 mill. kunas or 37.03% has been recorded. According to information's of Central Bureau of Statistics number of employed in Middle and Eastern Croatia in period from 2008 till 2011 fell for 28.413 employees, while number of employees in agriculture, forestry and fisheries in same period fell for 1.030 employees. The share of employed in agriculture, fisheries and forestry in overall rate of employed grows and in 2008 amounts 5.64%.

There are several known similarity measures, mostly developed in fields such as the bibliometric and scientometric research, which are based on co-occurrences between objects, and satisfy certain properties which unfortunately don't suit to our problem. Taking inspiration from these measures, we propose a class of similarity measures for response patterns on dichotomously scored items. This study is meant as an example of applying these measures within the item response theory framework, and as a critical assessment of the usefulness of this approach. Our method focuses on the position of respondents in the multidimensional space spanned by the aggregated subject-subject co-occurrences.

Some, called cleaner vehicle strategies in this article, reduce emission rates per vehicle-kilometer. Others, called mobility management (also called transportation demand management) strategies, reduce total vehicle travel. There is disagreement concerning which approach is best overall. Some studies conclude that cleaner vehicle strategies are generally most cost effective and beneficial, while others favor mobility management strategies. These different conclusions tend to reflect different analysis scope. Analyses that favor clean vehicle strategies tend to overlook or undervalue some significant impacts including cleaner vehicle rebound effects and mobility management co-benefits.

The first one is used for estimating the trend, whereas the second one is used for comparison and evaluation, too. In the basic framework, we may use either homogeneous MC or non-homogeneous one. When building model we are focused both on various state space discretizations and corresponding construction of transition probability matrices.

One common way of interpreting these data is to see a positive association between job satisfaction and job quality. Another view is to dismiss the usefulness of job satisfaction data, because workers can often express satisfaction with work where job quality is poor. It is argued that this second view has some validity, but that survey data on job satisfaction and subjective well-being at work are informative if interpreted carefully. If researchers are to come to sensible conclusions about the meaning behind job satisfaction data, information about why workers report job satisfaction is needed. It is in the understanding of why workers report feeling satisfied (or dissatisfied) with their jobs that sociology can make a positive contribution.","[Charlwood, Andy] Univ York, York Management Sch, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England; [Brown, Andrew; Spencer, David A.] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of Leeds,"Charlwood, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Management Sch, Freboys Lane, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England.",andy.charlwood@york.ac.uk,"Charlwood, Andy/ABD-5859-2020; Charlwood, Andy/B-1324-2013","Charlwood, Andy/0000-0002-5444-194X;",,,,,41,83,103,1,91,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Families that regularly eat their main meal together four or more times a week are more likely to have children who do better in school, are of average weight, less likely to use drugs and alcohol at an early age, and consume more fruits and vegetables. The mere fact that families eat together does not address the process by which shared family mealtimes may protect children from unhealthy weight gain. Just as there is no simple explanation for the rising rates of obesity, the link between shared family mealtimes and childhood obesity is a complex one including socioeconomic and cultural context. In this paper, we provide an overview of how shared family mealtimes are embedded in a socio-cultural context that may either support or derail healthy eating patterns for children and youth. Evidence from an observational study of 200 family mealtimes demonstrates the complex interplay between socio-economic factors, family mealtime behaviors, and child obesity status. Families who had a child of healthy weight spent more time engaged with each other during the meal, expressed more positive communication, and considered mealtimes more important and meaningful than families who had a child who was overweight or obese. Using a cumulative risk model, it was found that the combination of family level and neighborhood risk factors predicted child overweight status. Recommendations are made for future research directions and policies directed toward families living in diverse economic circumstances. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To test for moral hazard, the authors use a 2005 rule change that moved the red flag from 1 km to 3 km from the finish. Data from Europe's Grand Tours indicate that, after the rule change, both the incidence and the size of crashes nearly doubled in the 1-3 km from the finish zone.

After experiencing a peak 20% mode share in 1980, the current share of carpooling for work trips is about 10% and the majority of these carpooling trips are made by intra-household members. Casting the choice between SOV and carpool as a social dilemma in which SOV is a noncooperative choice and carpool is a cooperative one, we propose to test two hypotheses. First, the switch from SOV to carpool and the reverse choice are attributed to different factors-structural factors, or those factors altering the objective features of a decision scenario such as travel time and travel cost, play a dominant role in the switch from carpool to SOV while psychosocial factors (attitudes and beliefs) play a critical role in the switch from SOV to carpool. Second, the two choices are underlay by different behavioral mechanisms. In particular, we expect self-justification by carpool-to-SOV switchers-after they switch from carpool to SOV, they adjusted their attitudes toward carpool accordingly to match their behavior. The analysis of the first three waves of the Puget Sound Transportation Panel supports these two hypotheses. Our study results recommend developing programs and policies that aim at influencing people's subjective assessments of carpooling, in addition to the existing ones that mostly focus on incentivizing carpooling, and differentiating between programs seeking to encourage SOV users to switch to carpool and those aiming to maintain existing carpoolers.

I use a neoclassical growth model to determine how much of these asset price movements can be accounted for by the observed changes in output growth and land-related taxation. In the model, corporations issue land-collateralized debt to reduce their tax liabilities, and the government follows a land-taxation policy that is countercyclical to land prices. Without these features, the model cannot generate any significant change in land values, even with a permanent increase in the growth rate of the economy, because a permanent increase in the growth rate results in a comparable increase at the rate at which agents discount future returns. The collateral use of land and countercyclical land-tax policy introduce a substantial magnification mechanism for asset prices by reducing the required return on land. I calibrate the model to Japanese data, and conduct steady-state experiments and deterministic simulations. I show that if the observed increase in the growth rate of productivity and the decline in land taxes were expected to be permanent by market participants, then the model can by and large account for the movements in land and stock prices, but has counterfactual predictions regarding the behavior of capital.

The model utilizes a dynamic activity planning framework within the larger overall microsimulation system, which is a computational process model that attempts to replicate the decisions which comprise time-dependent activity scheduling. The model presents a step forward in which the usual concepts of activity generation and activity scheduling are significantly enhanced by adding an additional component referred to as activity planning in which the various attributes which describe the activity are determined. The model framework, therefore, separates activity planning from activity generation and treats all three components, generation, planning and scheduling, as separate discrete but dynamic events within the overall microsimulation. The development of the planning order model, which determines when and in what order each activity planning decision is made is the specific focus of this paper. The models comprising the planning order framework are developed using recent survey data from a GPS-based prompted recall survey. The model development, estimation, validation, and its use within the overall ADAPTS system are discussed. A significant finding of the study is the verification of the apparent transferability of the activity planning order model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This article explores the evolution of U.S. monetary policy regimes via the development of a Markov-switching model predicated on narrative and statistical evidence of a monetary policy regime. We identified five regimes for the period spanning 1956:I-2005:IV and they roughly corresponded to the Chairman term of the Federal Reserve, except for the Greenspan era. More importantly, we demonstrate that the conflicting results regarding the response to inflation for the pre-Volcker period in the existing literature is not attributable to the different data but due to different samples, and also provided an insight regarding the Great Inflation-namely, that the near non-response to inflation in the early 1960s appears to have constituted the initial seed of the Great Inflation. We also find via analysis of the Markov-switching model for the U.S. real interest rate, that the regime changes in the real interest rate follow the regime changes in monetary policy within 2 years and that the evolution of real interest rate regimes provides a good explanation for the conflicting results regarding the dynamics of real interest rate.","[Kim, Chang-Jin; Kim, Dong Heon] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Bae, Jinho] Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 143701, South Korea; [Kim, Chang-Jin] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Korea University; Konkuk University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kim, DH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",jinhbk@konkuk.ac.kr; cjkim@korea.ac.kr; cjkim@korea.ac.kr,"Bae, Jinho/D-9441-2011","bae, jinho/0000-0001-5040-3770",,,,,43,13,13,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The market values an additional dollar of cash at a premium and, as theory predicts, unused credit lines are significantly less valued than cash. Evidence suggests an increase in the market value of liquidity during the recent financial crisis. We also find that financial characteristics quantifying financial constraint influence the value of REIT financial flexibility. Most notably, the value of cash decreases with remaining credit line capacity.

This uncertainty impacts a team's attendance and financial operation. While leagues cultivate uncertainty through various rules such as salary caps, revenue sharing, and the amateur draft, individual franchises have to manage the result of variability in annual revenues. Not only is this due to the parity in a league but also from injuries and changes in player quality that are unexpected. Whether uncertainty or winning or the perfect combination of the two, some aspects that affect revenues can be controlled by team management more so than others. Even though on-the-field success is not easily controlled by team management, the overall quality of the experience can be impacted from, among other things, a quality stadium with comfortable seating and delectable food. This research shows that the variability in annual team revenues decreases (relative to total revenues) once a team moves into a new stadium, all else equal. The increase in predictability lowers financial risk, impacting the cost of financing and other practical operational issues like game-day staffing.","[Rascher, Daniel A.] Univ San Francisco, Sport Management Program, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA; [Brown, Matthew T.; Nagel, Mark S.] Univ S Carolina, Dept Sport & Entertainment Management, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [McEvoy, Chad D.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Sport Management, David B Falk Coll Sport & Human Dynam, Syracuse, NY USA",University of San Francisco; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Syracuse University,"Rascher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ San Francisco, Sport Management Program, 241A Kalmanovitz Hall,2130 Fulton St, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA.",rascher@usfca.edu,,"Rascher, Daniel/0000-0002-5297-9519",,,,,25,6,7,1,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The data cover a broad range of import requirements for agricultural and food products for the EU and nine of its major trade partners. We find that trade is significantly reduced when importing countries have stricter maximum residue limits (MRLs) for plant products than exporting countries. For most other measures, due to their qualitative nature, we were unable to infer whether the importer has stricter standards relative to the exporter, and we do not find a robust relationship between these measures and trade. Our findings suggest that, at least for some import standards, harmonising regulations will increase trade.

By assuming instantaneous adjustment of all inputs, a static model may underestimate technical efficiency of a production unit in the short-run. However, in this article I show that under the assumption of similar adjustment speed for all inputs, a linear partial adjustment scheme for output characterizes the dynamic production frontier. The dynamic frontier with time-invariant technical efficiency is estimated using the system GMM (generalized method of moments) estimator. Applying the model and estimation method on a panel data set spanning 9 years of data on private manufacturing establishments in Egypt, I find that (1) the speed of adjustment of output is significantly lower than unity, (2) the static model underestimates technical efficiency by 4.5 percentage points on average, and (3) the ranking of production units based on their technical efficiency measures changes when the lagged adjustment process of inputs is taken into account.","Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA",Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University,"Bhattacharyya, A (通讯作者)，Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA.",aditibhattacharyya@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,4,4,2,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Monte Carlo evidence indicates that these models estimate well the impacts of covariates on expected counts when the data follow a Poisson distribution. With data from more complex processes, these estimators continue to perform well. Since most economic count outcomes arise from occurrence-dependent behavioral processes, using flexibly estimated distributions should reduce the dependence of results on convenient but invalid assumptions.

In cross-national perspective, research on youth employment has thus far paid attention to the transition from school to work, but underemphasized the importance of the social psychology of labour market entrance. In this article, European young adults' perceptions of the first-job opportunities in their country are analysed. The result of a multilevel regression analysis on the 2008 wave of the European Social Survey (ESS) shows that differences across countries can mainly be explained by the public's perceptions of levels of unemployment, and public spending on education. At the individual level, youth in a precarious socioeconomic situation have a rather pessimistic view on these opportunities. Moreover, women perceive the opportunities as less positive than men while young people of foreign origin have, contrary to the expectations, a more positive outlook on the chances for young people.","[Reeskens, Tim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Sociol Res, Res Fdn Flanders FWO, Louvain, Belgium; [van Oorschot, Wim] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands",KU Leuven; Tilburg University,"Reeskens, T (通讯作者)，POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",Tim.Reeskens@soc.kuleuven.be,"Reeskens, Tim/L-1469-2015","Reeskens, Tim/0000-0003-1211-7188",,,,,48,19,19,2,66,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

To identify the factors triggering innovative activities is a main concern for economic theory and empirical analysis. As the number of hypotheses is large, the process of model selection becomes a crucial part of the empirical implementation. The problem is complicated by unobserved heterogeneity and possible endogeneity of regressors. A new efficient solution to this problem is suggested, applying optimization heuristics, which exploits the inherent discrete nature of the model selection problem.

Transport policy research has explored a number of scenarios to better understand the future characteristics of US light-duty vehicles. Deterministic scenario analysis is, however, unable to identify the impact of uncertainty on the future US vehicle fleet emissions and energy use. Variables determining the future fleet emissions and fuel use are inherently uncertain and thus the shortfall in understanding the impact of uncertainty on the future of US transport needs to be addressed. This paper uses a stochastic technology and fleet assessment model to quantify the uncertainties in US vehicle fleet emissions and fuel use for a realistic yet ambitious pathway which results in about a 50% reduction in fleet GHG emissions in 2050. The results show the probability distribution of fleet emissions, fuel use, and energy consumption over time out to 2050. The expected value for the fleet fuel consumption is about 450 and 350 billion litres of gasoline equivalent with standard deviations of 40 and 80 in 2030 and 2050, respectively. The expected value for the fleet GHG emissions is about 1360 and 850 Mt CO2 equivalent with standard deviation of 130 and 230 in 2030 and 2050 respectively. The parameters that are major contributors to variations in emissions and fuel consumption are also identified and ranked through the uncertainty analysis. It is further shown that these major contributors change over time, and include parameters such as: vehicle scrappage rate, annual growth of vehicle kilometres travelled in the near term, total vehicle sales, fuel economy of the dominant naturally-aspirated spark ignition vehicles, and percentage of gasoline displaced by cellulosic ethanol. The findings in this paper demonstrate the importance of taking uncertainties into consideration when choosing amongst alternative fuel and emissions reduction pathways, in the light of their possible consequences.

It covers several aspects of the market, although those specifically connected with supply and demand were the primary focus. The issue of price formation mechanism is unique in the fish and seafood production sector as fishing companies, unlike many other industrial sectors, cannot plan production. Fishing boats head out to sea without any certainty that the market will absorb the entire catch and that the price obtained will be profitable. This implies that, in practice, variable costs are not easily adjustable as they are paid in advance. In more general terms, this leads to a degree of asymmetry in the management of fishing companies. The daily price series and associated volumes for the year 2009 were analyzed for anchovies (Engraulis Encrasicolus) and pilchards (Sardine Pilchardas) in the main Adriatic fishing areas. The analysis shows that a uniform approach to managing the average price uniform pelagic fish for the entire Adriatic Sea would not be effective, as this would negatively impact local niche markets. Specifically, the average annual prices for anchovies (Engraulis Encrasicolus) vary greatly at the different markets and there is little competition within the various fish and seafood markets.

This approach can be computationally burdensome and may not be viable for identifying the most critical links in large-scale networks. In this study, an impact area vulnerability analysis approach is proposed to evaluate the consequences of a link closure within its impact area instead of the whole network. The proposed approach can significantly reduce the search space for determining the most critical links in large-scale networks. In addition, a new vulnerability index is introduced to examine properly the consequences of a link closure. The effects of demand uncertainty and heterogeneous travellers' risk-taking behaviour are explicitly considered. Numerical results for two different road networks show that in practice the proposed approach is more efficient than traditional full scan approach for identifying the same set of critical links. Numerical results also demonstrate that both stochastic demand and travellers' risk-taking behaviour have significant impacts on network vulnerability analysis, especially under high network congestion and large demand variations.

One of their main characteristics in comparison with most types of revealed preference (RP) surveys is the ability to capture behaviour by the same respondent under varying choice scenarios. While this ability to capture multiple choices is generally seen as an advantage, there is a certain amount of unease about survey length. The precise definition about what constitutes a large number of choice tasks however varies across disciplines, and it is not uncommon to see surveys with up to twenty tasks per respondent in some areas. The argument against this practice has always been one of reducing respondent engagement, which could be interpreted as a result of fatigue or boredom, with frequent reference to the findings of Bradley and Daly (1994) who showed a significant drop in utility scale, i.e. an increase in error, as a respondent moved from one choice experiment to the next, an effect they related to respondent fatigue. While the work by Bradley and Daly has become a standard reference in this context, it should be recognised that not only was the fatigue part of the work based on a single dataset, but the state-of-the-art and the state-of-practice in stated choice survey design and implementation has moved on significantly since their study. In this paper, we review other literature and present a more comprehensive study investigating evidence of respondent fatigue across a larger number of different surveys. Using a comprehensive testing framework employing both Logit and mixed Logit structures, we provide strong evidence that the concerns about fatigue in the literature are possibly overstated, with no clear decreasing trend in scale across choice tasks in any of our studies. For the data sets tested, we find that accommodating any scale heterogeneity has little or no impact on substantive model results, that the role of constants generally decreases as the survey progresses, and that there is evidence of significant attribute level (as opposed to scale) heterogeneity across choice tasks.

Third, markups are heterogeneous across sectors, with services having higher markups on average than manufacturing. Fourth, services sectors generally have higher markups in the euro area than the US, whereas the pattern for manufacturing is the reverse.

Yet, only a limited number of countries report having policies in place aimed at increasing the intake of skilled immigrants. Why? In this paper, we analyse the factors that affect a direct measure of individual attitudes towards skilled migration. We focus on two main channels: the labour market and the welfare state. We find that more educated natives are less likely to favour skilled immigration consistent with the labour market channel while richer people are more likely to do so in accordance with the welfare state channel under the tax adjustment model. Our findings thus suggest that the labour market competition threat perceived by skilled natives in the host countries might be driving the observed cautious policies.","[Facchini, Giovanni] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Mayda, Anna Maria] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC USA; [Facchini, Giovanni] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Georgetown University; University of Milan,"Facchini, G (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,27,67,76,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2012,35.0,2,,,SI,,183.0,196,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01427.x,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,897VL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300687100004,0

The main purpose of this paper is to quantify and describe more comprehensively than in past research how variations in expenditure levels are associated with the nationality of foreign tourists in Norway during the summers of 2007 and 2009. The results show that nationality has both gross and net (unadjusted and ceteris paribus) effects on expenditures, and that this variable solely accounts for over 35% of the overall explained variance in tourism expenditures.

It is important to find correlation between the rated capacities of wind and solar PV equipment. Besides, sizing storage equipment is important, as it is expensive.

The major and so far unresolved difficulty is the former necessity. This article presents the optimal aggregation rule that simultaneously satisfies these two interdependent necessary requirements. In our setting, some record of the voters' past decisions is available, but the correct decisions are not known. We observe that any arbitrary evaluation of the decision-makers' capabilities as probabilities yields some optimal aggregation rule that, in turn, yields a maximum-likelihood estimation of decisional skills. Thus, a skill-evaluation equilibrium can be defined as an evaluation of decisional skills that yields itself as a maximum-likelihood estimation of decisional skills. We show that such equilibrium exists and offer a procedure for finding one. The obtained equilibrium is locally optimal and is shown empirically to generally be globally optimal in terms of the correctness of the resulting collective decisions. Interestingly, under minimally competent (almost symmetric) skill distributions that allow unskilled decision makers, the optimal rule considerably outperforms the common simple majority rule (SMR). Furthermore, a sufficient record of past decisions ensures that the collective probability of making a correct decision converges to 1, as opposed to accuracy of about 0.7 under SMR. Our proposed optimal voting procedure relaxes the fundamental (and sometimes unrealistic) assumptions in Condorcet's celebrated theorem and its extensions, such as sufficiently high decision-making quality, skill homogeneity or existence of a sufficiently large group of decision makers.","[Baharad, Eyal; Nitzan, Shmuel] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Goldberger, Jacob] Bar Ilan Univ, Sch Engn, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Koppel, Moshe] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University; Bar Ilan University; Bar Ilan University,"Baharad, E (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",baharad@mail.biu.ac.il; goldbej@eng.biu.ac.il; koppel@cs.biu.ac.il; nitzans@mail.biu.ac.il,,,,,,,31,12,14,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2012,72.0,1,,,,,113.0,130,,10.1007/s11238-010-9240-5,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,852LA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297358200007,0

However, current statistics imply only a small proportion of villages in the country enjoyed ICT facilities through eCommunity projects in the form of telecentres funded by the government and private sectors. This can result in the lack of participation from members of the community towards initiatives for eCommunity development, which impedes the efforts to bridge the digital divide among the rural communities. Institutions of higher learning have a role to play in addressing this predicament. To understand how the roles can be made possible, a case study was conducted in a selected rural village that represents a typical rural community in the northern region of Malaysia. A public university, Universiti Utara Malaysia was involved due to her proximity to the village that facilitates fieldworks in the form of interviews, data collections and observation. A model of IHL Collaboration in eCommunity development was created to represent the interplay between the roles of the IHLs and the community information needs through the implementation of a community telecentre.

First, the decision maker is uncertain ex ante (i.e., at the time of choosing a menu) about her ex post (i.e., at the time of choosing an option within her chosen menu) preferences over options, and she anticipates that this subjective uncertainty will not resolve before the ex post stage. Second, she is averse to ex post indecisiveness (i.e., to having to choose between options that she cannot rank with certainty). Third, when evaluating a menu she discards options that are dominated (i.e., inferior to another option whatever her ex post preferences may be) and restricts attention to the undominated ones. Under these assumptions, the decision maker has a preference for commitment in the sense of preferring menus with fewer undominated alternatives. We derive a representation in which the decision maker's uncertainty about her ex post preferences is captured by means of a subjective state space, which in turn determines which options are undominated in a given menu, and in which the decision maker fears, whenever indecisive, to choose an option that will turn out to be the worst (undominated) one according to the realization of her ex post preferences.","[Danan, Eric; Guerdjikova, Ani] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, F-95000 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Zimper, Alexander] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",CY Cergy Paris Universite; University of Witwatersrand,"Danan, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, 33 Blvd Port, F-95000 Cergy Pontoise, France.",eric.danan@u-cergy.fr; ani.guerdjikova@u-cergy.fr; alexander.zimper@wits.ac.za,"Zimper, Alexander/KBQ-4867-2024","Zimper, Alexander/0000-0002-3730-3086; Danan, Eric/0000-0002-0287-1091",,,,,19,7,8,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2012,72.0,1,,,,,1.0,13,,10.1007/s11238-011-9254-7,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,852LA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297358200001,0

Although we examine the bubbles presence over various time periods we found almost no evidence of speculative bubbles across the markets.","[Deev, Oleg; Kajurova, Veronika] Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Stavarek, Daniel] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance, Opava, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Silesian University Opava,"Deev, O (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",oleg@econ.muni.cz; vkajurova@seznam.cz; stavarek@opf.slu.cz,"Stavárek, Daniel/A-7134-2010; Deev, Oleg/G-8486-2013; Kajurova, Veronika/O-4739-2014","Stavárek, Daniel/0000-0001-5061-1721; Kajurova, Veronika/0000-0002-6518-1944","Czech Science Foundation [GAR 403/11/2073]; Procyclicality of financial markets, asset price bubbles and macroprudential regulation","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Procyclicality of financial markets, asset price bubbles and macroprudential regulation","Support of the Czech Science Foundation within the project GAR 403/11/2073 Procyclicality of financial markets, asset price bubbles and macroprudential regulation is gratefully acknowledged.",,16,0,0,0,5,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,107.0,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900019,0

This paper analyzes the effect of fast-food availability on the level of fast-food consumption and obesity risk among both white and non-white residents of central Texas. Potential endogeneity of fast-food availability is addressed through instrumental variables regression using distance to the nearest major highway as an instrument. We find that non-whites tend to exhibit higher obesity rates, greater access to fast-food establishments and higher consumption of fast-food meals compared to their white counterparts. In addition, we found that whites and non-whites respond differently to the availability of fast-food in rural environments. Greater availability is not associated with either greater consumption of fast-food meals or a higher obesity risk among the sample of whites. In contrast, greater availability of fast-food is positively associated with both the number of meals consumed for non-white rural residents and their obesity. While our results are robust to specification, the effect of availability on weight outcomes is notably weaker when indirectly calculated from the implied relationship between consumption and caloric intake. This highlights the importance of directly examining the proposed mechanism through which an environmental factor influences weight outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Scholars know plenty about why companies might accept private regulators to oversee and protect labour standards. But they know very little about why companies choose one rather than another private regulatory approach when several are available, differing in terms of stringency. This paper explores the conditions under which companies in the clothing industry choose private labour-standards regulation with more rather than less stringent regulation. It does so based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of clothing companies in Europe. It argues that business preference for more stringent private labour regulation is positively affected by societal pressure, and that this societal pressure is predominantly orchestrated by activist groups. This not only entails campaigns, but also can be a combination of public and informal efforts to influence companies, together with pressures from consumers and media. This research also shows that national and industrial factors play a role. In particular, the position of the firm in the value chain and its distance to consumers and manufacturers affect preference for more or less stringent private regulation. Societal pressure is therefore important but not the only source of business preferences for private regulation.","[Fransen, Luc; Burgoon, Brian] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Burgoon, Brian] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Fransen, L (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,"Fransen, Luc/0000-0002-9846-8386; Burgoon, Brian/0000-0002-7300-0541",,,,,47,41,43,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Entrepreneurial clusters comprising economic operators within the same field of activity or several comparative activities have the need to adjust to a global market. Therefore they design and set up an organisational structure that provides them with possibilities for development, market and marketing activities in one region (district) or in several closely related regions. This concept provides fast development of economic operators by applying modern working methods, and under modern management they draw the maximum from the market environment, whereas economy of a region or a district gains competitive advantages in relation to others. Causes of competitiveness such as cost reduction, added value and new market opportunities can encourage innovation in order to raise the quality and expertise of economic operators. Cluster-based economic development is a model of development of economic operators, particularly the small and medium sized ones, as they initiate development at both the local and regional level through networking. Clusters are drivers of growth and innovation and they ensure competitiveness on a global market. Results show that this development model has provided opportunities for significant success of regions and countries, and it has resulted from synergy of knowledge and technical and technological capacities of associated economic operators. These prerequisites make it possible for operators in the tourism sector to increase their participation in common markets by working together. Therefore this paper will focus on analysis of thematic clusters referring to market segmentation. In the field of tourism this may include cultural heritage, some special interests, health tourism, wine tourism, etc. Such a model initiates development of a tourist destination in a flexible way, thus stimulating economic development at both the local and regional level.","[Horvat, Duro] Agrokor Vina Doo, Zagreb 10090, Croatia",,,horvat@edukator.hr,,,,,,,10,1,1,1,14,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,230.0,239,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600026,0

Regression results for pooled sample (2000-2010) indicate positive and highly statistically significant associations between IC and selected corporate performance measures in the study such as productivity, profitability and investor expectation on the firm. However, estimates for individual years provide contrasting findings (except for the relationship between IC and profitability on equity) compared to evidence for pooled sample. This study is the pioneering example to explore the IC performance of the selected context and also provides evidence using longitudinal data which has been cited as a probable research area in many retrospective IC performance research.

In this paper we will consider specific cases of negotiation which will initiate modern changes and development of the insurance network through proving information and responses to the challenges in the real world and it that way being a guideline towards the ways of attracting clients (the insured people). A special challenge in insurance is the occurrence of complex dependent relations. The challenge is special because in insurance the product that is for sale has no physical existence and is not visible. It is in fact an insurance service whose benefits can be felt after a certain period if a damaging event occurs. This characteristic of insurance gives an opportunity to both parties in the negotiation to fulfill their goals, which would mean common creation of new insurance services and products that are a result of specific market needs, giving discounts, creating package services etc. People tend to regard the economic exchanges as a win-lose situation. However, these exchanges can also be structured as a win-win, in which case there is a possibility both negotiation parties to be winners.

This article deals with constructing a track occupancy plan in the railway station using modern computational methods for its automatic creation based on the entered input data (the daily timetable and the structural and operational constraints). The linear mathematical model is introduced, the meaningful optimization criterion is designed and the constraints are formulated. The problem of allocation of trains to platforms is formulated as a single criteria optimization problem.

The main objective of the study is the area of retail foodstuff in the Czech Republic and the price elasticity of demand. The fact that the economic recession impacted consumers' purchasing power has consequences in the retail foodstuff, as decreasing food consumption and the structural changes in household consumption. Czech consumers are highly cost-oriented, so the preference of cheaper and lower quality products is increasing. Sensitivity of the changes in the groceries purchasing quantity in dependence on their prices is reflected in demand price elasticity (further only DPE). Despite the fact that the food-processing industry is generally considered to be a cyclically neutral, which means that the stadium of business cycle does not affect the demand for products of the industry, it is possible to prove considerable differences in DPE of various commodities in relation to business cycle development The aim of the study is to prove the impact of economic development on the DPE by means of a case study on real data.

The empirical model is estimated by using the econometric method of panel regression. Because of the existence of reverse causality, i.e. the existence of simultaneity between the dependent variable and one of the explanatory variables (foreign trade) of the basic model, another equation was added into the model and this simultaneous equations model was then estimated by using the instrumental variables method and the two stage least squares method (the new model). We conclude that foreign trade has a positive impact on the financial integration and that increasing financial integration leads to more intensive foreign trade among these countries. However, world trade (and thus financial integration) can be undermined by limiting trade finance as a result of tightening financial regulation and supervision after a decade of loose regulation and supervision.","[Kucerova, Zuzana] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Policy, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,zuzana.kucerova@vsb.cz,"Kucerova, Zuzana/K-6162-2018","Kucerova, Zuzana/0000-0001-6888-9262",,,,,15,1,1,0,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,512.0,517,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900088,0

On account of these empirical observations, we set up and estimate models with alternative factor adjustment costs, using the Method of Simulated Moments. We show that a model incorporating convex, non convex, and interrelation adjustment processes fits the data best. Moreover, the results indicate that (i) labor and capital adjustment should be analyzed together, (ii) capital and labor's slow adjustment is generated and can be explained by costs associated with changing input demand, and (iii) the firm has an incentive to adjust input factors at the same time period, since adjustment costs decrease when the firm decides to adjust the two factors, namely capital and labor, simultaneously.","Univ Ioannina, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece",University of Ioannina,"Lapatinas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece.",alapatin@cc.uoi.gr,,"Lapatinas, Athanasios/0000-0002-1728-6522",,,,,55,3,3,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

However, ANP have two disadvantages: firstly, it is difficult to provide correct network structure among criteria even for experts, and different structures lead to different results. Secondly, to form a supermatrix all criteria have to be pair-wise compared with regard to all other criteria, which is difficult and also unnatural. To circumvent these problems criteria network structure in ANP can be modeled with fuzzy cognitive maps. The aim of this article is to propose the hybrid eigenvalue-fuzzy cognitive map method (HEFCM) for the derivation of criteria weights. In the first step of HEFCM initial (local) weights of criteria are determined by Saaty's eigenvalue method. In the second step contribution to criteria weights from dependence and feedback is established by fuzzy cognitive map approach.

There are at least two ways of taking a model to data: (i) filtering the historical time series outside the model in order to render them stationary or (ii) solving the model around balanced growth path and using nonstationary time series in estimation. While filtering is ubiquitous, there are number of problems associated with it. In particular, prefiltering time series outside of the model using univariate filters (the usual method) results in loss of information. This paper employs small open economy model with financial accelerator to show how prefiltering using univariate filters influences estimates of model parameters and the output gap. It concludes that for small-scale small open economy DSGE models, other ways of dealing with the filtering problem might be worth considering.","[Motl, Tomas] Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,tommotl@econ.muni.cz,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,611.0,616,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900105,0

The article compares the party websites in early 2010 through an analysis of online audience, web links, content posted by parties and user-generated material linked to the two parties. The research found that the online potential of party communication, despite the universal availability of powerful tools of information distribution and social networking opportunities, was far more closely tied to national political culture than to cyber-culture in general. The Communist Party web activity tended to parallel the party activity offline, failing to craft the appearance of a more modern or inclusive party. At the same time, supporters of the British Liberal Democrats made greater use of external social networking and were apparently more connected with the broader political sphere, although perhaps at the expense of party branding and control. The findings demonstrate the need to understand how national political organisations and attitudes can play a much stronger role than technological potential in shaping the democratising forces of the online sphere.","Univ Maryland, Philip Merrill Coll Journalism, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Oates, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Philip Merrill Coll Journalism, 1100 Knight Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",sarah.oates@gmail.com,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I003509/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I003509/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,3,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,8,,,SI,,1460.0,1485,,10.1080/09668136.2012.712277,0.0,,,26,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,008TA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308978300007,0

Entrepreneurial answer offers a formula for institutional development of university in which university defines and determines its autonomy, ensures diversified financing (and thus decreases its dependence on the state), develops new university departments and activities in accordance with society's demand, and leads to structural changes, which are ensuring better university's capacity in responding to changes. In order for that to be possible, the assumption is that university is unified, but also subsidiary and autonomous, and responsible towards the environment in which it operates. The role of entrepreneurial university is emphasized in the Triple Helix concept of regional development, using current discussion on interconnection and functioning of three forces (actors) in society: university, business sector and government (Blenker et al. 2006; Etzkowitz et. al. 2000; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000). Integrating discussions about the characteristics of entrepreneurial university stated by various authors (especially Clark 1998 and Gibb 2005) with knowledge on functioning of entrepreneurially oriented organizations (e. g. Lumpkin and Dess 1996), a model of entrepreneurial university is developed (Oberman Peterka, 2008). By comparing the model of entrepreneurial university with situation at the J. J. Strossmayer University of Osijek, it is concluded that some elements of this model are now present at the university: some of the periphery institutions, there is diversified financing; interdisciplinarity of teaching is manifested through several university interdisciplinary graduate programs; connections between individual elements of the model exist at the Osijek University, as well as some of the connections with value components of the model (autonomy and responsibility of university), but these are insufficiently developed and aren't contributing in the full sense to the development of the model. The goal of this paper is to see whether J.J.

Since then, countries around the world have been working vigorously to reach these goals. The deadline in achieving MDGs is approaching. Few countries in Asia have been very successful in implementing these goals. This article raises four questions: what progress has been made to achieve the Millennium Development Goal No.1 (MDG1) targets in Bangladesh? What are the reasons for success, if any? What challenges remain? And what more should be done? To examine these questions, the article assesses the progress of Bangladesh based on different indicators of MDG1. This article also uses the Poverty and Hunger Index (PHI) to measure the net static and dynamic progress towards its own goal. It argues that the country is on track to achieve MDG1 targets. Social safety nets (SSNs) programs, per capita GDP growth, structural change, remittance earning have been contributing to achieve MDG1 targets. However, some significant challenges such as a number of poor, inflation, high unemployment rate and inequality are still prevailing. Thus, the country might give more attention on the expansion of SSNs for quick protection and promotion for the poor and vulnerable, the creation of local value chain and the inflation control.","[Pradhan, Mohammad Abdul Hannan; Mohd, Saidatulakmal; Sulaiman, Jamalludin] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Georgetown, Pulau Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,,"Mohd, Saidatulakmal/J-1535-2014; Pradhan, Mohammad Abdul Hannan/I-9313-2014","Mohd, Saidatulakmal/0000-0002-7947-7324;",,,,,19,0,0,0,5,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,829.0,842,,,,,,14,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600073,0

This thesis attempts to establish a new clothing industry concept in accordance with the consumption demand by breaking through the trade division within the product economy mode. Through the growth model analysis, it is pointed out that the development of clothing industry relies on product innovation and design innovation. Based on economic scale, the scope economy theory and management practice, the research method of segmentation and integration can be used to put forward strategy of industry development through the implementation of brand, and can also realize the professional integration of products and services for industry resources from both inside and outside.

Hence, this survey attempts to discover managers' point of view in the context of some issues such as attitude, perceived benefits, and infrastructure toward globalization policy and e-commerce. The sample size consists of 210 IT SMEs which were randomly selected from the official list of the ministry of industry. According to this study, the SMEs Management's views indicate positive insight and attitude toward globalization policies and e-commerce usage within their organization. It is noteworthy to state that most managers believe there are many benefits in globalization policy and e-commerce implementation. However, most managers indicated that they have limitedly used proper hardware and software for their e-commerce systems.

Yet at times in the past, and very powerfully in the last two years, many voices have noted that the two price series appear to have decoupled. We explore the apparent contradiction between these two views. We find that recognition of the statistical fact of cointegration needs to be tempered with two additional points. First, there is an enormous amount of unexplained volatility in natural gas prices at short horizons. Hence, any simple formulaic relationship between the prices will leave a large portion of the natural gas price unexplained. Second, the cointegrating relationship does not appear to be stable through time. The prices may be tied, but the relationship can shift dramatically over time. Therefore, although the two price series may be cointegrated, the confidence intervals for both short and long time horizons are large.","[Parsons, John E.] MIT Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, MIT Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Parsons, John E.] MIT Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ramberg, David J.] MIT, MIT Engn Syst Div, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ramberg, David J.] MIT, MIT Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Parsons, JE (通讯作者)，MIT Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, MIT Sloan Sch Management, E19-411,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dramberg@mit.edu; jparsons@mit.edu,,,BP Technologies Ventures Inc. as a part of the BP-MIT,BP Technologies Ventures Inc. as a part of the BP-MIT,"This research was supported by a grant from BP Technologies Ventures Inc. as a part of the BP-MIT Advanced Conversion Research program.

We find that after a positive rainfall shock children are shorter regardless of their region or altitude. Negative temperature shocks have a negative impact on height in the central and southern parts of the country as well as in higher altitudes. Although on average there are no statistically significant impacts from positive temperature shocks, certain subpopulations - namely boys, children between 12 and 23 months at the time of measurement, and children of less educated mothers - in some of the regions are negatively impacted.

Going beyond other studies, this paper assesses affiliation with eight elements that underpin the commercialisation of tenant businesses, as recognized by Patton et al. The rationale behind this model is that intangible elements are the true contributors of value for tenants.

Globalization is creating trends and expectations but there is also evidence to suggest that the strong sense of the local community is a vital part of the destination competitive advantage. Tourism competitiveness is rarely examined at the single business level as the complexity of the tourism system is based on interaction and interdependency. Therefore the concerns with strategy, structure and rivalry seems a little different within tourism - hence the growing concerns with network partnerships, clusters and co-operations within the tourism literature. Management of tourist services should satisfy the needs of the customer (tourist) and contributes to tourist well-being as well as it should contribute to well being of local community.

Using a political economy approach we argue that the interaction of distributional concerns, cognitive limitations, time-consistency problems, and institutional structures can keep governments from implementing the economically optimal policy response. We argue that distributional concerns often lead to a 'bias' in favor of currency defense as long as market pressures are mild. The political incentives to initially delay devaluations can be exacerbated by institutions that either increase the size of interest groups vulnerable to depreciation or give policymakers incentives to adopt a short time-horizon. Once market pressure becomes strong, however, the politically salient alternative to not depreciating becomes raising interest rates rather than just running down reserves. This acts as a wake-up call that changes perceptions of the underlying distributional considerations and hence the political trade-off between the costs and benefits of an exchange rate defense. As the coalition of devaluation-proponents grows, the likelihood of a devaluation increases. We illustrate our argument by discussing the salient distributional issues and their interaction with domestic institutions in four brief case studies.","[Walter, Stefanie] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Heidelberg, Germany; [Willett, Thomas D.] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA USA; [Willett, Thomas D.] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA USA",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College,"Walter, S (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Heidelberg, Germany.",,"Walter, Stefanie/A-5418-2012","Walter, Stefanie/0000-0002-0804-5647",,,,,48,15,20,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It has long been recognised that the disutility of the time spent travelling also depends upon a wide range of factors such as the journey length or the effort, comfort and safety associated with travelling. Hence we might expect the value of motorists' travel time to vary with the traffic conditions as represented by the degree of congestion, in part to reflect the more difficult driving environment when there are more vehicles, but also a higher sense of frustration, similar to that associated with waiting time and contributing to its premium valuation. In this context, and despite the predominance of car travel in developed countries, the empirical evidence specifically relating to car values of travel time tends to fail to distinguish between different types of time according to the degree of congestion. Thus we are often left unclear as to precisely what type of time has been valued. Moreover, when a distinction is made, it tends to be into a simple dichotomy of congested and uncongested traffic. This paper provides new evidence on the variation in the valuation of motorists' travel time savings across a finer gradation of types of time than has been hitherto attempted. This is obtained from the same Stated Choice exercise conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States. The paper also provides an extensive account of previous research into how congestion impacts on motorists' values of time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model constructed here is based on vector autoregressive approach but it allows the changes in relationships by regime switching. The switch is made according to the business environment, more accurately according to phases of expansion or contraction in the economy. Considering that turning points in the economic activity could not be necessary determined only by exceeding fixed values of observed variables, regime switching model is made by using dummy variables in the model. The turning points' dating is adopted from OECD turning points dating for Czech economy. By distinguishing of the environment conditions in the model the different relationships between variables are investigated. As an endogenous variable in the model an indicator of confidence of firms is added, as a possible source of information about future development of economy.","[Zavacka, Jana] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,jana.zavacka1@vsb.cz,"Závacká, Jana/L-2475-2015",,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,1016.0,1020,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900174,0

By using the literature, interviews and logical analysis, this paper proposes the innovative method for physical education management. The author does the research from three aspects: physical education, sports competition platform building and campus sports talents' training. Based on the three aspects, this paper builds up in and outside classroom teaching and managing model and concludes that the campus physical education could be improved by adopting utilitarian teaching ideas so as to increase students' physical fitness and health standards.","[Zou Wei] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Sports Dept, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Lv Lulu] Wuhan Inst Phys Educ, Coll postgraduate, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan Sports University,"Zou, W (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Sports Dept, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",873924190@qq.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,1054.0,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500166,0

The Imperiali method strongly disadvantages the opposition. But, in the absence of political constraint or trends towards liberalisation, most of the regional decision makers still chose a more permissive formula. The trade-off among the incentives to solidify the power monopoly, to maintain the democratic facade of the regime and to co-opt the opposition was achieved by rejecting the least permissive electoral formula and choosing a middle-of-the-road solution instead.","European Univ St Petersburg, St Petersburg 191187, Russia",European University at Saint Petersburg,"Golosov, GV (通讯作者)，European Univ St Petersburg, Gagarinskaya 3, St Petersburg 191187, Russia.",ggolosov@gmail.com,"Golosov, Grigorii/C-3032-2012","Golosov, Grigorii/0000-0001-9769-9230",,,,,78,8,8,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,NOV 26,2014,66.0,10,,,,,1611.0,1628,,10.1080/09668136.2014.967553,0.0,,,18,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AS9HR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344554500002,0

It provides a comparative theory test of Common Foreign and Security Policy alignment in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. In doing so it seeks to elucidate why they engage in alignment as well as how cross-country and cross-issue variance can be theorised. After reviewing the explanatory potential of power-based and sociological institutionalist theory, domestic variables are assessed. The essay shows that, contrary to frequently expressed assumptions, convergence is even possible in less institutionalised high politics fields. But it emphasises that it is largely conditioned by domestic institutional configurations, the preferences of individual or collective actors and overall state gains.","Univ Bremen, Inst Intercultural & Int Studies, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Mayer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Inst Intercultural & Int Studies, Mary Somerville Str 7 Haus Wien, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",sebastian.mayer@iniis.uni-bremen.de,,"Mayer, Sebastian/0000-0002-1360-9881",,,,,72,6,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,NOV 26,2014,66.0,10,,,,,1679.0,1702,,10.1080/09668136.2014.967556,0.0,,,24,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AS9HR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344554500005,0

This logic seems applicable in the case of the European Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive: in fear of managers relocating, the UK, which hosts almost the entire European alternative investment sector, successfully advocated a watering down of the proposed requirements. This paper, however, questions the origins of the - seemingly natural - British negotiation position. The empirical record confirms that the relocation threat is not a necessary fact imposed by a global logic of market forces, but a scenario constructed and contested both by the regulator and firms. The scale and imminence of the threat posed to the UK's competitiveness depends on the use and function of competing narratives about hedge fund managers' relocation and these narratives inform the behaviour of both hedge fund managers and their regulator. The British authorities hence not only influence the degree of regulatory competition through acts of liberalisation, but also through their influence on dominant narratives. This means that regulatory competition is a social, not a brute fact, and that the associated power relationship between state and market actors is discursively produced.","UCL, Sch Publ Policy, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Sennholz-Weinhardt, B (通讯作者)，UCL, Sch Publ Policy, London WC1E 6BT, England.",,,,,,,,82,14,14,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

A DSGE model which includes financial markets is tested in the CVAR framework, and restrictions from the theoretical model are mainly rejected. Comparing impulse response functions from the theoretical model and the restricted empirical model also show that the results from the theoretical model are not found in the data.

These cracks allow water infiltration to the underlying layers and causes further moisture damage as well as weakening the unbound layers. Over the years, several methods have been developed for mitigating the RCs. This study aims to investigate the current reflective cracking mitigation methods and develop a methodology for the selection of appropriate mitigation technique. The developed model is then applied to a case study in the state of Florida. Method: To accomplish this goal, a nationwide literature review was conducted to better understand the current in practice methods in the United States. Moreover, a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) in five different road types was performed to find the annuity of roadway rehabilitation for each of the mitigation methods. The uncertainty in the LCCA results is represented using Exploratory Modeling and Analysis (EMA) method. Then through a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model, a stochastic optimization model was developed to find the appropriate reflective cracking mitigation solution under Florida's climate and road conditions, based on different cost and performance weights. Results: Based on the available data for the state of Florida, the LCCA results indicate that the annuity of maintaining the roadway with Fabrics and ISAC are lower compared to other methods. However, the results of stochastic optimization model reveal that while looking at the performance and cost at the same time, different methods would be more feasible. For instance, while the cost of the used method does not matter at all and only performance matters, STRATA (R) is more probable to be the appropriate mitigation technique. The findings of this research are critical for decision makers to better understand the most cost-effective mitigation technique in different conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the hybrid model, backward-looking behavior is found to be predominant.

It analyzes the relationship between daily prices of electricity, natural gas and carbon emission allowances with a semiparametric varying smooth coefficient cointegration model. Different electricity generation technologies have distinct fuel price dependencies, which allows estimating the structure of the power plant portfolio by exploiting market prices. The semiparametric model indicates a technology switch from coal to gas at roughly 85% of maximum demand. This model is used to analyze the market impact of the nuclear moratorium by the German Government in March 2011. Futures prices of electricity, natural gas and emission allowances are used to show that the market efficiently accounts for the suspended capacity and correctly expects that several nuclear plants will not be switched on after the moratorium.","Univ Cologne EWI, Inst Energy Econ, D-50827 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Thoenes, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne EWI, Inst Energy Econ, Vogelsanger Str 321, D-50827 Cologne, Germany.",thoenes@wiso.uni-koeln.de,,,,,,,30,10,10,0,13,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2014,35.0,4,,,,,61.0,78,,10.5547/01956574.35.4.3,0.0,,,18,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AP4HB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342036700003,0

Variations in the FAR across cities remain an understudied measure of urban spatial structure. We examine how the FAR varies across the five boroughs of New York City. In particular, we focus on the FAR gradient over the 20th century. First we find that the gradient became steeper in the early part of the 20th century, but then flattened in the 1930s, and has remained relatively constant since the mid-1940s. Next we identify the slope of the gradient across space, using the Empire State Building as our core location. We find significant variation of the slope coefficients, using both ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regressions. We then identify subcenters, and show that while accounting for them can better capture New York's spatial structure, by and large, the city remains monocentric with respect to its FAR. Lastly, we find a nonlinear relationship between plot sizes and the FAR across the city. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Public attitudes to the charges became more negative during the period from the decision to the start of the system. Once the trial started, public attitudes became dramatically more positive over the following years, going from 2/3 against the charges to more than 2/3 in favor of the charges. Self-reported changes in behavior and attitudes considerably underestimate actual changes: about 3/4 of the decrease in car trips and more than half of the change in attitudes seem to have gone unnoticed by respondents, ex post. Self-interest and belief in the charges' effectiveness strongly affect attitudes at any given point in time, but can only explain a minor part of the change in attitudes. I suggest that the debate and the shift in attitudes can be understood as a public and political reframing of the congestion charges over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The study also documents the myriad research studies and professional opinions offered on the potential safety effects of equipping school buses with safety restraints/seat belts. Four seat configurations for the school buses were analyzed. The first configuration represents the most common current bus seating configuration without seat belts, 3 seats on each side of the aisle and 12 rows (3/3-12). The physical space required for seat belt hardware may result in a loss of a row of seats and may reduce the number of students seated per row. Thus, three more configurations were studied: loss of a row of seats (3/3-11), loss of one seat per row (3/2-12), and loss of both a row of seats and a seat per row (3/2-11). The capacity for each configuration for each bus using current pupil loads was determined. The costs associated with installation of seat belts, and purchase and operation of new buses were obtained. Should school bus seat belts become mandatory in Alabama, the results obtained in this study can be used by any school system to determine the optimum configuration for their pupils, which will identify the number of additional buses that must be purchased by the school system. This study found that many of the buses that would become overloaded due to seat belt installation and the resultant loss of seating will be carrying only a few excess pupils. Transportation supervisors may be able to handle such overloads by transferring these pupils to other buses or by adjusting their bus routes to minimize purchase of new buses. Additional suggestions for handling bus overloads were offered in the body of this report. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To deal with the endogenous problem, we introduce three estimation methods, e. g., a joint estimation procedure, a two-step estimation procedure and a MCMC estimation procedure. Although the joint estimation procedure provides us with a direct estimator via Kim's (Kim, C.-J. 1994. Dynamic Linear Models with Markov-Switching.

In this case, we consider the two-step estimation procedure and the MCMC estimation procedure. Our Monte Carlo experiments show that three estimation procedures are in general feasible and robust. Although the two-step estimation procedure is not as efficient as the MCMC estimation procedure, they both perform better than the joint estimation procedure. In an application to the Campbell and Mankiw's (1989) consumption model, we document the robustness of our three estimation procedures and verify the significant regime switching behavior of this model.","[Wang, Xia] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Shang, Yuhuang; Zheng, Tingguo] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Xiamen University","Zheng, TG (通讯作者)，Room A202,Econ Bldg WISE,Siming South Rd, Xiamen, Fujian Province, Peoples R China.",zhengtg@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The procedures are illustrated by material from the construction of monthly price indices for Norway from the year 1777 to 1920. The price indices shed new light on two great wartime inflationary episodes in Norway: 1807-17 and 1913-20. In spite of a 61-fold increase in the price level in the first period and a four-fold increase in the second, it is found that, after inflation had been brought under control, prices reverted to a level consistent with the purchasing power parity principle.","Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Klovland, JT (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway.",jan.klovland@nhh.no,,,,,,,59,2,2,1,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

In case of both, this problem is magnified by the paucity of reliable instruments. Instead of resorting to the oft-employed alternative of panel data to address selection on just the time-invariant unobservables, this paper assesses the extent to which a positive association between CU or RTA membership and bilateral trade can be considered causal. In addition, it attends to recent concerns over the extensive margin of trade (at the country-level) and the issue of zero trade observations in log-linearized gravity models by relying more on a bivariate probit analysis. Despite not identifying point estimates, striking results are obtained. While most cross-sections exhibit a positive association between both RTAs and CUs and trade, the evidence in favor of a robust causal effect is strong mainly for CUs. However, the magnitude of the CU effect is still sensitive to the amount of selection on unobservables. Moreover, selection into RTAs (CUs) is mostly found to be positive (negative). Finally, the presence of spillovers across the policy regimes is also detected.","Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Roy, J (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",royj@appstate.edu,,,,,,,62,5,5,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Our central thesis is that abnormal trading volume is lower for the more informed institutions vis a vis non-sophisticated retail investors/institutions. We find a negative relationship between ownership by pension funds and abnormal trading volume around quarterly FFO announcements. However, ownership by the other types of institutions is unrelated to abnormal trading volume. Consistent with the view that some institutional investors are more informed than individual investors and therefore respond less to end of year announcements, we find that higher ownership by investment advisors is associated with lower levels of trading volume around end of year FFO announcements.

However, the studies of external perception offer some findings that are central for the NPE debate. This article's argument is that the external perceptions literature points to a limited (if still identifiable) perception of the EU as a normative power depending on the geographical area. By comparison, the image of a powerful economic actor is prevalent. The article raises the question of whether the thin and geographically varied character of the perceptions relating to the EU as a normative power justifies the general designation of NPE. A new agenda focusing on geographical differences and interaction with other sources of power is outlined.","[Larsen, Henrik] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Larsen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farigmagsgade 5, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",HL@ifs.ku.dk,,"Larsen, Henrik/0000-0003-2213-4125",,,,,44,49,52,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Resurrected in the 1920s, the interwar gold standard malfunctioned from the onset, contributing to the Great Depression's quick propagation and severity, and its abandonment between 1929 and 1936 was a critical factor in ending the Great Depression, with countries devaluing earlier and more sizeably recovering more quickly. The intricate combination of similarities and differences with the present situation makes one of two outcomes likely: either some countries will eventually leave the eurozone to boost their growth prospects; or, the eurozone will remain intact as a result of stronger political co-operation today, but a poorly working internal adjustment mechanism could result in low growth rates for the foreseeable future, similar to the experience of the gold bloc countries in the 1930s.","[Morys, Matthias] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Morys, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",matthias.morys@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,21,6,7,1,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

A large body of work assumes that they maximize the power of their organization. This study suspends a priori preference attribution and empirically investigates variation in support for supranational authority over five policy areas. The analysis uses Kassim etal.'s survey data from 2008 (N=1,901). The first finding in this article is that Commission officials do not systematically prefer more supranational decision-making. Following the logic of fiscal federalism, they support changes in EU policy scope to the extent that this would improve public good provision. The second finding, taking a political psychology perspective, is that individual calculations of efficiency are mediated by ideological beliefs. Because issues are complex and information is costly, Commission officials rely on heuristics to assess what the European Union should do.

J,"Bréban, L",,,,"Breban, Laurie",,,Smith on happiness: towards a gravitational theory,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF ECONOMIC THOUGHT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Adam Smith; happiness; gravitation; hedonic adaptations; sympathy,SYMPATHY; EMPATHY,"Some commentators have tried to link Smith's analysis with fundamental results in economics of happiness. These contributions mainly focus on the influence of wealth on happiness (Ashraf et al. 2005; Bruni 2006; Brewer 2009). However, this connection is far from covering Smith's considerations about individual happiness and their possible similarities with today's analysis in economics of happiness. In the Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith argues that adverse events depress people's mind much more below their ordinary state of happiness than prosperous ones. However, close to what we call, today, hedonic adaptations theories, he views adverse and prosperous events as only short term shocks, so that an individual's level of happiness tends towards the one of his ordinary state of happiness, just as short term market prices tend towards long term natural prices. This paper aims at throwing light on the foundations of Smith's gravitational theory of happiness, on its consequences on an individual's preferences, and also on its implication with regard to the possibility of long-term variations of happiness. The first step leads to establish a link between the nowadays familiar idea that individuals adapt to circumstances and Smith's analysis of individual happiness. The second step puts to the fore the role that Smith grants to the sympathy with the impartial spectator in the way back to the ordinary state of happiness after deviations produced by prosperous or adverse events. At last, we focus on the decisional consequences that Smith draws from his gravitational theory of happiness, chiefly those which deal with the choice between various permanent situations (for instance, poverty and riches) and their evaluation.","[Breban, Laurie] Univ Paris 01, PHARE, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Breban, Laurie] Univ Caen Basse Normandie, F-14000 Caen, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite de Caen Normandie,"Bréban, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, PHARE, Maison Sci Econ,106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",laurie.breban@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,41,7,7,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

We find that smoothing is on average close to zero but varies substantially over time. From the inception of the NCREIF index in 1978 until the mid-1990s, there was little evidence of smoothing. Smoothing has increased significantly since the mid-1990s to the end of 2010. Smoothing increases when property prices or uncertainty increases. However, it decreases when sentiment in the property market is high or during recession periods. The substantial variation in the level of smoothing indicates that the volatility of unsmoothed appraisal-based property returns would be significantly over- or under-estimated for different periods if unsmoothed with a long-run average smoothing.","[Cho, Youngha] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Hwang, Soosung; Lee, Yong-ki] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Oxford Brookes University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, Y (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",ycho@brookes.ac.uk; shwang@skku.edu; manppang1@gmail.com,"Hwang, Soosung/C-3842-2013; CHO, YOUNGHA/AAL-2058-2020","Hwang, Soosung/0000-0003-3953-0829; Cho, Youngha/0000-0002-6914-1798",,,,,62,9,9,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2014,42.0,2,,,,,497.0,529,,10.1111/1540-6229.12027,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,AH2NT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335958900008,0

This model fits within the neo-institutional conceptual framework; more specifically, we used the DiMaggio/Powell analytical grid. Our desire to prepare this model was born from the observation that the analytical framework that is generally used to study the adoption of these new standards is the neo-institutional framework and that the principal methodologies implemented are qualitative. The question addressed in this study regards the forces leading an agent-in this case, an organisation providing standards for accounting-to adopt, at a given moment, these new standards. Existing studies, as interesting as they might be, are devoted to the question of adoption and leave aside the question of diffusion. In other words, the evolution of the system as a whole in time is ignored. Constructing a model appeared to us to be a way to move beyond these limitations. This model allows us to formalise the forces at work in the DiMaggio/Powell representation and to simulate the diffusion processes of the IFRS. To this end, we implement a multi-agent simulation. The various simulation scenarios are then compared to the observed diffusion of the IFRS.","[Dufour, Dominique; Teller, Pierre; Luu, Philippe] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GRM EA 4711, F-06189 Nice, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Teller, P (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GRM EA 4711, F-06189 Nice, France.",domduf@wanadoo.fr; pierre.teller@unice.fr; philippe.luu@unice.fr,,,,,,,26,8,8,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Our goal is to analyze the effects of the partial information on investment in the American option under an incomplete market. The objective of the option holder is to maximize the expected discounted utility of consumption over an infinite lifetime. Thanks to consumption utility-based indifference pricing principal, stochastic control and filtering theory, under CARA utility, we derive the value and the exercise time of the American call option, which are determined by a semi-closed-form solution of a free-boundary PDE problem with a finite time horizon. We provide numerical results by finite difference methods and compare the results with those under a fully observable case. Numerical calculations demonstrate that partial information leads to a significant loss of the implied value of the American call option. This loss increases with the uncertainty of the mean appreciation rate. If the option holder is risk-averse enough, a growth of the systematic/idiosyncratic risk will increase/decrease the implied option value and the option is exercised later/sooner. Whether a stronger positive correlation between the tradable asset and the non-tradable underlying asset increases the option value and the information value depends on the risk attitude of the option holder. On the contrary, a stronger negative correlation will definitely make the option and the information more valuable. In addition, explicit expressions of the utility-based pricing for a perpetual American call are presented if the tradable risky asset is perfectly correlated with the underlying asset.","[Song, Dandan; Yang, Zhaojun] Hunan Univ, Sch Finance & Stat, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Yang, ZJ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Finance & Stat, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",songdan000@126.com; zjyang@hnu.edu.cn,"Yang, Zhaojun/B-2546-2013; Yang, Zhaojun/P-5318-2019","Yang, Zhaojun/0000-0002-2591-7283; Yang, Zhaojun/0000-0002-2591-7283","National Natural Science Foundation of China [70971037, 71171078, 71221001]; Ministry of Education of China [20100161110022]; Scientific Research Project of Graduate Student in Hunan University [CX2011B142]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Scientific Research Project of Graduate Student in Hunan University","The research for this paper was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (70971037, 71171078 and 71221001), Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China (20100161110022) and Scientific Research Project of Graduate Student in Hunan University (CX2011B142).",,31,4,4,1,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In this paper, we revisit the immediate post-war period in both parts of Germany to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the output and productivity shocks operating in both economies. Our principal finding is that the dismantling of the capital stock alone cannot explain the inferior performance of the East German economy. The collapse of output after the war and the ensuing recovery in both parts of the country were driven by total factor productivity; changes in factor endowments were of second-order significance. West Germany began to lead East Germany in industrial labor productivity well before the economic reforms of 1948 could make their mark. The major factor contributing to this early divergence were disproportions in industrial structure caused by the division of Germany.","[Ritschl, Albrecht; Vonyo, Tamas] London Sch Econ, Econ Hist Dept, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ritschl, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Econ Hist Dept, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.o.ritschl@lse.ac.uk; t.vonyo@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,5,5,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The nonlinear Granger-causality test provides strong evidence that personal current taxes and taxes on production and imports Granger-cause GDP and weak evidence that CR Granger-cause GDP. As a consequence, in order to influence (rebalance) the USA's GDP through taxation, it is recommended to the USA government to adjust the tax structure, focusing on PCT and taxes on production and imports' shocks.

Past empirical research on the relationship between hotel room revenue and labour demand has failed to take into account the fact that the causality between these two variables can be a two-way rather than just a one-way relationship. En other words, room revenue can affect labour demand and Vice versa. The authors address this issue by using an instrumental variables (IV) regression approach in which room revenue and hotel labour demand can be determined simultaneously. The empirical results indicate that a failure to account for the two-way causality will underestimate the effect of room revenue on labour demand. The findings are of particular importance to hotel managers as the authors provide more accurate estimates for the relationship between hotel room revenue and labour demand.","[Chen, Chiang-Ming; Liao, Yu-Hsun] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Puli 54561, Nantou, Taiwan; [Lin, Yu-Chen] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University; Soochow University,"Chen, CM (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Rd, Puli 54561, Nantou, Taiwan.",ming@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

So far there are no techniques for validating the shocks identified via such restrictions. Although in an ideal setting the sign restrictions specify shocks of interest, sign restrictions may be invalidated by measurement errors, data adjustments or omitted variables. We model changes in the volatility of the shocks via a Markov switching (MS) mechanism and use this device to give the data a chance to object to sign restrictions. The approach is illustrated by considering a small model for the market of crude oil. Earlier findings that oil supply shocks explain only a very small fraction of movements in the price of oil are confirmed and it is found that the importance of aggregate demand shocks for oil price movements has declined since the mid 1980s.

The results expose unexpected national and intra-national similarities and differences.

A growing literature in economic sociology and business suggests that diaspora investors are motivated by patriotism and other social and emotional factors, endowing them with unique potential as a force for international development. This literature argues that diaspora-owned firms are more socially responsible than other foreign firms, and engage in a range of economic development-promoting behaviors when investing in the homeland: hiring more local labor, paying higher wages, and making more contributions to charity. I argue that diaspora-owned firms enjoy competitive advantages in the homeland based on access and attention to information. I evaluate these theories at the firm level, using data from an original survey of 174 foreign-owned firms in the post-conflict country of Georgia. Across a range of self-reported behaviors and priorities, I find no evidence that diaspora-owned firms are more likely to engage in a specific set of socially responsible, pro-development behaviors than are other foreign firms, and some evidence that they are less likely to do so. I argue that diaspora investors are uniquely capable, but not uniquely philanthropic, when doing business in their homelands.","Univ So Calif, Sch Int Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Graham, BAT (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Sch Int Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,"Graham, Benjamin A.T./E-7404-2011",,,,,,83,16,18,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

I find that the degree of strategic coordination through extra-market institutions - which protect the economic system from class and sectoral pressures and promote collaboration among state agencies, financiers, managers, and labor organizations - contributes to a country's domestic banking and financial intermediary-based development but is less conducive to the development of its securities markets. The financial liberalization reforms of the 1990s meant the emergence of an asymmetric corporatist system, whereby banks and other financial institutions played a crucial role in defining the new rules of financial governance. Conducting a panel data analysis encompassing 18 advanced democracies over the period of 1960-2005, I find evidence of the impact of strategic coordination on financial development, while controlling for alternative explanations and ensuring that my estimates capture the influence of the exogenous component of coordination.

Until the crisis, the IMF had not lent to EU member states in decades, but now the two organisations closely coordinate their lending policies. In the Latvian and Romanian programmes, the IMF and the EU advocated different loan terms. Surprisingly, the EU embraced 'Washington Consensus'-style measures more willingly than did the IMF, which much of the contemporary literature still portrays as an across-the-board promoter of orthodox macroeconomic policies. We qualify this stereotypical characterisation by arguing from a constructivist perspective that the degree of an organisation's autonomy from its members depends on the interpretation of its mandate. IMF staff viewed the Fund's technical mandate as an opportunity to react rather flexibly to the challenges of the latest crisis. By contrast, European Commission, as well as European Central Bank (ECB), staff interpreted the vast body of supranational rules as necessitating stricter adherence to economic orthodoxy. Thus, IMF lending policies were more flexible and, at least on fiscal issues, also less contractionary.","[Luetz, Susanne; Kranke, Matthias] Free Univ Berlin, Otto Suhr Inst Polit Sci, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Lütz, S (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Otto Suhr Inst Polit Sci, Berlin, Germany.",,"Kranke, Matthias/AAJ-6162-2021","Kranke, Matthias/0000-0002-7693-5748",,,,,88,74,74,2,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

To undertake this analysis we examined own and cross price elasticities of different production factors using a translog production function which provides a convenient framework for analysing output reaction to changes in prices. Moreover a regression approach was used to test the hypotheses that government-funded research, development and extension (RD&E), private and investment, terms of trade, and share of irrigated area are significant determinants of total factor productivity (TFP) in the agricultural sector. We found significant negative cross-price elasticities between labor and capital suggesting that agricultural policies in the form of subsidies for agricultural machinery could be introduced without negatively affecting the agricultural labor force. Our results indicate that agricultural productivity experienced moderate annual growth between 1981 and 2007. Over the whole period, land and capital were found to be the most important contributors to productivity, followed by agricultural inputs and livestock, while labor was the least significant single contributor. The findings show that TFP growth was the result of investments in the agricultural sector with the use of intensive irrigated production systems and the adoption of new production technologies.","[Dhehibi, Boubaker; Telleria, Roberto; Aw-Hassan, Aden] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas, Social Econ & Policy Res Program, Amman, Jordan",CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA),"Dhehibi, B (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas, Social Econ & Policy Res Program, Amman, Jordan.",,,"Dhehibi, Boubaker/0000-0003-3854-6669",Economic Research Service (ERS) - United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),Economic Research Service (ERS) - United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"The authors thank the Agricultural Productivity with an Emphasis on Water Constraints in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) project sponsored by the Economic Research Service (ERS) - United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), for partially funding this research.",,48,6,6,0,13,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2014,13.0,1,,,,,4.0,14,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AG2VW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335276200002,0

Our contribution is two-fold. First, we develop a static theoretical model based on the concept of health capital, wherein poor working conditions are partially compensated by higher wages. According to our model, the effect of working conditions on sickness absence is ambiguous. Second, we apply our model to the case of working time arrangements and test the effect of working irregular schedules or work around the clock on sickness absence, using data from the French Labor Force Survey on a specific population (male manual workers in private sector). As heterogeneity may lead to severe bias, we use propensity score matching methods. Our estimates show that working irregular schedules has a significant impact on sickness absence. The results are more mitigated for work around the clock.

The optimal employment tax rate is given by an inverse elasticity rule. This rule depends on the global response of the employment rate, which depends not only on the participation (labor supply) responses, but also on the vacancy posting (labor demand) responses and on the product of these two responses. For plausible values of the parameters, our matching environment induces much lower employment tax rates than the usual competitive model with endogenous participation only. However, optimal employment tax rates are larger (in absolute value) when a given level of the global elasticity of employment is more due to search frictions and less due to participation responses.","[Jacquet, Laurence] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Cergy Pontoise, France; [Lehmann, Etienne] Univ Pantheon Assas Paris 2, CRED TEPP, Paris, France; [Lehmann, Etienne] CREST, Paris, France; [Van der Linden, Bruno] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Van der Linden, Bruno] FNRS, Brussels, Belgium",CY Cergy Paris Universite; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Universite Catholique Louvain; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,"Lehmann, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pantheon Assas Paris 2, CRED TEPP, Paris, France.",laurence.jacquet@u-cergy.fr; etienne.lehmann@ensae.fr; bruno.vanderlinden@uclouvain.be,"Lehmann, Etienne/AAI-3084-2020; Lehmann, Etienne/HFZ-8470-2022","Lehmann, Etienne/0000-0002-2408-9674; Van der Linden, Bruno/0000-0002-8735-1158",,,,,40,6,10,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2014,42.0,2,,,,,381.0,402,,10.1007/s00355-013-0736-0,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA3KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330992000007,0

The region of Andalusia in Spain receives more than 16 million tourists annually. The purpose of this study is to analyse levels of seasonality in this region during 2005-2010 according to type of destination (coastal capitals, coastal areas, inland capitals and inland areas) to highlight the differences in patterns of seasonality in these destinations. The authors focus on tourism seasonality based on type of destination as regional aggregate data provide very little information about the situation, thus making it difficult to determine the expected effects of seasonality on the sustainability of each environment. Due to its wide acceptance, the authors use the Gini index in the analysis and apply it to monthly arrivals of passengers and their overnight stays. Their analysis reveals that coastal areas suffer from the greatest seasonality, and that these destinations also receive the greatest influx of tourists. Furthermore, coastal areas have experienced higher growth in terms of seasonal trends, which may threaten sustainability. The analysis also shows that the seasonality of foreign tourism intensifies because its monthly distribution pattern is very similar to that of domestic tourism.","[Martin Martin, Jose Maria; Jimenez Aguilera, Juan De Dios] Univ Granada, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Econ, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Molina Moreno, Valentin] Univ Granada, Fac Econ, Dept Business Org, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada; University of Granada,"Martín, JMM (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",martinmartin@ugr.es; juande@ugr.es; valentinugr1@gmail.com,"Martin Martin, Jose Maria/O-8111-2018; Martin Martin, Jose Maria/O-8111-2018","Martin Martin, Jose Maria/0000-0002-5891-0037; Martin Martin, Jose Maria/0000-0002-5639-2213",,,,,68,76,77,0,58,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Data are reported from the Los Angeles Justice for Janitors campaign two decades after initial mobilization occurred there.

Our study design to evaluate the sustainable management of hypertension and diabetes was developed using brainstorming, Delphi techniques, and the AHP model. We first used the brainstorming and Delphi techniques, as well as literature review, to determine 50 criteria with which to evaluate the national non-communicable diseases policy; we then proposed a hierarchical structure of the AHP model. By applying the proposed AHP model to the assessment of the sustainable management of hypertension and diabetes in Korea, we show that the improvement of treatment compliance of patients should be relatively important rather than the healthcare system strengthening.","[Byun, Do-Hwa] Hongcheon Gun Hlth Ctr, Hongcheon, Gangwon Provinc, South Korea; [Kim, Chun-Bae] Yonsei Univ, Wonju Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Chang, Rho-Soon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Kangwon, South Korea",Yonsei University; Kangwon National University,"Kim, CB (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Wonju Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",jajaja@korea.kr; kimcb@yonsei.ac.kr; rschang@kangwon.ac.kr; parklove5004@naver.com,"박, 명배/AAE-9033-2020",,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-200-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,489.0,495,,,,,,7,Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BC2LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351060400085,0

However, as the dimensions and degree of heterogeneity in these models increase, the computational burden imposed by rational expectations solution methods for nonstationary equilibrium transition paths increases exponentially. As a result, these models have been limited in the scope of their use to a restricted set of applications and a relatively small group of researchers. In addition to providing a detailed description of the benchmark rational expectations computational method, this paper presents an alternative method for solving for equilibrium transition paths in OLG life cycle models that is new to this class of model. The key insight is that even na < ve limited information forecasts within the model produce aggregate time series similar to full information rational expectations time series as long as the na < ve forecasts are updated each period. We find that our alternate model forecast method reduces computation time by 85 percent, and the approximation error is small.","[Evans, Richard W.; Phillips, Kerk L.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"Evans, RW (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 167 FOB, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",revans@byu.edu; kerk_phillips@byu.edu,"Phillips, Kerk/H-2732-2012","Phillips, Kerk/0000-0002-4895-4167",,,,,25,0,2,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In this regard, our purpose was to identify the main revival strategies to be used for a tourism destination which lost in time its attractiveness but still preserves its potential of natural and artificial resources. To reach such goal, we designed a research methodology made up of two parts, a piece of descriptive research presenting the dynamics of a tourism destination and a piece of quantitative research centred on identifying customers' attitudes regarding their past experiences with that tourism destination. Thus, we chose as a tourism destination the beautiful area represented by the North-Western part of Moldavia (the counties of Suceava and Neamt) in Romania that in our view shall represent one of the top tourism attractions in our country, nationally and internationally as well. The main findings highlighted by our research were that in general, for old tourism destinations which lost their profitableness in time, there is a more tremendous need of focus and differentiation strategies aiming at emphasizing the tourism attractions of the area than of diversification strategies trying to design new products which need time to be developed and promoted.

Contrary to this traditional narrative, we argue that as governments increased state capacity, they often strove to weaken the autarkic tendencies of regional laws, thereby promoting greater trade and a more integrated market. To show this, we exploit a quasi-natural experiment generated in the French wine industry by a law implemented on 1 January 1901 which lowered and harmonized various local tax rates. We demonstrate that high internal taxes on wine, set by regional governments, discouraged trade and protected small producers of expensive and low quality wines. We then trace how the political response to this tax decrease led to increases in wine regulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A survey has been conducted on a sample of 500 Croatian small and medium size companies for the period 2005. to 2010. The data used for the empirical analysis were derived from companies' annual reports. Pearson correlation coefficient is applied in order to examine the relationship between profitability and leverage measures. The results of this research indicate negative relationship between profitability and leverage. But, profitability differently affect short-term and long-term leverage. The relationship between profitability and short-term leverage is negative and statistically significant in all observed years. The relationship between profitability and long-term leverage is not negative in all observed years and is not statistically significant. These results suggests that Croatian SME's use profits to reduce their debt level or becoming less levered when they are profitable.

Examining the case of Ukraine, the article finds that international financial institutions and donors are better at eliciting reform than the EU because they empower state and non-state domestic actors, who in turn demand and enforce new rules in their home markets. Overall, because the EU limits itself to intergovernmental co-operation and other external actors only engage in reform of select sectors, we do not observe comprehensive regulatory change in the eastern neighbourhood. Shallow transnational market integration is the result. Eastern neighbours are therefore economically worse off than even the laggards of EU enlargement, Bulgaria and Romania.

Other leakages related to import of the goods Is not possible to calculate because of absence the necessary data. The same problem woks in relation to the savings of the business and the state taxes.

Under this arrangement, peripheral countries have to accept periodically the debasement of the US dollar. Thus, there are some mutual incentives for the EU and China to reform the current IMS through cooperation. Both are in favour of stable exchange rates, and both are keen to constrain US macroeconomic profligacy. There have been some efforts towards these objectives in the past, especially during the French presidency of the G20 in 2011. However, there has been no significant progress. On the European side, there is not a united and independent Europe which could act as the primary agent of reform. On the Chinese side, Beijing does not see Europe as a reliable partner because the latter is deemed to have a major vested interest in the current regime. As a result, the French government failed to focus the world's attention on the reform of the IMS during G20 Cannes Summit, and the Chinese government has chosen a more unilateral way to internationalise its own currency.","[Otero-Iglesias, Miguel] Lunam Univ, ESSCA Sch Management, Ctr European Integrat, Paris, France; [Zhang, Ming] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Dept Int Investment, Beijing, Peoples R China",ESSCA School of Management; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Otero-Iglesias, M (通讯作者)，Lunam Univ, ESSCA Sch Management, Ctr European Integrat, Paris, France.",,"Otero-Iglesias, Miguel/H-9807-2015","Otero-Iglesias, Miguel/0000-0003-2010-8476",,,,,59,11,12,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2014,37.0,1,,,,,151.0,168,,10.1111/twec.12131,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,287GL,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329529900006,0

The effects of per capita agricultural value added on per capita income were examined using two samples of 25 and 30 EU member and candidate states respectively for the periods 1995-2007 and 2002-2007. A dummy variable representing EU membership status and a composite risk variable computed by the PRS Group, which provided information on structural properties of the economies of relevant countries, were used as independent variables. According to the two-way random effects estimation results, the agricultural value added elasticity of per capita income was 0.025 for the 1995-2007 period, and 0.22 for the 2002-2007 period. It was estimated that average per capita income is 5.6 % higher among EU members. With a change representing a 1 point rise in composite risk, which means a reduction of the risk faced by the country concerned, it was demonstrated that per capita income rose 1% during both periods. The results also showed that agriculture retains its economic importance, and that average per capita income among EU members is higher than among nonmembers due to exogenous factors.","[Ceylan, Rahmiye Figen; Ozkan, Burhan] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Ceylan, RF (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",,"Ceylan, Figen/C-7671-2016; Ozkan, Burhan/C-9583-2016","Ceylan, Figen/0000-0003-0459-7521; Ozkan, Burhan/0000-0002-9799-654X",,,,,43,4,4,0,8,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2013,12.0,4,,,,,62.0,71,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AG2VT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335275900008,0

However, such data are not a random sample from the whole population at the time of interest, but instead is skewed since the short men were less likely to be recruited. In statistical terms this means that the data are left-truncated. Although truncation is well-understood in statistics a further complication is that the truncation threshold is not known, may vary from time to time, and auxiliary information on the threshold is not at our disposal. The advantage of the fully Bayesian approach presented here is that both the population height distribution and the truncation are modeled simultaneously. The truncation threshold is allowed to be random and time-specific whilst the height distribution is assumed to change smoothly in time. Thus, in addition to the population height characteristics, we obtain also insight into recruiting criteria over time. Analysis of historical data from Swedish army recruitment in eight time events between 1768 and 1804 has found a declining trend in the mean population height during the inspected time period and also dramatic systematic changes in the recruiting.

These implications have not been lost on PRC-based scholars of international and comparative political economy, who have focused considerable - if, as we shall argue, incomplete - attention on globalization's challenge to state sovereignty, to economic sovereignty, and on the economic role of the state. The article highlights features of the Chinese scholarship that are quite distinctive. This literature reflexively favours a strong role for the state in the context of globalization. We also observe that the literature in general is not oriented to theory-building. Instead, scholarship is largely policy-driven; there is a strong impulse to provide positive policy advice to Chinese policy-makers. Most striking, the understanding of the state in the Chinese literature remains partial; there is a marked reluctance to delve into either empirical or theoretical study of the Chinese state itself - the state itself as a subject of critical analysis is rarely considered.","[Zhu, Tianbiao] Peking Univ, Sch Govt, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Pearson, Margaret] Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Peking University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Zhu, TB (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Govt, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,151,5,6,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The model we develop considers two airlines operating hub-and-spoke networks, using different hubs to connect the same spoke airports. We assume the airlines to be vertically differentiated, which allows us to distinguish between primary and secondary hubs. We conclude that this differentiation in air services becomes more accentuated after consolidation, with an increased number of flights being channeled through the primary hub. However, congestion can act as a brake on the concentration of flight frequency in the primary hub following consolidation. Our empirical application involves an analysis of Delta's network following its merger with Northwest. We find evidence consistent with an increase in the importance of Delta's primary hubs at the expense of its secondary airports. We also find some evidence suggesting that the carrier chooses to divert traffic away from those hub airports that were more prone to delays prior to the merger, in particular New York's JFK airport.

For simplicity, we refer to this as the cohesiveness. First, we provide axioms that characterize a family of linear and additive measures whose intersection is a partial ordinal criterion similar to first order stochastic dominance. The introduction of some additional properties isolates a one-parameter subfamily. This parameter evaluates the effect on the cohesiveness if one individual changes his ranking on a single pair of objects, as a function of how many of the remaining individuals in the group rank the first object over the second and vice versa. Finally, we characterize the focal measures of this subfamily separately showing that they coincide with measures constructed using two, at first sight, totally different approaches suggested in the literature.","[Alcalde-Unzu, Jorge] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Vorsatz, Marc] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Dept Anal Econ 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Vorsatz, Marc] Fdn Estudios Econ Aplicada FEDEA, Madrid 28001, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Vorsatz, M (通讯作者)，Fdn Estudios Econ Aplicada FEDEA, Calle Jorge Juan 46, Madrid 28001, Spain.",jorge.alcalde@unavarra.es; mvorsatz@fedea.es,"UNZU, FERNANDO/Y-7458-2019; Alcalde-Unzu, Jorge/S-9390-2017; Vorsatz, Marc/H-1489-2015","UNZU, FERNANDO/0000-0003-1232-8540; Unzu Martinez, Fernando/0000-0002-9479-554X; Alcalde-Unzu, Jorge/0000-0003-1839-6245; Vorsatz, Marc/0000-0001-6244-3606",,,,,24,19,19,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2013,41.0,4,,,,,965.0,988,,10.1007/s00355-012-0716-9,0.0,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,219ZR,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324551000012,0

Using a sample of publicly traded REITs for the 2004-2008 time period, we examine the relationships amongst corporate governance, accruals earnings management, manipulation of Funds from Operations (FFO), and real earnings management. We find that corporate governance quality is unrelated to accruals earnings management and manipulation of FFO. At first glance, the findings suggest that managers need less internal oversight because of the more transparent reporting structure of REITs. However, we document that REITs engage in significant real activities manipulation for earnings management purposes. Our empirical findings further show that corporate governance characteristics, in particular board size, independence, number of board meetings and audit committee financial expertise, are essential for constraining such activities. Finally, by focusing on a subset of REITs that act in ways which previous research has identified as more susceptible to earnings management activities, we demonstrate that good corporate governance effectively reduces accruals earnings management and manipulation of FFO for these REITs. Overall, our findings indicate that, despite the unique legal and reporting structure, REITs engage in certain forms of earnings management, and that the ability for REITs to manipulate earnings is reduced when corporate governance is more effective.","[Anglin, Paul] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Edelstein, Robert] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gao, Yanmin] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Tsang, Desmond] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Guelph; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Alberta; McGill University,"Anglin, P (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",panglin@uoguelph.ca; edelstei@haas.berkeley.edu; yanmin.gao@ualberta.ca; desmond.tsang@mcgill.ca,"Tsang, Desmond/O-6079-2017","Gao, Yanmin/0000-0003-4686-1781",,,,,70,21,21,0,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In this paper, these aspects are incorporated in the monetary and fiscal policy framework first suggested by Alesina and Tabellini (1987). It is shown that reneging on a fixed exchange rate promise unambiguously produces short term benefits, but long run losses. This leads to a non-straightforward trade-off between greediness (propensity for expropriation) and political stability (which implies a low time preference).

This procedure splits the process of spending decision into the stages of 'selection' and 'outcome', and also results in consistent estimates. The findings highlight two distinct profiles.

In current literature, the researches usually focus on the (ir)rationality of traders and its impacts on the bubble. We thereby propose a completely different perspective, that is, of traders' heterogeneity and its impacts on the formation of bubble in financial markets. As in the real financial markets, the agents are always heterogenous. For example, some of them are fundamentalists, some are chartists, some are noise traders, etc. To model the heterogeneity of agents in the real markets, we proposed a multi-agent model to control the constitution of traders. Based on four scenarios with different constitution of traders' behaviors, we investigated three extreme situations where the market is occupied by homogeneous agents (no matter they are fundamentalists, chartists or noise traders), and one scenario where the market is made up of heterogeneous traders. By applying Log-Periodic Power-Law (LPPL) model, We studied the impacts of different investors' behaviors on the bubble formation in the market and found that: (a) the public information has an important influence on the beginning of a bubble; (b) traders' different expectations and their self-feedback is one of reasons for the existence of log-periodicity in bubble; (c) the existence of power-law growth and log-periodicity, which leads the probability of prediction for the bursting of bubble, is caused by the combined effects of public information, traders' different expectations and their self-feedback.","[Chen, Shu-Peng; He, Ling-Yun] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Ctr Futures & Financial Derivat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [He, Ling-Yun] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",China Agricultural University; University of Calgary,"He, LY (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",cspslchen123@163.com; lyhe@ucalgary.ca,"HE, Ling-Yun/K-2346-2012","He, Ling-Yun/0000-0003-3565-9422","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71001101, 71273261]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-10-0779]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),We acknowledge the research grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71001101 and 71273261) and Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (No. NCET-10-0779).,,38,10,10,1,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Specifically, we break the New Deal period into the following six regimes: the Hundred Days, the President's Reemployment Agreement, the National Recovery Administration Codes of Fair Competition, the Schechter era, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Under these various regimes industrial markets were subject to different regulations relating to hourly wage rates, hours of work, the nature of competition, and unionization. Vector Autoregressive (VAR) regressions are run using a monthly panel of employment, weekly hours worked, wage rates, prices, and output for 11 major industries. We find that key policy and legal changes were associated with large and statistically significant movements in economic variables. Furthermore, changes in institutional regimes impacted different types of industries unevenly. For example, low-wage industries saw the largest increases in wages, and drops in output, after the mandated wage increases in 1933.

In the post-Soviet world, the democracy-geopolitics doublespeak breeds cynicism and achieves mixed results at best. Particularly discouraging are the outcomes of democracy promotion in the so-called cleft countries, straddled by a cultural divide. In Ukraine, American foreign policy achieved some success at the price of intensifying inter-regional antagonisms, which subsequently compromised and offset the progress that had been achieved in democratic forms of governance. In Belarus, democracy promotion failed altogether because inter-regional antagonisms in that country are too modest and are therefore difficult to leverage.","Radford Univ, Radford, VA 24142 USA",Radford University,"Ioffe, G (通讯作者)，Radford Univ, Radford, VA 24142 USA.",,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,SEP 1,2013,65.0,7,,,,,1255.0,1274,,10.1080/09668136.2013.822696,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,265DE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000327929100002,0

This article sheds new light on theories of regionalism by arguing that international actors can have a direct and significant influence on the dynamics of regionalism, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, by examining the influence of the European Union (EU) on the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Building on the recent literature on Africa and international relations, which shows how lines of sovereignty between domestic and international actors are blurred in the case of African political economies, the article shows how the EU played a significant role in the SADC's inception and has been directly influential in shaping the SADC's strategies and priorities in the post-Lome period. In the latter instance, this article explains how the EU's institutional embeddedness in the SADC's aid structures and its asymmetrical bargaining power in the SADC Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) has encouraged the SADC's pursuit of a neoliberal, trade-oriented form of regionalism.","[Buzdugan, Stephen Robert] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Management, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [Buzdugan, Stephen Robert] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Business, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England",Manchester Metropolitan University; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Buzdugan, SR (通讯作者)，Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Management, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.",,,"Buzdugan, Stephen/0000-0002-9679-1649",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-073-27-0034] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [RES-073-27-0034] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,73,16,16,0,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

(Am Econ Rev 84:84-103, 1994) introduced a new theoretical interpretation of the short-run relationship between the terms of trade and the trade balance: movements in net exports and the tendency for the trade balance to be negatively correlated with current and future movements in the terms of trade, but positively correlated with past movements. There have been several papers aimed at testing the S-curve hypothesis in the related literature. The most common empirical approach used in those papers is the cross-correlation analysis. This paper highlights several deficiencies of the cross-correlation analysis when being used directly to test for the validity of the mentioned hypothesis. The purpose of this paper is to offer an alternative approach so as to combine the causality theory in econometrics with the testing procedure of the S-curve hypothesis via the cross-correlations. The paper's empirical results reveal that disaggregated bilateral trade data between the United States and China almost never support the S-curve hypothesis, contrarily to a previous paper employing the same data, but utilizing the conventional cross-correlation analysis. Why this difference may have appeared is also discussed.","[Korkmaz, Abdurrahman] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Econometr, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkey; [Korkmaz, Sabiha] Ataturk Univ, Inst Social Sci, Erzurum, Turkey",Karadeniz Technical University; Ataturk University,"Korkmaz, A (通讯作者)，Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Econometr, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkey.",akorkmaz@ktu.edu.tr,"Korkmaz, Abdurrahman/AAB-9955-2020","KORKMAZ, ABDURRAHMAN/0000-0002-1374-5832",,,,,11,0,0,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The model replaces the benevolent organizer in the model of Brueckner and Selod (2009) with competing, rent-seeking squatter organizers, a structure that may offer a realistic picture of many cities in less-developed countries. The analysis demonstrates that, compared to the benevolent case, rent-seeking behavior puts more land in the hands of squatters, leading to greater squeezing of the formal housing market while extracting more defensive expenditures from each squatter household. Additional results show that competition among squatter organizers has much in common with competition in a traditional industry setting, while illustrating how changes in the squatting climate affect the equilibria.

We show that if winning in the first stage provides a psychological advantage in the second stage, each team would prefer to play the second stage at its home field.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Krumer, A (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",krumer@bgu.ac.il,"Krumer, Alex/AAP-9910-2020","Krumer, Alex/0000-0002-3274-8078",,,,,22,20,21,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2013,75.0,1,,,,,85.0,100,,10.1007/s11238-012-9313-8,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,179KV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321520100006,0

Stage two of the research involved the linkage of deaths over a 7-year period relative to their household context as of 1878. Being Jewish, having a servant, having access to a water well in the tenement and residing in a tenement only with other Jews, were all factors that contributed to a higher life expectancy. Our explanation for the enhanced survivorship among the Jews is grounded in economics as well as in an established welfare system, in religious precepts and in secular knowledge of health. One of the more notable and hitherto unobserved findings is that Roman Catholics residing in the same tenements with Jews enjoyed a distinct health advantage. This suggests that a positive amplification effect arose from their co-residence with the Jews. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We address dynamic selection, which may arise even under an initially random assignment to treatment, estimating a bivariate discrete-time hazard model jointly with a wage equation and correlated unobservables. Owing to the non-stationarity of job search behavior, we find heterogeneous effects of extended benefit duration on the re-employment hazard and on job match quality. Our results suggest that the unemployed who find a job close to and after benefit exhaustion experience less stable employment patterns and receive lower re-employment wages compared to their counterparts who receive extended benefits and exit unemployment in the same period.

I show that a system of Bank staff ratings of individual countries' policies, which has become more important in IDA lending over time, has systematically reduced the informal power of Board members. I show that while IDA Board members received more IDA commitments than their counterparts prior to 1989, this influence has disappeared since, as the importance of the policy index has increased. The findings are robust to the inclusion of fixed effects and a variety of relevant controls. In order to further support my argument, I also investigate the influence of Board membership on the Bank's policy index itself. I am unable to establish any positive relationship between Board membership and the index, either during the Cold War or afterwards. The findings not only shed important light on the internal workings of World Bank allocations to poor countries, but also highlight the ways in which institutional designs can affect the balance of informal power in international institutions.","Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Morrison, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 3218 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",morrison@gspia.pitt.edu,,,,,,,40,18,19,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

In general, apart from per capita income, features influencing the size of accessible markets (domestic and foreign) are the most relevant and robust determinants of the export diversification process.

In 2006, Venezuela and Argentina issued a package of joint' sovereign bonds, which were later tradable separately. Despite the fact that Venezuela did not explicitly guarantee the Argentine component of the bond, this paper shows through a series of GARCH models that the financial markets have traded the bond on the basis of news about Venezuela's politics, macro economy and its commitment to the bond and other regional integration projects. This is because the bond was embedded in a more extensive set of financial and political relationships between the two countries, and served as a commitment mechanism, enhancing Argentine credibility. The article demonstrates that bilateral economic and political relationships can serve as a credible commitment device in the absence of changes to domestic institutions or longer-term re-establishment of reputation.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Phillips, LM (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,,,,,,50,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Unanticipated inflation news implies abnormal returns depending on the direction of the news, the state of the economy and the flow-through ability of the sector.

This distinctly branded system operates primarily in two highly-travelled corridors and features high operating speeds, offline fare payment, advanced traveller information systems, and other ITS technologies. Although this new service has been deemed a success by many, it remains to be seen to what degree local work and post-secondary school transit use was affected by its introduction. To evaluate this, home-based work and post-secondary school trip mode choice models are estimated by using the datasets collected after the opening of the service. These models are then used to evaluate the impacts of the system on commuting mode choice preferences by using an additional dataset collected before opening the service. A GEV model is used to capture heterogeneity reflected in the RP datasets. The paper shows how modelling can be used to assess how level of service variables (e.g. travel times) can explain the impacts of new transit service. Empirical models reveal that the introduction of VIVA impacted the mode choice preference structure in the study area for work and post-secondary school trips. Also, it is shown that the improvements in transit service had greater impacts on transit mode share than the impacts of increasing traffic congestion. It is also posited that VIVA attributes such as improved branding, advertising, and communications may have caused this change in preferences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The framework can evaluate the public transit service performance at different levels of details (system level and route level). It can be used to assess the performance at the route level, which can then be used to provide specific recommendations to enhance the operation for specific routes, and also it can be used at a more macroscopic level to identify the operational deficiencies or areas of improvement at the system level. The route analysis level is based on a multi-criteria evaluation procedure that involves weighted scoring techniques.

Prevailing ideas of the Washington Consensus undoubtedly encouraged Russia's leaders to embrace radical reforms, but Russia's reformers were not blindly following an ideological agenda set for them in Washington, DC. The actual policies that were implemented diverged considerably from the prevailing neoliberal orthodoxy and were heavily shaped by the self-interest of the elites who were making the policy decisions. While prices were freed and international trade and currency flows opened up, an insider-dominated privatization process left the Russian economy in the hands of a narrow circle of oligarchs. Russia's corrupt, oil-dependent and state-centered economy is far removed from the decentralized, competitive market system that the reformers had envisaged. Democracy, which was initially seen as integral to the transition process, also fell by the wayside. While critics argue that Russia suffered from an overdose of market fundamentalism', neoliberals themselves still insist that Russia did not go far enough in unleashing genuine market forces. Either way, Russia has now joined the global market economy, while at the same time preserving many of the institutional features that are the product of its unique geography and historical heritage.","Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT USA",Wesleyan University,"Rutland, P (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT USA.",,"Rutland, Peter/AAU-4263-2020",,,,,,83,53,60,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

EBD studies for the healthcare industry are compiled into an international database to provide design information to all users. This paper reviews applications of EBD in healthcare and other fields, assesses the potential value of applying EBD in the transportation field, and makes recommendations that can help with the adoption of EBD for transportation design and engineering. Emerging areas such as transportation asset management, health impact assessments and green design are particularly appropriate and promising for the development and application of EBD databases. This paper is a useful resource for transportation executives or researchers who are interested in developing evidence-based databases to guide their future decision making to be more strategic to take advantage of proven successful applications. When appropriately applied, EBD has the potential to reduce costs and risks while increasing innovation and encouraging new ideas for transportation and other projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

One public service of particular interest is the provision of local public schools. Not only do public schools bulk large in the local property tax bill, but the inherent difficulty in measuring school quality has potentially undermined earlier attempts at achieving unbiased estimates of property tax capitalization. This particular problem has been of special concern since Oates' (1969) seminal paper. We sidestep the problem of omitted or misspecified measures of school quality by focusing on a segment of the housing market that likely places little-to-no value on school quality: small homes. Because few households residing in small homes have public school children, we anticipate that variations in their value do not account for differentials in public school quality. Using restricted-access microdata provided by the U.S. Census, and a quasi-experimental identification strategy, we estimate that local property taxes are nearly fully capitalized into the prices of small homes.

It also looks into the studies summarizing the developments in EU migration that show the restrained manoeuvring space the Commission has in the policy areas. Building on these, the discursive techniques that are likely to be used in Commission articulations are conceptualized. The analysis of Commission documents shows that in the common visa policy and the common European asylum system (CEAS), the Commission has configured borders indirectly. In distinction, in the fields of intra-Community border controls and movement for work purposes of highly skilled third country nationals (TCNs), the Commission has managed to play a leadership role and to significantly and directly challenge the underlying logic upon which these policies are based.","[Kostadinova, Valentina] Univ Buckingham, Buckingham MK18 1EG, England",University of Buckingham,"Kostadinova, V (通讯作者)，Univ Buckingham, Dept Econ & Int Studies, Hunter St Campus, Buckingham MK18 1EG, England.",valentina.kostadinova@buckingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,81,7,7,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In addition, treatment effects may be heterogeneous across agents. The former gives rise to duration dependence of the treatment effect, whereas unobserved heterogeneity gives rise to spurious duration dependence of the observable hazard rate. We develop a model allowing for duration dependence and unobserved heterogeneity in the treatment effect. The model incorporates a Timing of Events model and allows for selectivity on unobservables. We prove identification, exploiting variation in the timing of treatment and outcome. In the application we analyze the effects of the Swedish vocational employment training program on the individual transition rate from unemployment to work. We demonstrate the appropriateness of the approach by studying the enrollment process. The data cover the population and include multiple unemployment spells for many individuals. The results indicate a large, significantly positive effect on exit to work shortly after exiting the program. The effect at the individual level diminishes after some weeks. When taking account of the time spent in the program, the effect on the mean unemployment duration is small.

These dimensions of the default problem have, to our knowledge, not previously been considered altogether within the same investigation framework. We rely on a sample of individual mortgage loans for 20 counties in Florida, over the period 2001 through 2008, third quarter, with housing price performance obtained from repeat sales analysis of individual transactions. The results from the analysis strongly confirm the significance of the borrower's put as an operative factor in default. At the same time, the results provide convincing evidence that the experience in Florida is in part driven by lenders and purchasers exhibiting euphoric behavior such that in markets with higher price appreciation there is a willingness to accept recent prior performance as an indicator of future risk. This connection illustrates a familiar moral hazard in the housing market due to the limited information about future prices.","[Archer, Wayne R.] Wachovia Fellow Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Gainesville, FL USA; [Smith, Brent C.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Snead Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University,"Smith, BC (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Snead Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",wayne.archer@cba.ufl.edu; bcsmith@vcu.edu,"Smith, Brent/AAJ-5789-2020",,,,,,14,14,18,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The paradox of a negative relation between natural wealth and growth was elaborated, before Humboldt,by Hume. Humboldt's account of the high degree of income inequality in Mexico caught Malthus's attention, who turned it into a key element of his anti-Ricardo view that the fertility of soil may be associated with poor growth if there is a lack of effective demand. Cairnes claimed that the structural impact of a natural resource boom on the rest of the economy is compatible with the comparative-advantage framework. J.S. Mill articulated the potential perverse effects of natural wealth on effort supply and weak institutions, a theme conspicuous in the modem literature about the natural resource curse.","Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Boianovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, CP4302, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",boianovs@unb.br,,,,,,,74,18,19,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Yet, (external) institutions for enforcing cooperation are hampered by national sovereignty, supposedly strengthening the role of self-enforcing mechanisms. This paper examines their scope with a focus on contingent protection aka tit-for-tat in trade policy. Highlighting various strategies in a partial equilibrium framework, we show that retaliation of non-cooperative behaviour by limiting market access works as a disciplining device quite independently of supply and demand parameters. Our empirical findings are consistent with the theoretical results in that countries more frequently involved in WTO-mediated disputes entailing tit-for-tat strategies pursue on average more liberal trade regimes.","[Dluhosch, Barbara; Horgos, Daniel] Helmut Schmidt Univ Univ FAF Hamburg, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany",,"Dluhosch, B (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ Univ FAF Hamburg, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany.",,,"Dluhosch, Barbara/0000-0003-3419-0415",,,,,68,5,5,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2013,36.0,2,,,,,155.0,179,,10.1111/twec.12012,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,090KI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314977600002,0

The data set consists of questionnaire responses from random samples of residents of Sweden's three largest urban areas. A theoretically supported, one-factor second-order measurement model with three separate constructs received empirical support in analyses of satisfaction with daily travel in general, satisfaction with the commute to work, and satisfaction with the commute from work in the different urban areas and with different travel modes. On the three first-order factors, high loadings were as expected obtained on scales involving cognitive evaluations (e.g. low vs. high standard) and affective evaluations with respect to positive deactivation (e.g. relaxed vs. stressed) and positive activation (e.g. alert vs. tired). Satisfaction with daily travel in general differed significantly in the largest urban area from the medium-large urban area and the smallest urban area. The results also revealed that commuters travelling by bicycle or on foot are more satisfied with their work commute than people using other travel modes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

During this downturn, the number of real estate foreclosures has risen drastically. Recent studies have demonstrated a reduction in property values due to neighboring foreclosures-known as the foreclosure contagion effect. This study uses an agent-based modeling approach to explore market-wide emergent behavior that results from the interconnected property-agent behavior. Specifically, we find that the magnitude of the foreclosure contagion effect is a less powerful cause of eventual market collapse than the time a foreclosed property is allowed to linger on the market. This is important because disposition time is much easier to address from a policymaker perspective than is the strength of the foreclosure contagion effect.","[Gangel, Marshall; Seiler, Michael J.; Collins, Andrew] Old Dominion Univ, VMASC, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Seiler, MJ (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, VMASC, 2154 Constant Hall, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",mgang002@odu.edu; mseiler@odu.edu; ajcollin@odu.edu,,"Collins, Andrew/0000-0002-8012-2272; Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,20,34,41,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

A latent class analysis was performed to identify car type classes followed by a path analysis to investigate the determinants of the purchased car type class and the influence on the purchased car's level of carbon dioxide emissions. The results revealed that car type class is the strongest determinant of the car's level of CO2 emissions. Socio-demographic factors have little impact on choice of car type class when psychological factors are controlled for. Intention to purchase an environmentally friendly car has a direct effect on the car's CO2 emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

While the extension and deepening of debt has been underpinned by policies and discourses that assume the formal equality of individuals, the attempt to erase the gendered subject in the context of ongoing inequalities in paid labour markets, in asset ownership and in the division of unpaid labour has served to reproduce various overlapping social divisions and inequalities. In linking social reproduction to financial markets, the promotion of homeownership in the US has also rendered the social reproduction of present and future generations increasingly insecure. This work contributes to feminist and other critical IPE debates by highlighting the ways in which accumulation in financial markets has been based on the perpetuation of divisions and inequalities between social classes, between men and women and along certain racial and ethnic lines. It also centralises the role of the state in conditioning these processes.","Queens Univ, Dept Polit Studies, Kingston, ON MK7L3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Roberts, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Polit Studies, Kingston, ON MK7L3N6, Canada.",adrienne.roberts@queensu.ca,,,,,,,81,116,129,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The data from a randomized controlled trial in Cote d'Ivoire showed statistically insignificant effects of the consumption of iron-fortified biscuits on children's malaria parasite loads. Second, nutrient intakes data from Zambia showed insignificant correlations and associations between children's iron and folate intakes and malaria parasite loads. Third, malaria parasite loads did not change significantly for Tanzanian children receiving anthelmintic treatment: malaria loads were lower for older children and for those using bed nets. Overall, the evidence from sub-Saharan African countries suggests that small improvements in iron status achieved via suitable food policies are unlikely to have detrimental effects for children's malaria parasite loads.

One approach to modeling technology is learning or experience curves, which originated in techniques used to estimate cost functions in manufacturing. These have recently been introduced in policy models of energy and climate-change economics to make the process of technological change endogenous that is, allow technologies to vary with economic conditions. It is not widely appreciated that using learning in modeling raises major potential problems. The present note has three points. First, it shows that there is a fundamental statistical identification problem in trying to separate learning from exogenous technological change and that the estimated learning coefficient will generally be biased upwards. Second, we present two empirical tests that illustrate the potential bias in practice and show that learning parameters are not robust to alternative specifications. Finally, we show that an overestimate of the learning coefficient will provide incorrect estimates of the total marginal cost of output and will therefore bias optimization models to tilt toward technologies that are incorrectly specified as having high learning coefficients.","Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Nordhaus, WD (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",william.nordhaus@yale.edu,,,,,,,41,74,79,0,45,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,35.0,1,,,,,1.0,13,,10.5547/01956574.35.1.1,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,267KZ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328097900001,0

We find that prices of vegetables, processed foods, whole milk and whole grains are significantly associated with blood cholesterol levels.

Firstly, government should retain one-child policy in order to lower population, and improve old-age insurance system to mitigate social conflict caused by aging. Secondly, government should improve the ratio of education budget, reform the system of existing education, construct the system of advanced education, set up a more reasonable and fair educational platform, in order to accumulate human capital which is suitable for economic development.

The number of parametric intervals and corresponding segments of the efficient frontier is not known a priori. In this paper, we analyze the structure of the efficient frontier under the assumptions of weakly correlated assets and no short sales constraints. By weakly correlated, we mean the off diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are small relative to the diagonal ones. We obtain an explicit approximate solution for the entire efficient frontier. The error in the approximation is the order of the norm squared of the off diagonal part of the covariance matrix. The assumption of weakly correlated assets is restrictive. However, the explicit approximation of the efficient asset holdings in the presence of bound constraints gives insight into the nature of the efficient frontier. We prove that the efficient frontier is traced out in a monotonic fashion whereby assets are reduced to zero and subsequently remain at zero in order of their expected returns and the number of parametric intervals is equal to the number of assets. This generalizes the results of Best and Hlouskova (Math Methods Oper Res 52:195-212, 2000).

Trip purpose and several other trip-level variables recorded by the cyclists, and the resulting trips were coded to a highly detailed bicycle network. The authors used the 1449 non-exercise, utilitarian trips to estimate a bicycle route choice model. The model used a choice set generation algorithm based on multiple permutations of path attributes and was formulated to account for overlapping route alternatives. The findings suggest that cyclists are sensitive to the effects of distance, turn frequency, slope, intersection control (e.g. presence or absence of traffic signals), and traffic volumes. In addition, cyclists appear to place relatively high value on off-street bike paths, enhanced neighborhood bikeways with traffic calming features (aka bicycle boulevards), and bridge facilities. Bike lanes more or less exactly offset the negative effects of adjacent traffic, but were no more or less attractive than a basic low traffic volume street. Finally, route preferences differ between commute and other utilitarian trips: cyclists were more sensitive to distance and less sensitive to other infrastructure characteristics for commute trips.

The combined use of the two could provide a competitive alternative for an integrated, green, and seamless service, yet relatively few studies have investigated the multimodal integration problems of the entire service chain from the perspective of users. Users' perceived inconvenience during travel can be regarded as a latent construct that describes an unobservable and immeasurable characteristic. Nevertheless, the traditional Likert method in an ordinal scale causes a misleading statistical inference. The Rasch model eliminates such bias generated by an ordinal scale through a logistic linear transformation, and it compares person parameters with item parameters, which are then subjected to a logarithmic transformation along a logit scale to clearly identify which service items' inconvenience cannot be easily overcome by certain users. This empirical study demonstrates that perceived inconveniences differ based on the users' sex, riding frequency, trip purpose, and environmental awareness. The differential item functioning analysis that was adopted in this study can identify the critical factors leading to the differences in perceived inconvenience. Our empirical results suggest that a male cyclist who is a commuter with a high monthly riding frequency and who is environmentally conscious has a better ability than their counterpart to overcome perceived inconveniences during travel using a bicycle-transit service. To effectively mitigate users' perceived inconvenience, the Rasch analytical results suggest that the improvement of the intra-transit system factors in the short term and the improvement of external environmental factors in the long term will be successful. The information herein proves useful for transportation planners and policy makers when considering the special travel needs of certain groups to create a user-friendly bicycle-transit travel environment that promotes its usage.

A simple economic model is introduced to motivate the identifying assumptions of the empirical analysis. A stable long-run relationship is found for both countries. In order to study the dynamic behaviour of the model, and to decompose unemployment and vacancy fluctuations, we identify three common stochastic trends. The empirical results suggest that there are some sources of hysteresis in unemployment in both countries. Transitory shocks are also identified to account for the short-run dynamics of the model.

However, because different types of benefits are monetised (e.g., travel time savings, preventing statistical fatalities, reliability, etc.) the question naturally arises as to whether they are consistent. That is, whether a dollar is a dollar as welfare economics requires, or whether spending money in one area carries a different disutility from spending money in another area. This would equate to a violation of fungibility, which is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution. The view that money is not fungible is explained in behavioural economics through theories of framing and mental accounting. This paper describes the results of a stated choice experiment designed to test the fungibility and consistency of monetary valuations in transport. From a nationally representative sample, we elicit direct values for the three pairwise trade-offs between travel time, travel cost, and safety. We then show that in the context of our analysis, any trade-offs inferred on the basis of other trade-offs, as is common practice (e.g. inferring a safety vs time trade-off on the basis of monetary valuations for time and safety), produces biased results, suggesting that the assumption of fungibility does not hold. Specifically, we find that time is valued more highly when valued directly by cost than when traded with safety, and the reverse is true for safety. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A case study of South Africa's African tourism market,TOURISM ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,tourism arrivals; tourism spending; African market; shopping tourism; tourism shopping; South Africa,TRADE,"Tourism to South Africa has increased consistently over the last 15 years and the country has become one of the most popular tourist destinations, not only in Africa, but also in the world. With 10 million tourists visiting South Africa, tourism has grown to become an important industry, contributing more than 8% to the country's gross domestic product (GDP); it has even surpassed earnings from gold exports as an important source of foreign exchange. A closer inspection of the arrivals statistics reveals that the majority (75%) of tourists are from Africa. In addition, 75% of all African tourists are from South Africa's neighbouring countries. However, most research on tourism to South Africa focuses on intercontinental arrivals. Among the reasons cited for the exclusion of African tourists is that these tourists visit South Africa for reasons other than tourism, such as shopping, business and study. This research addresses this shortcoming by analysing the trends in arrivals and spending by African tourists to South Africa. The paper sheds light on the reasons why African tourists travel to South Africa and shows the important role of South Africa as a wholesaler for Africa. It is postulated that the link between trade and tourism is much stronger for South Africa and its neighbours than is the case for other countries.","[Saayman, Andrea] North West Univ, Inst Tourism & Leisure Studies, ZA-2521 Potchefstroom, South Africa; North West Univ, Sch Econ, ZA-2521 Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa,"Saayman, A (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Inst Tourism & Leisure Studies, Potchefstroom Campus,Private Bag X6001, ZA-2521 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",melville.saayman@nwu.ac.za; andrea.saayman@nwu.ac.za,"; Saayman, Andrea/A-1603-2018","saayman, melville/0000-0001-9991-0140; Saayman, Andrea/0000-0002-9506-8141",,,,,27,27,27,2,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This may be due to the use of different data sets, conditioning variables, or methodologies: studies either use an individual fixed effects (FE) approach and/or an instrumental variable (IV) specification. Using one common dataset, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, and a common set of controls, this paper compares the different approaches (including using different types of IV's), discusses their appropriateness, and contrasts their findings. We show that, although the results differ depending on the approach, most estimates cannot be statistically distinguished from OLS, nor from each other. Examining the potential violations of key assumptions of the different approaches and comparing their point estimates, we conclude that fat mass is unlikely to be causally related to academic achievement in adolescence.

In our model, we categorize individuals by their smoking frequencies and intensities instead of relying on the widely used dichotomous measure of smoking. Using data of a nationally representative sample of adolescents, we use an endogenity corrected model with school-level fixed effects to obtain our estimates. Moving beyond the conventional definition of smoking to a definition that recognizes the complex nature of addiction by categorizing smoking into various stages and also by controlling for peer and family effects together, we learn that adolescents are not necessarily the most responsive to taxes. Influence from peers and family plays a more significant role in influencing adolescent smoking.","US FDA, Off Regulat Policy & Social Sci, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",US Food & Drug Administration (FDA),"Ali, MM (通讯作者)，US FDA, Off Regulat Policy & Social Sci, 5100 Paint Branch Pkwy, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",mir.ali@fda.hhs.gov,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,31,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The analysis applies models presented in earlier research and has the objective of assessing the relative importance of demographic versus risk factors in subprime mortgage lending decisions. Regression equations are estimated for census tracts and individual borrowers and include demographic variables and property risk measures. The results find race and ethnicity to be significant determinants of subprime lending in the borrower equations that include the full set of risk measures. Neighborhood educational levels are found to have an inverse and often significant association with subprime mortgage loans. Property risk measures present mixed results regarding their significance in subprime lending, suggesting that risk may have played less of a role in loan originations in 2006 than it did in earlier studies.","Western Connecticut State Univ, Danbury, CT 06810 USA",Connecticut State University System; Western Connecticut State University,"DeLoughy, ST (通讯作者)，Western Connecticut State Univ, 181 White St, Danbury, CT 06810 USA.",deloughys@wcsu.edu,,,,,,,15,1,5,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This pact-making and the maturity that both regime and opposition have so far exhibited are analyzed in terms of prospects for a peaceful mode of regime transformation that produces a democratic outcome.","[Hahn, Gordon M.] Ctr Strateg & Int Studies, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Hahn, Gordon M.] Monterey Inst Int Studies, Monterey Terrorism Res & Educ Program, Monterey, CA 93940 USA",Centre for Strategic & International Studies,"Hahn, GM (通讯作者)，Ctr Strateg & Int Studies, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",,"Hahn, Gordon/AAQ-7855-2021",,,,,,33,3,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

However, the available empirical literature for Germany defined the groups in consideration, immigrants and natives, by citizenship. This limits the explanatory power of the estimates since citizenship distinguishes foreigners and German nationals, but assigns naturalised immigrants (including the large group of ethnic Germans) to the latter group. Providing a more adequate definition based on the concept of origin we analyse the immigrant-native wage gap. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, we decompose the wage gap between native Germans, foreigners, and naturalised immigrants, and consider further subgroups in the analysis. In the literature, time of residence has been proven to be a relevant determinant of immigrants' wages. For the natives, time of residence is perfectly collinear with age, and unequal sets of variables have to be considered. We therefore suggest an extension of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition technique. Our results show a substantial gap in earnings for all immigrants' groups compared to natives. Discarding immigrants who completed education abroad reduces much of the immigrants' wage gap. Hence, educational attainment in Germany is an important component of economic integration of immigrants, and degrees obtained abroad are valued less.","[Aldashev, Alisher] Kazakh British Tech Univ Almaty, Int Sch Econ, Alma Ata 050000, Kazakhstan; [Gernandt, Johannes] German Engn Federat VDMA, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany; [Thomsen, Stephan L.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Thomsen, Stephan L.] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Kazakh British Technical University; Leibniz University Hannover; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Aldashev, A (通讯作者)，Kazakh British Tech Univ Almaty, Int Sch Econ, Tole Bi Str 59, Alma Ata 050000, Kazakhstan.",a.aldashev@kbtu.kz; johannes.gernandt@vdma.org; thomsen@niw.de,"Aldashev, Alisher/AAE-2193-2022; Thomsen, Stephan/AAF-3588-2019; Aldashev, Alisher/AAC-2914-2020","Aldashev, Alisher/0000-0001-6413-3062; Thomsen, Stephan/0000-0002-9677-9199;",,,,,33,26,27,0,28,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

A matched group of beneficiaries and control farmers is determined using propensity score matching techniques to mitigate biases stemming from observed variables. In addition, possible self-selection arising from unobserved variables is addressed using a selectivity correction model for stochastic frontiers recently introduced by Greene (J Prod Anal 34:15-24, 2010). The results reveal that average TE is consistently higher for beneficiary farmers than the control group while the presence of selectivity bias cannot be rejected. TE ranges from 0.67 to 0.75 for beneficiaries and from 0.40 to 0.65 for the control depending on whether biases were controlled or not. The TE gap between beneficiaries and control farmers decreases by implementing the matching technique and the sample selection framework decreases this gap even further. The analysis also suggests that beneficiaries do not only exhibit higher TE but also higher frontier output.","[Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Talca, Dept Agr Econ, Talca, Chile; [Greene, William] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY USA; [Solis, Daniel] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Affairs & Policy, Miami, FL 33149 USA",University of Connecticut; Universidad de Talca; New York University; University of Miami,"Bravo-Ureta, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA.",boris.bravoureta@uconn.edu,"Solis, Daniel/B-1031-2009","Solis, Daniel/0000-0002-7322-7201",,,,,45,87,97,1,26,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The policies addressed are higher fuel taxes, tighter vehicle efficiency standards, and financial subsidies and penalties for the purchase of high- and low-efficiency vehicles (feebates). I find that tightening fuel-efficiency standards beyond those currently mandated through 2016, or imposing feebates designed to accomplish similar changes, can achieve by 2030 reductions in energy use by all light-duty passenger vehicles of 7.1-8.4%. A stronger feebate policy has somewhat greater effects, but at a significantly higher unit cost. High fuel taxes, on the order of $2.00 per gallon (2007$), have somewhat greater effects, arguably more favorable cost-effectiveness ratios, and produce their effects much more quickly because they affect the usage rate of both new and used vehicles. Policy costs vary greatly with assumptions about the reason for the apparent myopia commonly observed in consumer demand for fuel efficiency, and with the inclusion or exclusion of ancillary costs of congestion, local air pollution, and accidents.

This is necessary as long as the fund guarantees basic benefits, irrespective of the contractual form of service provision. In this context externalities arise which may not be internalized by the partner of a selective contract. We look at externalities in the context of a collectively financed fund where insurers and health care providers can contract forms of managed care that need an adjustment scheme. We show that in a first-best static world, unique reimbursement schemes between collective and selective contracts are appropriate. From a dynamic perspective problems of externalities between collective and selective contracts increase due to the requirement of an enduring commitment scheme between the health care providers and the cost-payers. But some simple form of cost-sharing ideas in which the patient is also involved can help to achieve a pareto-optimal equilibrium. This commitment strategy will be easier to organise if the selective contract is connected with a process innovation. Altogether, the dynamic commitment strategy may only work if health care providers as well as cost-payers compete actively.","[Zerth, Juergen] Diakonie Neuendettelsau, Int Dialog Coll, D-91564 Neuendettelsau, Germany; [Zerth, Juergen] Diakonie Neuendettelsau, Res Inst Furth IDC, D-91564 Neuendettelsau, Germany; [Zerth, Juergen] Univ Bayreuth, Forsch Stelle Sozialrecht & Gesundheitsokon, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Daum, Stefanie] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lehrstuhl Wirtschaftspolit, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Bayreuth; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Zerth, J (通讯作者)，Diakonie Neuendettelsau, Int Dialog Coll, D-91564 Neuendettelsau, Germany.",juergen.zerth@diakonieneuendettelsau.de; stefanie.daum@wiso.uni-erlangen.de,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,6,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Since various kinds of events including floods, heavy snowfall, storms and wildfires can cause such spatially spread degradations, the analysis method is an important complement to the existing studies of single link failures. The methodology involves covering the study area with grids of uniformly shaped and sized cells, where each cell represents the extent of an event disrupting any intersecting links. We apply the approach to the Swedish road network using travel demand and network data from the Swedish national transport modelling system Sampers. The study shows that the impacts of area-covering disruptions are largely determined by the level of internal, outbound and inbound travel demand of the affected area itself. This is unlike single link failures, where the link flow and the redundancy in the surrounding network determine the impacts. As a result, the vulnerability to spatially spread events shows a markedly different geographical distribution. These findings, which should be universal for most road networks of similar scale, are important in the planning process of resource allocation for mitigation and recovery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This article reviews the indicators proposed in the literature and assesses the quality of these indicators. Furthermore, a multi-linear fit of the indicators is made to find a better, combined, indicator to rank the links according to their vulnerability. The article shows that different indicators asses different links to be vulnerable. Also combined they cannot predict the vulnerability of a link.

With regard to establishing a viable market for this service, this paper explores how the educational externality could be internalized by focusing on educational dairy farms in Japan. The author evaluates quantitatively the attitudes of operators towards establishing a viable service, as revealed by a questionnaire survey. First, a conceptual framework was devised to express their orientation towards an economically viable service by incorporating a stepwise internalization process of positive externalities with the help of a social learning network. Then, empirically, statistical tests were conducted and factors that determined this orientation, a viable service determinant function, were explored by means of the ordered logit model. The results show that, first, the higher the number of visitors to the farm the more operators are oriented towards a viable service, while no connection with ordinary dairy production is demonstrated. Second, social learning is effective for initiating the internalization process. Third, marketing skills become more important for upgrading the internalization level. Consequently, it is important to create opportunities for those farmers who want to provide consumers with educational services to learn a new role for agriculture and to establish a new income source.","Chiba Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Matsudo, Chiba 2718510, Japan",Chiba University,"Ohe, Y (通讯作者)，Chiba Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, 648 Matsudo, Matsudo, Chiba 2718510, Japan.",yohe@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"Ohe, Yasuo/K-1096-2019",,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20248024] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,46,13,13,3,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The ongoing financial crisis has perfectly exemplified this point. Surprisingly, there are few studies exploring this issue for REITs. This study aims to close the knowledge gap. We conduct a comprehensive study by utilizing all three methodological categories to examine their forecasting performances of VaR and ES for nine major global REIT markets. Our findings indicate that there is no universally adequate method to model extreme risks across global markets. Also, estimating risks for the stock and REIT markets may require different methods. In addition, we compare the risk profiles between the stock and REIT markets, and find that the extreme risks for REITs are generally higher than those of stock markets. The fluctuations of risk levels are well synchronized between the two types of markets. The current crisis has significantly increased the extreme risk exposure for both REIT and stock investors. In all, our results have significant implications for REIT risk management, portfolio selection, and evaluation.","[Zhou, Jian] Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Anderson, Randy I.] Univ Cent Florida, Coll Business, Dr Phillips Sch Real Estate, Dept Finance, Orlando, FL 32789 USA",University of Guelph; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jian@uoguelph.ca; randy.anderson@bus.ucf.edu,,,,,,,27,36,38,2,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Over decades, the EU had pursued a policy of pragmatic engagement with autocratic regimes for stability in the region, to the detriment of democracy promotion. This article examines the EU's policy towards Belarus, often labelled the 'last dictatorship' in Europe, and demonstrates that the EU has not just pursued pragmatic politics in the MENA - it has also gradually moved from democracy promotion towards interest-based functional co-operation in its relations with the most 'reluctant democratizer' in eastern Europe. It is argued here that the case of Belarus and other states with autocratic leanings in eastern Europe are examples of an increasingly institutionalized pragmatic approach of the EU towards autocratic regimes, which is likely to dominate its policies in years to come - notwithstanding the recent events in the MENA.","Maastricht Univ, FASoS, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Bosse, G (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, FASoS, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",g.bosse@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Bosse, Giselle/0000-0002-3099-9412",,,,,72,22,24,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This generalized APLE takes into account exogenous variables directly and can be used to detect spatial dependence originating from either a spatial autoregressive (SAR), spatial error (SE) or SD process. However, that measure is not consistent. Secondly, by examining carefully the first order condition of the concentrated log likelihood of the SD (or SAR) model, whose first order approximation generates the APLE, we construct a moment equation quadratic in the autoregressive parameter that generalizes an original estimation approach in Ord (1975) and yields a closed-form consistent root estimator of the autoregressive parameter. With a specific moment equation constructed from an initial consistent estimator, the root estimator can be as efficient as the MLE under normality. Furthermore, when there is unknown heteroskedasticity in the disturbances, we derive a modified APLE and a root estimator which can be robust to unknown heteroskedasticity. The root estimators are computationally much simpler than the quasi-maximum likelihood estimators. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As a measure of the overall change in shareholder wealth created by a merger, the combined firm return plays a key role in differentiating competing merger theories and is quantified for the real estate industry for the first time. Findings from this study are consistent with the notion that real estate mergers occur because firms with superior management acquire other firms that possess unexploited opportunities to cut costs and increase earnings (the inefficient management hypothesis). Furthermore, the results indicate that real estate mergers generally create wealth, as shareholders at best realize modest gains and at worst break even.","Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Womack, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, 286 Brooks Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",kwomack@uga.edu,,"Womack, Kiplan/0000-0003-0917-1503",,,,,39,17,18,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The results suggest that REIT-stock correlations form three distinct periods. During the first period, ending in August 1991 with the start of the modern REIT era, correlations were high and without trend, never dipping below 59%. During the second period, ending in September 2001 with the inclusion of REITs in broad stock market indexes, correlations declined precipitously to 30%, enabling substantially higher portfolio allocations to both high-return asset classes and therefore higher portfolio returns without increasing portfolio volatility. During the third period, since September 2001, correlations increased steadily but only reached 59% in late 2008. A simple portfolio optimization suggests that asset managers would be willing to pay 20 basis points per year, plus the difference in transaction costs, for the ability to use DCC-GARCH modeling of dynamic correlations in place of rolling 24-month asset correlations.","[Case, Bradford] Natl Assoc Real Estate Investment Trusts, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Yang, Yawei; Yildirim, Yildiray] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,"Case, B (通讯作者)，Natl Assoc Real Estate Investment Trusts, 1875 I St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",bcase@nareit.com; yildiray@syr.edu,,,,,,,24,63,75,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We also estimate a probit model that indicates higher quality properties are more likely to sell and lower quality properties are less likely to sell.

Politicization, it is argued, is a direct consequence of the increasing authority of the EU. The executive response to reverse this trend, however, does not address its cause, but rather the intermediating factors in the form of political opportunity structure.

To characterize the behavior of a CGE model of carbon output with respect to two of these assumptions, we perform a large-scale Monte Carlo experiment to examine its sensitivity to base year calibration data and elasticity of substitution parameters in the absence of a policy change. By examining a variety of output variables at different levels of economic and geographic aggregation, we assess how these forms of uncertainty impact the conclusions that can be drawn from the model simulations. We find greater sensitivity to uncertainty in the elasticity of substitution parameters than to uncertainty in the base-year data as the projection period increases. While many model simulations were conducted to generate large output samples, we find that few are required to capture the mean model response of the variables tested.

The fieldwork study reveals how back office service work has been identified as suitable for ongoing reorganization and reconfiguration as firms respond to the pressures of contemporary capitalism. The article focuses on standardization as a means of facilitating organizational restructuring into shared service centres as highly skilled back office work is reframed as routine service work. Standardization is the vehicle that drives the commodification of the labour process as tasks are fragmented, quantified and traded in the global sourcing of services, allowing work to be lifted out of traditional organizational structures and placed elsewhere, or outsourced to other service providers.

They differ in terms of accuracy, coding and computing time. However for many macroeconomic applications the differences in accuracy do not matter, since all methods generate approximations with similar statistical properties of simulated time series. In the paper we check whether this is also the case for DSGE models with financial variables, like stocks and risk-free bonds. These models are usually highly nonlinear and some special methods should be applied to approximate the asset prices. In the paper we take a simple macro-finance DSGE model proposed by Jermann, solve it with three different group of methods, simulate and check if the simulated series of financial variables differ in terms of basic statistical moments. For solving the model we use the higher-order perturbation approaches, the loglinear-lognormal method, as well as the Galerkin projection method. The results show that there might be significant differences between moments of the financial series in models approximated using different methods. For example for moderate parametrization the expected risk premium in the model approximated by the Galerkin method is about half of percentage point higher than for the perturbation methods and the loglinear lognormal approach. These results clearly indicate that the further research on the solution methods of DSGE models with financial variables is needed.","[Acedanski, Jan] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat & Math Methods Econ, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,,jan.acedanski@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,2.0,7,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900001,0

Social capital is considered as a latent construct composed of a variety of indicators, such as blood donations, voter turnout, voluntary contributions to community well-being, and trust. To isolate exogenous variation in social capital, three historical variables are used as instruments: the fraction of foreigners, the number of schools and the fraction of Protestants in 1859. The historical information provides heterogeneity across municipalities in these three variables. In an application to Dutch municipalities the 2SLS estimates suggest that the exogenous component of social capital is significantly and negatively correlated with current crime rates, after controlling for a range of contemporaneous socio-economic indicators. Next, the robustness analysis shows why some social capital indicators are more useful than others in applied economic research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Regression analysis reveals that the share of time spent in the commercial rural nonfarm economy was larger in districts with low agricultural potential, indicating that the rural poor are pushed into accessible but not necessarily very profitable nonfarm activities. This 'push' scenario is probably strengthened by the low commercialisation and unfinished institutional reforms in the agricultural sector. Only in a few land-rich districts and in a district with a famous resort was labour 'pulled' into a profitable rural nonfarm economy stimulated by agricultural development and other local 'motors' of growth.","[Atamanov, Aziz] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance, UNU MERIT, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands; [Van Den Berg, Marrit] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Wageningen University & Research,"Atamanov, A (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance, UNU MERIT, Keizer Karelpl 19, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands.",aziz.atamanov@maastrichtuniversity.nl; Marrit.vandenBerg@wur.nl,,"Van den Berg, Marrit/0000-0001-5369-8850",,,,,27,5,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,2,,,,,349.0,368,,10.1080/09668136.2011.642581,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,912DU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301775700007,0

In this paper, we examine this issue for the case of Spain, using time series data extending over the period 1850-2000. Overall, the external deficit does not seem to have worked as a constraint on the growth of the Spanish economy over the long run, unless some shorter and specific subperiods, such as 1940-1959 and 1959-1974.

Nowadays markets are changing as well as they ever did but today they are changing much more quickly than ever before. For companies it is necessary to stay flexible. Markets are more globalized but also more fragmented, life cycle of products shortens and quick copying of products is very common. A permanent flow of new and innovative ideas can still give a company a crucial competitive advantage. The main aim of this paper is to refer about quantitative questionnaire research among Czech business companies from spring 2012. This research focuses on the importance that Czech companies assign to innovations in relation to globalization of market in which they occur. It tries to find an answer to the question if Czech business companies assign more importance to innovations than companies in more local or more global markets. Within this research framework, this paper tries to describe some of the most significant current market changes.","[Blahus, Radek] Tomas Bata Univ, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,blahus@fame.utb.cz,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,259.0,271,,,,,,13,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700028,0

Using real estate data from a large suburb in the Washington D.C. area we first show that the whole distribution of marketing time shifts to the right when a hot housing market in 2003 is compared with a cold one in 2007. The shift, however, is not homogenous across the distribution: it is negligible at lower percentiles, very large at the median and much smaller at higher percentiles. Moreover, the shift in the distribution cannot be explained by changes in the characteristics of the units. We then compute (quality adjusted) time on the market distributions and hazard functions for each year during the period 1997 to 2007. We find that while there are no changes at the bottom of the (conditional) distribution over time, higher percentiles, such as the first quartile and the median, are notably more volatile. We also find that the distribution of marketing time is heterogeneous across property types and property location. The focus on the distribution of marketing time rather than solely on the mean or on the median provides a comprehensive description of the evolution of this asset's liquidity and may help homeowners and financial institutions to better grapple with liquidity risk.

In particular, we formulate an educated guess about the burden that the government and the taxpayer must bear when a bubble bursts, and its relationship with the extent of government intervention and the taxation system. We also evaluate the outcomes of possible alternatives or complementary regulatory policies. We model four different scenarios treating separately a tax on profits and a tax on private wealth and, for both of them, we specify two cases depending on whether the financial system is able to autonomously generate liquidity.

We then develop two-factor and multi-factor nonparametric models that allow time variation in risk exposure and risk premium, and nonlinearity in the return generating process. When we assume that risk exposure can be time-varying but risk premium is constant, the estimated premium for exchange rate risk is significant only for the most positive FEI-ranked portfolio and marginally significant for the most negative FEI-ranked portfolio. When we further assume that both risk exposure and risk premium can be time-varying, results suggest that exchange rate risk is significantly priced for all the FEI-ranked portfolios except the one with little exposure.","[Chung, Y.

The lead role of the US reflected its structural power in global finance and the influence of societal interests within the US concerned about the rapid growth of financial investment in agricultural derivatives markets over the past decade. Encouraged by market developments and deregulation in the United States, these investments represented a financialization of agriculture that was blamed for contributing for global food price volatility. In their push for tighter regulation, US domestic groups were able to boost their influence by allying with other domestic actors concerned about volatile energy prices and by linking their cause to the broader politics of financial reform in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

Furthermore, problems such as obesity, motor impairment, and chronic diseases entail high social costs, particularly when childhood health problems carry over into adulthood. This study examines intergenerational relationships between parent and child health based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), in particular the recently introduced Mother and Child Questionnaires. Using various health measures, including anthropometric measures, information on health disorders, and self-rated health measures, we find significant relationships between parental and child health during the first three years of life. Overall, our results suggest that when controlling for parental income, education, and family composition, parents with poor health are more likely to have children with poor health. However, there are significant differences between health measures and age groups. For some health measures, our results suggest an increasing health gradient by age. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There are two distinct issues related to the specification of these extended models. The first issue is what form the higher-order spatial econometric model takes, i.e. higher-order polynomials in the spatial weights matrices vs. higher-order spatial autoregressive processes. The second issue relates to the parameter space in such models and how this can affect the choice of model specification, estimation, and inference. We outline a procedure that is simple both mathematically and computationally for finding the stationary region for spatial econometric models with up to K weights matrices for higher-order spatial autoregressive processes. We also compare and contrast this approach with the parameter space for models that incorporate higher-order polynomials in the spatial weights matrices. Regardless of the model utilized in empirical practice, ignoring the relevant parameter region can lead to incorrect inferences regarding both the nature of the spatial autocorrelation process and the effects of changes in covariates on the dependent variable.

We study data from a promotional campaign of NH-Hoteles to study sample selection problems in a gift exchange field experiment. The promotion allowed guests to pay any non-negative amount for a stay in one of 36 hotels in Belgium and the Netherlands. We distinguish between involuntary participants, who booked prior to the announcement of the promotional campaign, and voluntary participants, who booked after the campaign was announced. The involuntary participants pay, on average, substantially more. This different behavior cannot be explained by differences in satisfaction or observed compositional differences between both groups. During the promotion we varied the posted price of a room that was communicated to the guests. Only the involuntary participants respond to this exogenous variation in the posted price. We argue that the promotional campaign mainly attracted individuals with relatively few prosocial reputational concerns, because they benefit most from a name-your-own-price scheme.

If all consensus ballots name the same option, it wins; otherwise, a randomly drawn fall-back ballot decides. If there is one potential consensus option that everyone prefers to the benchmark lottery which picks the favorite of a randomly drawn voter, then naming that option on all consensus ballots builds a very strong form of correlated equilibrium. Unlike common consensus procedures, ours is not biased toward the status quo and removes incentives to block consensus.

However, managerial practice shows that instead of crisp definition of order and delivery variations very often more flexible approach based upon control thresholds is utilized. Application of such thresholds provides sensitive instruments to evaluate conditional entropy of supplier-customer relations. General procedure consists of three basic steps - pre-processing of data with consistency checks in Java, calculation of histograms and empirical distribution functions conditioned by control thresholds applied, and finally, evaluation of conditional entropy, which are realized both by Mathematica modules. Illustrative results of supplier-customer system analysis with and without time and volume quantity variation thresholds from selected Czech SME are presented in detail.","[Hofman, Jiri; Lukas, Ladislav] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,hofman@kpm.zcu.cz; lukasl@kem.zcu.cz,"Lukas, Ladislav/B-5818-2016",,,,,,6,4,4,0,4,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,302.0,307,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900052,0

We wonder whether transmission of inputs into outputs in the innovation function depends on public policy incentives. These policies can affect firms' decisions both at the extensive and intensive margins and transmission could go to sales, employment or productivity. We match data from the Survey on Business Strategies and tax records from the corporate tax and we conduct several exercises trying to identify causal effects. The results show that public policies have some impact on the use of private funds and on the promotion of innovation in big firms but they do not either affect the propensity to innovate or modify the behavior of small firms. As a result, we propose to make a deep revision in the design of the system of fiscal incentives in order to allow small and medium firms benefiting more from it. Since the firm structure of the Spanish economy is dominated by small and medium firms any progress on R&D effectiveness will depend on the behavior of those companies.","[Labeaga Azcona, Jose Maria; Martinez-Ros, Ester] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Labeaga Azcona, Jose Maria; Martinez-Ros, Ester] Univ Carlos III, Getafe, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED); Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Azcona, JML (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",martinez@merit.unu.edu,"Ros, Ester Martinez/Q-5525-2018","Ros, Ester Martinez/0000-0003-0088-4611",,,,,23,1,1,0,12,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,966.0,+,,,,,,3,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500152,0

However, variations exist in how inclusion and play are constructed by early years practitioners within and across European countries and beyond (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD 2006). Such variations arise from social, cultural, political and historical landscapes specific to each country, but each country faces common challenges in terms of sharing professional expertise and making space for debates about 'inclusion' and 'play'.","[Mara, Elena Lucia] Univ Lucian Blaga Sibiu, Fac Law, Private Law & Educ Sci Dept, Sibiu 550324, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,,luciamara2002@yahoo.com,"Mara, Elena/AAR-4676-2020",,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,HONG KONG EDUCATION SOC,TSEUNG KWAN O,"FLAT 16E BLOCK 3 THE PINNACLE, 8 WANG HANG RD, TSEUNG KWAN O, NEW TERRITORIES 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-988-19750-3-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,226.0,230,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BET96,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318122400039,0

The article addresses this question by returning to eighteenth century scholarship on the relationship between English common law and commercial law. Specifically, I explore the fundamental challenge posed to common law by the regulation, through commercial law, of enslaved Africans as labouring 'things'. I show how key British scholars in the eighteenth century traditions of jurisprudence, moral philosophy and political economy struggled to address the radical unfreedom of the enslaved and the meaning of her/his radical emancipation. I explore how this Atlantic challenge was 'indigenised' to speak to the threat posed by enclosures in Britain, in particular, the possible destruction of the qualified unfreedoms and freedoms extant in the paternal social order upheld by common law. I explore how political economy traditions pre and post abolition and emancipation sought to deal with this challenge. And I conjecture on the significance of remembering the most radical process of commodifying labour - in Aime Cesaire's terms, thingification - for present day interpretations of the relationship between capitalism and freedom.","Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London E1 4PN, England",University of London,"Shilliam, R (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Mile End Rd, London E1 4PN, England.",r.shilliam@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,86,12,13,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Multi-agent systems consist of a significant number of cooperating elements, so called intelligent agents. A multi-agent financial market model and simulation is introduced. Intelligent agents follow technical and fundamental trading rules to determine their speculative investment positions. We consider direct interactions between speculators due to which they may decide to change their trading behaviour. For instance, if a technical trader meets a fundamental trader and they realize that fundamental trading has been more profitable than technical trading in the recent past, the probability that the technical trader switches to fundamental trading rules is relatively high.

This condition certainly contributes to the degree of resilience and vulnerability of the society. This paper argues that in order to establish the capacity of society to bounce back from such disasters, the government and other humanitarian agencies should engage in economic sustainability on the rehabilitation programme in the aftermath of such disasters. There are six indicators which can be used to measure the integration of sustainable development in these types of rehabilitation programmes: (1) Empowerment of local economy to raise society's collective income (2) Capacity building for society in order to achieve efficiency of economic activity (3) Active participation of society toward economic activity (4) Improvement of civil society to empower social cohesion (5) Economic activity based on environment awareness and (6) Improving environmental sustainability. Through such economic sustainability programmes, the government could better guarantee the social protection for society. The United Nations Research Institute for Social Development defines social protection as a way of preventing, managing, and overcoming situations that adversely affect people's well being. This definition covers policies and programs which intended to eliminate poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor markets, diminishing people's exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to manage the economic and social risks, such as unemployment, exclusion, sickness, disability and old age. This paper will elaborate on three things: (1) the concept of economic sustainability and social protection (2) the elaboration of microeconomic programmes in the aftermath of the Mount Merapi Volcanic Eruption in 2010 and (3) the extent this programme can contribute as a means towards social protection.","[Srikandini, Annisa Gita] Univ Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University,,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,8,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,595.0,606,,,,,,12,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600051,0

This paper explores how the Chinese state rescales to implement this going-out strategy and produce new spaces of development. Particularly, this paper examines how the Chinese state reconfigures its institutional ensemble to integrate landlocked Yunnan Province into the transnational economy embodied in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). The paper finds that the Chinese state deploys two spatial strategies - upward coordination with international organizations and GMS national governments, and downward implementation throughout Yunnan Province - to establish an interscalar regulatory regime. Through this regime the Chinese state aims to assemble capital, labor, and political clout to expand Chinese capital and labor in the GMS, and to develop Yunnan's economy to ease uneven domestic geographical development. This paper contributes to the booming literature on the political-economic restructuring of national states and to the limited scholarship on the institutional arrangement for cross-border regions in a non-Western context. It also sheds light on how the rescaling of the Chinese state potentially shapes the international political economy.","Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Su, XB (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",,,,,,,,63,54,62,1,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Drawing on panel data for 40 major pharmaceutical firms, we find that positive effects of direct university collaboration are restricted to firms with sufficient absorptive capacity to assimilate scientific knowledge. Firms lacking such capacity instead benefit from 'indirect' ties with universities (collaboration with university-centred dedicated biotech firms) while direct university collaboration only undermines the benefits of their inter-firm research alliances.","[Victor, Gilsing] Ctr Innovat Res, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Rene, Belderbos; Shinya, Suzuki] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Victor, G (通讯作者)，Ctr Innovat Res, Tilburg, Netherlands.",v.a.gilsing@tilburguniversity.edu; Rene.Belderbos@econ.kuleuven.be; Shinya.Suzuki@econ.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,89,0,0,0,29,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,117.0,+,,,,,,6,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500019,0

Furthermore, this study analyzes the trend of small and medium enterprises in employment generation and value added. The secondary data have been employed. Headcount index and SMEs' employment data have been interpolated because of non-availability of some data. The simple multiple regression model was employed to analyze the data. Heteroskedasticity and serial correlation problems were detected by using Eviews option. The finding clearly shows that there is positive relationship between economic growth and SMEs but, impact of SMEs on economic growth is not significant in Sri. Lanka. Even though the co-efficient of SMEs is 0.02 indicating that there is positive relationship between economic growth and SMEs, the impact of SMEs on economic growth is statistically insignificant. Another finding is that there is vast number of industrial establishments of SMEs in total establishments which do not significantly contribute to the employment generation and value added in Sri Lanka. Therefore, active private public participation (PPP) is needed to accelerate the growth and improvement of SMEs and thereby, its contribution to the economy can be enhanced.

This framework is used to develop a set of equations that, in historical perspective, combine traditional concepts about the dynamics of economic systems and about the effects of random economic disturbances. This set of equations provides relationships among well-known ideas in general macroeconomics and provides a means to interrelate and examine ideas about stabilization policies. In this study, linear-control analysis is applied as an aid in understanding the fluctuations of business cycles in the past, and to examine monetary policies that might improve stabilization. The analysis shows how different policies change the frequency and damping of the economic system dynamics, and how they modify the amplitude of the fluctuations that are caused by random disturbances. Examples are used to show how policy feedbacks and policy lags can be incorporated, and how different monetary strategies for stabilization can be analytically compared. Representative numerical results are used to illustrate the main points.","[Davis, Ronald E.] San Jose State Univ, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Wingrove, Rodney C.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA",California State University System; San Jose State University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center,"Davis, RE (通讯作者)，San Jose State Univ, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.",Ronald.Davis@sjsu.edu,,,,,,,30,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The consequences of this effect have been confirmed in several experiments and its robustness is largely undisputed. The effect's causes, however, have not been thoroughly examined with regard to one important aspect. Due to the construction of the lotteries that were used in the experiments, none of the studies is able to distinguish between MLA and an explanation based on (myopic) loss probability aversion (MLPA). This distinction is important, however, in discussion of the practical relevance and the generalizability of the phenomenon. We designed an experiment that is able to disentangle lottery attractiveness and loss probabilities. Our analysis reveals that mere loss probabilities are not as important in this dynamic context as previous findings in other domains suggest. The results favor the MLA over the MLPA explanation.","[Zeisberger, Stefan; Langer, Thomas] Univ Munster, Finance Ctr Munster, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Weber, Martin] Univ Mannheim, Dept Banking & Finance, Mannheim, Germany",University of Munster; University of Mannheim,"Langer, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Finance Ctr Munster, Univ Str 14-16, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",thomas.langer@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,"Zeisberger, Stefan/AAM-7569-2020; Weber, Martin/JLL-7207-2023; Weber, Martin/GPW-6095-2022","Zeisberger, Stefan/0000-0002-8412-622X;",,,,,29,7,9,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2012,72.0,1,,,,,35.0,50,,10.1007/s11238-010-9236-1,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,852LA,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297358200003,0

Most researches have focused on the determination of a proper price for city parking spaces that are open to the public and it is now evident that price is used by authorities as a tool to manage transport demand. However, studies of parking pricing that pertain to privately-owned parking resources are few and in particular, the problem of setting a proper price for physical market parking has rarely been studied, such as a mall's 'dual-pricing portfolio' decision for the simultaneous determination of a parking fee and the consumer spending required for free parking (i.e., the 'threshold'). This is a common problem for most malls, but the different agents involved (e.g., the visitors, the mall, the marketplace and the parking lot departments) usually have diverse goals, so the decision must take account of a multiplicity of criteria and subtle relationships. In order to systematically support this type of interdepartmental decision process, a decision model that includes an analytical decision-aid process and the relevant programming models is established. A numerical example verifies the proposed model by taking the data for a mall in Taiwan and the implications, in terms of management, are given. This systematic computational model can be generalized to any type of commercial market that requires a (new) parking pricing policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas the existing literature assumes that states tend to exploit forum-shopping opportunities to pursue their parochial interests, we show that multiple members of several overlapping institutions operate in a setting of 'nested games'. They have a general interest in some form of institutional complementarity within the complex and therefore take the implications for overlapping institutions into account when determining their behavior within either of these institutions. On that basis, we show first that the multiple members are likely to induce complementary processes of institutional adaptation, even if their interests diverge with regard to the specific form of institutional rearrangement; second, that a balanced distribution of power among the advocates of different institutions may be expected to produce particularly sophisticated forms of institutional adaptation that do not simply separate the domains of overlapping institutions, but establish patterns of permanent co-governance; and third that state-induced processes of institutional adaptation gradually produce a spontaneously emerging division of labor among overlapping institutions that organizes their governance activities. These theoretical claims are probed by two case studies on institutional complexes that are characterized by sharp distributional conflicts among the multiple members: First, we demonstrate the emergence of a sophisticated division of labor in the institutional complex on international trade in agricultural GMOs. Second, we show that an equally sophisticated division of labor has emerged in the institutional complex on public health-related intellectual property rights.","[Gehring, Thomas] Univ Bamberg, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany; [Faude, Benjamin] Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Res Unit Global Governance, D-10785 Berlin, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Gehring, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",thomas.gehring@uni-bamberg.de; faude@wzb.eu,,,,,,,111,120,131,2,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

This action had the potential to impact housing transactions for every existing homeowner, regardless of age, as well as future purchasers of housing. We analyze household-level data to determine if the repeated ability to exclude periodic recognized capital gains on housing from taxation shortened housing tenure significantly after TRA97 became effective. We next consider whether the decline was heterogeneous across age groups, across trading up and trading down and across geography. Given that the impact of TRA97 appears at first glance to be most profound for taxpayers close to 55 years of age, a somewhat surprising result of our research is that significant decreases in tenure are pervasive, appearing in all age ranges and in samples of homeowners who trade up and who trade down. Finally, we provide additional evidence at the aggregate level that TRA97 led to measurable changes in the price elasticity of housing turnover in the four geographic regions defined by the U.S. Census Bureau (Northeast, Midwest, South and West) and in states that are home to large metropolitan housing markets.","[Heuson, Andrea J.] Univ Miami, Dept Finance, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Painter, Gary] Univ So Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Miami; University of Southern California,"Heuson, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Finance, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",aheuson@miami.edu; gpainter@usc.edu,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2014,42.0,4,,,,,869.0,899,,10.1111/1540-6229.12053,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,AU5FK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345632400003,0

We study the problem of distributing a resource through a network from sources endowed with the resource to citizens with claims. A link between a source and a citizen depicts the possibility of a transfer from the source to the citizen. Given the endowments at each source, the claims of citizens, and the network, the question is how to allocate the available resources among the citizens. We consider a simple allocation problem that is free of network constraints, where the total amount can be freely distributed. The simple allocation problem is a claims problem where the total amount of claims is greater than what is available. We focus on resource monotonic and anonymous bilateral principles satisfying a regularity condition and extend these principles to allocation rules on networks. We require the extension to preserve the essence of the bilateral principle for each pair of citizens in the network. We call this condition pairwise robustness with respect to the bilateral principle. We provide an algorithm and show that each bilateral principle has a unique extension which is pairwise robust (Theorem 1). Next, we consider a Rawlsian criteria of distributive justice and show that there is a unique Rawls fair rule that equals the extension given by the algorithm (Theorem 2). Pairwise robustness and Rawlsian fairness are two sides of the same coin, the former being a pairwise and the latter a global requirement on the allocation given by a rule. We also show as a corollary that any parametric principle can be extended to an allocation rule (Corollary 1). Finally, we give applications of the algorithm for the egalitarian, the proportional, and the contested garment bilateral principles (Example 1).","[Ilkilic, Rahmi] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Kayi, Cagatay] Univ Rosario, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Universidad del Rosario,"Ilkiliç, R (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",rahmi.ilkilic@bilkent.edu.tr,"Ilkilic, Rahmi/I-6230-2016; Kayi, Cagatay/G-6442-2016; Kayı, Çağatay/O-7499-2019","Ilkilic, Rahmi/0000-0002-7096-2737; Kayi, Cagatay/0000-0003-3831-7807; Kayı, Çağatay/0000-0003-3831-7807",,,,,32,5,6,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,DEC,2014,43.0,4,,,,,877.0,892,,10.1007/s00355-014-0815-x,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AU0UC,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345339100005,0

Considering the long-term symbiotic relationship of the national retail trade and international inbound tourism, the crisis, which has affected each segment of the national economy, has also influenced both the characteristics of tourist shopping and the structure and volume of retail trade, with an indirect impact on the country's GDP. The study investigates the purchases of day-trippers arriving from neighbouring countries and focuses on changes that occurred between 2006 and 2010. The survey is based on the assumption that the sending markets have become more price-sensitive as a consequence of the crisis, and the changes brought about will be diverse, depending on the economic and social processes of each sending country. Demand is influenced by crisis management strategies, by the price-value ratio of goods and services available in the market, and by the business practices of retail companies. Based on secondary analysis of the databases of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office and the Hungarian National Bank, the paper provides an overview of how Hungarian shopping tourism was shaped by the above factors in the period of crisis.","[Michalko, Gabor] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Astron & Earth Sci, Inst Geog, Budapest, Hungary; [Ratz, Tamara] Kodolanyi Janos Univ Appl Sci, Inst Tourism & Business Studies, H-8000 Szekesfehervar, Hungary; [Hinek, Matyas] Kodolanyi Janos Univ Appl Sci, Dept Management Sci, H-8000 Szekesfehervar, Hungary; [Tomori, Mihaly] Coll Nyiregyhaza, Inst Tourism & Geog, Nyiregyhaza, Hungary",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Research Centre for Astronomy & Earth Sciences,"Rátz, T (通讯作者)，Kodolanyi Janos Univ Appl Sci, Inst Tourism & Business Studies, Furdo U 1, H-8000 Szekesfehervar, Hungary.",michalko@iif.hu; tratz@kodolanyi.hu; hinekm@kodolanyi.hu; tomori@nyf.hu,"Hinek, Mátyás/JNT-1018-2023","Hinek, Mátyás/0000-0002-8838-2204; Ratz, Tamara/0000-0002-1500-6785",project 'Invisible Tourism Mobility in Hungary' [OTKA K100953],project 'Invisible Tourism Mobility in Hungary',The research was conducted within the 'OTKA K100953' project entitled 'Invisible Tourism Mobility in Hungary'.,,60,17,17,2,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The model incorporates nonlinear effects, eventually heterogeneous across countries, for both income and time. We also handle serial correlation by using autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes. We find that country-specific time related factors weight more than income in driving the northern EU Environmental Kuznets. Overall, the countries differ more on their carbon-time relation than on the carbon-income relation which is in almost all cases monotonic positive.

In this paper, we propose an agent-based model (ABM) aiming at modelling the deployment of these vehicles. ABM is particularly indicated when modelling complex systems whose final results are the combination of the interactions between individuals and their environment and when the agents have partial information to take their decisions. We selected Luxembourg and its French neighbouring region, Lorraine, as the case study for our model, to test Luxembourg's ambitious objective of deploying 40,000 electric vehicles by the year 2020. Model results show that the number of battery powered electric vehicles in Luxembourg (including vehicles from Lorraine's commuters crossing the border every day) could be between 2000 and 21,000. A high number of commercial vehicles in Luxembourg, as well as an unlikely deployment in the neighbouring Belgium and Germany would therefore be required to meet the deployment objective. However, the deployment of plug-in hybrid vehicles could reach 60,000 cars by the end of 2020. To achieve this number, the deployment of charging points seems to be the more effective policy, along with actions aiming at increasing public awareness and acceptance of electric vehicles. The interest in using the ABM also lies in the identification of the main individuals' characteristics affecting the deployment of electric vehicles (household size, commuting distances, etc.), which further support the setting of public policies.

The model generates social clustering around weight through two mechanisms: a causal link from others' weight to an individual's weight and the propensity to select peers based on weight. We simulated weight loss interventions and tried to identify intervention targets that maximized the spillover of weight loss from intervention participants to nonparticipants. Social multipliers increase with the number of intervention participants' friends. For example, when friend selection was based on a variable exogenous to weight, the weight lost among non-participants increased by 23% (14.3 lb vs. 11.6 lb) when targeting the most popular obese. Holding constant the number of participants' friends, multipliers increase with increased weight clustering due to selection, up to a point. For example, among the most popular obese, social multipliers when matching on a characteristic correlated with weight (1.189) were higher than when matching on the exogenous characteristic (1.168) and when matching on weight (1.180). Increased weight clustering also implies more obese friends of friends of participants, who reduce social multipliers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These are the most serious railway accidents to have occurred in the past decades and both involved collisions on a single track system. The two events have been analyzed and compared in order to investigate possible learning effects and possible differences in learning given the 25-year span between them. The study is based on the analysis of selected documents related to the accidents in general and the narrative components in the documentation related to learning in particular. Our findings indicate that learning from these events was not expressed as an explicit goal in the aftermath. Learning in these cases seems to be linked for a large part to a change in measures, technical, operational and organizational, but we have not observed any managed confirmation or comprehension processes. The Tretten accident report suggests that the possibility of human error should be mitigated through the implementation of technological barriers, while it omits all other elaborations and risk reducing measures. The Asta accident report recommended that the work to introduce modern safety management principles that had already been initiated before the accident should be continued. Neither of the accidents yielded any new insights and the knowledge brought forward was merely perceived as confirmation of already-agreed changes. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Applying spatial data from 2010 provided by a geographical information system (GIS) to a mode choice model estimated with sample travelers in this corridor, the present study examines whether and how the level-of-service of transport terminals spatially affects the competitiveness or modal distribution of HST and air transport in the provinces of Madrid and Barcelona; and, in particular, the degree of competitiveness that can be accrued by the access time provided by private car and transit in different market segments, especially mandatory and leisure trips. In a number of urban zones near train stations and airports, terminal accessibility clearly favors one transport mode in comparison to the other. Improving terminal accessibility via private car or public transit not only affects the relative access to terminals, but also represents a key strategy for readjusting the market shares of the competing modes in the corridor.

Paradoxically, all the indications are that the EU will demand that Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand liberalize financial services trade with the EU. This article asks whether the EU's policy undermines coherence between EU trade and development policies. It argues that the EU and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agree that financial services are crucial for development, but that they differ on the approach to liberalization: the EU advocates broad-ranging liberalization, whereas ASEAN countries favour a cautious approach, conditioned by their experience of the Asian financial crisis. In view of this divergence, the EU will have to rethink its approach to financial services trade liberalization in negotiations with ASEAN countries.","[Robles, Alfredo C., Jr.] De La Salle Univ, Manila 1004, Philippines; [Robles, Alfredo C., Jr.] Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",De La Salle University; Universiti Malaya,"Robles, AC (通讯作者)，De La Salle Univ, Int Studies Dept, 2401 Taft Ave, Manila 1004, Philippines.",roblesajr@yahoo.com,,,,,,,91,0,0,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

By exploiting the variation in the pace of agricultural decollectivization among the Chinese provinces during 1978-1984, we test the respective effects of weather shocks, the lasting impact of the Great Leap Famine, and public goods provision on the villages' institutional choice between collective and family farming. We find that bad weather at the time of decollectivization had the likely effect of strengthening the collectives, but that effect reverses in provinces that had experienced greater famine severity or had enjoyed better public goods provision.

Normative implications and appropriate social policy are discussed.","[Lambert, Peter J.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Subramanian, S.] Madras Inst Dev Studies, Chennai 600020, Tamil Nadu, India",University of Oregon,"Subramanian, S (通讯作者)，Madras Inst Dev Studies, 79 Second Main Rd, Chennai 600020, Tamil Nadu, India.",plambert@uoregon.edu; subbu@mids.ac.in,,,,,,,15,2,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2014,43.0,3,,,,,565.0,576,,10.1007/s00355-014-0794-y,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AO6WX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341494500003,0

However, Lange's article was not only an attempt to illuminate Keynes's main innovations but the first part of a wide project that included the development of a theory of economic evolution. This paper aims at showing that Lange's article can help in illuminating critical aspects of this project: in particular, Lange's idea that a synthesis between Kaldor's and Kalecki's theories and that of Schumpeter, might have been possible and that it represented (in intentions) a modern and consistent reconstruction of the Marxist theory of the business cycle. Section 2 clarifies Lange's early reflection on dynamics. Section 3 centres on Lange's 1938 static model and indicates the effects of a change of saving on investment. Section 4 suggests a dynamic reconstruction from which are addressed important arguments raised by Lange in a series of papers written between 1934 and 1942.","[Assous, Michael] Univ Paris, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Assous, Michael] Univ Paris 01, GREDEG CNRS, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Lampa, Roberto] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Lampa, Roberto] Univ Buenos Aires, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires,"Assous, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris, 106-108 Bd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",michael.assous@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,32,1,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

However, whether this applies to intra-cabinet EU decision-making is more difficult to analyze. Drawing on the agendas (1995-2012) of the Finnish ministerial EU Committee and on interviews with key civil servants, this article examines whether the interests of governing parties or bureaucratic procedures are more important in determining which EU policies are debated by the government and which in turn are decentralized to individual ministries. The analysis confirms the strong influence of both established administrative procedures and of a small elite of civil servants in setting the agenda of governmental EU policy formulation. The paper also shows that intra-cabinet co-ordination focuses on high politics issues, with individual EU laws seldom discussed by the government - a finding that raises important questions about the accountability of domestic EU co-ordination.","[Hyvarinen, Anna] Univ Turku, Fac Law, SF-20500 Turku, Finland; [Raunio, Tapio] Univ Tampere, Sch Management, Tampere 33014, Finland",University of Turku; Tampere University,"Raunio, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Sch Management Polit, Tampere 33014, Finland.",tapio.raunio@uta.fi,,,,,,,48,7,7,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In order to do this, it examines what were the operational implications of establishing the euro and shows that the opposite endeavour would not just be its symmetric counterpart. The paper also looks at two developments that took place after the launch of the euro - the emergence of very large Target2 balances during the crisis that started in 2010 and the move towards financial integration - showing that they would add to the formidable operational complications that would be created by the demise of the euro. The paper concludes that the logistical difficulties considered here only look minor in comparison with the fundamental reasons that led governments and central banks to fight with determination the risk of a demise of the euro. In absolute terms, they are important enough to tilt the balance of costs and benefits in the direction of preserving the eurozone.","[Papadia, Francesco] PCS, Redwood City, CA USA",,"Papadia, F (通讯作者)，Hansa Allee 7, D-60322 Frankfurt, Germany.",francesco.papadia@gmail.com,"Papadia, Francesco/K-1359-2019",,,,,,13,7,7,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Evidence for this proposition is based almost entirely on studies that compare the behavior of states that have and have not ratified treaties. This paper evaluates instances in which some member states temporarily experience increased entanglement with an IO because they or their nationals serve in a position of authority. Unlike selection into IOs, selection into positions of authority is often governed by a common, observable, and partially exogenous process. I exploit exogenous exit, random assignment to different term lengths, and competitive elections in three contexts: the International Criminal Court (ICC), the UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), and the UN Security Council (UNSC). The evidence implicates that acquiring a position of authority can make states more willing to reject U.S. advances to sign non-surrender agreements, adopt domestic legislation that changes the penal code (ICC case), ratify legally binding treaties (UNHRC case), and contribute to peacekeeping missions (UNSC case). On the other hand, there is no evidence that UN institutions successfully select more cooperative states for positions of authority. Similar research designs can gainfully be employed to identify the causal effects of other forms of institutional participation.","Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Voeten, E (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",ev42@georgetown.edu,,"Voeten, Erik/0000-0002-1002-3770",,,,,35,10,13,1,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Beijing is the first city in China to implement this policy. A one-day-a-week driving restriction scheme was expected to take 20% of cars off the road every week day. Using household survey and travel diary data, we analyze the short-term effect of this driving restriction policy on individual travel mode choice. The data also allow us to identify which demographic groups are more likely to break the restriction rule. The estimates reveal that the restriction policy in Beijing does not have significant influence on individuals' decisions to drive, as compared with the policy's influence on public transit. The rule-breaking behavior is constant and pervasive. We found that 47.8% of the regulated car owners didn't follow the restriction rules, and drove illegally to their destination places. On average, car owners who traveled during peak hours and/or for work trips, and whose destinations were farther away from the city center or subway stations, were more likely to break the driving restriction rules. Therefore, Beijing is probably in need of more comprehensive and palatable policy instruments (e.g., a combination of congestion tolls, parking fees, fuel taxes, and high-speed transit facilities) to effectively alleviate traffic congestion and air pollution.

First, we argue that while Veblen's views anticipated macroprudential arguments, they also obscured tensions between the technocratic acumen of policy engineers' and popular legitimacy. Second, we argue that while Galbraith's views similarly shaped the postwar Keynesian policy mix, they also echoed Veblen in underrating the potential for populist resentment of an intellectual technostructure'. We conclude that while this analysis can be seen as highlighting an overlooked century of macroprudential debate, it also demonstrates the potential for technocratic overconfidence - which can eventually undermine policy legitimacy and effectiveness.","[Baker, Andrew] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Studies & Philosophy, Belfast BT7 1PA, Antrim, North Ireland; [Widmaier, Wesley] Griffith Univ, CGPP GAI, Nathan, Qld 4102, Australia",Queens University Belfast; Griffith University,"Baker, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Studies & Philosophy, 21 Univ Sq, Belfast BT7 1PA, Antrim, North Ireland.",W.Widmaier@griffith.edu.au,,"Baker, Andrew/0000-0001-6677-930X; Widmaier, Wesley/0000-0003-2261-4479",,,,,63,15,17,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This article uses structural equation modelling and OLS regression techniques to analyse 2002 survey data drawn from a nationally representative sample of US employees in order to assess the pathways through which ICT use may influence levels of employee strain and distress. It is found that use is linked to higher levels of employee strain and distress via a work intensification process that is indicated by faster-paced work and greater levels of interruptions and multitasking. However, there is also evidence that both work and personal ICT use may mitigate these influences.

In line with the literature, we label as degree of openness the extent to which software start-ups mix open source (OS) and proprietary solutions in the portfolio of software products they offer. We relate the choice of the degree of openness to two key characteristics of the market segments in which software start-ups operate: the strength of the network externalities and the competitive advantage of the incumbent. Specifically, by modelling (price) competition between an incumbent and an entrant in two ways, i.e., the entrant is price-setter or price-taker, we derive the necessary condition(s) in terms of the strength of network externalities for observing the adoption of a business model that comprises the offering of both proprietary and OS solutions by the entrant (i.e., hybrid business model). Then, we highlight that, if a hybrid business model is the choice, the degree of openness chosen in equilibrium increases along with both the strength of the network externalities and the competitive advantage of the incumbent. This result holds indifferently whether the software start-up is modelled as a price-setter or a price-taker.

Using an exploratory factor analysis, we are able to distinguish between two dimensions of financial liberalization, namely the robustness of the markets and their freedom from direct government control. We find that a standard deviation improvement in the robustness of the source country financial sector magnifies the extent of skilled emigration by a factor of about 3.9-5.1 % points on the average.

This study investigates the role of compositional variation in unemployment duration using individual data on Finnish workers. The compositional effect is examined by predicting the impact of the observed unemployment inflow heterogeneity on aggregate re-employment rates. Focusing on a recession period provides useful variation for the analysis due to large increase in the unemployment inflow. According to the results, the aggregate outflow effect dominates and the observed compositional variation implies only a small increasing trend in the average duration during the recession period.","Social Insurance Inst Finland, Res Dept, Helsinki 00101, Finland",,"Verho, J (通讯作者)，Social Insurance Inst Finland, Res Dept, POB 450, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",jouko.verho@kela.fi,,,,,,,16,4,4,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The model includes four factors: access to other artists; access to consumer demand; access to service jobs; and housing affordability. These four factors are combined in a spatial equilibrium model. An equilibrium spatial distribution of artists is derived from the model and is correlated with the actual distribution among Swedish municipalities. Subsequently, the model is used for an econometric estimation of factor effects. The results show that access to other artists and local access to service jobs are important localization factors.

This paper exploits a unique and extremely rich vehicle-level dataset of all new vehicles registered in California in 2001-2003 and then subsequently given a smog check in 2005-2009, a period of steady economic growth but rapidly increasing gasoline prices after 2005. The primary empirical result is a medium-run estimate of the elasticity of vehicle-miles-traveled with respect to gasoline price for new vehicles of -0.22. There is evidence of considerable heterogeneity in this elasticity across buyer types, demographics, and geography. Surprisingly, the vehicle-level responsiveness is increasing with income, perhaps due to within-household switching of vehicles. The estimated elasticity has important implications for the effectiveness of price policies, such as increased gasoline taxes or a carbon policy, in reducing greenhouse gases. The heterogeneity in the elasticity underscores differing distributional and local air pollution benefits of policies that increase the price of gasoline. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It distinguishes between the uses of the term dynamic consistency in order to characterize two different properties: the first accounts for the neutrality of individual preferences towards the timing of resolution of uncertainty whereas the second guarantees that a strategy chosen at the beginning of a sequential decision problem is immune to any reevaluation and will effectively be implemented from then on in the decision problem. Although these two properties are equivalent under expected utility (EU), this is not the case under non-EU. Building on the possible characteristics of individual dynamic preferences under risk, this paper proposes a conceptual categorization, that is experimentally testable, of possible sequential decision making behaviors of non-EU maximizers.","[Nebout, A.] LAMETA CNRS, LAMETA UMR5474, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Nebout, A.] GREG HEC CNRS, UMR2959, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Nebout, A (通讯作者)，GREG HEC CNRS, UMR2959, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France.",nebout@greg-hec.com,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUN,2014,77.0,1,,,,,85.0,110,,10.1007/s11238-013-9387-y,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AI9FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337237000003,0

In addition, I compare and contrast spatial impulse response estimates over sub-periods. Results show that for the 1975 to 2011 period spatial diffusion of housing prices is statistically significant and persistent across states. This conclusion is robust to whether the model is estimated in levels or in first differences controlling for cointegration.

The objective of this paper is to analyse the influence of peer pressure on adolescent cigarette consumption. More concretely, we explore the significance and robustness of the peer effects using several estimation methods employed in the existing literature. On the basis of the data provided by the 2004 Spanish survey on drug use in the school population, we estimate the probability of being a smoker by two-stage models. The results reveal that when we use standard errors used in the literature the class peer variable appears to be significant. However, the class peer variable is not significant when we calculate more exigent standard errors, a result that is robust across all specifications. The paper suggests the need for a more cautious interpretation of the peer effects found previously in the literature until a deeper analysis confirms the robustness of the peer effects.","[Duarte, R.; Escario, J-J.; Molina, J-A.] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Molina, J-A.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Zaragoza; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Escario, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",rduarte@unizar.es; jescario@unizar.es; jamolina@unizar.es,"Duarte, Rosa/F-4239-2016; Escario Gracia, José-Julián/AAU-5111-2021; Molina, Jose Alberto/H-1676-2015","Escario Gracia, José-Julián/0000-0002-2940-6587; Molina, Jose Alberto/0000-0002-9437-4606",,,,,38,12,12,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Here, an in-depth investigation of cyclists' perceptions is attempted using a large university survey designed and collected ad hoc, and then applying exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. After identifying fourteen factors, a structural equations model was estimated to find structure and relationships among variables and to understand users' intentions to use the bike. Four (latent) variables are identified, namely convenience, pro-bike, physical determinants and exogenous restrictions. The main conclusion is that convenience (flexible, efficient) and exogenous restrictions (danger, vandalism, facilities) are the most important elements to understand the attitudes towards the bicycle.

Price variation decomposes into: (i) magnitude of price shocks; (ii) correlation of price shocks; (iii) between-period arbitrage. Data frequency affects these components, but has the largest effect on between-period arbitrage, commonly measured by half-life. Since this measure has been generally employed, previous analyses should be interpreted with caution. We further show that estimated effects of better transport and communication depend on the model used to measure market integration. Notably, we observe market integration improvements, not in between-period arbitrage, but in the within-week behaviour of prices (i.e. over much shorter time periods). So transport impacted English market integration, but in a way not captured by half-lives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

First, it presents the results of a history-friendly simulation model of evolution of the pharmaceutical industry. Second, it aims at contributing to a more general methodological discussion about agent-based models by proposing an econometric analysis of the results of the simulations. The case of the pharmaceutical industry has been studied extensively by scholars because, despite the high level of R&D intensity, the industry has been characterized by a relatively low levels of concentration. The model is able to reproduce the main stylized facts of the industry in an evolutionary perspective. In this paper we extend the analysis conducted in two previous works (Garavaglia et al. 2012, 2013) by further qualifying the findings with an extensive econometric investigation of the model outputs. The paper focuses the attention on the determinants of market structure, the innovative performance of the industry, the diversification in multiple submarkets and the level of prices. We find that the properties of the technological and demand regimes are key determinants of the patterns of industry evolution and that the main mechanisms driving the model are the random processes of search, the discovery of new submarkets as well as the interactions between patent protection, imitation and price competition. In addition, this paper emphasizes how the emerging leaders in the industry are those innovative early entrants which entered in large submarkets, showing the importance of the first mover advantage and of the size of the prize accruing to innovators when they discover a new rich submarket.","[Garavaglia, Christian] Univ Milano Bicocca, DEMS, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Garavaglia, Christian; Malerba, Franco; Orsenigo, Luigi; Pezzoni, Michele] Bocconi Univ, CRIOS, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Malerba, Franco] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Orsenigo, Luigi] IUSS Inst Adv Studies, Pavia, Italy; [Pezzoni, Michele] OST, Paris, France; [Pezzoni, Michele] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CEMI, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Milano-Bicocca; Bocconi University; Bocconi University; IUSS PAVIA; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Garavaglia, C (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, DEMS, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi 8,Bldg U7, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",christian.garavaglia@unimib.it; franco.malerba@unibocconi.it; luigi.orsenigo@iusspavia.it; michele.pezzoni@epfl.ch,,"Pezzoni, Michele/0000-0002-2255-8166",,,,,34,0,0,1,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Nonetheless, there has been little acknowledgement that OCA is the subject of very significant internal disagreement, to the extent that economists writing within the field do not commonly agree upon the ontological foundations of the theory. This entails that the translation of the theory into political reality has been characterised by a series of often mutually contradictory narratives, which build upon schisms in the academic corpus. The political realisation of this can be seen during the negotiations over the 1992 process, where certain aspects of the theory concerning governance (of fiscal policy and preferences for conflict adjudication) have been notably suppressed, capitalising upon the fundamental uncertainty in the theory itself. The final part of the paper goes on to consider the financial crisis, and how OCA theory might aid policy-makers' attempts to induce ex-post convergence, demonstrating the continued relevance of the theory.","Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Snaith, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",h.snaith@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,12,12,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Previous empirical research pointed out that weak export performance was due to (i) vigorous domestic demand, (ii) lower markups due to head-to-head competition with Germany, (iii) low non-price competitiveness of French export goods, (iv) offshoring of entire production processes (especially in the automobile sector), and (v) difficulties of French manufacturing firms to reach critical size for exporting. This paper adds an additional explanation to this list. We argue that resource reallocation from the exporting to the construction sector triggered by fast rising property prices hindered France to meet world export demand vis-a-vis its products. Our econometric analysis shows that the resource reallocation argument helps explain French export performance between the early 2000s and 2007, unexplained by traditional models. This result is confirmed for a set of OECD countries that experienced a marked decline in their export performance and sustained real estate boom after 2000.","[Egert, Balazs; Kierzenkowski, Rafal] OECD, Dept Econ, Paris, France; [Egert, Balazs] Univ Paris West, EconomiX, Paris, France; [Egert, Balazs] Nanterre La Def, Paris, France; [Egert, Balazs] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Ifo Institut,"Égert, B (通讯作者)，OECD, Dept Econ, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2014,37.0,3,,,,,387.0,409,,10.1111/twec.12122,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AD7LK,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333445200002,0

Using original survey data, PDR is operationalized via counterfactual simulations within a limited information discrete choice model. Augmenting individual opinions about one of the three policies at driving environmental outcomes, stakeholders can induce preference switching in favor of or in detriment to a specific policy. The three policies are summarized as: (1) ban; (2) tax; and (3) label. The resulting substitution patterns demonstrate that the extent of preference switching between policies depends on the relative change in individual opinions about a policy. Furthermore, different forms of PDR may be more effective at inducing preference switching in favor of or in detriment to a specific policy.","[Jeffords, Christopher] Eastern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Econ, Willimantic, CT 06226 USA; [Jeffords, Christopher] Indiana Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Indiana, PA 15705 USA",Connecticut State University System; Eastern Connecticut State University; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Indiana University of Pennsylvania,"Jeffords, C (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Indiana, PA 15705 USA.",cjeffords@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

High rates of death and injury coupled with reporting of poor infrastructure and fear of the behaviour of other road users point to a plausible prima facie concern that pedestrians and cyclists suffer inequalities. Yet this appearance masks uncertainty about what factors are relevant in judging inequality and how these should be treated against potentially competing claims. This article develops a framework assessing conditions for walking and cycling according to a theoretical conception of political and social equality, and so providing a basis on which to make arguments for change in transport policy, planning and law. In developing the framework we examine the relevance to equality of a range of factors, including measurement of road casualties, questions of responsibility to increase walking and cycling as means of contributing to pollution and carbon reduction, matters of fault and responsibility for road safety, and the economic impacts of improving conditions for walking and cycling.

As a possible solution to this problem, policy-makers and various observers have pushed increasingly for the adoption of market-based carbon financing strategies, with the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) representing the most consistent application of this approach to date. Nevertheless, market-based carbon finance remains highly volatile given its heavy dependence on conditions in the broader global carbon market which remains in the throes of a devastating crisis, earning carbon the distinction of 2011s worst performing global commodity. By demonstrating that it is through carbon's market price that finance-generating investment in the CDM is largely derived, and which also determines the ex post value of CDM projects, this paper argues for the decoupling of climate change finance from carbon's market value. The need to do so is particularly pressing since, it is argued, the current crisis in the global carbon market reflects an embedded crisis tendency in that market, born in part from the political machinations through which it was born and which leaves it prone to persisting crises of oversupply.","St Marys Univ, Halifax, NS B3L 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Ervine, K (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3L 3C3, Canada.",kate.ervine@smu.ca,,,,,,,137,11,13,2,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Ordinal regression was used to study the impact of highway externalities on residential satisfaction. Moreover, we gained first insights into the reactions of people on highway adjustment projects, by studying people's expectations towards residential satisfaction as a consequence of the project with use of a multinomial logistic regression analysis. On average, 85% of respondents reported being satisfied with living near a highway. Regarding explanatory characteristics, subjective evaluations of air and noise nuisance and of accessibility are of comparable importance and seem to outperform objective exposure calculations or distance from the highway or access lane in explaining residential satisfaction. Moreover highway interest is directly reflected in a higher satisfaction. However, other factors such as neighborhood design, traffic safety and social cohesion are important as well. People react differently to highway adjustment plans, negative expectations being highly driven by current negative feelings towards nuisance, and positive expectations by personal interest in accessibility and a positive attitude towards cars. An important implication could be the notion that exposure is not the same as perceived nuisance, which may give reason to be cautious when making transportation planning decisions based solely on calculations. In addition, the finding that other (neighborhood) factors are also very important in explaining residential satisfaction is interesting when thinking about compensating for the negative effects of a highway in the neighborhood. Also, the results regarding reactions to an announced highway adjustment project might be used to better adjust the planning process to the characteristics of the residents in the area. Further research is necessary to deepen the results, for example through the addition of other road project locations, interviews and longitudinal data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

According Porter [1] clusters are geographic concentrations of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field. Clusters support: economic growth, the increasing of competitiveness and performance of businesses, the developing of innovation, the creation of new businesses, attracting foreign investment, increasing exports and the employment. The grouping of economic subjects into clusters in regions can have a positive influence on the regional development and on the growth of competitiveness of the region. The topic of industrial clusters in the Slovak Republic in recent year has become the forefront of the professional and the expert public, government and local government. There were established more than 20 clusters which is in comparison with some EU countries very little. The formation process of a cluster has to start with identification of the economic branches that prevailing in the region. These industries form the basis for the following cluster creation and development. For identification of economic industries suitable for cluster creation in regions are used the quantitative and qualitative methods. Their application mostly depends on available data basis.

In doing so, there is an emphasised need for effective asset management in the public sector, particularly management the asset specific for the public sector. The necessary precondition for effective management the asset specific for the public sector include definition, accounting recognition, measurement and reporting on asset specific for the public sector, the establishment of the state asset register and effectively management the cost and performance. The results of the research conducted during 2012, on a selected sample of the budgetary users in Croatia, show that a small number of budgetary users have the register of assets they dispose. In order to create a base of information, experiences show that the accounting and accounting information are a very important precondition for efficient asset management. This leads to the main goal of this paper which relates to the identification and systematization of existing and possible models for recognition and measurement of asset specific for the public sector and their presentation in the financial statements. Current public sector accounting in Croatia is based on a modified accrual basis. That means that in the balance sheet are presented information about financial assets and non-financial assets, while the information on asset specific for the public sector are not presented in the balance sheet. The basic assumption of the efficient management the asset specific for the public sector represents the introduction of an accrual basis of accounting in public sector accounting in Croatia. Only by fulfilling this condition, it can be expected the improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency in management the asset specific for the public sector.

Organic farming is often presented as a way of producing healthy food without use of agrochemicals (mineral fertilizers, pesticides, growth hormones and other), but it represents a lot wider concept. Organic agriculture tends to use all potentials of a certain ecosystem, and leans towards mixed economy that has a rounded agricultural production. According to law (NN 139/10) organic agriculture is subject to mandatory professional control of a whole economy. The nature and frequency of professional control is determined by the risk evaluation, appearance of irregularities and determination of compliance. Professional control is performed at least once a year except in those subjects who are engaged in packed food wholesale or those who sell directly to final consumers or users. Except professional control, organic agriculture is also subject to official food controles in accordance to provisions of the food Act (NN 81/13) and regulations enacted under it. Certification and production control have been established in order to protect consumers, and in order for a consumer to be sure that a certain product is produced according to demands of organic farming as it is specified in Act regulations on organic production and labelling of organic products.

Currently, the OECD countries produce in services about 70 percent of the added value and the development of this share has continued to have a growing trend [1]. Prosperity of the country as a whole is thus significantly affected by the performance of companies providing services, including telecommunications companies. In the past 20 years, telecommunications and mobile services in the world and in the Czech Republic has undergone a rapid development and technological shift. Since the early 1990s, however, conditions for business of individual telecom firms in the Czech Republic have been gradually getting worse, especially due to increasing competition as a result of globalization and the entry of new mobile operators on the market, as well as a growing negative attitude of customers as a result of an approach of telecommunications companies to their customers favouring profit before customer value. However, in the long term, only those companies may be successful that offer customers a higher value than the competition does. This requires building a truly fully functional quality management based on the identification and management of all business processes. One of the key processes for satisfying customers of the telecommunications company is the innovation process. In order to implement it successfully, companies need to find appropriate sources of invention for innovation of the telecommunications services supply and also create mechanisms to acquire, process and store information needed as inputs into the innovation process. The retention process can be a very good source of information for the innovation process. Telecommunications companies include it in their own system of processes in particular to retain dissatisfied and defecting customers from the pre-paid segment (customers without a contract using telecommunication services on the basis of prepaid cards) and customers of the post-paid segment (i.e. retail customers using telecommunication services on the basis of paying regular monthly subscription fees). Considering that tens of thousands of customers who contact the company if dissatisfied pass the retention process monthly, the retention process can be considered a very valuable source of information about the imperfections of the previous range of services offered. The forthcoming article publishes the results of a primary research conducted in the spring of 2014 in a company providing telecommunications services. It deals with the retention process, its purpose, course, outputs and analyses how to improve its current course in order to make it an important source of information to innovate the range of services offered to individual customers and thus to contribute to improving the competitive position of the company.","[Kovarikova, Pavla; Branska, Lenka] Univ Pardubice, Fac Chem Technol, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Kovarikova, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Chem Technol, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,"Branská, Lenka/AAX-4437-2021; Sterbova, Petra/T-5493-2017",,,,,,9,1,1,0,9,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,771.0,780,,,,,,10,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800096,0

It also allows countries to better diversify their foreign exchange holdings. Given the continuing strong economic growth in the China and its growing influence on the world economy, the renminbi will likely emerge as a new international currency. However, this is contingent on the China accepting a more convertible capital account and developing an efficient financial system.

The Makeham - Gompertz function is one of the commonly used models for the mortality modelling of the population. Parameters of this function are mostly estimated for example by the method of the partial sums. This method however fails at very high old age group mortality estimation. The big problem is lack of data at these age groups for the statistical processing by the classical methods. An alternative approach of the solution of this problem is presented in the article, namely application of the bootstrap method. Its principle is the determination of residuals, creating of their bootstrap samples and subsequently calculation of a model that is used to estimate population mortality rate in the old age. Characteristics specific mortality rate was calculated for the age categories 85 - 105. 5000 bootstrap simulations were done and the same number of bootstrap replications of the parameters k, a, b of the Gompertz - Makeham function were calculated.

The adverse demographic situation and labour migration in the Baltic States allow speaking about inviability of the present retirement system for future pensioners. The aim of the present paper is to identify new tendencies in the labour market that allow speaking about a crisis of the state retirement system. To achieve this aim, the author considers issues of population ageing in the world and Latvia by using the life cycle hypothesis of saving with regard to the Baltic States where the demographic crisis is particularly pointed. The author raises a hypothesis about lowering retirement age that enables early youth employment. The author's proposal about early youth employment by reducing terms of learning at secondary school, and introducing professional training in the senior classes and colleges could be one of the ways for achievement of balance in the labour market. The virtualisation has led more professions to demand computer skills and ability to work with other equipment that can appear in the future. The education system must focus on lifelong learning. In the labour market, the youth will be ranked high if they acquire professions; consequently, youth unemployment will decline.","[Pavuk, Olga] Baltic Int Acad, Riga, Latvia",,,olga.pavuka@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,3,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-3-2,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,36,,,,,110.0,117,,,,,,8,Economics; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography; Public Administration,BB8OR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347134600012,0

The ubiquitous measure of GDP per capita reflects a utilitarian conception of justice, where individual utility is defined as personal income, and social welfare is the average of utilities in a population. A more attractive conception of justice is opportunity-equalization. Here, a two-dimensional measure of economic development is proposed, based upon viewing individuals' incomes as a consequence of circumstances, effort, and policy. The first dimension is the average income level of those in the society with the most disadvantaged circumstances, and the second dimension is the degree to which total income inequality is due to differential effort, as opposed to differential circumstances. This pair of numbers is computed for a set of 22 European countries. No country dominates all others on both dimensions.

Although competitiveness is still difficult to measure, there are factors that affect it and not just the intradepartmental, but also on the sectoral and macroeconomic level.In this paper we focus on the evaluation of the competitiveness of countries based on the country's involvement in international trade by individual commodity areas and highlight the comparative advantages of the countries surveyed. For this purpose we use the RCA index and Michaely index. The article points to the growing interdependence of the world economy in the globalization process, so it is necessary to monitor and compare the competitiveness not only of integration groups, but also the competitiveness of individual countries.

Health reforms indicate new directions for health policies and implement new tools to support decision-making on the financing of health care services, guaranteeing both the specific health benefits for the patients, as well as economic benefits for the system, emphasising the importance of these problems. Some of these tools are the methods and techniques of economic evaluation of health programs which are a part of a group of cost and benefits analyses. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is one of the evaluation methods that can be successfully used in healthcare for efficient allocation of limited resources. The main purpose of cost-benefit analysis may be either establishing the most valuable set of benefits, or determining the lowest possible cost at which certain benefits are achieved. The aim of the article is to present a cost-benefit techniques and their possible applications in healthcare. In discussion, the theoretical aspects of the use of that technique were described, while mentioning the relations of CBA with other methods of health needs assessments, for instance: the willingness to pay. Theoretical considerations were also supported by empirical examples of healthcare programs evaluations with the use of cost-benefit analyses.","[Suchecka, Jadwiga; Jewczak, Maciej] Univ Lodz, Dept Spatial Econometr, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Suchecka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Spatial Econometr, 37 Rewolucji 1905 R St, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland.",suchecka@uni.lodz.pl; jewczak@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,11,1,1,1,6,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-43-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,194.0,203,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367244900020,0

Before the development of this economy of food production based on farming and livestock rearing the economy of hunter-gatherers based on food procurement is usually assumed to be limited to a subsistence economy. Our purpose is to demonstrate that even during the pre-Neolithic period, the economic activity had been already quite developed. Indeed, this period starts with the end of the last ice age and is then featured by a broad-spectrum economy, including varied food resources. Such change has induced less nomadism, increasing division of labour and human population growth. In turn, it has implied, on the one hand, trade, wealth accumulation, the implementation of property rights, including land ownership. On the other hand, it has stimulated labour productivity and human knowledge. Even if it was less developed, the pre-Neolithic economy was quite similar in nature to the Neolithic one's. Therefore it already contained the origins of our civilization.","Univ La Reunion, Fac Droit & Econ, St Denis, France",University of La Reunion,"Svizzero, S (通讯作者)，Univ La Reunion, Fac Droit & Econ, St Denis, France.",serge.svizzero@univ-reunion.fr,,,,,,,19,4,4,0,5,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Using a method borrowed from statistical physics, we find that crude oil price display weak persistent behavior for time scales smaller than a year. For time scales larger than a year, strong mean-reversion behaviors can be found. That is, crude oil futures markets are not efficient in the short-term or in the long-term. By quantifying the market inefficiency using a multifractality degree, we find that the futures markets are more inefficient in the long-term than in the short-term. Furthermore, we investigate the stylized fact of volatility dynamics on market efficiency. The simulating and empirical results indicate that volatility clustering, volatility memory and extreme volatility have adverse effects on market efficiency, especially in the long-term.","[Wang, Yudong; Wu, Chongfeng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Wang, YD (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Fahuazhen Rd 535, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",wangyudongnj@126.com; cfwu@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Wang, Yudong/0000-0002-0156-1294",National Natural Science Foundation of China [70831004],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We would like to show our sincere gratitude to the anonymous review whose comments and suggests greatly improved the quality of the earlier draft.

Yet, it is not clear whether the media is actually a policy actor, like politicians or interest groups, which pursues a particular policy positions. This paper empirically examines whether the Dutch news media was objective in its reporting of the Dutch road pricing policy debate (which took place between 1998 and 2010) or whether it acted as a policy actor through biased reporting. We applied Westerstahl's Objectivity Framework to the media coverage by five leading national newspapers. Our main conclusion is that the Dutch news media was not objective and acted as a policy actor in the Dutch road pricing policy debate. Although all the newspapers violated objectivity to the same degree, they clearly adopted different policy positions. One popular newspaper was negative and the other mixed whereas all three quality newspapers were positive with the exception of one which sometimes inclined to a mixed position. All newspapers generally maintained the same position over the relatively long period of the road pricing debate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This is particularly relevant for firms which have been recently acquired by foreign investors. We employ the variation in civic capital across Italian provinces as an exogenous determinant of these governance costs. We claim that the effect of foreign ownership on productivity is less favorable in areas where civic capital is low. As the level of local civic capital increases, the scope for opportunistic behavior is reduced, which makes the governance of foreign affiliates easier and improves their performance. We take this prediction to the data and find confirmation of our conceptual framework.

We provide empirical evidence that is consistent with this hypothesis. Specifically, manipulation strategies may rely on the opportunistic use of leverage. However, manipulation does not appear to be uniform across REIT sectors and seems to become more common as the level of competition in the underlying property sector increases. We employ a set of commonly used traditional performance measures and a recently developed manipulation-proof measure (MPPM, Goetzmann et al., Rev Finan Stud 20(5):1503-1546, 2007) to evaluate the performance of 147 REITs from seven different property sectors over the period 1991-2009.

Yet, analyses that go beyond income and incorporate non-market dimensions of welfare most often rely on the assumption of identical preferences to avoid the difficulties related to interpersonal comparisons. In this paper, we suggest an international comparison based on individual welfare rankings that fully retain preference heterogeneity. Focusing on the consumption-leisure trade-off, we estimate discrete choice labor supply models using harmonized microdata for 11 European countries and the US. We retrieve preference heterogeneity within and across countries and analyze several welfare criteria which take into account that differences in income are partly due to differences in tastes. The resulting welfare rankings clearly depend on the normative treatment of preference heterogeneity with alternative metrics. We show that these differences can indeed be explained by estimated preference heterogeneity across countries-rather than demographic composition.","[Bargain, Olivier] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, F-13290 Aix En Provence, Les Milles, France; [Bargain, Olivier; Dolls, Mathias; Neumann, Dirk; Peichl, Andreas; Siegloch, Sebastian] IZA, D-53072 Bonn, Germany; [Decoster, Andre] Katholieke Univ Leuven, CES, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Dolls, Mathias; Neumann, Dirk; Peichl, Andreas; Siegloch, Sebastian] Univ Cologne, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Peichl, Andreas] Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Peichl, Andreas] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Aix-Marseille Universite; IZA Institute Labor Economics; KU Leuven; University of Cologne; University of Essex; Ifo Institut,"Neumann, D (通讯作者)，IZA, POB 7240, D-53072 Bonn, Germany.",olivier.bargain@univ-amu.fr; andre.decoster@econ.kuleuven.be; dolls@iza.org; dneumann@iza.org; peichl@iza.org; siegloch@iza.org,"Peichl, Andreas/D-7829-2018; Decoster, André/S-9719-2017; Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019","Decoster, André/0000-0002-0521-8610;",,,,,55,22,22,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2013,41.0,4,,,,,789.0,817,,10.1007/s00355-012-0707-x,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,219ZR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324551000004,0

This paper seeks to measure the importance of the New Deal in facilitating the Democrats' control of the federal government well into the 1960s. We test whether long-differences in the county-level electoral support for Democratic presidential candidates after the 1930s can be attributed to New Deal interventions into local economies. We also investigate more narrowly whether voters rewarded Roosevelt from 1932 to 1936 and from 1936 to 1940 for his efforts to stimulate depressed local economies. Our instrumental variable estimates indicate that increasing a county's per capita New Deal relief and public works spending from nothing to the sample mean ($145) would have increased the long-run support for the Democratic party by 2 to 2.5 percentage points. We further find that the long-run shift toward the Democratic party after 1928 was not a function of the Roosevelt landslide victory in 1932. Roosevelt's ability to win over voters during the 1936 and 1940 elections with New Deal spending, however, did matter for the long-term. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Using quarterly data from 1994 to 2006, this paper detects outliers in the time series of international tourists to China and finds that the number of international tourists during the second and the third quarters of 2003 are outliers of the time series. To eliminate the impact of outliers, the paper uses the SARIMA model to forecast the values of outliers. By replacing the original value with the forecasted values, the authors conduct a co-integration analysis with the new time series and the corresponding quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) data.

In doing so, we extend the approach developed in Albert and Chib (Journal of the American Statistical Association 1993; 88: 669-679; in Bayesian Biostatistics, Berry DA, Stangl DK (eds), Marcel Dekker: New York, 1996), and in Chib and Carlin (Statistics and Computing 1999; 9: 17-26) by releasing restrictive parametric assumptions on the latent individual effect and eliminating potential spurious state dependence with latent time effects. The model is found to outperform more traditional approaches in an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations. We then apply the model to the estimation of a patent equation using firm-level data on research and development (R&D). We find a strong effect of technology spillovers on R&D but little evidence of product market spillovers, consistent with economic theory. The distribution of latent firm effects is found to have a multimodal structure featuring within-industry firm clustering.

In a structural demand model applied to German consumption data, we use cross-sectional and longitudinal variation in prices and tax rates to construct individual after-tax interest rates and cluster-specific consumer prices. We find that the compensated own-price elasticities for savings as well as consumption are significantly negative, while the theoretical model implications of homogeneity and symmetry must be rejected. Importantly, we estimate the uncompensated interest rate elasticity of savings, in line with the literature, at around zero. Some heterogeneity in this elasticity is found along the savings and wealth distribution. We conclude that short-term policy-induced variation of net returns to savings is expected to have no significant effects on the level of compound savings.","[Beznoska, Martin; Ochmann, Richard] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Dept Publ Econ, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Ochmann, R (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Dept Publ Econ, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",mbeznoska@diw.de; rochmann@diw.de,,,,,,,54,6,6,1,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Building on previous single-donor statistical studies of AfT, this paper conducts a statistical study of 19 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) AfT donors and then examines the delivery and implementation of AfT in four recipient countries - Indonesia, the Philippines, Timor-Leste and Vietnam - from four donor countries - Germany, Japan, Norway and the US. The paper finds considerable variation in the export effects of the AfT programs, ranging from programs with no impact on recipient country exports to programs that are positively correlated with recipient country exports to the donor country and/or the rest of the world. Taking a closer look at the AfT programs of Germany, Japan, Norway and the US suggests that differences in program design and implementation may account for differences in AfT export effects.","Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Brazys, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland.",,,"Brazys, Samuel/0000-0002-4482-4234",,,,,72,14,14,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

However, some still managed to outperform the market and even made large profits in the midst of widespread economic difficulties. McDonald's was one such company and, in light of its example, many industry magazines and newspapers featured articles suggesting that a quick-service restaurant, with a lower income elasticity of demand, might be better able to survive during constrained economic conditions than upper-level restaurants. This paper empirically examines whether US restaurants' income elasticity of demand and actual financial performances during economic downturns are affected by the restaurant type. The findings suggest that restaurant type showed no significant effects on the income elasticity of demand for US restaurant companies, while fast-food restaurants showed significantly greater accounting performances than those of non-fast-food restaurants during recession. The insignificant differences in the income elasticity of demand and significant differences in accounting performances during the recession may suggest that fast-food restaurants implemented cost control more effectively than non-fast-food restaurants, and the authors' additional analysis confirms this.","[Koh, Yoon] Univ Houston, Conrad N Hilton Coll Hotel & Restaurant Managemen, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Lee, Seoki] Penn State Univ, Sch Hospitality Management, University Pk, PA 16801 USA; [Choi, Chris] Univ Guelph, Sch Hospitality & Tourism Management, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Houston System; University of Houston; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Guelph,"Koh, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Conrad N Hilton Coll Hotel & Restaurant Managemen, 229 CN Hilton & Coll,Suite 236, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",ykoh@uh.edu; leeseoki@psu.edu; hwchoi@uoguelph.ca,"Choi, Hwansuk Chris/IAO-2291-2023; Lee, Seoki/AFK-7195-2022; Koh, Yoon/AAE-5355-2022","Lee, Seoki/0000-0003-4720-9170; Koh, Yoon/0000-0002-0213-0082",,,,,67,16,17,0,26,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

How CRAs contribute to the constitution of the politics of limits underpinning the European sovereign debt crisis is at the core of this article. As a socio-technical device of control, sovereign ratings are an illocutionary' statement about budgetary health, which promotes an artificial fiscal normality. Subsequently, these austere politics of creditworthiness have perlocutionary' effects, which seek to censure political discretion through normalizing risk techniques aligned with the self-systemic, and thereby self-regulating, logic of Anglo-American versions of capitalism. The ensuing antagonistic relationship between the programmatic/expertise and operational/politics dimensions of fiscal governance leaves Europe vulnerable to crisis and the renegotiation of how the political' is established in the economy.

Over the past decade, financial processes originating in Anglo-American markets, such as derivatives, hedge funds and mergers and acquisitions (M&A), have made quiet headway in emerging markets. One of the transmission channels is financial returnees, defined as elites returning to domestic finance from either global finance abroad or from foreign financial institutions in their home countries. Many financial returnees pursue business agendas that parallel the Anglo-American model, while portraying themselves as local for domestic constituencies. These actions are now especially visible in the rise of private equity funds in emerging markets. This article defines the concept of a financial returnee and charts the impact of these individuals in importing the Anglo-American private equity model to Asia with Korea as the primary case study. Once foreign-controlled, the private equity industry in Korea is now domestically-run and financial returnees have been integral in this sector's short but important history.","City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Robertson, J (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",justin.robertson@cityu.edu.hk,,"ROBERTSON, Justin/0000-0002-7484-0112",,,,,62,6,6,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We collected data in 2007 from 374 adults (16-60 years of age) from 196 households in 13 villages. Household random-effects multiple regressions were run using systolic (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as outcomes; covariates included the four sibling categories and control variables (e.g., sex, age, education, body mass index [BMI]). Mean SBP and DBP were 114 (SD = 14) and 66 (SD = 11) mmHg. The prevalence of hypertension was 5.08%. Having an additional younger brother bore a small (3.3-5.9%) positive association with both SBP and DBP, with the effect weakening as people aged. Having an additional younger sister was associated with a small (3.8%) increase in SBP among women, with the magnitude shrinking as people aged. In a large family, the number of younger brothers may exert an impact on an individual's blood pressure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Utilizing the quantile regression method, we find that herding is more likely to be present in the high quantiles of the REIT return dispersion. This implies that REIT investors tend to herd under turbulent market conditions. Our results also support the asymmetry of herding behaviors, that is, herding is more likely to occur and becomes stronger in declining markets than in rising markets. In addition, our findings show that the current financial crisis has caused a change in the circumstances under which herding can occur, as we find that during the current crisis REIT investors may not start to herd until the market becomes extremely turbulent whereas during the relatively normal period before the crisis, investors tend to herd when the market is moderately turbulent. Finally, we find that compared with the case of the 'pre-modern' era, REIT investors are more likely to herd in the 'modern' era, during which herding usually occurs when the market becomes tumultuous. This implies that the switch of REITs from passive externally managed entities into active self-managed ones has made the investors more responsive to market sentiment.","[Zhou, Jian] Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Anderson, Randy I.] Univ Cent Florida, Dr Phillips Sch Real Estate, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",University of Guelph; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jian@uoguelph.ca; randerson@bus.ucf.edu,,,,,,,39,52,56,2,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We construct a straightforward theoretical model showing that this practice introduces a specific type of measurement error that generates a major source of endogeneity into empirical research.

By giving a detailed overview of the structure of a country's population at a specific point in time, they provide one of the most important parameters for political action. In addition, in modern statistical systems, population censuses are the data basis for a variety of further statistical information, such as intercensal updates of the number of inhabitants. They provide the basis for the statistical fields which either describe the population or in which population data are integrated. Furthermore they allow drawing reliable population samples and performing qualified extrapolation of sample results. This article focuses on the relevance of censuses in general and, more specifically, of the current 2011 Census in Germany. Following a historical overview in the first part of the article, the second part describes the various definitions of population, the relevance and issues of defining the survey unit and of operationalising concepts of variables.

We also use identification through heteroskedasticity, which does not rely on standard exclusion restrictions. The results from alternative identification schemes show that better access to both domestic and international markets has positive effects on per capita consumption, the domestic market effect is significantly larger in magnitude, and there is complementarity between the access to domestic and international markets.","[Emran, M.

The model allows the reproduction of observed travel demand (1971-2005) in the different world regions and considers income and time rebound effects. Regarding future travel demand, the model allows for an evaluation of the sensitivity for future trends in travel money and time budgets, luxury level, vehicle load and modal split. The study highlights the high relevance of future development in travel behavior for climate policy. A consistent combination of different behavioral changes towards a more climate friendly travel behavior is modeled to reduce CO2 emissions towards the end of this century by around 50% compared to the baseline.

In developing and validating the model, the study uses a wide range of data sources including: (I) a brief trip-diary type survey; (2) 24-h traffic counts at the entry and exit points to the campus; (3) information about the university buildings' class room capacities and class schedules; (4) parking occupancy surveys; and (5) select intersections' turn movement counts. The agent-based model is designed to explicitly capture trip chaining behavior, and the often-overlooked phenomenon of drivers searching for an available parking spot. The parking search process is modeled using a sequential game-theoretic, neo-additive capacity model which accounts for drivers optimistic and pessimistic attitudes regarding parking availability in their most desirable lot. The agent-based demand model is then integrated with the Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS), which serves as the traffic micro-simulation engine, and with the MOVES2010 emissions model. Following the validation of the integrated model, it is used to quantify the environmental cost of the parking search process on campus. The study may be regarded as one of the few studies to integrate an agent- or activity based model of travel demand, albeit admittedly simplified, with a fine-grained transportation network, a detailed traffic micro-simulation, and a project-level emissions model. Another contribution of the study is in terms of quantifying the environmental cost, in terms of wasted fuel and increased emissions, associated with the parking search process on campus.

There are two disjoint sets of battlefields, each of which is associated with a player who competes only within that set. The common enemy competes in both sets of battlefields. An 'enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend' alliance forms when the two players facing the common enemy agree on a pre-conflict transfer of resources among themselves. We examine the case in which the players may commit to binding ex post transfers (alliances with full commitment) and the case in which ex post transfers are not feasible (self-enforcing alliances). Models that utilize the lottery contest success function typically yield qualitatively different results from those arising in models with the auction contest success function. However, under both contest success functions, alliances with full commitment result in identical alliance transfers for all parameter configurations, and self-enforcing alliances yield identical transfers over a subset of the parameter space. Our results, thus, provide a partial robustness result for 'enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend' alliances.","[Rietzke, David] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Roberson, Brian] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of Arizona; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Roberson, B (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",rietzkdm@email.arizona.edu; brobers@purdue.edu,,"Rietzke, David/0000-0002-8108-1396",,,,,48,8,10,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2013,40.0,4,,,,,937.0,956,,10.1007/s00355-012-0650-x,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,112DQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316572800001,0

The Scully method has its weaknesses; however, its flaws are not as serious as Krautmann claims. Though Krautmann's free market returns method offers a useful approach for estimating players' marginal revenue products, it suffers from deficiencies that the Scully method avoids; thus, it is not necessarily superior to revenue-based estimates.","Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Hlth Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Bradbury, JC (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Hlth Phys Educ & Sport Sci, MD 0202,1000 Chastain Rd, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",jbradbu2@kennesaw.edu,"Bradbury, John/V-6080-2019","Bradbury, John/0000-0001-9209-569X",,,,,15,13,18,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

In this paper we examine the political economy within which the Diaspora option has emerged and the broader implications of the discursive and material ways that migrants are being incorporated as professionalized partners in development. Drawing on a case study of the World Bank's Africa Diaspora Program we examine the underlying assumptions, ideologies and silences upon which this policy option rests. We conclude that the emerging Diaspora option should be approached more critically because the current celebration of these strategies obscures the selective and narrow neoliberal orientation; the assumptions that they make about the nature of diasporic engagement, and their increasing reliance on migrant populations to shoulder the investment risks associated with social transformation.","[Pellerin, Helene] Univ Ottawa, Sch Polit Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mullings, Beverley] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; Queens University - Canada,"Pellerin, H (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Sch Polit Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,"Mullings, Beverley/0000-0001-5583-8001",,,,,106,58,63,0,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Cartels which, based on the agreed market strategies, may follow common price strategy, set their production quotes or divide the market are forbidden in the European Union countries as well as in many countries outside the EU. This functional scheme of cartel behavior is thus fundamentally incompatible with generally supported terms of competition protection on the markets of developed economies. In the developed economies of the European Union and the world there are established governmental institutions to control and guarantee the conditions of economic competition. In this article we will present the mathematical formalization of the model of equilibrium price and supply of the cartel agreement participants and point out the social inefficiency of such decision-making scheme.

Taking into account the spatial tendencies and dependence across the regions in the growth models allows to evaluate the convergence phenomenon on the grounds of beta parameter estimated better than in the traditional approach. Then the estimate of the parameter will not be influenced by omitting the dependence.

Using a simple analytical model we find out that there are situations when it will be costly for this agent to adjust its positions in intraday markets. A first key factor is of course the technical flexibility of the power system: if highly flexible units provide energy at very low prices in real-time there is no point in participating into intraday markets. Besides, we identify the way wind production forecast errors evolve constitutes another essential, although less obvious, key-factor. Both the value of the standard error and the correlation between forecasts errors at different gate closures will determine the strategy of the wind power manager. Policy implications of our results are the following: low liquidity in intraday markets will be unavoidable for given sets of technical parameters, it will also be inefficient in some cases to set discrete auctions in intraday markets, and compelling players to adjust their position in intraday markets will then generate additional costs.","Florence Sch Regulat, I-50014 Fiesole, FI, Italy",European University Institute,"Henriot, A (通讯作者)，Florence Sch Regulat, Villa Fonte,Via Fontanelle 10, I-50014 Fiesole, FI, Italy.",arthur.henriot@eui.eu,,,,,,,14,18,18,0,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,35.0,1,,,,,99.0,117,,10.5547/01956574.35.1.6,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,267KZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328097900006,0

We use a comparative advantage model to disentangle the effect of sorting workers across sectors from the effect of the differences in returns to workers skills. The selection of the best workers into the public sector is clearly an important component of the explanation for the public-private sector earnings gap, but the widening of this gap over time is primarily due to changes in the compensation patterns. We find that in the 1990s, public employees were underpaid compared with their earning potential in the private sector, whereas in the early 2000s, public employees earned similar returns to their comparative advantage in the public and private sectors. The increasing homogeneity in returns to skills in the Vietnamese labor market appears to explain both the increase in the public-private pay gap and the decrease in overall inequality.","Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Imbert, C (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",imbert@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,19,9,9,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

These techniques include differential evolution algorithm or threshold accepting method. Results of application of simple general purpose heuristic methods are reported and the impact of values of control parameters on the quality of the solution is discussed. The problem addressed is cluster analysis of countries with respect to the food supply (various items per capita per day). The average silhouette width is used as the objective function for evaluation of the solution and the results are compared with the solution obtained with the commonly used partitioning algorithms. The results suggest that both the threshold accepting method and the differential evolution method are suitable for solving the optimal partitioning problem. These methods easily allow to supply the objective function preferred by the user and reach the solution rather quickly. The values of the control parameters did not exhibit any significant impact on the quality of the solution. The quality of the resulting classification was a little bit higher when using the differential evolution method than when using the threshold accepting method. And both heuristic methods slightly outperformed the standard implementations of the clustering methods (k-means, partitioning around medoids) available in the statistical software packages. The final classification has two groups, where the smaller cluster seems to include the countries usually treated as developing.","[Kasprikova, Nikola] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Math, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,data@tulipany.cz,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,368.0,372,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000063,0

Imports from high-income countries do not significantly contribute to the export orientation of firms, especially when both persistence in export and the possible endogeneity of the import measures are accounted for via system generalised method of moments (GMM) estimation of a linear probability model.

The first neolithic population of the mentioned region is called Starcevo culture. With its appearance (end of 7th millenium) the economy based on agriculture and breeding of some animal species, fe. cattle, begins. The first trade routes which provided stone of high quality, are established. Neolithic economy of that time was in its very beginnings. Starcevo culture in the east part of Slavonija and Baranja was replaced by Sopot culture (about 5500 BC), which in that region lasted till the end of Neolithic and the first signs which announced the beginning of the next period - the Eneolithic or the Copper Age (about 4300 BC). Population of Sopot culture is represent of the developed neolithic economy, primarily agricultural with the great participation of cattle breeding. At all mentioned sites, some kinds of stone imported from very distinct areas were found. That presumes well organised trade and trade routes. The example is opsidian, volcanic stone that is possible to find only at the region of volcanic activity in the past. It is ascertained that all opsidian found at the sites in the north Croatia, including those in Slavonija and Baranja, comes from the northern Carpathian region, which means several hundreds km distance. Population of Sopot culture in the mid-and late neolithic had sufficient economical power to acquire such highly valued gooods. The second example that prooves the existance of trade routes is spondylus gaederopus, thorny oyster, the marine mollusc which occurs in Adriatic and Aegean sea and at some spots in Mediterranean sea. Jewelry made of its shells have been found at almost every site of Sopot culture. At the very end of Neolithic, that is time of late Sopot culture, appears elementary use of copper - metal that has marked the next prehistoric period. The purpose of the paper is to present that at the beginning of the Neolithic origins the economy of which some aspects can be followed until today, such as agriculture and cattle breeding, production of various artefacts for everyday's needs or trade, even the earliest beginning of metalurgy. Also, starting with some general facts about neolitihic economy, on some examples from the mentioned excavated sites, its development during the Neolitihic will be presented, as well as some details specific to the region in question.","[Simic, Jasna] Filozofski Fak Osijeku, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,,eurinomechild@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,14.0,21,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400001,0

The LS of the population can be described using different variables. Therefore the first part deals with the questions how to alternatively express the LS and whether a significant correlation exists between the imaginary LS variable and other chosen variables used to express it. As there is a problem with quantifying the LS with specific variables or a specific coefficient, the development of monitored life expectancy is modelled by trend function. The LS is one of the key variables that significantly affect the trend of particular demographic indicators such as life expectancy. Using certain assumptions, we can express the quality of life and its level, which should affect the development of life expectancy. However, as it is shown using Granger causality and VAR model, these general assumptions has limited usage.

The method enables quantitative capturing of relations between individual development actors, subjects or processes themselves that may occur during development of a municipality. It is then possible to explore causalities between individual elements of the whole municipal system. The main benefit of the system dynamics, however, is not only capturing of these simple causalities, but also understanding the feedbacks between the system elements. This means that one single element through its behaviour affects another one within the same system. But response of this second element has a loop influence on the initial one. System dynamics introduces a dynamic view, in this case applied on the topic of municipal development. The approach is applicable also in modern management systems. In that case it would be an application of the Balanced Scorecard method which is based on system dynamics principles described above. In addition this method recommends capturing the development through both financial and also non-financial indicators. This generates further possibilities of application of quantitative approach of system dynamics to processes of rather a qualitative character.","[Sobotka, Martin; Sobotkova, Lucie; Knezackova, Radka] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Econ Sci, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,,martin.sobotka@upce.cz; milan.pucek@seznam.cz; lucie.sobotkova@upce.cz; radka.knezackova@upce.cz,"Pucek, Milan Jan/F-3478-2012",,,,,,9,0,0,0,8,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,832.0,837,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000141,0

In this financial system, banks and markets exhibit three forms of interaction: they compete, they complement each other, and they co-evolve. Co-evolution is generated by two new ingredients of financial system architecture relative to the existing theories: securitization and risk-sensitive bank capital. We show that securitization propagates banking advances to the financial market, permitting market evolution to be driven by bank evolution, and market advances are transmitted to banks through bank capital. We then examine how politicians determine the nature of political intervention designed to expand credit availability. We find that political intervention in banking exhibits a U-shaped pattern, where it is most notable in the early stage of financial system development (through bank capital subsidy in exchange for state ownership of banks) and in the advanced stage (through direct lending regulation). Despite expanding credit access, political intervention results in an increase in financial system risk and does not contribute to financial system evolution. Numerous policy implications are drawn out.","[Song, Fenghua] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Thakor, Anjan] Washington Univ, ECGI, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Thakor, Anjan] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL),"Thakor, A (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, ECGI, Campus Box 1133,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",song@psu.edu; thakor@wustl.edu,,,,,,,39,15,16,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

This paper aims to explore how to apply community of practice to visually impaired students to ensure the current disability student issues in service in knowledge delivery will be managed properly. Correspondents of 27 visually impaired students are involved in this research. 25 of them are selected from university that mainly conducts non-classroom teaching method and another 2 visually impaired students are selected from another university that only conducts classroom teaching method. All of them are fully involved in this study along 8 weeks duration. All correspondents are classified into 5 small groups and arranged into 4 different research conditions namely (1) leadership (2) participation level of knowledge access enabler technology (text to speech technology) (3) participation level of knowledge transfer enabler technology (telephony technology) and (4) face-to-face community of practice experiences. Applying virtual and traditional community of practice to visually impaired students is explained with its implications under the research results. It revealed that there are different implications of applying virtual (vCops) and traditional community of practice (CoPs). The vCoPs is not formally accepted by the sampling groups from classroom teaching method as all their required assistance is naturally fulfilled by peers and instructors while the possibility of vCoPs is highly appeared to the sampling groups from non-classroom teaching method as provided assistances is currently inadequate. At the end of this paper, the conclusion and strategy of both vCoPs and CoPs models are presented with some challenges and recommendations.","[Tangsri, Chatchai] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Technol & Commun Educ, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,,chatchai.tangsri@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,"INFORMATION ENGINEERING RESEARCH INST, USA",NEWARK,"100 CONTINENTAL DR, NEWARK, DE 19713 USA",,,978-1-16275-049-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,267.0,272,,,,,,6,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BGC87,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322345500051,0

The flexible employment, or the informal employment, includes the employment of the informal sector, informal employment of the formal sector and creative employment independent of the sectors. The construction of the social security system for the flexible employment group will address the laborers' concerns and lift their worries. And it will also conduce to the rational flow of labour force and the adjustment of industrial structure. Therefore, the flexible employment works for an effective way for job enlargement and reasonable allocation of labour resources. Meanwhile, most employees of the formal sector are included by the social security system but the flexible employment group belongs to the vulnerable groups as they receive instable income. Therefore, without efficient security, not only the basic rights of the laborers will be damaged, but also serious social problems will be caused. Focusing on the flexible employment group contributes to realizing the social equity and promoting the harmonious development of the economic society.","[Wang Yini] Chongqing Business Vocat Coll, Res Dept, Chongqing, Peoples R China",,,cqszyzcp@163.com,"Jiang, Yuan/JED-3759-2023",,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,19.0,,,,,,397.0,401,,,,,,5,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA3ZX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335235900073,0

The large number of existing models that capture different aspects of the airport are a testament to this. However, these existing models do not consider in a systematic sense modelling requirements nor how stakeholders such as airport operators or airlines would make use of these models. This can detrimentally impact on the verification and validation of models and makes the development of extensible and reusable modelling tools difficult. This paper develops from the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) framework a methodology to help structure the review and development of modelling capabilities and usage scenarios. The method is applied to the review of existing airport terminal passenger models. It is found that existing models can be broadly categorised according to four usage scenarios: capacity planning, operational planning and design, security policy and planning, and airport performance review. The models, the performance metrics that they evaluate and their usage scenarios are discussed. It is found that capacity and operational planning models predominantly focus on performance metrics such as waiting time, service time and congestion whereas performance review models attempt to link those to passenger satisfaction outcomes. Security policy models on the other hand focus on probabilistic risk assessment. However, there is an emerging focus on the need to be able to capture trade-offs between multiple criteria such as security and processing time. Based on the CONOPS framework and literature findings, guidance is provided for the development of future airport terminal models. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper will explore port regionalisation in different contexts through a greater focus on the drivers and direction of a number of inland terminal development strategies. The paper will build on previous work by combining inland terminal taxonomies and the theory of directional development with traditional port development models. Regionalisation strategies will be compared and contrasted through examples derived from field work undertaken in Europe and the USA. The results contribute towards a disaggregation of the process of port regionalisation, revealing different levels of integration and cooperation observed in different location splitting models. In this way, different strategies will be elucidated, enabling further exploration and more nuanced understanding of the institutional aspects of spatial development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This raises a critical question: how does the scientization of decision-making shape the construction of new governance arrangements? Using the case of negotiations between the Chinese state and the US state over the harmonization of cotton quality classification, I consider three approaches to scientization in world politics: the world polity approach, the world-systems approach and the political sociology of science. Evidence from the case demonstrates the need to largely reject the world polity approach while integrating the world-systems approach with the finer-grained analyses of the political sociology of science. This analysis yields two key arguments regarding the implications of science-based decision-making as an institutionalized global norm. First, scientization can formalize existing power inequalities given the uneven historical terrain of research legacies. Second, as scientization channels politics through science, powerful actors are better situated to legitimate their own interests in scientific terms and to define what makes science legitimate.","Coll William & Mary, Dept Sociol, Williamsburg, VA USA",William & Mary,"Quark, AA (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Sociol, Williamsburg, VA USA.",,,,,,,,62,13,16,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Several tests of the reference-dependent preference framework have been carried out in experimental economics, and to a smaller extent in a choice modelling setting, to date. However, these empirical applications have generally focussed on a single behavioural phenomenon using uniform modelling approaches. This paper aims to broaden existing work by presenting a multi-attribute framework, allowing contemporarily for gains-losses asymmetry, non-linearity and testing for several possible reference points. The framework is applied in the context of commuter choices and reveals important gains in model fit and further insights into behaviour compared to standard modelling approaches. Of particular relevance for future research is the functional form of fare sensitivity that varies significantly with the reference point used. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Since then, research on WalMart's impacts has exploded. Recent studies employ sophisticated statistical techniques to more accurately measure the size and direction of effects. Many reach conclusions similar to Stone's original work. This article updates the original Stone study with additional years of data. It draws on recent methodological advances to help account for the effects of WalMart's strategic location decisions on estimated retail sales in Iowa. As is consistent with previous studies, we find that WalMart's entry into smaller trade centers in Iowa had a big initial impact on host-town retail sales, with some categories experiencing significant increases while others saw declines in sales per capita. WalMart's presence helped stabilize or even expand the local retail sector of most rural Iowa host communities. To conclude, we discuss policy implications for local economic development officials.","[Artz, Georgeanne M.; Stone, Kenneth E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Artz, GM (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 260 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",gartz@iastate.edu,"Stone, Kenneth/JQV-4333-2023",,,,,,26,19,22,0,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Using recent insights about the dynamic interaction of learning mechanisms that are part of the individual's genetic endowment, we argue that, contra Scitovsky (1976), the emergence of relatively convenient forms of entertainment may foster - rather than inhibit - the accumulation of consumer knowledge. Furthermore, because specialized consumers have a greater tendency to innovatively modify aspects of the consumption activity, we argue that this specialization process fundamentally affects the rate at which consumers become habituated to novelty. This represents an important way in which cognitive learning patterns interact with non-cognitive learning dynamics and it has consequences for understanding the direction and length of fashion cycles in recreational activities. In particular, we discuss how this perspective can be applied to studying tourism demand patterns and the 'Destination Life Cycle'.","Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, AFE, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University,"Chai, A (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, AFE, Gold Coast Campus, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia.",a.chai@griffith.edu.au,,"Chai, Andreas/0000-0003-0838-9324",,,,,87,8,10,1,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Although it sympathizes with Marks invocation of empire as a key theoretical concept and historical category in the study of European integration, it fundamentally disagrees with his continentalist operationalization. Marks chooses to discuss the nexus of empire and European integration exclusively with reference to historical processes of imperial expansion and community formation occurring on the western European land mass. Since this methodology leaves out Europe's maritime colonial empires, it cannot account for the mutually conditioning relations between the intra- and extra-European imperial processes. Consequently, Marks also fails to register colonialism's decisive bearing on post-war European integration, and thus the fact that the scale of the original EEC was not delimited by the European land mass, but corresponded to the geopolitical constellation that at the time was called Eurafrica.","[Hansen, Peo; Jonsson, Stefan] Linkoping Univ, REMESO, Inst Res Migrat Ethn & Soc, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Hansen, P (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, REMESO, Inst Res Migrat Ethn & Soc, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",peo.hansen@liu.se; stefan.jonsson@liu.se,"Jonsson, Stefan/D-5138-2012","Jonsson, Stefan/0000-0003-2007-3736",,,,,39,27,28,1,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The paper analyses the performance of Irish exports in internationally comparative terms and assesses the contributions of both foreign-affiliate and indigenous firms across both manufacturing and services. Since almost 80 per cent of Irish exports are generated by foreign affiliates, medium-term export prospects are highly dependent on trends and developments in global market conditions for foreign direct investment. The paper discusses the likely impact on the countrys medium-term prospects of technological developments in key sectors and possible changes in the international regulatory and corporation tax landscapes.","[Barry, Frank] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Bergin, Adele] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Barry, F (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",,"barry, frank/Y-6289-2019","barry, frank/0000-0002-4226-5299",,,,,29,14,14,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2012,35.0,10,,,SI,,1291.0,1304,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01484.x,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,021MY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309890100006,0

The main findings are as follows. Steady-state inflation and inflation uncertainty have declined steadily since the inception of EMU, whilst short-run uncertainty has stabilised. A sequential dummy procedure provides further evidence of a structural break coinciding with the introduction of the euro and resulting in lower long-run uncertainty. It also appears that the direction of causality has been reversed, and that in the euro period the Friedman-Ball link is empirically supported, consistently with the idea that the ECB can achieve lower inflation uncertainty by lowering the inflation rate.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, London, England; [Onorante, Luca] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Paesani, Paolo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",Brunel University; European Central Bank; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, London, England.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk; luca.onorante@ecb.int; paolo.paesani@uniroma2.it,,,,,,,49,14,14,0,18,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Impulse response functions confirm that exchange rates and economic activity affect individual non-energy commodity prices, but we fail to find strong spillovers from oil to non-oil commodity prices or an impact of the interest rate.

Our approach is distinct owing to its comprehensiveness: First, we employ a data-rich forecast methodology to handle a large set of potential predictors in a Bayesian model-averaging approach and, second, we take a look at multiple asset classes (equities, foreign exchange, bonds and commodities) over long time spans. We find that proxies for credit risk and funding liquidity consistently show up as common predictors of volatility across asset classes. Variables capturing time-varying risk premia also perform well as predictors of volatility. While forecasts by macro-finance augmented models also achieve forecasting gains out-of-sample relative to autoregressive benchmarks, the performance varies across asset classes and over time.

In part, the difficulty stems from the fact that parties may have a hard time discerning the preferences of their respective voter coalitions. In the case of EU integration, parties may have additional incentives to disregard the interests of the public in the hope of securing benefits associated with their country's membership of the EU. In this article we investigate the extent of party responsiveness on EU integration issues in early transition years in central and eastern European countries. We find that while mainstream parties do consistently show more support for EU integration, we find no evidence that parties, in fact, track their voters. The lack of responsiveness cannot, however, be explained by the general instability of public and party positions, nor can this absence of a relationship be satisfactorily captured by low salience of the EU in the transition years.","[Spanihelova, Lucie] Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Zicha, Brandon C.] Leiden Univ Coll, Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Spanihelova, L (通讯作者)，Lange Voorhout 86, NL-2514 EJ The Hague, Netherlands.",l.spanihelova@montesquieu-instituut.nl,,,,,,,32,3,3,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This article adds to the literature by showing that, although there is a large degree of parameter uncertainty associated with the choice of determinants, the implied current account benchmarks for central and eastern Europe are in a narrow range. The second approach is the external sustainability framework where we extend the analysis to take into account the importance of FDI financing. We find that both approaches point to similar conclusions on which countries were in need of a current account adjustment in central and eastern Europe in 2007.

Knowing these relations is important since researchers have recently started to analyze and interpret user benefits in general and Logsums in specific in terms of these more behaviorally oriented notions, rather than in terms of expected utility. Participants to a stated route choice experiment were asked to indicate, after each choice made, to what extent they considered the choice set to be desirable, or to what extent they were satisfied with the chosen alternative. These measurements were correlated with Logsums that were computed for each choice situation. In addition, the paper derives a regret-based Logsum (which gives the expected regret of a choice situation) and presents a comparison with its utilitarian counterpart. Also for this regret-based Logsum, correlations with desirability- and satisfaction-ratings are computed. As a general finding, it appears that all computed correlations are rather weak. This suggests that, at least in the context of our data, the utility-based Logsum and its regret-based counterpart appear to have only a fairly weak connection with the behavioral notions of choice set-desirability and choice-satisfaction.

Data were drawn from national censuses, vital and cause-of-death statistics and seven National Health Surveys dating from 1987 to 2006 (almost 100,000 subjects aged 20-79 were used to compute cohort height averages). A multivariate regression analysis was performed on infant mortality and economic/historical dummy variables. Our results agree with the general timing of the health transition process in Spain as has been described to date insofar as we document that there was a rapid improvement of sanitary and health care related factors during the second half of the 20th century reflected by a steady decline in infant mortality and increase in adult height. However, the association between adult height and infant mortality turned out to be not linear. In addition, remarkable gender differences emerged: mean height increased continuously for male cohorts born after 1940 but meaningful improvements in height among female cohorts was not attained until the late 1950s.

The statistical tests suggest no significant instability in the narrow money demand relationship despite financial deregulation and innovation in Australia since the early 1980s.

It examines how the concept emerged and has been defined, and identifies its scope of application. 'Representativeness' is mostly used to refer to organizational features of the interest groups (organizational representativeness), but is occasionally used in relation to representative aspects of the overall system of interest representation (system representativeness). The focus is primarily on aspects of 'descriptive representativeness' - in particular, territorial and thematic representativeness - rather than on 'procedural representativeness' that guarantees authorization and accountability. Originally applied to the social partners only, the White Paper on European Governance proposed to extend the use of representativeness to the wider category of civil society organizations. It will be shown that the application of the concept to these organizations proves more problematic than it does to the social partners. The European Transparency Initiative subsequently abandons representativeness, but it is argued that it contains the seeds for its re-emergence.","[Borragan, Nieves Perez-Solorzano] Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, Bristol BS8 1TY, Avon, England; [Smismans, Stijn] Cardiff Law Sch, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Smismans, Stijn] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, Wales",University of Bristol; Cardiff University; Cardiff University,"Borragan, NPS (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, 4 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TY, Avon, England.",n.perez-solorzano@bristol.ac.uk; smismanss@cardiff.ac.uk,"Smismans, Stijn/ABC-9956-2020","Smismans, Stijn/0000-0002-6072-7389; Perez-Solorzano Borragan, Nieves/0000-0001-7652-7018",,,,,25,10,12,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The empirical results show that there are significant positive abnormal stock returns for the parent companies when their own teams qualified for the final championship series, and the parent companies have higher and more significant cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) when their teams win the championship. It is noteworthy that the stocks of parent companies experience significantly positive ARs prior to the event day when their team wins the title earlier. Additionally, the retail industry has more significant positive abnormal stock returns when teams backed by this industry win the championship, as compared with non-retail industries. The related sports marketing expenses and teams' operations do affect firm values during the postseason period. The authors reasonably conclude that the retail industry is the most likely sector to adopt sports marketing strategies to enhance firm performances and profits, especially for those companies that own professional baseball teams.","[Chen, Chun-Da] Tennessee State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Chen, Chih-Chun] Fo Guang Univ, Dept Management, Yilan, Taiwan",Tennessee State University; Fo Guang University,"Chen, CC (通讯作者)，Tennessee State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, 330 10th Ave N, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",cchen2@tnstate.edu,"Chen, Chun-Da D/O-1454-2017; Chen, Chun-Da Derek/HZK-9205-2023","Chen, Chun-Da D/0000-0001-8527-8375; Chen, Chun-Da Derek/0000-0001-8527-8375",,,,,40,13,13,1,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

To this aim, we develop a simple model and design a laboratory experiment that allows us to compare individual versus paired decisions across two treatments, where pairs are, respectively, exogenously and endogenously formed. In both treatments, paired subjects decide individually and independently how to allocate their wealth over a portfolio of lotteries and fully commit to share any winnings. The main result from our experiment is that whenever agents are allowed to choose a gambling partner they decide to team up with other agents who display the same degree of risk aversion as themselves. Moreover, paired choices consistently involve higher risk taking than individual choices. This finding is more evident when information on subjects' risk attitudes is made available and when subjects team up in homogeneous pairs, thereby confirming that subjects successfully exploit the benefits of mutual insurance.","[Sciubba, Emanuela] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Econ Math & Stat, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Di Cagno, Daniela] LUISS Guido Carli, Rome, Italy; [Spallone, Marco] UG DAnnunzio Chieti & Pescara, Pescara, Italy",University of London; Birkbeck University London; Luiss Guido Carli University; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Sciubba, E (通讯作者)，Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",esciubba@econ.bbk.ac.uk,,"Sciubba, Emanuela/0000-0002-1962-6869; di cagno, daniela/0000-0002-9208-7654",,,,,31,4,5,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2012,72.0,4,,,,,537.0,571,,10.1007/s11238-011-9267-2,0.0,,,35,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,892LK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300287500007,0

The authors provide boat operators with strategic information that will help them to develop new tourism products so they can continue to provide anglers with offshore access in an increasingly competitive regulatory environment. For a better understanding of fishing tourists' trade-off oriented preferences for new product offerings, a stated preference choice model was employed. Two different data analyses were conducted: an aggregate model and segmented models of resident and out-of-state anglers. The preference results indicated that anglers were interested in including non-fishing elements.

Finally, exchange rate volatility appears to have played a relatively less important role in these cross real estatestock correlations.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Liow, KH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",rstlkh@nus.edu.sg,"Liow, KimHiang/K-7295-2013",,,,,,26,65,69,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2012,40.0,1,,,,,97.0,129,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2011.00314.x,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,897RF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300671800004,0

This paper analyzes and quantifies the induced demand for road transport for Spain's main regions from 1998 to 2006, years that saw mobility in Spain attain its highest growth rate. The lack of research in this area involving Spain and the key role played by the sector, given its high level of energy consumption and the negative externalities associated with it (accidents, noise, traffic congestion, emissions, etc.), endow greater relevance to this type of research. Based on a Dynamic Panel Data (DPD) reduced-form model, we apply alternative approaches (fixed and random effects and GMM-based methods) for measuring the induced demand. The results obtained provide evidence for the existence of an induced demand for transport in Spain, though said results vary depending on the estimating method employed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our method does not impose an explicit assumption of (asymptotic) smoothness of the statistic of interest with respect to the model's parameters and thus is especially useful in cases where such smoothness is difficult to establish. Instead, we use a locally uniform convergence in distribution condition, which is automatically satisfied by residual-based specification test statistics. To illustrate, we derive the limiting distribution of a new functional form specification test for discrete choice models, as well as a runs-based tests for conditional symmetry in dynamic volatility models.","[Andreou, Elena] Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Werker, Bas J.

For what we call the infimum of expectations class of risk measures, we show that if the decision maker (DM) maximizes the expectation of a random prospect under constraint that the risk measure is bounded above, he then behaves as a generalized expected utility maximizer in the following sense. The DM exhibits ambiguity with respect to a family of utility functions defined on a larger set of decisions than the original one; he adopts pessimism and performs first a minimization of expected utility over this family, then performs a maximization over a new decisions set. This economic behaviour is called maxmin under risk and studied by Maccheroni (Econ Theory 19:823-831, 2002). As an application, we make the link between an expected prospect maximization problem, subject to conditional value-at-risk being less than a threshold value, and a non-expected utility economic formulation involving loss aversion-type utility functions.","[Seck, Babacar; De Lara, Michel] Univ Paris Est, CERM, F-77455 Marne La Vallee 2, France; [Andrieu, Laetitia] Elect France R&D, F-92141 Clamart, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Electricite de France (EDF),"De Lara, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, CERM, 6-8 Ave Blaise Pascal, F-77455 Marne La Vallee 2, France.",seck@cermics.enpc.fr; laetitia.andrieu@edf.fr; delara@cermics.enpc.fr,,,,,,,19,2,3,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2012,72.0,2,,,,,257.0,271,,10.1007/s11238-011-9255-6,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,885JC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299774200007,0

These aspects are part of the social responsibility of an organization i.e. the corporate social responsibility. Corporate social responsibility means taking responsibility for all the activities and following the principles that can be modified and applied regardless of the size of the business. Every organization has its own characteristics. Leaders form the characteristics by shaping the organizational goal i.e. organizational mission and basic organizational values that are transferred to the employees and by which their behaviour influenced. The management of the organization must be certain that the goal, mission and basic organizational values that have already been approved in the tourist organization, will be accepted by all those that will influence or will have any benefit from it. Tourist agencies social responsibility can be defined as success in the business activities that is gained not only by adhering the laws and regulations, but by approach that accomplishes balance between economic, ecological and social goals, on a way that is useful for the citizens, community and society. Tourist agencies in order to deal with the social needs have to decide how to outrun the minimal conditions and responsibilities that are part of the law and labor agreement.

Such an approach ignores the significant sources of discontinuity and rupture between the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia. The essay presents an alternative framework for understanding and conceptualising Russia's engagement with the Middle East. This has three dimensions and takes an 'inside-out' approach. First, there are the domestic drivers for Russian engagement which is linked to the perceived need to counter the threat of secessionism in the North Caucasus and the potential broader radicalisation of Russia's Muslim population. Second, there are the more strictly economic interests in the Middle East, which include increasingly important trading relations with moderate pro-Western states in the region. And, third, there are the geopolitical considerations which certainly include potential competition with the West but also incorporate Russian ambitions to promote its credentials as a responsible great power supporting international norms, such as the principle of non-proliferation and a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The tension and conflict between these two strands of Russian policy making have been notably present in Moscow's responses to the Arab Spring.","Univ Westminster, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Languages, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Level 5,32-38 Wells St, London WIT 3UW, England",University of Westminster,"Dannreuther, R (通讯作者)，Univ Westminster, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Languages, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Level 5,32-38 Wells St, London WIT 3UW, England.",R.Dannreuther@westminster.ac.uk,,,,,,,62,15,17,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,3,,,SI,,543.0,560,,10.1080/09668136.2012.661922,0.0,,,18,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,943ZT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304167900008,0

Market knowledge and operative planning are two phenomena which appear to be more and more interlinked and the changes in planning should reflect the future events on the free market. Estimating future demand is a necessary prerequisite for satisfying customers' needs in a more efficient way. It allows companies to focus on more economical resources and cut overheads in the pursuit for rationalization. The article presents the results of a research conducted in 2011 among 271 enterprises in the Czech Republic. The research was focused on analyzing the current state of implementation of demand management in domestic companies and also how this concept of management is perceived in these companies. The research has shown that companies take a very narrow approach to the term demand management seeing it solely as a process of demand forecasting. As a result of this, the companies are limited in gaining potential benefits which the concept of demand management can bring.","[Dobes, Kamil] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Dept Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,dobes@fame.utb.cz,"Dobeš, Kamil/H-6568-2012","Dobes, Kamil/0000-0003-1448-1936",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,685.0,696,,,,,,12,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700070,0

In the second half of the 1930s, Hicks's ideas on equilibrium and capital progressively change. With the publication of Value and Capital in 1939, this process culminates in the rediscovery of an equilibrium concept, Hicks's temporary equilibrium, that is similar to the one adopted by Walras and Pareto about forty years before. Yet such direct link with the Walrasian tradition is not overtly recognised: on the contrary, the essentially Walrasian character of Hicks's temporary equilibrium approach is carefully disguised under Marshallian garments. The paper aims at clarifying the reasons behind the winding path followed by Hicks over the 1930s.","Univ Milan, Dipartimento Econ Management & Metodi Quantitativ, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Donzelli, F (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dipartimento Econ Management & Metodi Quantitativ, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",franco.donzelli@unimi.it,,,,,,,84,0,0,0,6,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

However, travel demand modelling has been undergoing a paradigm shift from the traditional trip-based approach to an activity-based approach. The activity-based approach is intended to capture the influences of different policy variables at various stages of activity-travel decision making processes. Parking is a key policy variable that captures land use and transportation interactions in urban areas. It is important that the influences of parking choice on activity scheduling behaviour be identified fully. This paper investigates this issue using a sample data set collected in Montreal, Canada. Parking type choice and activity scheduling decision (start time choice) are modelled jointly in order to identify the effects of parking type choice on activity scheduling behaviour. Empirical investigation gives strong evidence that parking type choice influences activity scheduling process. The empirical findings of this investigation challenge the validity of the traditional conception which considers parking choice as exogenous variable only in the mode choice component of travel demand models.

It is affected by the magnitude, timing and riskiness, or volatility, of the cash flows. We hypothesize that if the expected values of two assets' cash flows are equal, the value of the asset with more volatile cash flows will be lower. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the volatility of cash flows on the volatility of prices. We consider a simple experimental environment where subjects trade in an asset which provides dividends from a known probability distribution. The expected value of the dividends is identical in all experimental treatments. The treatments vary with respect to the volatility of dividends. We find that when dividends are more volatile, transaction prices are lower. We also find that the volatility of prices is lower in the treatment with highly volatile dividends. In addition, as expected, trading volume is lower when cash flows are less volatile.","[Ikromov, Nuriddin] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Coll Business Adm, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Yavas, Abdullah] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA",California State University System; California State University Sacramento; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Ikromov, N (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Sacramento, Coll Business Adm, Tahoe Hall 2047,6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",ikromovn@csus.edu; ayavas@bus.wisc.edu,,,,,,,26,7,9,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This study aims to explore the factors that drive innovativeness of small and medium enterprises in Sri Lanka. Drawing upon data from 124 firms, the analysis was carried out using correlation and hierarchical linear regression analysis. The findings reveal the fact that besides firm internal factors such as strategic orientation, market orientation and structural flexibility, the external factors such as association with other firms and government assistance programs have positive impact on the firm innovativeness. In addition, high cost of innovation, lack of appropriate sources for finance and lack of information about technology and market are discovered as the obstacles which discourage the innovativeness in small and medium enterprises.","[Jayathilake, Bandula; Hu Shuhua] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,,bandulapmb@yahoo.com; sjxwhsh@163.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,432.0,438,,,,,,7,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500067,0

Thus, the provision of electricity and other forms of modern energy has been a priority for many development organizations, including the World Bank. However few impact studies of electrification have taken the endogeneity of the grid connection into account. Using a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2005 of 20,900 rural households in Bangladesh, this paper examines the welfare impacts of household access to grid electricity after controlling for endogeneity bias. The econometric analysis shows that grid electrification has significant positive impacts on household income, expenditure, and education. The household gain in total income due to electrification is as high as 21 percent, with a 1.5 percentage point reduction in poverty per year The results also suggest that the income and expenditure effects of electricity connection are higher for better-off households. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol33-No1-7","[Khandker, Shahidur R.; Barnes, Douglas F.; Samad, Hussain A.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Khandker, SR (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",skhandker@worldbank.org,,,Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP); Development Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME),Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP); Development Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME),"This is a revised version of a study published as a World Bank discussion paper (WPS4859).

In the decoding stage, the meanings of an advertising work tend to be unlimited according to the selectivity principle of understanding, because the communication based on new media has special characteristics such as personality and interaction which highlight the power of the audiences' interpretations of advertisements.

The benefits of scale arise from the nature of public goods, and include economic exchange, political power and protection against external shocks. Communities are double-edged in that they are characterized by parochial altruism. Altruism and social solidarity facilitate government within communities, but parochial attachments constrain government among communities. Scale and community, as theorized here, provide a setting for strategic choice. Both are in flux as patterns of human interaction change, and government itself shapes those patterns.

The major findings of this paper suggest that commuter's mode choice can be affected by various public policy tools. In particular, we find commuters' drive alone to work rate decreases as a response to higher SOV parking charges, higher HOV parking discount, and lower onsite parking space ratio. When employers provide reserved parking for HOV and HOV fleet vehicles for shared riders, commuters' likelihood to share ride to work also increases. Commuters also respond to direct financial subsidies to alternative modes positively. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The neweurasia project began in 2005 as an English-language volunteer-run blog project about the former Soviet republics of Central Asia and the Caucasus, rapidly becoming one of the most visited blogs about the region. Following this auspicious start, over the next five years neweurasia developed into a multi-language locally driven project with more than 80,000 unique page views on average per month. Despite its indisputable successes, the project was often a steep learning curve for all involved. In this essay, we examine neweurasia's evolution from 'blogging Central Asia' towards a citizen media project, and reflect on some of the issues and challenges encountered. On the basis of our discussion, we reflect upon how neweurasia, and citizen media in general, can maximise its impact on the nascent Stanosphere, in the process helping to give Central Asia a voice in the global blogosphere.","[Wilkinson, Cai] Deakin Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Fac Arts & Educ, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Wilkinson, C (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Fac Arts & Educ, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",cai.wilkinson@deakin.edu.au; mursya@yandex.ru,,"Wilkinson, Cai/0000-0002-8702-750X",,,,,31,5,7,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,8,,,SI,,1395.0,1414,,10.1080/09668136.2012.712267,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,008TA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308978300004,0

A special focus is applied to two groups of the member states: the euro zone, due to its significance in the European economy, but also other states that joined the EU with Poland during the same period. Interestingly, the coherence between the Polish and the euro zone business cycles is high, while it is much lower between Poland and the other new member states. The data also proves that Poland had benefited from the accession to the EU, even though this happened during an unfavorable period of the business cycle of the euro zone's countries. The analysis performed illustrates that the Polish business cycle over the years is becoming closer to the euro zone's cycle, while remaining behind it in phase. This conclusion is vital to some companies, as it might help them in mid-term strategy planning.","[Wyrobek, Joanna; Stanczyk, Zbigniew] Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland; [Zachara, Marek] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Krakow, Poland",AGH University of Krakow,"Wyrobek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland.",wyrobekj@uek.krakow.pl; stanczyz@uek.krakow.pl; mzachara@agh.edu.pl,"Zachara, Marek/E-5076-2012","Zachara, Marek/0000-0002-8560-9696",,,,,10,2,2,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,998.0,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900171,0

Next, we provide two alternative MILP formulations that can be used to find the optimal schedule under the given criteria; these formulations take into account the specific crew structure of the fast food restaurant (full-time vs. part-time employees, underage temporary jobs etc.), as well as its specific criteria. We discuss and compare the computational tractability of the proposed models for small-scale applications and comment on solution concepts for large-scale ones.

In this perspective, the paper aims at exploring the weaknesses and constraints which hamper the progress of this sector and proposes strategies to develop the different steps of the value chain. To fulfill this objective, a methodology based on a value chain analysis was undertaken. Results show the dominance of informal activity which leads to an unfair competition with the organized sector, price fluctuations and an unequal distribution of economic margins between producers. This difference between farmers' margins and market margin and the lack of coordination between actors, highlights the need for a vertical integration between the three sub-sectors (production, processing and commercialization) and the necessity to encourage informal producers to get involved in the sector organization.","[Ben Abdallah, Saker; Elfkih, Saida; Fourati, Hayet] Inst Olivier Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Abdelkafi, Bel-Hassen] Ecole Super Agri Mograne, Mograne, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax; Institut de l'Olivier,"Ben Abdallah, S (通讯作者)，Inst Olivier Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,5,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2014,13.0,4,,,,,20.0,29,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CD5HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351118700003,0

This article examines this question by testing an explanatory framework that emphasizes the inter-organizational context in which lobbying takes place and interest groups' resource endowment. The empirical analysis focuses on environmental policy-making. The findings show that interest groups' preference articulation behaviour is largely influenced by the number of inter-organizational linkages they have with other stakeholders. Resource endowment matters in that resource-rich interest organizations are found to be less likely to articulate their preferences via open consultations. Interest groups' organizational form is also a relevant predictor of the likelihood they articulate preferences: in consultations, European federations voice more preferences than national or individual organizations.","European Univ Inst, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy",European University Institute,"Bunea, A (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Via Roccettini 9, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy.",adriana.bunea@eui.eu,,,,,,,35,21,23,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We first sketch a theoretical model with regulated prices and derive conditions on demand and cost functions which determine whether a hospital will increase its quality if its rivals increase their quality. We then apply spatial econometric methods to a sample of English hospitals in 2009-10 and a set of 16 quality measures including mortality rates, readmission, revision and redo rates, and three patient reported indicators, to examine the relationship between the quality of hospitals. We find that a hospital's quality is positively associated with the quality of its rivals for seven out of the sixteen quality measures. There are no statistically significant negative associations. In those cases where there is a significant positive association, an increase in rivals' quality by 10% increases a hospital's quality by 1.7% to 2.9%.

I obtain new insights on this topic, mainly using a precise measure for outsourcing and analyzing differences across industries. Using an unbalanced panel of Spanish manufacturing firms, I estimate a production function depending on traditional inputs (labor, capital, and materials) and an index of production subcontracting. I find that for manufacturing as a whole, outsourcing intensity has a positive effect on productivity, showing an elasticity of output with respect to outsourcing around 0.15. When analyzing industry level results, I find that outsourcing intensity has a positive effect on productivity, mainly for firms belonging to light industries.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"López, A (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",alberto.lopez@ccee.ucm.es,"Lopez, Alberto/K-7685-2014","Lopez, Alberto/0000-0001-8252-1368",,,,,35,11,12,1,26,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Political Conditionality and the Crucial Case of Serbia's (Non-)Co-operation with the ICTY,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EUROPEANIZATION; STATES,"Seeking to explain the difficult cases of delayed democratic transition in the Western Balkans, recent literature argues that 'national identity' significantly limits the effectiveness of external actors' political conditionality. This argument is tested in this article by investigating Serbia's co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which was demanded by the United States and the European Union (EU). The findings show that incidents of Serbian co-operation with the ICTY were not preceded by widespread national identity change; rather, co-operation occurred when Serbia was faced with consistent external pressure and the immediate prospect of small-scale rewards. Conditionality thus remained effective. These findings challenge theoretical arguments that issues of national identity may impede external actors' projection of power, independently of domestic actors' cost-benefit calculations. Moreover, they suggest that, in the future, external actors such as the EU may continue to rely upon political conditionality for their democratization agenda, even concerning domestically sensitive issue-areas.","[Pawelec, Maria] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Pawelec, Maria] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Grimm, Sonja] Univ Konstanz, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Bath; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Konstanz,"Grimm, S (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, POB 86, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",sonja.grimm@uni-konstanz.de,"Pawelec, Maria/HKN-7090-2023","Pawelec, Maria/0000-0003-2728-7796",,,,,78,10,10,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

However, research is limited as conventional data collection methods are both time and labour intensive. In this paper, we present the first use of smart card data to study passenger boarding/alighting behaviour and its impact on bus dwell time. Given the nature of these data, we focus on passenger activity time and do not account for the time necessary to open and close doors. We study single decker, double decker and articulated buses and identify the specific effects of floor/entrance type, number of activities and occupancy on both boarding and alighting dynamics. A linear relationship between average boarding and alighting times and their respective standard deviations is also found, whereas the variability of boarding and alighting time decreases with the number of passengers boarding and alighting. After observing the cumulative boarding/alighting processes under different occupancy conditions, we propose a new model to estimate passenger activity time, by introducing critical occupancy - a parameter incorporating the friction between boarding/alighting and on-board passengers. We conduct regression analyses with the proposed and another popular model for simultaneous boarding/alighting processes, finding that the critical occupancy plays a significant role in determining the regime of boarding and alighting processes and the overall activity time. Our results provide potential implications for practice and policy, such as identifying optimal vehicle type for a particular route and modelling transit service reliability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The conventional wisdom is that a play-off would be a more fair way to determine the national champion, and more fun for fans to watch. The colleges finally agreed to begin a play-off in the 2014-2015 season, but with just four teams, and speculation continues that more teams will be added soon. A subtle downside to adding play-off teams is that it reduces the significance of regular season games. We use the framework of Ely, Frankel, and Kamenica (in press) to directly estimate the utility fans would get from this significance, that is, utility from suspense, under a range of play-off scenarios. Our results consistently indicate that play-off expansion causes a loss in regular season suspense utility greater than the gain in the postseason, implying the traditional bowl system (two team play-off) is suspense-optimal. We analyze and discuss implications for TV viewership and other contexts.","[Olson, Jarrod] Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Stone, Daniel F.] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA",Oregon State University; Bowdoin College,"Stone, DF (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",dstone@bowdoin.edu,,,,,,,21,4,4,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

While new technologies continually promise enhanced performance, not least by extending managerial control, the implementation of these technologies is an emergent process that requires effort by workers to establish new routines that embed innovations into everyday work. This article considers the role that trust may play in this process. Drawing on a theoretical framework which conceptualizes trust as an organizing principle of organizational activity, and placing this in a wider context where trust may be understood as an element of normative control in the workplace, the role of trust in technical innovation in three healthcare call centres is explored. The research reveals heterogeneous trusting relations between managers, staff and technical systems shaping the process of change and suggests that whilst managerialist efforts to generate trust maybe one element of this, the operation of trust at work is more complex.","[Prichard, Jane; Turnbull, Joanne] Univ Southampton, Fac Hlth Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Halford, Susan; Pope, Catherine] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton; University of Southampton,"Prichard, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",J.S.Prichard@soton.ac.uk,"Turnbull, Joanne/AFV-9843-2022","Halford, Susan/0000-0001-5102-1790; Pope, Catherine/0000-0002-8935-6702; Prichard, Jane/0000-0001-7455-2244; Turnbull, Joanne/0000-0002-5006-4438",National Institute for Health Research Service Delivery and Organisation programme; National Institute for Health Research [08/1819/217] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research Service Delivery and Organisation programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Service Delivery and Organisation programme and its findings published in Pope C, Turnbull J, Halford S, Prichard J, Calestani M, Salisbury C et al.

Using German data, we address the question of whether early work experience pays off upon labour market entry. We compare the labour market benefits of different types of work experience. This comparison allows us to more generally test hypotheses about different explanations of why education pays off. Results indicate that tertiary graduates do not profit from work experience that is unrelated to the field of study or was a mandatory part of the study programme. Even though field-related and voluntary work experience helps graduates to realize a fast integration into the labour market, it is not linked to higher chances for entering a favourable class position or to higher wages in the long run. These results provide evidence for the signalling explanation of educational benefits in the labour market rather than the human capital explanation.","[Weiss, Felix] Univ Cologne, Inst Sociol & Social Psychol, Cologne, Germany; [Weiss, Felix] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Klein, Markus] Univ Edinburgh, Appl Quantitat Methods Network AQMeN, Moray House Sch Educ, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Grauenhorst, Thomas] Univ Mannheim, Ctr Doctoral Studies Social & Behav Sci, Mannheim, Germany",University of Cologne; Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS); University of Edinburgh; University of Mannheim,"Weiss, F (通讯作者)，GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, B2,1, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",Felix.Weiss@gesis.org,"Klein, Markus/I-3937-2017; Weiss, Felix/ACH-8085-2022; Weiss, Felix/B-6422-2011","Klein, Markus/0000-0003-1195-8938; Weiss, Felix/0000-0002-1685-3732;","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01JG1096, 01JG0926]; ESRC [ES/K006460/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006460/1] Funding Source: researchfish",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research received funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, grants 01JG1096 and 01JG0926.",,47,55,64,3,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Such politically motivated interpersonal violence committed by authoritarian leaders has never before been theorized. Through a comparison of Hussein and Stalin, we explain why some dictators engage in this behavior and others do not. We propose a model based on three components: the individual's prior habituation or non-habituation to violence; regime characteristics that 'select for' a personally violent or non-violent ruler; and, once a ruler takes power, the interaction of the first two variables. We also suggest that most communist regimes featured organizational characteristics that discouraged such violence by the leader.","[Light, Matthew; Gartner, Rosemary; Strbac, Milomir] Univ Toronto, Ctr Criminol & Sociolegal Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Light, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Ctr Criminol & Sociolegal Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada.",matthew.light@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,107,2,2,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

To conduct our analysis, we construct measures of import-related layoffs at the ZIP code level and combine these with ZIP code-level establishment counts. We find that import-related layoffs in manufacturing have large negative effects on the survival rate of existing establishments and the entry rate of new establishments in manufacturing, non-manufacturing, and even non-offshoreable sectors. These negative effects are larger in the longer-term than in the near-term. Additionally, these negative impacts spillover into nearby ZIP codes but that the effects diminish over space. Finally, we find evidence that agglomeration economies associated with more densely populated areas appear to mitigate the negative impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis uses a Swedish career break program where applications were accepted until local funds were exhausted. The rejected applicants serve as counterfactuals to derive estimates that are unaffected by selection or omitted variables. The estimated wage effect of a 10-month-long break is negative and in the order of 3 % 1-2 years after the interruption. The average applicant is estimated to have substantially lower returns to experience than the average worker. The results thus show that career breaks are costly, even for groups with low expected returns to experience, and in an environment with very compressed wages. The career breaks also induced an increase in job and task mobility whereas post-leave labor supply remained unaffected except for workers close to retirement.","[Skans, Oskar Nordstrom; Liljeberg, Linus] Inst Evaluat Labour Market & Educ Policy IFAU, Uppsala, Sweden; [Skans, Oskar Nordstrom] IZA, Uppsala, Sweden; [Skans, Oskar Nordstrom] Uppsala Ctr Labor Studies, Uppsala, Sweden",,"Skans, ON (通讯作者)，Inst Evaluat Labour Market & Educ Policy IFAU, Uppsala, Sweden.",oskar.nordstrom_skans@ifau.uu.se; Linus.liljeberg@ifau.uu.se,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

To evaluate these projections, previous papers compare the midpoint of the range with the realized outcome. This paper proposes an alternative approach to forecast evaluation that takes account of the interval nature of projections. It is shown that using the conventional Mincer-Zarnowitz approach to evaluate FOMC forecasts misses important information contained in the width of the forecast interval. This additional information plays a minor role at short forecast horizons but turns out to be of sometimes crucial importance for longer-horizon forecasts. For 18-month-ahead forecasts, the variation of members' projections contains information that is more relevant for explaining future inflation than information embodied in the midpoint. Likewise, when longer-range forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are considered, the width of the forecast interval comprises information over and above the one given by the midpoint alone.","[Fischer, Henning; Winker, Peter] Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, D-35394 Giessen, Germany; [Garcia-Barzana, Marta] Univ Oviedo, Dept Stat & Operat Res & Math Didact, Oviedo 33007, Spain; [Tillmann, Peter] Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Oviedo; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Fischer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, Licher Str 64, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.",henning.fischer@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de; garciabarmarta.uo@uniovi.es; peter.tillmann@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de; peter.winker@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,"Winker, Peter/D-1389-2011","Winker, Peter/0000-0003-3412-4207",,,,,34,6,7,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

For example, consider choosing a dish in a restaurant after going through different menu cards (a menu card for buffet, another for combo offers etc.). The decision maker observes the items displayed (as a list) on a menu card and she switches to another menu card to see the items displayed on it (again in the form of another list). Thus the set of all items appears as an ordered-tree to the decision maker. There are other examples of decision making where alternatives appear in the form of an ordered-tree. In this paper we consider the cases of choice from ordered-trees (in particular, lists of lists) and characterize the choice functions. We impose the axioms of Backward Consistency and Replacement Indifference on choice functions and obtain characterization results for -ary ordered-trees and more general ordered-trees. We show that the results for are similar to those of (Rubinstein and Salant 2006), in which the cases of choice from lists are considered. However the results for and general ordered-trees are different and allow for instance, a richer class of tie-breaking rules in special cases.","Shiv Nadar Univ, Greater Noida, Nct Delhi, India",Shiv Nadar University,"Mukherjee, S (通讯作者)，Shiv Nadar Univ, Greater Noida, Nct Delhi, India.",saptarshi.isi@gmail.com,"Mukherjee, Saptarshi/O-6376-2018",,,,,,16,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2014,43.0,2,,,,,471.0,496,,10.1007/s00355-013-0778-3,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AM5JO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339894000010,0

The production costs capture the total quality cost, which, in turn, can also represent the R&D cost. We first present the equilibrium version and derive alternative variational inequality formulations. We then construct the projected dynamical systems model, which provides a continuous-time evolution of the firms' product shipments and product quality levels, and whose set of stationary points coincides with the set of solutions to the variational inequality problem. We establish stability analysis results using a monotonicity approach and construct a discrete-time version of the continuous-time adjustment process, which yields an algorithm, with closed form expressions at each iteration. The algorithm is then utilized to compute solutions to several numerical examples. The framework can serve as the foundation for the modeling and analysis of competition among firms in industries ranging from food to pharmaceuticals to durable goods and high tech products, as well as Internet services, where quality and product differentiation are seminal.","[Nagurney, Anna; Li, Dong] Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Nagurney, Anna] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Gothenburg,"Nagurney, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",nagurney@isenberg.umass.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF) CISE [1111276]; School of Business, Economics and Law at the University of Gothenburg; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1111276] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF) CISE(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); School of Business, Economics and Law at the University of Gothenburg; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))","This research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant CISE #1111276, for the NeTS: Large: Collaborative Research: Network Innovation Through Choice project awarded to the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

This essay surveys his intellectual legacy, beginning with his early work with John Kain. Their research pioneered the application of hedonic price models to housing micro-data, and kicked off a literature that asked whether housing market discrimination led African-Americans to pay more for equivalent units. Over four decades, Quigley continued to develop housing price models, championing a hybrid approach that used both repeat sales and other transactions. Together with Robert Van Order, Quigley developed empirical tests of rational mortgage default and prepayments. Their work found that frictionless models are often rejected by the data. Quigley's work on green buildings documented their high economic returns; his work on homelessness pointed to high housing prices and overly restrictive supply regulations. Together with Karl Case and Robert Shiller, Quigley demonstrated the strong effects of housing wealth on consumption.

One important chronic health condition linked to obesity is pediatric asthma. Although researchers have speculated that both conditions may have common origins, the majority of research in this area has focused on a unidirectional relationship between obesity and later asthma. However, much of the literature is limited by its reliance on cross-sectional data and its failure to examine the possibility that asthma may influence weight fluctuations through changes in physical and sedentary activity. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), I explore the bidirectional relationships between childhood obesity and asthma. The results in this paper suggest that past asthma levels are positively correlated with changes in BMI and the onset of obesity. However, only new onset asthma is positively correlated with subsequent changes in BMI. The potential mechanisms are unclear, as I find little evidence that asthma is structurally related to changes in physical or sedentary activity over time. When testing the prevailing hypothesis that obesity is related to subsequent asthma, I find that lagged weight status is strongly related to asthma prevalence levels but that the onset of overweight or obesity is not associated with the subsequent onset of asthma. These results suggest that the onset of asthma may be related to subsequent weight gain over time.

The effort to secure initial possession thereby creates a legacy effect, reducing subsequent investments in housing quality.

Although PR's performances presented a coherent alternative to the Putin regime's image of Russian reality, it was unlikely that the discordant music and crude lyrics of their art protest would inspire Russian society to take to the streets. Yet, the regime mounted a very visible prosecution against the three young women. We argue that the trial marked a shift in the Kremlin's strategy to shape state-society relations. In the face of declining economic conditions and social unrest, the PR trial encapsulated the Kremlin's renewed focus on three related mechanisms to insure social support: coercion, alliance building, and symbolic politics. The PR trial afforded the Kremlin an important opportunity to simultaneously redefine its loyal constituency, secure the Church-state relationship, and stigmatize the opposition.","[Smyth, Regina] Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Soboleva, Irina] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Polit Sci, Moscow, Russia",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Smyth, R (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rsmyth@indiana.edu,"Soboleva, Ira/ABC-6496-2020","Soboleva, Ira/0000-0003-4934-4085",,,,,58,40,48,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Air transport demand models typically assume a perfectly reversible impact of the demand drivers. However, there are reasons to believe that the impacts of some of the demand drivers such as fuel price or income on air transport demand may not be perfectly reversible. Two types of imperfect reversibility, namely asymmetry and hysteresis, are possible. Asymmetry refers to the differences in the demand impacts of a rising price or income from that of a falling price or income. Hysteresis refers to the dependence of the impacts of changing price or income on previous history, especially on previous maximum price or income. We use US time series data and decompose each of fuel price and income into three component series to develop an econometric model for air transport demand that is capable of capturing the potential imperfectly reversible relationships and test for the presence or absence of reversibility. We find statistical evidence of asymmetry and hysteresis for both, prices and income in air transport demand. Implications for policy and practice are then discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These changes combine new acceptance of these policy instruments with an older emphasis on their negative consequences and on the desirability of free movement of capital. Policy change of this sort is puzzling from the standpoint of the existing literature on international organisations (IOs), which has thus far paid little attention to transformative incremental change associated with long-term contestation. This article departs from this tendency by drawing on insights from principal-agent theory, constructivism and historical institutionalism to identify the conditions under which such change may originate. I argue that actors within IOs are likely to pursue incremental change by layering new policies on to old ones as a way to build coalitions and to respond to external organisational insecurity imperatives and diverse member state preferences and to internal path-dependent organisational cultural features. Over time the incremental shifts brought by layering can induce transformative rather than reproductive change because they fit with consequentialist and appropriateness behavioural logics. I illustrate this argument by investigating recent changes in IMF policy on capital controls.","London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Chwieroth, JM (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.m.chwieroth@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,99,36,37,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Yet literature on the geography of knowledge transfer shows that knowledge is spatially sticky, suggesting that the impact of patents can be exaggerated. Using interview evidence, this paper explores how Indian pharmaceutical firms have responded to changes in patent law, including the introduction of more extensive patent protection in 2005 as a condition of TRIPs. A regime of limited patent protection for over three decades prior to TRIPs facilitated informal knowledge transfer and the emergence of a pharmaceutical industry with significant domestic capabilities. Contrary to some expectations, the Indian pharmaceutical industry has continued to grow post-TRIPs, with large domestic firms becoming involved in more formal technology transfer as part of an increasingly collaborative relationship with multinationals. This trend is also driven by a focus on the markets of developed countries, raising questions for the future sustainability of India's low-priced medicines. While changes in patent law can facilitate or inhibit a variety of aspects of development, the adaptation of the Indian pharmaceutical industry suggests that their impact must be related to the broader institutional setting, particularly the underlying domestic capabilities.","Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Horner, R (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",rhorner@clarku.edu,,"Horner, Rory/0000-0002-8730-2014",,,,,101,22,23,5,69,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In such a setting, it may not only be of interest to determine whether the program or treatment has an effect on some sub-population defined by these observed characteristics, but also to determine for which sub-populations, if any, there is an effect. This paper treats this problem as a multiple testing problem in which each null hypothesis in the family of null hypotheses specifies whether the program has an effect on the outcome of interest for a particular sub-population. We develop our methodology in the context of PROGRESA, a large-scale poverty-reduction program in Mexico. In our application, the outcome of interest is the school enrollment rate and the sub-populations are defined by gender and highest grade completed. Under weak assumptions, the testing procedure we construct controls the familywise error rate-the probability of even one false rejection-in finite samples. Similar to earlier studies, we find that the program has a significant effect on the school enrollment rate, but only for a much smaller number of sub-populations when compared to results that do not adjust for multiple testing.

First and foremost, it shows that his theory of unemployment is coherent - what Beveridge refers to as 'the reserve of labour' represents 'unemployment' as a whole; unemployment is due to the imperfection of the labour market and associated friction and the organisation of the labour market is necessary. Second, it suggests that as early as 1909, a negative relationship already existed between unemployment and job vacancies and that the segmentation of the labour market and imperfect information are key factors of friction. The first part of the paper provides a reconstruction of Beveridge's theory of the reserve of labour (1909) including causes and factors of unemployment and unemployment policies. The second part shows that certain founding principles of the 'Beveridge curve' (Beveridge 1944 [1953]) were already to be found in his 1909 book and that links can be established between Beveridge (1909), Phelps (1970) and Pissarides (2000).","Univ Paris 01, CNRS, PHARE, F-75013 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Poirel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CNRS, PHARE, Maison Sci Econ,106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",jocelynpoirel@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

J,"Chiang, YM; Sa-Aadu, J",,,,"Chiang, Yao-Min; Sa-Aadu, Jarjisu",,,Optimal Mortgage Contract Choice Decision in the Presence of Pay Option Adjustable Rate Mortgage and the Balloon Mortgage,JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mortgage choice; Balloon mortgages; Pay option ARMs; Horizon risk management; Household mobility,,"The unprecedented run-up in global house prices of the 2000s was preceded by a revolution in U.S. mortgage markets in which borrowers faced a plethora of mortgages to choose from collectively known as nontraditional mortgages (NTMs), whose poor performance helped ignite the global financial crisis in 2007. This paper studies the choice of mortgage contracts in an expanded framework where the menu of contracts includes the pay option adjustable rate mortgage (PO-ARM), and the balloon mortgage (BM), alongside the traditional long horizon fixed rate mortgage (FRM) and the short horizon regular ARM. The inclusion of the PO-ARM is based on the fact it is the most controversial and perhaps the riskiest of the NTMs, whereas the BM has not been analyzed in the literature despite its different risk-sharing arrangement and long vintage. Our inclusive model relates the structural differences of these contracts to the horizon risk management problems and affordability constraints faced by the households that differ in terms of expected mobility. The numerical solutions of the model generates a number of interesting results suggesting that households select mortgage contracts to match their horizon, manage horizon risk and mitigate liquidity or affordability constraints they face. From a risk management and welfare perspectives, we find that the optimal contract for households with shorter horizons, specifically households who expect to move house once every 1 to 2 years, is the PO-ARM. Beyond 2 years the welfare advantage of the PO-ARM diminishes and BM becomes the more optimal contract up to 5-year horizon. Overall, the results suggest that households are neither as risk averse as the selection of the FRM would suggest, nor are they as risk-seeking as the selection of PO-ARM or regular ARM would suggest. The results also suggest that the exuberance demonstrated for NTMs by borrowers, especially PO-ARMs, may be both rational and irrational.","[Chiang, Yao-Min] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 11605, Taiwan; [Sa-Aadu, Jarjisu] Univ Iowa, Dept Finance, Henry B Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",National Chengchi University; University of Iowa,"Sa-Aadu, J (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Finance, Henry B Tippie Coll Business, 108 PBB,Suite 252, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",ymchiang@nccu.edu.tw; jsa-aadu@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,19,6,9,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We study the predictive power of each of these spreads for output growth within aggregate and time scale framework using wavelet methodology. We find that predictive power holds only at lower frequencies for the spreads which are constructed at shorter end and policy relevant areas of yield curve.

While in Europe, road lane management has focused mainly on introduction of bus lanes, the conversion to High Occupancy Vehicles (HOV) and eco-lanes (lanes dedicated to vehicles running on alternative fuels) has not been studied comprehensively. The objectives of this research are to: (1) Develop an integrated microscopic modeling platform calibrated with real world data to assess both traffic and emissions impacts of future Traffic Management Strategies (TMS) in an urban area; (2) Evaluate the introduction of HOV/eco-lanes in three different types of roads, freeway, arterial and urban routes, in an European medium-sized city and its effects in terms of emissions and traffic performance. The methodology consists of three distinct phases: (a) Traffic and road inventory data collection; (b) Traffic and emissions simulation using an integrated platform of microscopic simulation; and (c) Evaluation of scenarios. For the baseline scenario, the statistical analysis shows valid results. The results show that HOV and eco-lanes in a medium European city are feasible, and when the Average Occupancy of Vehicles (AOV) increases, on freeways, the majority of vehicles can reduce their travel time (2%) with a positive impact in terms of total emissions (-38% NOx, -39% HC, -43% CO and -37% CO2). On urban and arterial corridors, the reduction in emissions could be achieved only if the AOV increases from 1.50 to 1.70 passengers/vehicle. Total emissions of the corridor with an AOV of 1.70 passengers/vehicle can be reduced up to 35-36% for the urban route while the values can be reduced by 36-39% for the arterial road. With the introduction of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) and Electric Vehicles (EV) it is possible to reduce emissions, although the introduction of eco-lanes did not show significant reductions in emissions. When both policies are simulated together, an emissions improvement is observed for the arterial route and for two of the scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Properties in larger HOAs sell for less, and this is particularly true for properties in the biggest HOAs.

In 2009-10, the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation co-ordinated a randomised controlled trial in the Irish residential electricity market. Smart meters were introduced in approximately 5,000 households, divided into control and treatment groups, with treatment groups exposed to a variety of TOU tariffs and information stimuli. This paper analyses the response of Irish households at different times of the day to the introduction of TOU tariffs and information stimuli. We find that these measures have a significant effect in reducing electricity consumption in Ireland, particularly during peak hours. However, while households reduce peak demand significantly after the introduction of TOU tariffs and associated information, there is little incremental response to increasing differentials between peak and off-peak prices.","[Di Cosmo, Valeria; Lyons, Sean; Nolan, Anne] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Di Cosmo, Valeria; Lyons, Sean; Nolan, Anne] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Di Cosmo, V (通讯作者)，Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland.",valeria.dicosmo@esri.ie,"Lyons, Sean/AAH-7579-2019","Lyons, Sean/0000-0002-3526-6947; Nolan, Anne/0000-0002-4597-180X",ESRI Energy Policy Research Centre,ESRI Energy Policy Research Centre,"We are grateful for funding from the ESRI Energy Policy Research Centre.

They focus on grocery spending at selected stores in Cornwall, a popular tourist destination in South West England. The loyalty card data provide a valuable source rarely available for academic investigations. The authors are able to analyse visitor spend by socio-economic and geodemographic characteristics, drawing a range of comparisons with residential demand from within the store catchment areas. They demonstrate that visitor grocery expenditure is complex and varies by store, destination and type of customer. The paper presents evidence to suggest that the current approaches used to estimate sales uplift and local-level economic impact from visitor demand are unable to account for the complexities of this form of expenditure.

This allows to extend knowledge on the supply side and to examine if strategies of integrators are consistent with cost structure. The cost function is based on quarterly time-series data from 1990 to 2010 for FedEx and UPS. A total and a variable model are estimated. In addition, a static as well as a dynamic approach is followed. We find that integrators exhibit strong scale and density economies in the short and the long term. This result is in line with the aggressive expansion and cooperation strategies pursued by integrators. Our results indicate that the concentration in the integrated air freight industry will continue: a concern for industry actors and regulatory agencies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Since aid for trade (AfT) has been recognised as a powerful instrument for increasing developing countries' trade capacity by targeting internal trade costs, this article tests whether complementarities exist between this type of aid and economic integration using a gravity model on panel data for the period 1995-2005. Results indicate that AfT, when combined with economic integration, has been effective in increasing trade flows. Both South-South and North-South trade flows have benefited, and the combination of the two instruments has been particularly effective in expanding the South's exports to the North. Finally, when breaking down AfT into categories, assistance to trade-related institutions seems to generate the strongest complementarities with economic integration.","INRA, UMR SMART 1302, F-35042 Rennes, France",INRAE; Universite de Rennes,"Vijil, M (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR SMART 1302, Agrocampus Ouest, F-35042 Rennes, France.",,,,,,,,29,13,14,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2014,37.0,4,,,SI,,555.0,566,,10.1111/twec.12140,0.0,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AE7RT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000334197100005,0

Their consideration as three interlinked entities rests on the high degree of EU-Israeli interdependence, the EU's deep involvement in the Palestinian territories and Israel's control over the latter. The article evidences the existence of variegated borders regimes applying to different categories of Israelis, Palestinians and EU citizens, together with Israel's outstanding prerogatives in defining these practices. The analysis suggests conceptualizing the space comprising the EU and Israel/Palestine as overlapping borderlands, with Israel and the territories emerging as a single, yet highly fragmented, space in which borders are alternative expressions of power relations in protracted conflicts. With the EU being drawn into prevailing conflict dynamics, the type and extent of EU-Israeli-Palestinian interconnectedness thus undermine the coherent implementation of Brussels' mainly bilateral policies towards Israel and the territories.","[Del Sarto, Raffaella A.] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, I-50014 Fiesole, FI, Italy; [Del Sarto, Raffaella A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Paul H Nitze Sch Adv Int Studies SAIS Europe, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",European University Institute; Johns Hopkins University,"Del Sarto, RA (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Via Fontanelle 19, I-50014 Fiesole, FI, Italy.",raffaella.delsarto@eui.eu,"Del Sarto, Raffaella A./I-4048-2019","Del Sarto, Raffaella A./0000-0001-9037-4281",,,,,53,24,25,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

One prominently-published article purports to show that signing on to an IMF structural adjustment program (SAP) increases the risk of civil war, Hartzell et al. (International Organization 64:339-56, 2010). The authors claim that IMF SAPs push liberalization, which hurts people badly enough that they foment civil war. We advance the debate by critically examining their theoretical and empirical evidence, particularly questioning their crucial assumptions about the impact of IMF programs on the economic environment in terms of who actually wins and loses from liberalization and who might be in a position to rebel. Using their data, we find that signing on to an IMF program predicts the onset of a civil war negatively if one uses a lower threshold of 25 deaths when defining civil war. These results suggest that the operationalization of the IMF variable as well as the use of large-scale civil war (1,000 deaths and above) simply capture the effect of ongoing conflict rather than the effects of liberalization. After extending the time period under study and making only minor changes to operationalization, we find that at no time does IMF involvement successfully predict the onset of a civil war.","[Midtgaard, Trude M.; Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya; de Soysa, Indra] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway; [de Soysa, Indra] St Thomas Coll, Mt Lavinia, Sri Lanka",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"de Soysa, I (通讯作者)，St Thomas Coll, Mt Lavinia, Sri Lanka.",trude.midtgard@svt.ntnu.no; Krishna.c.vadlamannati@svt.ntnu.no; indra.de.soysa@svt.ntnu.no,"; , Indra/D-6635-2015","Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya/0000-0001-5999-1126; , Indra/0000-0003-2751-4223",,,,,49,10,11,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The individual rent-seeking expenditure in the former equilibrium is more than that in the Nash equilibrium in the original Tullock contest; moreover, over-dissipation can occur in a destructive equilibrium even in the case of constant returns to expenditure.

The reality is very much different, especially in the transport sector, due to the complex and dynamic nature of the transport system and the interplay between the many sub-systems that comprise it. Inherent in such complexities are elements of uncertainty, risk, irreversibility, path dependency and lock-in effects. This article reviews some of the existing literature on risk and risk management. It argues that one way of better accounting for the above elements associated with risk and uncertainty is to devote efforts at the planning stage to the identification of possible unintended adverse effects, as well as during and after implementation of policy measures or policy packages. While it is imperative to address potential unintended adverse effects ex-ante, it is equally important to monitor policy measure or packages ex-post to identify unintended effects and to evaluate whether the initial objectives are being met. Since circumstances are very likely to change over time and unintended effects can arise, there is a need for flexibility in the design of policy packages to allow as much as possible changes in the package if and when intentions and outcome do not match.

The purpose of getting this intellectual product with specified set consumer properties set in advance is achievement maximum use which in applied, qualitatively other kind may be used or transferred to other economic agents for pay. That is, the information is perceived not in itself as a certain idea or system of the data, and the information is considered as an economic resource (commodity) which is necessary for consuming in the course of economic activities for the purpose of obtaining of certain useful effect. The authors formulate the concept of information properties as an economic resource because in the economic literature there is no such standard determination. They prove that the information specified in a similar way possesses a number of the important properties, distinguishing it from other economic resources. The non-observance of the law of supply and demand is believed to be the main difference of the information from other economic resources and the information cost is not connected directly with its quantity. But it noted that dependence of cost of the information on the definite moment of its usage and the period of its life is high. The information is the social wealth in scientific sphere of creation of new scientific knowledge and anybody can use it free of charge. The information creation costs much, until it is inaccessible to the third parties, otherwise it depreciates. For this reason methods of representation of the information, its forms and reliability in many respects determine quality of the information for the consumer, providing essential growth of the final results of economic activities. The person always acts as a means of production for it and the capital in this case can be used only as the auxiliary tool. The consumer informative value depends on time of its presentation greatly because lack of time for its processing by managers results in the wrong decisions. It is underlined that studying of processes of the organization and information processing in economic systems is necessary for carrying out from the point of view of the theory of self-organizing systems, instead of that of classical economy. The authors see the special role of information as an economic resource at its transfer to applied consumption where the labour productivity connected with quantity of the produced product will be no longer be the main criterion but a certain criterion of quality of processing of the information used at different stages of workflow.

Thus, trade policy began to be very effective instruments in affecting growth of economies. It is liberalization of trade that has shift Visegrad countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) from transition economies to the group of most developed world countries. As known, production of these countries is oriented mostly on export and their output significantly depends on demand on foreign markets. This situation yields two contrary effects. Firstly, such orientation allows achieving high rates of economic growth and strengthens the position of countries in world economy.

To benefit from these preferences, proof of sufficient transformation must be provided to customs in importing countries by meeting the rules of origin requirements. These rules of origin are complicated and burdensome to exporters in least developed countries. Since 2001, under the U. S. Africa Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA), 22 African countries that export apparel to the United States have been able to use fabric of any origin (single transformation) and still meet the criterion for preferential access (the so-called Special Rule). In contrast, the EU has continued to require yarn to be woven into fabric and then made into apparel in the same country (double transformation). Panel estimates for the 1996-2004 period exploit this quasi-experimental change in the design of preferences. Estimates show that this simplification contributed to an increase in export volume of approximately 168 percent for the top seven beneficiaries, or approximately four times as much as the 44 percent growth effect from the initial preferential access under the AGOA without single transformation. This change in design was also important for diversity in apparel exports because the number of export varieties grew more rapidly under the AGOA special regime.","[de Melo, Jaime] FERDI, Paris, France; [de Melo, Jaime] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Portugal-Perez, Alberto] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",University of Geneva; The World Bank,"de Melo, J (通讯作者)，FERDI, Paris, France.",jaime.demelo@unige.ch; aportugalperez@worldbank.org,"Azevedo, Micheline/JHT-0825-2023",,,,,,19,8,9,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Several studies in this field identified core benefits of such mechanisms. Results from them suggest that sellers with higher ratings are usually rewarded by higher purchasing price, than sellers with lower rating level. Reputation mechanisms are not very widely implemented on B2B (business to business) e-markets and/or on e-procurement markets. Therefore benefits identification of such reputation mechanisms on those markets is difficult. This paper's main objective is the impact analyses of reputation mechanisms on buyer's decision in e-procurement and is carried out by evaluating four research questions. First is focused on identification of the relationship (if any) between the rating level and probability of success in e-procurement. Second analyses the relationship between buyer's previous experiences with current seller and the seller's rating acquired from other market participants. Third research question is focused on the relationship between price premium and rating level and the last one validates the significance of rating for various purchasing price levels. All the data about buyer's preferences are obtained from a controlled experiment, which involved different groups of buyers that were asked to sort sellers according to their preferences. Analysis for evaluation of research questions is based on statistical and econometrical analysis using generalised linear model with Logit link function and relevant correlation analysis. According to preliminary results sellers with better values of reputation were rewarded with a purchase price for 4 % higher than market average. Analysis and results could show significant benefits of the reputation mechanisms implementation in B2B and e-procurement markets for all participants of these markets.","[Drab, Radovan] Safarik Univ, Fac Publ Adm, Kosice, Slovakia; [Mihokova, Lucia] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia",University of Pavol Jozef Safarik Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Dráb, R (通讯作者)，Safarik Univ, Fac Publ Adm, Kosice, Slovakia.",,"Mihoková, Lucia/AAA-8692-2020; Dráb, Radovan/AAH-4044-2019",,,,,,12,1,1,0,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,217.0,224,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900028,0

Although the economy of Croatia as a small country is inevitably dependent on exogenous processes, it is also evident that since the creation of the independent state, political elites have not reached a consensus on the development agenda and economic development goalsthey desire. In order to secure access to European Union cofinancing for economic-development activities, the Croatian Government was asked to present to the European Commission an economic development plan for a financial perspective on 2014 - 2020. They selected the Smart Specialization Strategy to advance the development of twelve sectors of the economy that are deemed the sectors with the highest competitiveness potential. Further development of these sectors is stimulated through creation of competitiveness clusters designed to enable a triple-helix cooperation model connecting the scientific and public sector, and the economic actors. Their cooperation creates a framework which enables the scientific sector to better understand the needs of the economy and to link its research agenda with these needs, foster faster transfer of innovation and new technologies into the real sector, and educate public policy makers to create an enabling environment to intensify this cooperation. Activities in the development of competitivness clusters up until now have not been sufficient to ensure a full functioning of the triple-helix model. To prove this hypothesis, we conducted a study, the results of which show why the Croatian economy has still not managed to create competitiveness clusters. The ideas we gained through the study should serve as guidelines to decision makers at different levels for more effective implementation of the activities for the development of competitiveness clusters in the Republic of Croatia. The methods employed in the study comprise methods of analysis, synthesis, induction and deduction, as well as a descriptive and a compilation method.","[Horvat, Duro; Bogdanic, Marta] Agrokor DD, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",,"Horvat, D (通讯作者)，Agrokor DD, Trg Drazena Petrovica 3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",djuro.horvat@agrokor.hr; marta.bogdanic@agrokor.hr,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,310.0,320,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600029,0

It argues that central European states cluster around two dominant modes of party competition. In the first, predominantly ideologically committed elites (Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Slovenia and Estonia) established relatively electoral professional' party competitions, only to face deepening fiscal constraints on mainstream ideological competition. Following the collapse of the social democratic left, both Hungary and Poland experienced attempts to reassert political monopoly, i.e., party state capture'. In the second group (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Latvia), more entrepreneurial political elites established brokerage' party systems, in which public policy remains a side-product of an essentially economic competition. All five states show high levels of corporate state capture' in which public power is exercised primarily for private gain. These findings contest the more optimistic expectations of the institutionalist literature on state-building and democratic consolidation.","[Innes, Abby] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Innes, A (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.innes@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,105,116,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Rating evaluation of companies is a reasonable and practical approach for competitiveness assessment. To calculate the rating can be used not only quantitative indicators of competitiveness but also qualitative indicators. The information about uncertainty of the environment is included in the technique by using methods of the fuzzy sets theory. Quantitative and qualitative factors of competitiveness are selected depending on the characteristics of the industry and the availability of public information. To achieve comparability, indicators are converted in scale [0, 1] with regard to their conventional critical values. The model proposes to account the importance of the indicators depending on external conditions. Integral rating estimation is formed as a weighted sum of fuzzy estimates of competitiveness indicators in the form of fuzzy trapezoidal numbers. To find the final rating of the company's competitiveness is proposed to use the Kemeny's median of different rankings obtained by different methods of ranking fuzzy integral indicators of competitiveness. The presented technique provides effective tools for assessing the competitiveness of companies. The advantage of this technique lies in the fact that it uses quantitative and qualitative factors of competitiveness.

The underlying model is based on the Pathways to health framework in which SES affects health by modifying the relationship between lifestyles and health. We use data from the British Health and Lifestyle Survey (1984-1985) and the longitudinal follow-up in June 2009, and run parametric Gompertz survival models to investigate the association between obesity and survival, also accounting for interactions between obesity and both age and SES. Generally we find that obesity is negatively associated with survival, and that SES is positively associated with survival, in both men and women. The interactions between obesity and SES predict survival among women but not among men. Obesity compared with normal weight is associated with a reduction in survival of 3.3, 3.2 and 2.8 years in men aged 40,50 and 60 years, respectively. Corresponding numbers among women in the lowest SES group are 13.1, 9.7 and 6.1 years, respectively; in the highest SES group they are 6.2, 3.1 and 0.1 years, respectively, a difference of approximately 6 years between the highest and lowest SES groups.

Non-parametrical way of productivity analysis helps to avoid assumption as to specific type of production function building deterministic production frontier. In the paper, data envelopment analysis approach is employed to determine labour input utilization assuming labour to be a variable input in a short run, capital stock being fixed during the period. The adopted measure of resource utilization exploits a change in the efficiency after relaxing the constraint associated with the variable input. Two modifications of the model were computed - with a labour measured in employed persons and as a human-capital-augmented labour.

Therefore, it is possible to use it in creation of a system of forecasts on different aggregation levels in the way the created forecasts are in mutual time and material harmony. The thing is that in hierarchical forecasting the final forecasts are created from forecasts on a lower level of aggregation (bottom-up process), or from forecasts on a higher level of aggregation (top-down process). However, the knowledge of the influence of the aggregation level on the accuracy of the arising forecasts is a necessary condition of using the right approach to hierarchical forecasting. This paper describes the principles of hierarchical forecasting and the possibilities of their utilization within forecasting development of time series in consumption of basic petroleum products in the EU countries in 1993-2010. On the basis of the time series analysis, the authors then deal with comparison of the accuracy of forecasts arising on different levels of aggregation and evaluate the impacts of the aggregation level on the forecasting accuracy.

Now the value assessment of wood resources is underestimated because of unreal value in use that leads to decrease of the wood income. Growth of the wood income is possible on the basis of the new forestry busyness concept the meaning of which consists in a real estimation, both current receipts, and dynamics of wood assets. Taking into account deficit of natural resources the authors assert that science and quality education should act as a profit source in forestry busyness. Evolution of knowledge in key source of cost assumes availability of innovations and methods of their practical application in them. The paper affirms that new knowledge should occupy key positions in ecology development of the wood industry branches. This circumstance considerably changes a place of the status of timber formation in structure of values of public life, a ratio of its spheres, as higher education and economy. The paper underlines insufficient interest of the state structures to an estimation of potential competence of forest engineers for realizations of professional activity because of considerable presence of not profile scientific and pedagogical staff for training of engineers for forest industries of economy. It points to absence of the erudition approach to training of the wood & paper goods appraisers with the level of potential competence, sufficient for achievement of the strategic goals of a wood complex development.

Unknown parameter values are calibrated using data available from the area-based pricing scheme implemented in the London metropolitan area. The key features of our model are that individual behavior is affected by the level of congestion, the cost of driving, and the supply/capacity and demand associated with metro transit. Perceptions of users are captured by three separate linguistic variables and fuzzy set theory is used to evaluate the combined effects of individual perceptions on the travel mode selection and the switching behavior between travel modes. As part of our analysis we explore three premises, i.e., that revenues generated from a congestion pricing scheme can substantially improve alternative transportation modes, that the improvement of these modes can have a positive effect on the mitigation of traffic congestion, and that a congestion pricing scheme cannot effectively resolve congestion problems in short term due to the existence of material and information delays.

One issue has not, as yet, received much attention. This is the mingling of unapproved GM products with conventional products. This issue is likely to gain more prominence in the future as new GM product development accelerates. Until recently, problems with mingling were largely one-off events. Recently, however, an ongoing case of mingling has arisen - the case of Canadian GM flax in the EU. The case led to an embargo of imports from Canada and subsequently the bilateral negotiation of a protocol to allow exports to resume. The case raises a number of important issues pertaining to the objective of zero tolerance policies for GM products, the operationalisation of zero tolerance, the role of the testing industry, the design of testing regimes and the risks associated with the absence of transparency and/or international standardisation. It is concluded that mingling is a topic that is deserving of multilateral attention.","[Viju, Crina] Carleton Univ, Inst European Russian & Eurasian Studies, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Yeung, May T.] Estey Ctr Law & Econ Int Trade, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Kerr, William A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",Carleton University; University of Saskatchewan,"Viju, C (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Inst European Russian & Eurasian Studies, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",,"Yeung, May/ABB-9483-2021","Yeung, May/0000-0003-1359-5974",,,,,32,6,6,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2014,37.0,1,,,,,137.0,150,,10.1111/twec.12077,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,287GL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329529900003,0

Using a large sample of anonymous credit bureau records, observed quarterly from 1999 through 2010, we examine the credit experiences of 330,000 borrowers before and after a foreclosure start. Our analysis documents the substantial declines in credit scores that accompany a foreclosure start and examines the length of time it takes individuals to return their credit scores to predelinquency levels. The results suggest that, particularly for prime borrowers, credit score recovery comes slowly, if at all. The lack of recovery appears to be driven by persistently higher delinquency rates on consumer credit (such as auto and credit card loans) in the years that follow their foreclosure start. Our results also indicate that the experiences of individuals whose mortgages entered foreclosure from 2007 to 2009 have followed a similar path to borrowers foreclosed earlier in the decade, though their postforeclosure-start delinquency rates have been higher and, consequently, credit score recovery appears to be taking longer.","[Brevoort, Kenneth P.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Cooper, Cheryl R.] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Urban Institute,"Brevoort, KP (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",ken@brevoort.com; Cheryl.r.cooper@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,20,24,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,DEC,2013,41.0,4,,,,,747.0,792,,10.1111/1540-6229.12021,0.0,,,46,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,273PU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328549000002,0

According to the results, the effect of mothers' prenatal famine exposure status on children's infant mortality risk depends on the level of famine severity. In regions of low famine severity, mothers' prenatal famine exposure significantly reduces children's infant mortality, whereas in regions of high famine severity, such prenatal exposure increases children's infant mortality although the effect is not statistically significant. Such a curvilinear relationship between mothers' prenatal malnutrition status and their children's infant mortality risk is more complicated than the linear relationship predicted by the original fetal origins hypothesis but is consistent with the more recent developmental origins of health and disease theory.

We investigate to what extent these findings generalize to evolutionary models of price competition among spatially distributed firms. We consider both one- and two-dimensional models, and we vary the amount of information firms have about competitors in their neighborhood. Our computer simulations show that the emergence of cooperative behavior depends strongly on the amount of information available to firms. Firms tend to behave most cooperatively if they have only a very limited amount of information about their competitors. We provide an intuitive explanation for this phenomenon. Our simulations further indicate that three other factors in our models, namely the accuracy of firms' information, the probability of experimentation, and the spatial distribution of consumers, have little effect on the emergence of cooperative behavior.","[Waltman, Ludo; van Eck, Nees Jan] Leiden Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol Studies, Leiden, Netherlands; [Waltman, Ludo; van Eck, Nees Jan; Dekker, Rommert; Kaymak, Uzay] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Kaymak, Uzay] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Ind Engn & Innovat Sci, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Waltman, L (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol Studies, Leiden, Netherlands.",waltmanlr@cwts.leidenuniv.nl; ecknjpvan@cwts.leidenuniv.nl; rdekker@ese.eur.nl; u.kaymak@tue.nl,"Kaymak, Uzay/A-3364-2008; van Eck, Nees Jan/B-6042-2008; Waltman, Ludo/B-5561-2008; Dekker, Rommert/E-7620-2012","Kaymak, Uzay/0000-0002-4500-9098; van Eck, Nees Jan/0000-0001-8448-4521; Waltman, Ludo/0000-0001-8249-1752; Dekker, Rommert/0000-0003-3823-1990",,,,,24,2,2,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The main objective of this paper is to introduce on-road pollution exposure as an externality of traffic, particularly important during traffic congestion when on-road pollution exposure is highest. Marginal private and external cost equations are developed that include on-road pollution exposure in addition to time, fuel, and pollution emissions components. The marginal external cost of on-road exposure includes terms for the marginal vehicle's emissions, the increased emissions from all vehicles caused by additional congestion from the marginal vehicle, and the additional exposure duration for all travelers caused by additional congestion from the marginal vehicle. A sensitivity analysis shows that on-road pollution exposure can be a large portion (18%) of marginal social costs of traffic flow near freeway capacity, ranging from 4% to 38% with different exposure parameters. In an optimal pricing scenario, excluding the on-road exposure externality can lead to 6% residual welfare loss because of sub-optimal tolls. While regional pollution generates greater costs in uncongested conditions, on-road exposure comes to dominate health costs on congested freeways because of increased duration and intensity of exposure. The estimated marginal cost and benefit curves indicate a theoretical preference for price controls to address the externality problem. The inclusion of on-road exposure costs reduces the magnitudes of projects required to cover implementation costs for intelligent transportation system (ITS) improvements; the net benefits of road-pricing ITS systems are increased more than the net benefits of ITS traffic flow improvements. When considering distinct vehicle classes, inclusion of on-road exposure costs greatly increases heavy-duty vehicle marginal costs because of their higher emissions rates and greater roadway capacity utilization. Lastly, there are large uncertainties associated with the parameters utilized in the estimation of health outcomes that are a function of travel pollution intensity and duration. More research is needed to develop on-road exposure modeling tools that link repeated short-duration exposure and health outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we develop a search model where REITs optimally pay more for property because (1) they are willing, due to cost of capital advantages and, (2) they are occasionally rushed, due to external regulatory time constraints and internal incentives to deploy capital quickly. Second, using commercial real estate transactions, we find that the extant hedonic pricing models contain an unobserved explanatory variables bias leading to inflated estimates of the REIT premium. Third, using a repeat-sales methodology that controls for unobserved property characteristics, we derive more plausible estimates of the REIT premium. Consistent with our model, we also find the REIT-buyer premium depends on the size of the REIT advantage, the rush to deploy, and the relative presence of REITs in the market.","[Akin, S.

Europeanisation Going NUTS?,EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Starting from the empirical observation of high levels of absorption of EU cohesion funds but strikingly low levels of substantive change in regional cohesion, this essay offers a contextual analysis of regional development policies in Hungary. Based on theoretical frameworks dealing with Europeanisation, new regionalism and participative development, it explores the reasons for this observation by analysing the role of administrative and planning structures and of development discourses. The essay shows that the Europeanisation of regional development policy triggered several changes in the planning process and led to the partial inclusion of new actors. However, the main effect of this was a growing centralisation of development policy making. The essay explains this by pointing to the domestic political context and the historical foundations of regional development discourses of the conservative and leftist liberal parties. While there are overlaps between the discourses on both sides of the ideological divide, they are perceived as incompatible by political actors. Thus, it is argued that considerations of political power, rather than ideological nature, shape Hungarian regional and development policy and explain the incremental reform process.","[Buzogany, Aron] German Res Inst Publ Adm Speyer, Speyer, Germany; [Korkut, Umut] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow Sch Business & Soc, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow Caledonian University,"Buzogány, A (通讯作者)，German Res Inst Publ Adm Speyer, Speyer, Germany.",buzogany@foev-speyer.de; umut.korkut@gcu.ac.uk,"Buzogány, Aron/AAJ-8445-2020","Buzogány, Aron/0000-0002-9867-3742",,,,,87,20,20,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,OCT 1,2013,65.0,8,,,,,1555.0,1577,,10.1080/09668136.2013.833015,0.0,,,23,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,293PC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329983900004,0

The standard explanation is that political institutions, in particular the left government and proportional representation, are negatively associated with income inequality among advanced industrial countries, but there have been so few studies attempting to explain the variation of distributional outcomes across new democracies. This article tests the hypotheses about the effects of political institutions on income inequality with unbalanced pooled time-series cross-sectional data that cover 26 fledgling democracies for 1975-2006. The evidence presented here suggests that, other things being equal, a parliamentary system and PR are substantially more likely to be associated with lower levels of income inequality, but a left government and more years of democracy do not appear to be related to lower income inequality.","Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul 157881, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Yi, DJ (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, 332 Fac Off Bldg 1,107 Imun Ro, Seoul 157881, South Korea.",letitbii@hanmail.net,,,,,,,57,5,6,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The U.S. orange juice industry benefits from one of the highest levels of import protection in U.S. agriculture. Additional trade protection was recently added with a U.S. industry victory in an antidumping trade suit against Brazil. We study the impact of FCOJ imports from Brazil on U.S. prices using time series econometric models and find only a weak FCOJ domestic price response to imports from Brazil, because extremely large U.S. inventories mute the price impact of any fluctuation in imports.

This article examines the distribution dynamics of inflation rates in ten new EU members from CEE relative to the EMU accession benchmark inflation over the period 1990-2009. In contrast to previous studies, we use nonparametric methods to test for convergence in inflation rates between CEE and the EMU benchmark as well as within the CEE sample. Over the entire sample period, we detect a general shift in the CEE inflation distribution toward the EMU benchmark along with intradistributional convergence. However, this process is not uniform. In the early years, it was equally likely for CEE inflation rates to move toward or away from the benchmark. The resulting multimodal distribution gave way to a unimodal distribution in the years leading up to the EU accession, accompanied by a marked shift toward the EMU benchmark. In more recent years, emergence of a bimodal distribution signaled the stratification of relative inflation in CEE into two convergence clubs, which has intensified since the start of the global economic crisis.","[Nath, Hiranya K.] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA; [Tochkov, Kiril] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA",Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University; Texas Christian University,"Nath, HK (通讯作者)，Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA.",eco_hkn@shsu.edu; k.tochkov@tcu.edu,"Nath, Hiranya/X-8216-2019; Tochkov, Kiril/F-1779-2017","Nath, Hiranya/0000-0002-7150-739X; Tochkov, Kiril/0000-0001-8356-1310",,,,,33,5,5,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using the Atkinson-Plotnick-Kakwani re-ranking indexes of taxes, tax rates, and post-tax incomes, calculated with respect to the ranking of pre-tax income distribution, they then propose a measurement system to evaluate the negative influences that axiom violations exert on the redistributive effect of taxes. In this paper, we reconsider the way Kakwani and Lambert measure violations of their second axiom, which concerns the re-ranking of tax rates. We construct a non-negative index which is strictly faithful to Kakwani and Lambert's commands; we show that the Authors' measure does not exactly fit the statements made in their second axiom. Both Kakwani and Lambert's original measurement system and the modified one are then applied to Italian personal income tax in 2008. According to the modified measurement system, the average tax rate seems to play a smaller role than that suggested by the results gained using Kakwani and Lambert's original methodology.","[Pellegrino, Simone] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, I-10134 Turin, Italy; [Vernizzi, Achille] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Business & Stat, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Turin; University of Milan,"Pellegrino, S (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, Corso Unione Soviet 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",pellegrino@econ.unito.it; achille.vernizzi@unimi.it,"vernizzi, achille/K-4518-2017","vernizzi, achille/0000-0002-1641-5003",,,,,8,8,8,0,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of implementing age-friendly guidelines for public buses on bus use, useability and social participation for older people. Methodology: Age-friendly changes were implemented in Hervey Bay, Queensland, over a 3 year period. Changes included more lower floor buses, age-awareness training for bus drivers, more frequent scheduling, improved pedestrian infrastructure, a bus buddy program and trial of a flexible route bus. Brisbane, Queensland, served as a control site. This study adopted two complementary methodologies for evaluating the impact of age-friendly changes. The first study incorporated on-board satisfaction surveys with 335 bus users. The second involved a repeated measures cohort study (n = 100) with bus users and non-users. Results: Implementation of age-friendly changes in Hervey Bay, Queensland, resulted in improved satisfaction with, and perceived useability of, the bus system. Participants in Hervey Bay maintained their bus use and social activity participation, while participants in Brisbane experienced a decline in ease of bus use and social activity participation over the intervention period. Conclusion: The implementation of age-friendly guidelines for public buses may improve the useability of bus systems for older people and result in maintenance of participation in social activities.

Standard tools from the measurement of income inequality, including the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient, are applied to the distribution of European Union contributions and expenditure. In addition, the inequality in the allocation of the budget is juxtaposed against the distribution of voting power within the Council of Ministers. Redistribution from rich to poor members can mainly be attributed to unequal per capita contributions in funding the EU budget, while voting power rather than the needs of individual members dominates with respect to expenditure. The accession to the EU of relatively smaller eastern European countries in 2004 and 2007 delivered more voting power to poorer countries with relatively small population shares. This change reinforced the voting power effect in expenditures.","[Groot, Loek; Zonneveld, Erik] Utrecht Univ Sch Econ USE, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Groot, L (通讯作者)，Utrecht Univ Sch Econ USE, POB 80-125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",L.F.M.Groot@uu.nl,"Groot, Loek L.

As the corporate tax transfers part of the risk of investment from firms to the government (risk sharing), two differences to the previous literature arise. First, the capital mobility externality may be positive or negative, depending on how strong the risk sharing effect of taxation is. Second, the sign of the tax exporting externality is also indeterminate. Each government not only exports the burden of taxation, but also bears risk which would have been borne by foreigners instead. Thus, while the socially optimal tax rate equates the risk exposure of the private and the public sectors, the equilibrium decentralized tax may be inefficiently high or low. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A large-scale reform of the Danish student grant and loan system that among others increased student grants by up to $3,000 per year (57 %) was used to identify causal effects of financial aid on outcomes for university students. Estimates were obtained from year-of-study specific models for students observed just before and after the reform, controlling for student, parental and labour-market characteristics. The estimates indicate that the reform lowered dropout rates, but had no overall effect on completion rates, although with substantial variation across population subgroups. The impact on dropout rates was found to be higher for students from a lower socio-economic background and the impact on completion rates was found to be higher three years after the designated study time to completion. The reform seems to have performed as intended by increasing the take-up of student grants and lowering work hours while studying.","[Arendt, Jacob Nielsen] KORA, DK-1150 Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Arendt, JN (通讯作者)，KORA, Kobmagergade 22, DK-1150 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jani@kora.dk,"Arendt, Jacob Nielsen/ISS-2184-2023","Arendt, Jacob Nielsen/0000-0001-5675-8564",,,,,34,23,31,1,33,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

One such determinant which has received considerable attention is maternal smoking. From an economic perspective this is in part due to the possibility that smoking habits can be influenced through policy conduct. It is widely believed that maternal smoking reduces birthweight; however, the crucial difficulty in estimating such effects is the unobserved heterogeneity among mothers and the fact that estimation of conditional mean effects seems potentially inappropriate. We provide a unified view on the estimation of relationships between prenatal smoking and birthweight outcomes with quantile regression approaches for panel data and emphasize their differences. This paper contributes to the literature in three ways: (i) we focus not only on one technique, but provide evidence from several approaches and highlight a variety of statistical issues; (ii) the performance of the methods are thoroughly tested in a simulated environment, and recommendations are given on their appropriate use; (iii) our results are based on a detailed data set, which includes many relevant control variables for socio-economic, wealth, and personal characteristics.","[Bache, Stefan Holst Milton] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark; [Bache, Stefan Holst Milton] Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE, Odense, Denmark; [Dahl, Christian Moller] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, COHERE, Odense, Denmark; [Dahl, Christian Moller] Univ Southern Denmark, CREATES, Odense, Denmark; [Kristensen, Johannes Tang] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Aarhus, Denmark; [Kristensen, Johannes Tang] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; CREATES; Aarhus University; Aarhus University; CREATES,"Dahl, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, COHERE, Odense, Denmark.",stefan@sdu.dk; cmd@sam.sdu.dk; jtang@creates.au.dk,"Kristensen, Johannes Tang/C-3025-2013","Kristensen, Johannes Tang/0000-0002-9494-6619; Dahl, Christian Moller/0000-0001-9880-2818",,,,,30,28,33,0,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We show that the conditional variance obtained from the GARCH model with VIX has better predictive ability for realized volatility than the conditional variance from GARCH without VIX and VIX itself, thereby documenting an important information content of VIX for conditional variance. The results are interpreted as evidence that adding VIX squared in the conditional variance equation yields a better measure of conditional variance which, subsequently, uncovers a strong risk-return relation.","Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Kanas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus, Greece.",akanas@unipi.gr,,,,,,,44,18,19,3,30,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The common thrust of these studies is that informal governance is the result of an implicit agreement among states that, in order to sustain cooperation, it can be necessary to accommodate important interests even if this seemingly goes against the organization's purpose. Struck under conditions of uncertainty, however, implicit agreements such as this are necessarily vague, and their implementation is bound to generate conflicts that threaten to undermine the organization's legitimacy. How, then, do states decide whether formal rules or informal governance apply? This article uses the case of the EU to propose a solution to this dilemma. The central argument is that member states have delegated the authority to adjudicate on demands for informal governance to the office of the Council Presidency. They mold the legislative agenda such that the government in office can be trusted in its judgment. The plausibility of this argument is illustrated with a description of the Presidency's historical development and a case study on the negotiation of the EU's controversial Working Time Directive. Apart from pointing to a missing piece in the literature on informal governance, the study holds more general lessons for the interaction of formal and informal rules as well as the information-providing role of international institutions.","London Sch Econ, European Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kleine, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.o.kleine@lse.ac.uk,"Kleine, Mareike/AAP-6202-2020","Kleine, Mareike/0000-0002-7442-7328",,,,,85,22,23,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are discussed. Furthermore, a practical and flexible algorithmic framework for this class of models is proposed and is illustrated using simulated data, thus also offering some insight into the small-sample biases of such estimators.

It shows that while the greenback is still the top currency in the system due to a lack of alternatives, its long term dominance is questioned because its economic pre-eminence and its political leadership are perceived to be fading. This in turn is stimulating financial elites in emerging markets to promote alternative regional monetary frameworks and the internationalisation of their own currencies. The article explores how financial elites in key dollar holding countries react to the US exorbitant privilege' of not facing disciplinary constraints in its economic policies. It then examines how the US has been able to misuse its central position in the system by delaying and deflecting adjustment costs upon others, and illustrates the disapproving response that this has provoked in emerging markets and Europe. Finally, it concentrates on Chinese proposals to renegotiate the status of the dollar in the system and why these have been hitherto rejected by the US.","[Otero-Iglesias, Miguel] Lunam Univ, ESSCA Sch Management, F-49003 Angers 01, France; [Steinberg, Federico] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain",ESSCA School of Management; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Otero-Iglesias, M (通讯作者)，Lunam Univ, ESSCA Sch Management, 1 Rue Lakanal,BP 40348, F-49003 Angers 01, France.",miguel.otero@essca.fr; Federico.steinberg@uam.es,"Otero-Iglesias, Miguel/H-9807-2015","Otero-Iglesias, Miguel/0000-0003-2010-8476",,,,,106,13,13,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

A set of directional vectors is used to capture complete information regarding the overall shift in the technology frontier; we then visualize the DEA frontiers in the output space. This approach deals with the problems of sample dependence and non-circularity of technical change measures. It allows us to measure output-by-output technical change. Furthermore, the geometric mean of the technical change measures derived using this approach satisfies circularity. The application of Malmquist indices to the panel datasets of agricultural production in the Brazilian Amazon during the period 1975-1995 indicates a non-Hicks-neutral technical change, with intersection of frontiers during both the 1975-1985 and the 1985-1995 sub-periods. We find moderate progress in cattle production and annual crops, and a decline in perennial crops (bananas). Technological progress is a modest 0.7% during the period 1975-1995 on average. In addition, comparisons with the sample-dependent measures in the preceding studies demonstrate that these indices are usually sensitive to the distribution of actual sampled data points.","Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, Osaka, Japan",Osaka University,"Otsuki, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, Osaka, Japan.",otsuki@osipp.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25285076, 22330077, 24653059] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,17,5,5,1,18,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.
