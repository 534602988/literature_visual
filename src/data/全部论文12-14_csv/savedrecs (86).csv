We show that if individuals value their reputation for the degree to which they are informed, this reduces the incentive to learn by observing others and exacerbates the incentive to consume the good before others, i.e., to attempt to be an opinion leader. Consequently, reputation concerns reduce the average delay of consumption of new goods and weaken the social information value of early consumption. In an extension, we show that reputation concerns increase the probability of herding on consumption of both high and low quality goods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The existing literature suggests that the low level of Medicaid fee payments to physicians reduces their willingness to see Medicaid patients, thus creating an access-to-care problem for these patients. For the identical service, current Medicaid reimbursement rates are only about 65 percent of those covered by Medicare. Increasing the relative payments of Medicaid would increase its perceived value, as it would provide better access to health care for Medicaid beneficiaries. Using variation in the timing of the changes in Medicaid payment across states, I find that increasing Medicaid generosity is associated with both an increase in take-up and a reduction in uninsured rate. These results provide a partial answer to the puzzling question of why many low-income children who are eligible for Medicaid remain uninsured. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The set of Walrasian payoff vectors for our induced coalition production economy coincides with the inner core of the balanced cover of the original game. This equivalence depends heavily on our representation. We exemplify that this equivalence need not hold in other representations. We also give a sufficient condition for the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium for our induced coalition production economy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we examine four types of analyses that these health data might inform: comparisons of alternative treatments for the same condition, of health care providers, of changes in performance over time and of treatments of different types of condition. Analytical challenges arise because counterfactuals cannot be observed and because health status cannot be measured continuously. The implications of these challenges and the ability to meet them vary according to the comparative exercise. We argue that, provided with a sufficient number of health status measures for each patient and proper risk adjustment, health status measurement has great potential to inform the first three types of comparison. However, we believe that it is not yet possible to use such data to make secure comparative judgements about the outcomes from treatment for different types of condition.

Estimates of price elasticity of expenditure are a key component for predicting expenditures under alternative policies. Using unique individual-level data compiled from administrative records from the Chilean private health insurance market, I estimate the price elasticity of expenditures across a variety of health care services. I find elasticities that range between zero for the most acute service (appendectomy) and -2.08 for the most elective (psychologist visit). Moreover, the results show that at least one third of the elasticity is explained by the number of visits; the rest is explained by the intensity of each visit. Finally. I find that high-income individuals are five times more price sensitive than low-income individuals and that older individuals are less price-sensitive than young individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our aim was to compare the impact of SLNB and ALND on QOL and arm symptoms of patients with early breast cancer, using generic (short form 36 health survey) and tumor site-specific (FACT-B + 4) instruments. Methods: This was a prospective longitudinal observational study of 93 patients (64 SLNB, 29 ALND). Patients were evaluated presurgery and 1, 6, and 12 months postsurgery. Generalized estimation equation models were constructed to assess the effect of treatment on QOL. The relative risks of edema, dysesthesia, and heaviness were calculated comparing ALND to SLND. Results: Most patients presented T1 (67.7%) and underwent breast-conserving surgery (92.5%). At 12 months, the SLNB group presented deterioration on the FACT-B + 4 Arm Scale (beta coefficient estimated a change of -1.6 score points; P < 0.01) while, compared with SLNB, the deterioration in the ALND group was almost 2 additional score points higher (P = 0.009). FACT-B + 4 global summary and short form 36 health survey did not show statistically significant differences between groups. Relative risk of dysesthesia and subjective edema was higher for the ALND group than for the SLNB group (1.97 and 2.11 at month 12; P < 0.01). Conclusion: These results confirm the benefit of SLNB due to its lower arm morbidity impact on QOL, compared with ALND. There are clinically relevant between-treatment differences in the Arm Scale of FACT-B + 4, while there were no relevant differences in general well-being, measured with the disease-specific FACT-B + 4 and the generic short form 36 health survey.","[Belmonte, Roser; Escalada, Ferran] Hosp Mar Esperanca, Dept Med Fis & Rehabil, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Belmonte, Roser; Ferrer, Montserrat] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Garin, Olatz; Ferrer, Montserrat] CIBERESP, CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ, Madrid, Spain; [Garin, Olatz; Pont, Angels; Ferrer, Montserrat] Hosp del Mar, Res Inst, IMIM, Barcelona, Spain; [Segura, Marcel] Hosp Mar Esperanca, Dept Cirurgia Gen & Digest, Barcelona 08028, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Hospital del Mar,"Belmonte, R (通讯作者)，Hosp Mar Esperanca, Dept Med Fis & Rehabil, Parc Salut Mar,C St Josep Muntanya 12, Barcelona 08028, Spain.",rbelmonte@parcdesalutmar.cat,"Pont, Angels/B-1368-2015; Garin, Olatz/K-5468-2013; Belmonte, Roser/M-7778-2019; Ferrer, Montse/A-5510-2010; Belmonte, Roser/D-5478-2013","Pont, Angels/0000-0002-0602-552X; Ferrer, Montse/0000-0001-9867-7391; Belmonte, Roser/0000-0002-4062-4542",Instituto de Salud Carlos III FEDER [PI06/90070],Instituto de Salud Carlos III FEDER(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIIEuropean Union (EU)),"Source of financial support: This work was sponsored by a governmental grant from Instituto de Salud Carlos III FEDER (PI06/90070).

We explore whether several families of dynamic term structure models that enforce a zero lower bound on short rates imply conditional distributions of Japanese bond yields consistent with these patterns. Multi-factor shadow-rate and quadratic-Gaussian models, evaluated at their maximum likelihood estimates, capture many features of the data. Furthermore, model-implied risk premiums track realized excess returns during extended periods of near-zero short rates. In contrast, the conditional distributions implied by non-negative affine models do not match their sample counterparts, and standard Gaussian affine models generate implausibly large negative risk premiums.

We propose a two-step procedure that accommodates both (asymptotically) stationary (delta < 1/2) and nonstationary (delta >= 1/2) stochastic trend and/or equilibrium error. A tapered version of the local Whittle estimator of Robinson (2008) is used as the first-stage estimator, and the second-stage estimator employs the exact local Whittle approach of Shimotsu and Phillips (2005). The consistency and asymptotic distribution of the two-step estimator are derived. The estimator of the memory parameters has the same Gaussian asymptotic distribution in both the stationary and the nonstationary case. The convergence rate and the asymptotic distribution of the estimator of the cointegrating vector are affected by the difference between the memory parameters. Further, the estimator has a Gaussian asymptotic distribution when the difference between the memory parameters is less than 1/2. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

I employ panel data models using patient discharge and hospital financial data from California (1999-2006). My results indicate that uninsured patients have an economically significant effect that increases the mortality rate of insured heart attack patients. I show that these results are not driven by alternative explanations, including reverse causality, patient composition effects, sample selection or unobserved trends and that they are robust to a host of specification checks. The primary channel for the observed spillover effects is increased hospital uncompensated care costs. Although data limitations constrain my capacity to check how hospitals change their provision of care to insured heart attack patients in response to reduced revenues, the evidence I have suggests a modest increase in the quantity of cardiac services without a corresponding increase in hospital staff.

This is due to the fact that the typical judgement aggregation problem induces an ultrafilter on the set of individuals. We propose a model-theoretic framework for the analysis of judgement aggregation and show that the conditions typically imposed on aggregators induce an ultrafilter on the set of individuals, thus establishing a generalised version of the Kirman-Sondermann correspondence. In the finite case, dictatorship then immediately follows from the principality of an ultrafilter on a finite set. This is not the case for an infinite set of individuals, where there exist free ultrafilters, as Fishburn already stressed in 1970. Following Lauwers and Van Liedekerke's (1995) seminal paper, we investigate another source of impossibility results for free ultrafilters: the domain of an ultraproduct over a free ultrafilter extends the individual factor domains, such that the preservation of the truth value of some sentences by the aggregate model - if this is as usual to be restricted to the original domain - may again require the exclusion of free ultrafilters, leading to dictatorship once again.

The conclusions from the received studies vary across the region or country studied and/or the methodology employed. Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia panel survey, this paper investigates the relationship between mental health and inequality in Australia. A variety of income inequality indices are calculated to test both the income inequality and relative deprivation hypotheses. We find that mental health is only adversely affected by the presence of relative deprivation to a very small degree. In addition, we do not find support for the income inequality hypothesis. Importantly, our results are robust to a number of sensitivity analyses.

We show that a sieve nonparametric instrumental variables estimator is pointwise asymptotically normally distributed. The asymptotic normality result holds in both mildly and severely ill-posed cases. We present methods to obtain a uniform confidence band and show that the bootstrap can be used to obtain the required critical values. Monte Carlo experiments illustrate the finite-sample performance of the uniform confidence band. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this research was to explore the reasons why PRO label claims were denied and to compile regulatory feedback regarding the use of PROs in clinical trials. Methods: By using the Food and Drug Administration's Drug Approval Report Web page, all new molecular entities and biologic license applications approved between January 2006 and December 2010 were identified. For identified drug products, medical review sections from publicly available drug approval packages were reviewed to identify PRO end-point status and any Study Endpoints and Label Development team comments. Results: Of the 116 new molecular entities and biologic license applications with accompanying drug approval packages identified and reviewed, 44.8% of the products included PROs as part of the pivotal studies; however, only 24.1% received PRO label claims. Primary reasons for denial included issues of fit for purpose, issues of study design, data quality or interpretation, statistical issues, administrative issues, and lack of demonstrated treatment benefit. Conclusions: Based on drug approval packages, nearly half (45%) of new molecular entitity/biologic license application products in the years 2006 to 2010 included PROs in the clinical trials supporting their approval, yet this rate is not reflected by claims granted.

We compared the results of applying two different analytical methods-the traditional human capital approach (HCA) and the emerging friction cost approach (FCA)-to estimate breast and prostate cancer productivity costs in Ireland in 2008. Methods: Data from a survey of breast and prostate cancer patients were combined with population-level survival estimates and a national wage data set to calculate costs of temporary disability (cancer-related work absence), permanent disability (workforce departure, reduced working hours), and premature mortality. Results: For breast cancer, productivity costs per person using the HCA were (sic)193,425 and those per person using the FCA were (sic)8,103; for prostate cancer, the comparable estimates were (sic)109,154 and (sic)8,205, respectively. The HCA generated higher costs for younger patients (breast cancer) because of greater lifetime earning potential. In contrast, the FCA resulted in higher productivity costs for older male patients (prostate cancer) commensurate with higher earning capacity over a shorter time period. Reduced working hours postcancer was a key driver of total HCA productivity costs. HCA costs were sensitive to assumptions about discount and growth rates. FCA costs were sensitive to assumptions about the friction period. Conclusions: The magnitude of the estimates obtained in this study illustrates the importance of including productivity costs when considering the economic impact of illness. Vastly different results emerge from the application of the HCA and the FCA, and this finding emphasizes the importance of choosing the study perspective carefully and being explicit about assumptions that underpin the methods.","[Hanly, Paul; Timmons, Aileen; Walsh, Paul M.; Sharp, Linda] Natl Canc Registry Ireland, Cork, Ireland",,"Hanly, P (通讯作者)，Natl Canc Registry Ireland, Bldg 6800,Cork Airport Business Pk,Kinsale Rd, Cork, Ireland.",p.hanly@ncri.ie,,"Hanly, Paul/0000-0002-5348-4825",Irish Cancer Society; Health Research Board,Irish Cancer Society; Health Research Board,"The breast and prostate cancer survey was funded by the Irish Cancer Society.

Recent research has used the term multicriteria decision analysis for methods that systematically include preferences for both equity and efficiency. The present study compares decision-makers' preferences at the country level for a set of equity and efficiency criteria according to a multicriteria decision analysis framework. Methods: Discrete choice experiments were conducted for Brazil, Cuba, Nepal, Norway, and Uganda. By using standardized methods, we elicited preferences for intervention attributes using a individual choice questionnaire. A multinomial logistic regression was applied to estimate the coefficients for all single-policy criteria, per country. Attributes were assigned to an equity group or to an efficiency group. After testing for scale variance, predicted probabilities for interventions with both types of attributes were compared across countries. Results: The Norway and Nepal groups showed considerable prefer-ences for efficiency criteria over equity criteria with percent change in respective predicted sum probabilities of [10%, -84%] and [6%, -79%]. Brazil and Uganda also showed preference for the efficiency criteria though less convincingly ([-34%, -93%], [-18%, -63%], respectively). The Cuban group showed the strongest preferences with equity attributes dominating efficiency ([-52%, 213%]). Conclusions: Group preferences of policymakers show explicit but varying trade-offs of efficiency and equity in these diverse settings. This multicriteria decision analysis approach, using discrete choice experiments, indicates that systematic setting of health priorities is possible across a variety of countries. It may be a valuable tool to guide health reform initiatives.","[Mirelman, Andrew; Kinter, Elizabeth; Ozawa, Sachiko; Niessen, Louis W.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Mentzakis, Emmanouil; Fordham, Richard; Niessen, Louis W.] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Kinter, Elizabeth] Campbell Alliance, Boston, MA USA; [Paolucci, Francesco] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Ctr Econ Res Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Ferraz, Marcos] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo Ctr Hlth Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Baltussen, Rob] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Primary & Community Care, Nijmegen Med Ctr, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; University of East Anglia; Australian National University; Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Radboud University Nijmegen,"Mirelman, A (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St,Room E8132, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",amirelma@jhsph.edu,"Ozawa, Sachiko/Z-4944-2019; Niessen, Louis/F-6254-2015; Niessen, Louis Wilhelmus/HSF-5254-2023; Baltussen, R.M.P.M./L-4181-2015","Ozawa, Sachiko/0000-0001-7608-9038; Niessen, Louis/0000-0002-8639-5191; PAOLUCCI, FRANCESCO/0000-0002-6585-7190; Mentzakis, Emmanouil/0000-0003-1761-209X; Fordham, Richard/0000-0002-5520-6255; Paolucci, Francesco/0000-0001-6173-5324",,,,,37,46,49,1,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2012,15,3.0,,,,,534,539,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.04.001,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,941CN,22583464.0,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303940600017,0

Methods: Patients from 11 Danish rheumatology outpatient clinics were asked to report current health status using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D), 15D, and six-dimensional health state short form (derived from SF-12) (SF-6D) instruments. Clinical staff provided data on current disease status (C-reactive protein and Disease Activity Score that involves clinical assessment of 28 joints). National mortality data were retrieved from Statistics Denmark. For each of the three instruments, mean index scores were estimated by gender and 5-year age groups. Partial QALE was estimated for the age interval 30 to 79 years for different subsamples. Results: Although the three quality-of-life index scores were highly correlated, there were statistically significant differences between the average index scores from the three instruments. The 15D provided the highest index score and SF-6D the lowest score. For a 30-year-old patient, the partial QALE ranged from 37.9 quality-adjusted life-years using the SF-6D to 45.6 quality-adjusted life-years using the 15D. The QALE for men and women differed by 6.2%, 4.0%, and 5.3% when the calculation was based on EQ-5D, SF-6D, and 15D index scores, respectively. The largest differences were observed when patients were grouped by functional status (Health Assessment Questionnaire score), where the EQ-5D showed a 50% difference in index score between the best and worst functional group while the SF-6D and 15D showed smaller differences (32% and 14%, respectively). Discussion: This analysis has shown the difference in QALE estimates related to different instruments. The study emphasizes that unless outcome studies use the same instruments and scoring algorithms, the results will not be directly comparable.","[Sorensen, Jan] Univ So Denmark, Ctr Appl Hlth Serv Res & Technol Assessment, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Linde, Louise; Hetland, Merete Lund] DANBIO Registry, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ostergaard, Mikkel; Hetland, Merete Lund] Copenhagen Univ Hosp Glostrup, Dept Rheumatol, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Copenhagen,"Sorensen, J (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Ctr Appl Hlth Serv Res & Technol Assessment, JB Winslows Vej 9B, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark.",jas@cast.sdu.dk,"Hetland, Merete L/AAE-5297-2019; Sorensen, Jan/AAN-3738-2020","Hetland, Merete L/0000-0003-4229-6818; Sorensen, Jan/0000-0003-0857-9267",Schering-Plough; National Board of Health [0-204-3-9/2006],Schering-Plough(Merck & CompanySchering Plough Corporation); National Board of Health,Parts of the study were supported by unrestricted research grants from Schering-Plough and the National Board of Health (J.

We consider that the good under consideration tends to be negligibly small compared to the entire set of commodity characteristics which is assumed to be a continuum, and look into the limit property of preferences over state-contingent consumption of the good and state-contingent income transfer associated to it. We show that the limit preference exhibits risk neutrality, not only that it exhibits no income effect, meaning that the two conditions are tied together. We also show that the marginal rate of substitution between extra income transfers at different states of the world converges to the ratio between the Lagrange multipliers associated to those states. When the asset markets are complete such ratios are equalized between consumers, but it is not the case in general when the asset markets are incomplete. This means that using the aggregate expected consumer surplus as the welfare measure will be in general inconsistent with individuals' expected utility maximization in the general equilibrium environment or with ex-ante Pareto efficiency.

A metric rationalizable SWF reports as an approximation of the unanimity consensus the relative ranking of any pair of alternatives as in the closest profile where individuals all agree on those alternatives, the closeness being measured with respect to a metric on profiles. Two notions of unanimity are in consideration: top unanimity on an alternative holds when individuals all agree that it is top ranked while pairwise unanimity on a pair occurs when individuals all prefer an alternative to another. Without strong requirements on metrics, characterizations provided in both cases show that metric rationalizations of SWFs are essentially equivalent to the Pareto principle for SWFs. Furthermore, two interesting classes of metric rationalizable SWFs - multi-valued scoring SWFs and pairwise scoring SWFs - are each uniquely identified by means of some appropriate and appealing properties on metrics among which decomposability, neutrality and monotonicity are known.

We focus on the two population groups which are the most vulnerable to malaria (children under 5 years and pregnant women) and on two preventive behaviors (sleeping under a bednet and taking intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy). We define the social environment of the individual as people living in the same region. To detect social interactions, we calculate the size of the social multiplier by comparing the effects of an exogenous variable at individual and regional levels. Our data come from 92 surveys for 29 Sub-Saharan countries between 1999 and 2012, and they cover approximately 660,000 children and 95,000 women. Our results indicate that there are social interactions in malaria preventive behaviors in the form of social multipliers effects of women's education and household wealth. The long-run effects of these characteristics on preventive behaviors at the regional level are larger than those apparent at the individual level.

We find little evidence of improvement in either the medium or the long run.

Estimates translate into an elasticity of 0.07-0.13 and the observed reduction in pollution implies an annual gain of 826-1460 infant lives.

The investor exhibits a change in the discount rate. The investment opportunities are a stock and a riskless account. The market coefficients and discount factor switch according to a finite state Markov chain. The change in the discount rate leads to time inconsistencies of the investor's decisions. The randomness in our model is driven by a Brownian motion and a Markov chain. Following Ekeland and Pirvu (2008) we introduce and characterize the subgame perfect strategies.

He records the first alternative as the initial survivor and then at every stage, he compares the current survivor with the next alternative in the list to determine whether the next alternative replaces that to become the new survivor. When the entire list is exhausted in this manner, the agent chooses the survivor in the last stage. We call this procedure iterative and provide an axiomatic characterization for it when the order in every list is observable. Then, we also study characterizations of the iterative procedure that is prone to the well-known primacy and recency effects. Finally, we analyze situations where the order of alternatives is unknown to an outside observer and provide a characterization result that enables such an outsider with limited information to understand whether the decision maker can indeed be an iterative list chooser for some order.","[Guney, Begum] Ozyegin Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Ozyegin University,"Guney, B (通讯作者)，Nisantepe Mh Orman Sk 13 Cekmekoy, Istanbul, Turkey.",begum.guney@ozyegin.edu.tr,"Guney, Begum/AAD-7428-2019","Guney, Begum/0000-0002-8638-6295",,,,,40,5,6,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0304-4068,,,J MATH ECON,J.

Methods: Resource usage in a 12-month clinical trial of LTHT was estimated from hospital records, patient diaries, and the equipment supplier. Health state utility values were derived from the St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score. All patients who remained in the trial for 12 months and who had at least 90 days of diary records were included (87 of 108). Results: Clinical costs were NZ $3973 (95% confidence interval [CI] $1614-$6332) for the control group and NZ $3331 (95% CI $948-$6920) for the intervention group. The mean health benefit per patient was -6.9 SGRQ units (95% CI -13.0 to -7.2; P < 0.05) or +0.0678 quality adjusted life years (95% CI 0.001-0.135). With the intervention costing NZ $2059 annually, the mean cost per quality-adjusted life-year was NZ $20,902 (US $18,907) and the bootstrap median was NZ $19,749 (2.5th percentile -$40,923, 97.5th percentile $221,275). At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of NZ $30,000, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 61%, ranging from 49% to 72% as the cost of LTHT was varied by +/- 30%. At a WTP of NZ $20,000, the probability was 49% (range 34%-61%). Conclusions: LTHT is moderately cost-effective for patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchiectasis at a WTP threshold that is acceptable for public funding of medicines in New Zealand. These findings must be interpreted with caution because of the modest size of the clinical study, necessary lack of blinding in the clinical trial, and uncertainty in estimating health state utility from the SQRQ.","[Milne, Richard J.] Hlth Outcomes Associates Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand; [Milne, Richard J.] Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Hockey, Hans] Biometr Matters Ltd, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Rea, Harry] Univ Auckland, South Auckland Clin Sch, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland; University of Auckland,"Milne, RJ (通讯作者)，Hlth Outcomes Associates Ltd, POB 25,005,St Heliers, Auckland, New Zealand.",rj.milne@auckland.ac.nz,"Milne, Richard/GNH-1930-2022",,"Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Limited; Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (NZ Government Science Fund); Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Limited, New Zealand","Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Limited; Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (NZ Government Science Fund); Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Limited, New Zealand","This study was supported by Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Limited.

Using household panel data from the Indonesian socio-economic household survey (Susenas) for 2003 and 2004, and applying fixed effects Poisson models, we find evidence of economic risk from illness through medical expenses. For the poor and the informal sector, ill health events impact negatively on income from wage labour, whereas for the non-poor and formal sector, it is income from self-employed business activities which is negatively affected. However, only for the rural population and the poor does this lead to a decrease in consumption, whereas the non-poor seem to be able to protect current household spending. Borrowing and drawing on family network and buffers, such as savings and assets, seem to be key informal coping strategies for the poor, which may have negative long-term effects. While these results suggest scope for public intervention, the economic risk from income loss for the rural poor is beyond public health care financing reforms. Rather, formal sector employment seems to be a key instrument for financial protection from illness, by also reducing income risk.

Using this result we find the envy-free and budget-balanced allocation rules which are least manipulable for each preference profile in terms of any agent's maximal gain. If preferences are quasi-linear, then we can find an envy-free and budget-balanced allocation rule such that for any problem, the maximal utility gain from manipulation is equalized among all agents.

We use panel data on bilateral migration flows and HIV prevalence rates covering 44 countries after 1990. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, reverse causality, reflection issues, incorrect treatment of country fixed effects and spatial autocorrelation, we find evidence of a highly robust emigration-induced propagation mechanism. On the contrary, immigration has no significant effect. Numerical experiments reveal that the long-run effect of emigration accounts for more than 4 percent of the number of HIV cases in 15 countries (and more than 20 percent in 6 countries).

This method allows to characterize utility changes associated with marginal variations in exogenous policy parameters along the entire transition path between two steady states. At the same time, it is not more complicated than a pure steady state analysis. Moreover, it can be applied to economies for which an explicit solution of the transition path is not available.

Infrequent monitoring of the debtors' solvency will result in erroneous observations of the rating transition times, and consequently in biased parameter estimates. We develop a score test against such measurement errors in the transition data that is independent of the error distribution. We derive the asymptotic chi(2)-distribution for the test statistic under the null by stochastic limit theory. The test is applied to an international corporate portfolio, while accounting for economic and debtor-specific covariates. The test indicates that measurement errors in the transition times are a real problem in practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Observational studies are being performed to help fill evidence gaps. Widespread adoption of evidence from observational studies, however, has been limited because of various factors, including the lack of consensus regarding accepted principles for their evaluation and interpretation. Two task forces were formed to develop questionnaires to assist decision makers in evaluating observational studies, with one Task Force addressing retrospective research and the other Task Force addressing prospective research. The intent was to promote a structured approach to reduce the potential for subjective interpretation of evidence and drive consistency in decision making. Separately developed questionnaires were combined into a single questionnaire consisting of 33 items. These were divided into two domains: relevance and credibility. Relevance addresses the extent to which findings, if accurate, apply to the setting of interest to the decision maker. Credibility addresses the extent to which the study findings accurately answer the study question. The questionnaire provides a guide for assessing the degree of confidence that should be placed from observational studies and promotes awareness of the subtleties involved in evaluating those.","[Berger, Marc L.] Pfizer, Real World Data & Analyt, New York, NY USA; [Martin, Bradley C.] Div Pharmaceut Evaluat & Policy, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Husereau, Don] Inst Hlth Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Ottawa, Dept Epidemiol & Community Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Tyrol, Austria; [Worley, Karen] Humana Inc, Comprehens Hlth Insights, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Allen, J.

We propose a simple, new estimation method based on an augmented partial sum (integration) transformation of the regression model. The new estimator is labeled integrated modified ordinary least squares (IM-OLS). IM-OLS is similar in spirit to the fully modified OLS approach of Phillips and Hansen (1990) and also bears similarities to the dynamic OLS approach of Phillips and Loretan (1991), Saikkonen (1991) and Stock and Watson (1993), with the key difference that IM-OLS does not require estimation of long run variance matrices and avoids the need to choose tuning parameters (kernels, bandwidths, lags). Inference does require that a long run variance be scaled out, and we propose traditional and fixed-b methods for obtaining critical values for test statistics. The properties of IM-OLS are analyzed using asymptotic theory and finite sample simulations. IM-OLS performs well relative to other approaches in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An advantage of the frequency domain approach is that it enables serial correlation to be treated non-parametrically. We demonstrate that our proposed statistics have pivotal limiting distributions under both the null and near seasonally integrated alternatives when we allow for weak dependence in the driving shocks. This is in contrast to the popular seasonal unit root tests of, among others, Hylleberg et al. (1990) which treat serial correlation parametrically via lag augmentation of the test regression. Our analysis allows for (possibly infinite order) moving average behaviour in the shocks. The size and power properties of our proposed frequency domain regression-based tests are explored and compared for the case of quarterly data with those of the tests of Hylleberg et al. (1990) in simulation experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Possible way how to achieve this benefit is also to build a brand valuable from the customer's perspective. This is because the brand is in fact a factor that significantly affects the buying decision of the consumer. Despite the fact that according to some authors, universal access to branding across cultures can be applied considering to globalization (almost in the process of brand value building and managing, where brand identity and image have to be uniform to reach goals which were set), there are still national specificities, which form a barrier of general applicability and reduce the effectiveness of applied marketing solutions and processes. [I] This is the reason why uniform approach to the brand building and managing can not be used. In this paper, we focus on the specifics of communication policy in the conditions of car brands through the analysis of current communication policy of car brand Skoda in the Slovak market. First, we analyze current state of communication policy and than we briefly argue with results of questionnaire survey. So we present the platform for future construction of integrated model of communication policy of car brands in specific conditions of Slovak market.","[Gogolova, Martina; Majerova, Jana] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Majerova, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",martina.gogolova@fpedas.uniza.sk; jana.majerova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Majerova, Jana/N-8126-2015; Gogolova, Martina/O-5769-2015",,,,,,7,3,3,0,14,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-1685-5,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2014,44,,,,,,9,+,,10.5729/lnms.vol44.9,0.0,,,3,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC9DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356316000002,0

If the coefficients are plausible and robust, this is commonly interpreted as evidence of structural validity. Here, we study when and how one can infer structural validity from coefficient robustness and plausibility. As we show, there are numerous pitfalls, as commonly implemented robustness checks give neither necessary nor sufficient evidence for structural validity. Indeed, if not conducted properly, robustness checks can be completely uninformative or entirely misleading. We discuss how critical and non-critical core variables can be properly specified and how non-core variables for the comparison regression can be chosen to ensure that robustness checks are indeed structurally informative. We provide a straightforward new Hausman (1978) type test of robustness for the critical core coefficients, additional diagnostics that can help explain why robustness test rejection occurs, and a new estimator, the Feasible Optimally combined GLS (FOGLeSs) estimator, that makes relatively efficient use of the robustness check regressions. A new procedure for Matlab, test rob, embodies these methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Such spaces might naturally contain equilibrium variables (paths) as well as time-dependent policies of a macro model. Convolution behaves very well on those spaces, which can be used as a basis for the classical comparative statics (see e.g. Mertens and Rubinchik (2011)). Finally, we generalise the classical implicit function theorem (IFT) for a family of Banach spaces, with the resulting implicit function having derivatives that are locally Lipschitz to very strong operator norms.

A new trade theory model is constructed without any freely traded homogeneous good, so that we can examine the home market effect (HME) and the non-monotonic relation between income inequalities and globalization. Meanwhile, there are three HME definitions for a two-country space in terms of firm share, labor wage, and trade pattern. The first two remain applicable in a multicountry space, and they are shown to be equivalent. However, a natural extension of the third is not equivalent. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In terms of social welfare, this prisoner's dilemma always works to the advantage of both consumers and society. This result allows a novel and enlightening perspective on some issues of substantial interest in the innovation literature. In particular, the incentive firms face towards R&D cooperation in the form of an R&D cartel is shown to be maximal for the case of zero spillovers, which is when the prisoner's dilemma has the largest scope.

This represents an improvement on the way uncertainty has been accommodated in existing approaches (e.g., threshold approach to cost-effectiveness analysis). We illustrate the approach using the decision making plane, which explicitly incorporates opportunity costs and relaxes the assumptions of perfect divisibility and constant returns to scale of the cost-effectiveness plane. The nature of the bad (or good) outcome is determined by the quadrant that it falls into (i.e., a quadrant effect') and its magnitude by its location within the quadrant (i.e., within quadrant effect'). By explicitly defining the loss function, the process of accepting (or rejecting) a new program becomes transparent. We illustrate the approach using a loss function and a net gain function. We show that by recognizing that, not all bad (or good) outcomes are equal and the choice of a loss or a net gain function can result in different ranking of resource allocation options. Further implications of the proposed approach are discussed.

The rate of growth of this variance depends crucially on the type of memory, and we present results on the behavior of tapered sums of sample autocovariances in this context when the bandwidth vanishes asymptotically. We also present asymptotic results for the case that the bandwidth is a fixed proportion of sample size, extending known results to the case of flat-top tapers. We adopt the fixed proportion bandwidth perspective in our empirical section, presenting two methods for estimating the limiting critical values-both the subsampling method and a plug-in approach. Simulation studies compare the size and power of both approaches as applied to hypothesis testing for the mean. Both methods perform well - although the subsampling method appears to be better sized - and provide a viable framework for conducting inference for the mean. In summary, we supply a unified asymptotic theory that covers all different types of memory under a single umbrella. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

With specific reference to two subpopulations of women already at risk (i.e., familial history or previous event of VIE), the study aimed to assess whether current screening practices in Italy are cost-effective. Methods: Two decisional models accrued costs and quality adjusted life-years (QALY) annually from the perspective of the National Health Service. the two models were derived from a decision analysis exercise concerning testing practices and consequent prescribing behavior for oral contraception conducted with 250 Italian gynecologists. Health care costs were compiled on the basis of 10-year hospital discharge records and the activities of a thrombosis center. Whenever possible, input data were based on the Italian context; otherwise, the data were taken from the international literature. Results: Current testing practices on women with a familial history of VIE generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)72,412/QALY, which is well above the acceptable threshold of cost-effectiveness of (sic)40,000 to (sic)50,000/QALY. In the case of women with a previous event of V'I'E, the most frequently used testing strategy is cost-ineffective and leads to an overall loss of QALY. Conclusions: This study represents the first attempt to conduct a cost utility analysis of genetic screening practices for the predisposition to VIE in the Italian setting. the results indicate that there is an urgent need to better monitor the indications for which tests for factor V Leiden and factor II are prescribed.","[Compagni, Amelia; Tarricone, Rosanna] Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Compagni, Amelia; Melegaro, Alessia; Tarricone, Rosanna] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management CeRGAS, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Melegaro, Alessia] Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Compagni, A (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",amelia.compagni@unibocconi.it,,"compagni, amelia/0000-0003-1744-3134; TARRICONE, ROSANNA/0000-0002-2009-9357; Melegaro, Alessia/0000-0003-2221-8898",Italian Ministry of Higher Education and Research within the PRIN program; Italian Ministry of Higher Education and Research within the PRIN program,Italian Ministry of Higher Education and Research within the PRIN program; Italian Ministry of Higher Education and Research within the PRIN program,Source of financial support: The project was funded by a grant of the Italian Ministry of Higher Education and Research within the PRIN program 2007.,,70,10,10,2,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,909,921,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.05.003,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041341.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700002,0

The basic idea is to exploit information regarding the m unobserved factors that are shared by k observed time series in addition to the series under consideration. Initially, we develop the tests assuming that m(0), the true number of factors, is known and show that the limit distribution of the tests does not depend on any nuisance parameters, so long as k >= m(0) - 1. Small sample properties of the tests are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and are shown to be satisfactory. Particularly, the proposed CIPS and CSB tests have the correct size for all combinations of the cross section (N) and time series (T) dimensions considered. The power of both tests rises with N and T, although the CSB test performs better than the CIPS test for smaller sample sizes. The various testing procedures are illustrated with empirical applications to real interest rates and real equity prices across countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Pesaran, M.

The reliability of the EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales is modest, thus limiting their utility in both clinical and research settings. The purpose of this study was to validate the factor structure of multiple-item subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and to improve their reliability by means of an item response analysis by using the multidimensional partial credit model. Methods: A total of 2295 patients with complete data were used for the analysis. One- and nine-dimensional partial credit models were used to fit the data to validate the construct validity of the multiple-item subscales of the QLQ-C30. Results: The model comparison showed that the nine-dimensional factor structure of multiple-item subscales was satisfactory. The multidimensional partial credit model fit data of the multiple-item subscales of the QLQ-C30 reasonably well. The estimated test reliabilities of each domain obtained from the multidimensional approach were higher than those obtained from the unidimensional approach. Conclusions: The constructs represented by the multiple-item subscales of the QLQ-C30 were validated. The improved reliability of the multiple-item subscales of the QLQ-C30 under the multidimensional approach can facilitate their applications in clinical and research settings.","[Shih, Ching-Lin] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Teacher Educ, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chen, Chien-Hung] Natl Taiwan Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Chen, Chien-Hung] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Med, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Sheu, Ching-Fan] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Educ, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Lang, Hui-Chu] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Sch Med, Inst Hosp & Hlth Care Adm, Taipei 11221, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Ching-Lin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Med, Sch Occupat Therapy, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Ching-Lin] Natl Taiwan Univ Hosp, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Taipei, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University; National Cheng Kung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University Hospital,"Lang, HC (通讯作者)，Natl Yang Ming Univ, Sch Med, Inst Hosp & Hlth Care Adm, 155,Sec 2,Linong St, Taipei 11221, Taiwan.",hclang@ym.edu.tw,"Sheu, Ching-Fan/CAI-2388-2022; Sheu, Ching-Fan/CAF-6596-2022; Lang, Hui-Chu/GXG-4373-2022; HSIEH, CHING-LIN/G-6057-2011","Sheu, Ching-Fan/0000-0002-5978-5768; Sheu, Ching-Fan/0000-0002-5978-5768; HSIEH, CHING-LIN/0000-0001-9468-9969",Taiwan National Health Research Institute [NHRI-EX909007PC],Taiwan National Health Research Institute,This study was funded by the Taiwan National Health Research Institute (grant no.

The causal impact of unemployment is established using instrumental variable methods. Psychological health is measured using both the General Household Questionnaire measure and also self-reported data on individual occurrences of anxiety-related conditions. We find evidence for positive selection into unemployment on the basis of poor psychological health. Nevertheless, panel instrumental variable estimates suggest a sizeable causal worsening of psychological health arising from unemployment. We also find evidence that the negative impact of unemployment can be largely mitigated by local labour market conditions: those entering unemployment in localities with higher unemployment rates suffer less deterioration in their psychological health.

For the most part, the asymptotic optimality of various existing frequentist model averaging estimators has been established under i.i.d. errors. Recently, Hansen and Racine [Hansen, B.E., Racine, J., 2012. jackknife model averaging. Journal of Econometrics 167, 38-46] developed a jackknife model averaging (JMA) estimator, which has an important advantage over its competitors in that it achieves the lowest possible asymptotic squared error under heteroscedastic errors. In this paper, we broaden Hansen and Racine's scope of analysis to encompass models with (i) a non-diagonal error covariance structure, and (ii) lagged dependent variables, thus allowing for dependent data. We show that under these set-ups, the JMA estimator is asymptotically optimal by a criterion equivalent to that used by Hansen and Racine. A Monte Carlo study demonstrates the finite sample performance of the JMA estimator in a variety of model settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Data come from the 1997, 2002, and 2007 waves of the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The findings show that income-related child health inequality remains stable as children grow up and enter adolescence. The main factor underlying income-related child health inequality is income itself, although other factors, such as maternal education, also play a role. Decomposition of income-related health mobility indicates that health changes over time are more favorable to children with lower initial family incomes versus children with higher initial family incomes. However, offsetting this effect, our findings also suggest that changes in income ranking over time are positively related to children's subsequent health status.

This study specifically investigates the effect of an individual's unemployment on the mental health of their spouse. In order to allow for causal interpretation of the estimates, it focuses on plant closure as entry into unemployment, and combines difference-in-difference and matching based on entropy balancing to provide robustness against observable and time-invariant unobservable heterogeneity. Using German Socio-Economic Panel Study data the paper reveals that unemployment decreases the mental health of spouses almost as much as for the directly affected individuals. The findings highlight that previous studies underestimate the public health costs of unemployment as they do not account for the potential consequences for spouses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In order to better understand the causes of this phenomenon, we investigate the relationship between suicidal ideation and cannabis use. Our empirical analysis is based on a 30-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort. We find that intensive cannabis use - at least several times per week - leads to a higher transition rate into suicidal ideation for males. We find no evidence that suicidal ideation leads to cannabis use for either males or females. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We characterize the transition between competitive pricing (without rebates), mixed strategy equilibrium (for intermediate rebates), and monopoly pricing (for larger rebates). In the mixed equilibrium, a firm's support consists of two parts: (i) aggressive prices that can steal away customers from the other firm, and (ii) defensive prices that can only attract customers who get the rebate. Both firms earn positive expected profits. We show that, counter-intuitively, for intermediate rebates, an increase in rebates leads to a lower market segmentation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using a Lagrange Multiplier approach rather than the Likelihood Ratio statistic proposed by Neyman greatly simplifies the calculations. Polynomials, splines, and the step function of Pearson's test are compared as alternative perturbations to the theoretical uniform distribution. The extended tests have negligible size distortion and more power than standard tests. The tests are applied to competing symmetric leptokurtic distributions with US stock return data.

The occurrence of asset price bubbles (see Araujo et al., 2011) when only myopia is required, explains why we focused on a stronger notion that we define as impatience and which allows to avoid such market anomalies. The first part characterizes the impatience and the myopia in the context of discrete and continuous time flows of income (consumption) valued through a Choquet integral with respect to an (exact) capacity. Our results unlike the additive utility functional allow to disentangle myopia from impatience: impatience requires myopia but the converse is false. Moreover it turns out that in our framework a decision maker exhibits more easily impatience and myopia in continuous time than in discrete time. In the second part, we recall the generalization given by Rebille (2008) of the Yosida-Hewitt decomposition of an additive set function into a continuous part and a pathological part and use it to give a characterization of those convex capacities whose core contains at least one g-continuous measure. We then proceed to characterize the exact capacities whose core contains only g-continuous measures thus connecting some previous characterizations of impatience and myopia with core properties of exact capacities. As a dividend, a simple characterization of countably additive Borel probabilities on locally compact a-compact metric spaces is obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We used generalized cost-effectiveness analysis and included costs from a health sector perspective. The model considered road traffic crash victims who were injured, disabled, or died. We obtained proportions of alcohol-related crashes from the Thai Injury Surveillance system. Intervention effectiveness was derived from published reviews and a study in one province of Thailand. Random breath testing, selective breath testing, and mass media campaigns, both current and intervention scenarios, were compared with a do-nothing scenario. We calculated intervention costs and cost offsets of prevented treatment costs in 2004 Thai baht (US $1 = 41 baht) and measured benefits in terms of disability-adjusted life-years averted. Interventions with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below 110,000 Thai baht (1 x gross domestic product per capita) per disability-adjusted life-year (US $2,680) were considered very cost-effective. Results: Compared with doing nothing, mass media campaigns, random breath testing, and selective breath testing are all cost saving. When averted treatment costs are ignored and only intervention costs are included, all three interventions are very cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 10,300, 14,300 and 13,000 baht/disability-adjusted life-year, respectively. The current mix of mass media campaigns and sobriety checkpoints is therefore also cost-effective, but underinvestment in checkpoints limits its overall effect. Conclusions: A greater intensity of conducting sobriety checkpoints in Thailand is recommended to complement the investment in mass media campaigns. Together these interventions have the potential to reduce the burden of alcohol-related road traffic injuries by 24%.","[Ditsuwan, Vallop] Thaksin Univ, Fac Hlth & Sports Sci, Amphoe Muang 93110, Phatthalung Pro, Thailand; [Ditsuwan, Vallop; Veerman, Jacob Lennert; Bertram, Melanie; Vos, Theo] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Thaksin University; University of Queensland,"Ditsuwan, V (通讯作者)，Thaksin Univ, Fac Hlth & Sports Sci, Amphoe Muang 93110, Phatthalung Pro, Thailand.",vallop.ditsuwan@uqconnect.edu.au,"Veerman, Lennert/A-9973-2011","Veerman, Lennert/0000-0002-3206-8232","Wellcome Trust, UK [071842/Z/03/Z]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [301199]","Wellcome Trust, UK(Wellcome Trust); National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia)","This work was completed as part of the Setting Priorities using Information on Cost-Effectiveness project, funded by the Wellcome Trust, UK (grant number 071842/Z/03/Z), and the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (grant number 301199).

Methods: A decision tree was specified for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer. Six strategies were defined from relevant combinations of mediastinoscopy, endoscopic or endobronchial ultrasound with needle aspiration, and combined positron emission tomography-computed tomography with F18-fluorodeoxyglucose. Patients without distant metastases and central or contralateral nodal involvement (N2/N3) were considered to be candidates for surgical resection. Diagnostic accuracies were informed from literature reviews, prevalence and survival from the Danish Lung Cancer Registry, and procedure costs from national average tariffs. All parameters were specified probabilistically to determine the joint decision uncertainty. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on the net present value of expected costs and life years accrued over a time horizon of 5 years. Results: At threshold values of around 30,000 for cost-effectiveness, it was found to be cost-effective to send all patients to positron emission tomography-computed tomography with confirmation of positive findings on nodal involvement by endobronchial ultrasound. This result appeared robust in deterministic sensitivity analysis. The expected value of perfect information was estimated at 52 per patient, indicating that further research might be worthwhile. Conclusions: The policy recommendation is to make combined positron emission tomography-computed tomography and endobronchial ultrasound available for supplemental staging of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. The effects of alternative strategies on patients' quality of life, however, should be examined in future studies.","[Sogaard, Rikke] Univ So Denmark, Ctr Hlth Serv Res & Technol Assessment, Inst Publ Hlth, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Fischer, Barbara Malene B.; Mortensen, Jann] Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Physiol, Nucl Med & PET, Rigshosp, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Mortensen, Jann] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Rasmussen, Torben R.] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Pulmonol, Aarhus Sygehus, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Lassen, Ulrik] Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Dept Oncol, Rigshosp, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; Rigshospitalet; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; Aarhus University; Rigshospitalet; University of Copenhagen,"Sogaard, R (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Ctr Hlth Serv Res & Technol Assessment, Inst Publ Hlth, JB Winslows Vej 9B, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark.",ris@cast.sdu.dk,"Lassen, Ulrik/AAH-2799-2021","Fischer, Barbara Malene/0000-0002-6065-3375; Lassen, Ulrik/0000-0002-3865-4574; Mortensen, Jann/0000-0002-1399-8995; Sogaard, Rikke/0000-0003-3557-8550",Danish Cancer Society [R2-A299-B239],Danish Cancer Society(Danish Cancer Society),The Danish Cancer Society (application no.

In states where payday lending is legal, many terms of these loans are regulated, ostensibly to protect the consumer from excessively burdensome lending practices. The existing literature on payday loans has primarily focused on estimating causal effects of access to those loans, including work by Morse (2011), Skiba and Tobacman (2009) and Melzer (2011). Using individual-level administrative records on borrowers in 38 states from an online payday lender, this paper departs from past work by estimating how payday loan regulation affects borrower behavior, specifically how much they choose to borrow, how many times they choose to renew the loan, and whether or not they choose to default. State-level variation in maximum loan sizes and renewal caps are used as exclusion restrictions for identification purposes. We pay particular attention to the calculation of posterior predictive distributions that summarize the sensitivities of borrower behavior to various changes in state-level policies.

Researchers have employed various methods to cost hospital stays, including per diem or diagnosis-related group (DRG)-based costs. Alternative methods differ in data collection and costing methodology. Using data from Scotland as an illustrative example, costing methods are compared, highlighting the wider implications for other countries with a publicly financed healthcare system. Five methods are compared using longitudinal data including baseline survey data (Midspan) linked to acute hospital admissions. Cost variables are derived using two forms of DRG-type costs, costs per diem, costs per episodeusing a novel approach that distinguishes between variable and fixed costs and incorporates individual length of stay (LOS), and costs per episode using national average LOS. Cost estimates are generated using generalised linear model regression. Descriptive analysis shows substantial variation between costing methods. Differences found in regression analyses highlight the magnitude of variation in cost estimates for subgroups of the sample population. This paper emphasises that any inference made from econometric modelling of costs, where the marginal effect of explanatory variables is assessed, is substantially influenced by the costing method.

Differences in uptake of screening related to socio-economic status exist and may contribute to differences in morbidity and mortality across socio-economic groups. Although a number of factors are likely to underlie differential uptake, differential access to subsequent diagnostic tests and/or treatment may have a pivotal role. This study examines differences in the uptake of cancer screening in Ireland related to socio-economic status. Data were extracted from SLAN 2007 concerning uptake of breast, cervical, colorectal and prostate cancer screening in the preceding 12?months. Concentration indices were calculated and decomposed. Particular emphasis was placed in the decomposition upon the impact of private health insurance, evidenced in other work to impact on access to care within the mixed publicprivate Irish health system. This study found that significant differences related to socio-economic status exist with respect to uptake of cancer screening and that the main determinant of difference for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer screening was possession of private insurance. This may have profound implications for the design of cancer control strategies in countries where private insurance has a significant role, even where screening services are publicly funded and population based.

There are two main methods for achieving this: transparency (people can see how the model is built) and validation (how well the model reproduces reality). This report describes recommendations for achieving transparency and validation developed by a taskforce appointed by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and the Society for Medical Decision Making. Recommendations were developed iteratively by the authors. A nontechnical description-including model type, intended applications, funding sources, structure, intended uses, inputs, outputs, other components that determine function, and their relationships, data sources, validation methods, results, and limitations-should be made available to anyone. Technical documentation, written in sufficient detail to enable a reader with necessary expertise to evaluate the model and potentially reproduce it, should be made available openly or under agreements that protect intellectual property, at the discretion of the modelers. Validation involves face validity (wherein experts evaluate model structure, data sources, assumptions, and results), verification or internal validity (check accuracy of coding), cross validity (comparison of results with other models analyzing the same problem), external validity (comparing model results with real-world results), and predictive validity (comparing model results with prospectively observed events). The last two are the strongest form of validation.

It has been used in a wide range of health care applications. Most early applications involved analyses of systems with constrained resources, where the general aim was to improve the organization of delivered services. More recently, DES has increasingly been applied to evaluate specific technologies in the context of health technology assessment. The aim of this article was to provide consensus-based guidelines on the application of DES in a health care setting, covering the range of issues to which DES can be applied. The article works through the different stages of the modeling process: structural development, parameter estimation, model implementation, model analysis, and representation and reporting.

There are three categories of patients: with no supplemental insurance, who bought it, and who are entitled to it for free. Our identification procedure relies on the premise that the difference in the observed medical care consumption between the patients who bought the insurance and those entitled to free insurance is caused by pure selection effect, whereas the difference in healthcare consumption between the group that received the free insurance and the group that has no insurance is due to moral hazard. Results show favorable selection for patients in 20- to 30-year-old cohort and significant moral hazard for all age cohorts. The selection effect reverses its sign in older cohorts explained by the differences in risk aversion across cohorts caused by the timing of transition from socialism to market economy.

The methods are designed to evaluate (i) how well diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) capture variation in resource use relative to other patient characteristics and (ii) what influence the hospital has on their resource use. In a first step, we examine the influence of variables that describe each individual patient, including the DRG to which the patients are assigned and a range of personal and treatment-related characteristics. In a second step, we explore the influence that hospitals have on the average cost or length of stay of their patients, purged of the influence of the variables accounted for in the first stage. We provide a rationale for the variables used in both stages of the analysis and detail how each is defined. The analytical strategy allows us (i) to identify those factors that explain variation in resource use across patients, (ii) to assess the explanatory power of DRGs relative to other patient and treatment characteristics and (iii) to assess relative hospital performance in managing resources and the characteristics of hospitals that explain this performance.

When both firms want to be the first investor a coordination problem arises. Here, a method is proposed to deal with this coordination problem, involving the use of symmetric mixed strategies. The method is based on Fudenberg and Tirole [Fudenberg, D., Tirole, J., 1985. Preemption and rent equalization in the adoption of new technology. Review of Economic Studies 52, 383-401], where it was designed within a deterministic framework. This paper extends the applicability of this method to a stochastic environment. The need for this is exemplified by the fact that ever more contributions in multiple firm real option models make unsatisfactory assumptions to solve the coordination problem mentioned above. Moreover, our approach allows us to show that in many cases it is incorrect to claim that, in equilibrium, the probability that both firms invest simultaneously while it is only optimal for one firm to invest, is zero.

Within a quite general framework we analyze four classes of tests based on least squares estimation, one of which is robust to both weak serial correlation and nonstationary volatility. The existing multivariate trend tests, which either use non-robust standard errors or rely on non-standard distribution theory, are generally non-pivotal involving the unknown time-varying volatility function in the limit. Two-step residual-based i.i.d. bootstrap and wild bootstrap procedures are proposed for the robust tests and are shown to be asymptotically valid. Simulations demonstrate the effects of nonstationary volatility on the trend tests and the good behavior of the robust tests in finite samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Shitovitz and Spiegel (1998) present an example of 2-person economy with one private good and one pure public good, where the core efficient Lindahl allocation does not Pareto dominate the (inefficient) Nash allocation. In this paper we introduce the new concept of Trading equilibrium for a general public good economy with smooth preferences and a mixed measure space of consumers. We obtain that this economy admits a unique Trading equilibrium. Moreover, the Trading equilibrium induces a core allocation that strictly Pareto dominates the Nash allocation.

Estimation of both parametric and nonparametric functional coefficients are proposed. In particular, we propose a three stage semiparametric procedure. Both consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators are derived. We demonstrate that the parametric estimators are root-n consistent and the estimation of the functional coefficients is oracle. In addition, efficiency of parameter estimation is discussed and a simple efficient estimator is proposed. A simple and easily implemented test for the hypothesis of a varying-coefficient is proposed. A Monte Carlo experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators.

Prospective observational studies will undoubtedly be conducted with increased frequency to assess the comparative effectiveness of different treatments, including as a tool for coverage with evidence development, risk-sharing contracting, or key element in a learning health-care system. The principle alternatives for comparative effectiveness research include retrospective observational studies, prospective observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and naturalistic (pragmatic) randomized clinical trials. Methods: This report details the recommendations of a Good Research Practice Task Force on Prospective Observational Studies for comparative effectiveness research. Key issues discussed include how to decide when to do a prospective observational study in light of its advantages and disadvantages with respect to alternatives, and the report summarizes the challenges and approaches to the appropriate design, analysis, and execution of prospective observational studies to make them most valuable and relevant to health-care decision makers. Recommendations: The task force emphasizes the need for precision and clarity in specifying the key policy questions to be addressed and that studies should be designed with a goal of drawing causal inferences whenever possible. If a study is being performed to support a policy decision, then it should be designed as hypothesis testing-this requires drafting a protocol as if subjects were to be ran-domized and that investigators clearly state the purpose or main hypotheses, define the treatment groups and outcomes, identify all measured and unmeasured confounders, and specify the primary analyses and required sample size. Separate from analytic and statistical approaches, study design choices may strengthen the ability to address potential biases and confounding in prospective observational studies. The use of inception cohorts, new user designs, multiple comparator groups, matching designs, and assessment of outcomes thought not to be impacted by the therapies being compared are several strategies that should be given strong consideration recognizing that there may be feasibility constraints. The reasoning behind all study design and analytic choices should be transparent and explained in study protocol. Execution of prospective observational studies is as important as their design and analysis in ensuring that results are valuable and relevant, especially capturing the target population of interest, having reasonably complete and nondifferential follow-up. Similar to the concept of the importance of declaring a prespecified hypothesis, we believe that the credibility of many prospective observational studies would be enhanced by their registration on appropriate publicly accessible sites (e.g., clinicaltrials. gov and encepp.eu) in advance of their execution.","[Dreyer, Nancy] Outcome, Cambridge, MA USA; [Berger, Marc L.] OptumInsight, Life Sci, New York, NY 10026 USA; [Anderson, Fred] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Ctr Outcomes Res, Worcester, MA USA; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Sedrakyan, Art] Weill Cornell Med Coll, HSS & NYP, Comparat Effectiveness Program, New York, NY USA; [Normand, Sharon-Lise] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Optum; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Berger, ML (通讯作者)，OptumInsight, Life Sci, 301 W 118th St,Apartment PH 2-C, New York, NY 10026 USA.",Marc.Berger@Optum.com,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014","Normand, Sharon-Lise/0000-0001-7027-4769",ISPOR,ISPOR,This task force was supported by ISPOR.

We compared utilization, clinical outcomes, and costs between two types of radical prostatectomy (RP)-minimally invasive prostatectomy (MIRP) and retropubic prostatectomy (RRP)-among young patients. Methods: We extracted from LifeLink Health Plan Claims Database, a commercial claims database, information on 10,669 patients receiving either MIRP or RRP between 2003 and 2007. In unadjusted analyses, we used chi-square tests to compare clinical outcomes and nonparametric boot-strapping method to compare costs between the MIRP and RRP groups. We applied logistic, Cox proportional hazard, and extended estimation equation methods to examine the association between surgical modality and perioperative complications, anastomotic stricture, and costs while controlling for age, comorbidity, and health plan characteristics. Results: The percentage of prostatectomies performed as MIRP increased from 5.7% in 2003 to 50.3% in 2007. Patients with more comorbidity were more likely to undergo RRP than MIRP. Compared with the RRP group, the MIRP group had a significantly lower rate of perioperative complications (23.0% vs. 30.4%; P < 0.001) and a lesser tendency for anastomotic strictures (hazard ratio 0.42; 95% CI 0.35-0.50) within the first postoperative year but had higher hospitalization costs ($19,998 vs. $18,424; P < 0.001) despite shorter hospitalizations (1.7 days vs. 3.1 days; P < 0.001). Similar findings were reported in the subgroup analysis of patients with comorbidity score 0. Conclusion: MIRP among nonelderly patients increased substantially over time. MIRP was found to have fewer complications.

This paper updates a review of published papers between 1990 and 2000 for the years 2001-2008. Based on this previous review, and a number of other key review papers, focus is given to three issues: experimental design; estimation procedures; and validity of responses. Consideration is also given to how DCEs are applied and reported. We identified 114 DCEs, covering a wide range of policy questions. Applications took place in a broader range of health-care systems, and there has been a move to incorporating fewer attributes, more choices and interview-based surveys. There has also been a shift towards statistically more efficient designs and flexible econometric models. The reporting of monetary values continues to be popular, the use of utility scores has not gained popularity, and there has been an increasing use of odds ratios and probabilities. The latter are likely to be useful at the policy level to investigate take-up and acceptability of new interventions. Incorporation of interactions terms in the design and analysis of DCEs, explanations of risk, tests of external validity and incorporation of DCE results into a decision-making framework remain important areas for future research.

The DCE was tested in a survey alongside the TTO in a sample of English-speaking Canadians recruited by a market research company. The study found that the DCE is able to derive logical and consistent values for health states valued on the full health - dead scale. The DCE overcame some issues identified in the version of TTO currently used to value EQ-5D, notably allowing for fewer data exclusions and incorporating values considered worse than dead without introducing a separate valuation procedure. This has important implications for providing robust values that represent the preferences of all respondents. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The key challenge in making this evaluation is that police officers have more information than the econometrician and thus racial disparities in police behavior may result from these unobservable factors rather than discrimination. We develop a general equilibrium model of police and potential criminal behavior that encompasses key models in the literature. We highlight the assumptions heeded for existing methods of detecting racial discrimination to hold. In particular, we show that when there are increasing costs to search, existing tests for discrimination can give incorrect results. Given the potential importance of these costs, we then propose some alternate methods for detecting racial bias in police behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The models compared olanzapine with ziprasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States. Methods: A decision analytic modeling approach was used to estimate annual health-care costs and health outcomes, incorporating events such as response, relapse, and suicide. Patients without response to first-line treatment switched to the other comparator. Decision tree probabilities were extracted from head-to-head studies and other published clinical literature. Direct health-care costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated on the basis of resource use and utility weights for initial and relapse episodes, maintenance therapy, and extended episodes of illness. Disutilities associated with treatment-emergent adverse events were included. Results: Consistent with the 2001 model, this model found that first-line treatment with olanzapine is associated with fewer hospital days, fewer days with extrapyramidal symptoms, and higher QALYs than is first-line treatment with ziprasidone. Total costs were lower for the olanzapine pathway ($70,232-$72,776 vs. $73,086-$73,310 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale analysis) due to the cost savings associated with reduced health-care resource use. The incremental cost per QALY gained indicated that the olanzapine pathway dominated the ziprasidone pathway. Conclusions: Decision analytic models should be continuously assessed against new data. This case study shows that incorporating new data confirmed results of a previously published model in which olanzapine was associated with better expected health outcomes and lower total health-care costs than was ziprasidone.","[Lawson, Anthony H.] Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46040 USA; [Graham, Christopher N.; Mauskopf, Josephine A.] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Bruhn, David] GlaxoSmithKline, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA",Eli Lilly; Research Triangle Institute; GlaxoSmithKline,"Lawson, AH (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46040 USA.",lawsonan@lilly.com,,"Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548; Graham, Christopher/0000-0001-8165-7095",Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),Eli Lilly and Company.,,39,7,8,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,,,,55,64,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.08.1741,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GU,22264972.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299318500007,0

The best response function gives the utility maximizing response to a decision of the other players. This is analogous to the response function in the treatment-response literature, taking the decision of the other players as the treatment, except that the best response function has additional structure implied by the associated utility maximization problem. Further, the relationship between the data and the best response function is not the same as the relationship between the data and the response function in the treatment-response literature. We focus especially on the case of a complete information entry game with two firms. We also discuss the case of an entry game with many firms, non-entry games, and incomplete information. Our analysis of the entry game is based on the observation of realized entry decisions, which we then link to the best response functions under various assumptions including those concerning the level of rationality of the firms, including the assumption of Nash equilibrium play, the symmetry of the payoffs between firms, and whether mixed strategies are admitted.

First, the benchmark models are estimated using panel methods with both fund and time effects. Second, the non-normality of individual mutual fund returns is accounted for by using panel bootstrap methods. We also augment the standard benchmark factors with fund-specific characteristics, such as fund size. Using a dataset of UK equity mutual fund returns, we find that fund size has a negative effect on the average fund manager's benchmark-adjusted performance. Further, when we allow for time effects and the non-normality of fund returns, we find that there is no evidence that even the best performing fund managers can significantly out-perform the augmented benchmarks after fund management charges are taken into account.

We exploit a large-sample patient data set in Australia and its linkage to administrative databases. The sample contains over 260 000 patients and over 12 600 GPs, observed between 2005 and 2010. Controlling for GP fixed effects and patient health, we find no strong evidence that quality differs by patient age, gender, country of origin, health concession card status and income, but quality is increased by stronger patient-doctor relationship. Using a competition measure that is defined at the individual GP level and not restricted to a local market, we find that competition lowers quality. Price is increasing in patient income, whereas competition has a small impact on price.

It is not preference-based, and there are currently no established algorithms for mapping between the RMQ and preference-based health-related quality-of-life measures. Using data from randomized controlled trials of treatment for LBP, we sought to develop algorithms for mapping between RMQ scores and health utilities derived using either the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-SD) or the six-dimensional health state short form (derived from Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) (SF-6D). Methods: This study is based on data from the Back Skills Training Trial in which data were collected from 701 patients at baseline and subsequently at 3, 6, and 12 months postrandomization using a range of outcome measures, including the RMQ the EQ-5D, and the Short Form 12 item Health Survey (SF-12) (from which SF-6D utilities can be derived). We used baseline trial data to estimate models using both direct and response mapping approaches to predict EQ-5D and SF-6D health utilities and dimension responses. A multistage model selection process was used to assess the predictive accuracy of the models. We then explored different techniques and mapping models that made use of repeated follow-up observations in the data The estimated mapping algorithms were validated using external data from the UK Back Pain Exercise and Manipulation trial. Results: A number of models were developed that accurately predict health utilities in this context. The best performing model for RMQ to EQ-SD mapping was a beta regression with Bayesian quasi-likelihood estimation that included 24 dummy variables for RMQ responses, age, and sex as covariates (mean squared error 0.0380) based on repeated data The model selected for RMQ to SF-6D mapping was a finite mixture model that included the overall RMQ score, age, sex, RMQ score squared, age squared, and an interaction term for age and RMQ score as covariates (mean squared error 0.0114) based on repeated data. Conclusions: It is possible to reasonably predict EQ-5D and SF-6D health utilities from RMQ scores and responses using regression methods. Our regression equations provide an empirical basis for estimating health utilities when EQ-5D or SF-6D data are not available. They can be used to inform future economic evaluations of interventions targeting LBP.","[Khan, Kamran A.; Madan, Jason; Petrou, Stavros; Lamb, Sarah E.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Hlth Sci, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Lamb, Sarah E.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Med Sci Div, Oxford, England",University of Warwick; University of Oxford,"Khan, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Hlth Sci, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",k.a.khan@warwick.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Khan, Kamran/JFJ-9362-2023","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Khan, Kamran/0000-0002-4322-9695; Madan, Jason/0000-0003-4316-1480; Lamb, Sarah/0000-0003-4349-7195",Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform; Advantage West Midlands (AWM); Wolfson Foundation; NIHR HTA programme; BEAM study by the Medical Research Council; National Institute for Health Research [01/75/01] Funding Source: researchfish,Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform; Advantage West Midlands (AWM); Wolfson Foundation; NIHR HTA programme; BEAM study by the Medical Research Council; National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project benefited from facilities funded through Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform, with support from Advantage West Midlands (AWM) and the Wolfson Foundation.

Most applications of VBID, however, have not used higher cost sharing to discourage specific services. In April 2011, the state of Oregon introduced a policy for public employees that required additional cost sharing for high-cost procedures such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Objectives: Our objectives were to estimate the societal impact of higher co-pays for TKA using Oregon as a case study and building on recent work demonstrating the effects of knee osteoarthritis and surgical treatment on employment and disability outcomes. Methods: We used a Markov model to estimate the societal impact in terms of quality of life, direct costs, and indirect costs of higher co-pays for TKA using Oregon as a case study. Results: We found that TKA for a working population can generate societal benefits that offset the direct medical costs of the procedure. Delay in receiving surgical care, because of higher co-payment or other reasons, reduced the societal savings from TKA. Conclusions: We conclude that payers moving toward value based cost sharing should consider consequences beyond direct medical expenses.","[Koenig, Lane; Saauoss, Josh] KNG Hlth Consulting LLC, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Dall, Timothy M.] IHS Global Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Ruiz, David, Jr.] Econometrica Inc, Bethesda, MD USA; [Tongue, John] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Tualatin, OR USA",,"Koenig, L (通讯作者)，KNG Hlth Consulting LLC, 15245 Res Blvd,Suite 305, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.",Lane.Koenig@knghealth.com,,,American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,This study was supported by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.,,24,3,4,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2014,17,6.0,,,,,749,751,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.07.006,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AP8XS,25237000.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342363300012,0

Using within-country variation in regional HIV prevalence and a synthetic panel, I find that HIV significantly increases the capital labor ratio in urban manufacturing firms. The impact of HIV on average wages is positive but imprecisely estimated. In contrast, HIV has a large positive impact on the skill premium. The impact of HIV on the wages of low skilled workers is insignificantly different from 0, and is strongly dampened by competition from rural migrants. The HIV epidemic disproportionately increases the incomes of high-skilled survivors, thus increasing inequality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Data came from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study conducted biannually. The analysis sample consisted of individuals aged 51 to 63 years at baseline with arthritis who were resurveyed at 2-year intervals from 1996 to 2010. Propensity score matching was used to compare outcomes of persons receiving total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with those of matched controls. Six measures of physical functioning were examined: lower body mobility problems, instrumental activities of daily living limitations, activities of daily living limitations, and large muscle, fine motor, and gross motor limitations. Self-rated health and pain were also examined. The two employment related outcomes were earnings and employment status. Results: Receipt of TKA was associated with better outcomes for several measures of physical functioning, especially mobility limitations, pain, and self-rated health. Receipt of IRA was not associated with increased earnings or employment. Conclusions: Receipt of TKA yields important improvements in physical function among persons with an arthritis diagnosis who received the procedure before reaching the age of 65 years. This study contributes to knowledge about the benefits of TKA in a community setting among nonelderly recipients of TKA.","[George, Linda K.] Duke Univ, Dept Sociol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [George, Linda K.; Hu, Linyan; Sloan, Frank A.] Duke Univ, Ctr Study Aging, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Sloan, Frank A.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University; Duke University; Duke University,"Sloan, FA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",fsloan@duke.edu,,,Institute for Health Technology Studies (In Health),Institute for Health Technology Studies (In Health),"This study was supported in part by the Institute for Health Technology Studies (In Health).

It is a unique combination of measurement attributes designed to minimise cognitive complexity and provide an additional option for measuring social value'. Similar to the person trade-off (PTO), it adopts a social perspective and asks respondents to evaluate programmes on behalf of society. Unlike the PTO, trade-offs between the options use dollars, not numbers of patients. Respondents are not, however, asked for their personal willingness to pay. Rather, the opportunity cost of funds spent on one service is as an offsetting reduction in funds for a second service. The amount spent on each service therefore indicates relative, not absolute, value. However, the two services combine to produce one Quality adjusted life year which allows the calculation of a Quality adjusted life year-like unit of social value on a 0-1 scale. A three-stage survey was used to test the instrument's reliability, validity and sensitivity to the framing of the main question. Results indicate that the Relative Social Willingness to Pay produces values similar to but less than the PTO and time trade-off techniques.

The objective of this article was to identify a set of utility values consistent with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) reference case and to critically discuss and illustrate challenges in creating such a utility set Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies reporting utility values for relevant complications. The methodology of each study was assessed for consistency with the NICE reference case. A suggested set of utility values applicable to modeling was derived, giving preference to studies reporting multiple complications and correcting for comorbidity. Results: The review considered 21 relevant diabetes complications. A total of 16,574 articles were identified; after screening, 61 articles were assessed for methodological quality. Nineteen articles met NICE criteria, reporting utility values for 20 of 21 relevant complications. For renal transplant, because no articles meeting NICE criteria were identified, two articles using other methodologies were included. Index value estimates for T2DM without complication ranged from 0.711 to 0.940. Utility decrement associated with complications ranged from 0.014 (minor hypoglycemia) to 0.28 (amputation). Limitations associated with the selection of a utility value for use in economic modeling included variability in patient recruitment, heterogeneity in statistical analysis, large variability around some point estimates, and lack of recent data Conclusions: A reference set of utility values for T2DM and its complications in line with NICE requirements was identified. This research illustrates the challenges associated with systematically selecting utility data for economic evaluations.","[Beaudet, Amelie; Clegg, John; Thuresson, Per-Olof] IMS Hlth, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; [Lloyd, Adam] IMS Hlth, London, England; [McEwan, Phil] Swansea Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Beaudet, A (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth, Theaterstr 4, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",abeaudet@ch.imshealth.com,"Thuresson, Per-Olof/GYU-1401-2022","Beaudet, Amelie/0000-0003-0535-672X",IMS Health; Eli Lilly,IMS Health; Eli Lilly(Eli Lilly),This literature review was initiated and supported by IMS Health and Eli Lilly.,,43,155,165,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,462,470,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.03.003,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24969008.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900021,0

In this paper, we consider an insurer contracting with a consumer and a provider. We focus on the trade-off between ex ante moral hazard and insurance, and consider both consumer and provider incentives in the insurer's contracting problem in the presence of unobservable preventive efforts. We study two cases of provider efforts: those that complement consumer efforts and those that substitute for consumer efforts. In the first case, our results show that the provider must have greater incentives when the consumer is healthy to induce effort and that inducing provider effort allows an insurer to offer a more complete insurance contract relative to the bilateral benchmark. In the second case, we state conditions under which these conclusions continue to hold. On the basis of our findings, we discuss the implications and challenges of multilateral contracting in practice.

Special attention was given to country specific results. Methods: Data from the EURopean Action on Secondary and Primary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events III (EUROASPIRE III) survey were used. Patients hospitalized for a coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, acute myocardial infarction, or myocardial ischemia were interviewed and examined at least 6 months after their acute event. Health related quality of life was assessed by using the EQ-5D and the SF-12. SF-12 outcomes were converted to SF-6D utility values, allowing comparison between both measures. Results: Both EQ-5D and SF-6D results were available for 7472 patients with coronary heart disease from 20 European countries. The measures were significantly correlated (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.536); however, large differences between the two measures remain. A total of 28.8% of the patients reported a ceiling effect on the EQ-5D instrument, whereas only 4.2% of the patients reported full health based on the SF-6D. Especially the mental component does not seem to be completely captured by the EQ-5D instrument Furthermore, patients with worse EQ-5D outcomes were more likely to have better SF CD results, whereas patients with better EQ-5D outcomes were more likely to have worse SF-6D results. Conclusions: Both measures are not interchangeable. Whereas the main disadvantage of the EQ-5D questionnaire is its ceiling effect, the potential advantages of SF-12 might disappear when converting the outcomes into an SF-6D utility, because of the small differences between patients.","[De Smedt, Delphine; Clays, Els; Annemans, Lieven; De Bacquer, Dirk] Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Annemans, Lieven] Vrije Univ Brussel, Fac Med & Pharm, Brussels, Belgium; [Annemans, Lieven] I CHER Interuniv Ctr Hlth Econ, Ghent, Belgium; [Annemans, Lieven] I CHER Interuniv Ctr Hlth Econ, Brussels, Belgium",Ghent University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"De Smedt, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, De Pintelaan 185,Blok A-2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",delphine.desmedt@ugent.be,"De Bacquer, Dirk/HGU-3191-2022","De Bacquer, Dirk/0000-0002-3202-7238; Clays, Els/0000-0002-1092-945X",AstraZeneca; Bristol-Myers Squibb; GlaxoSmithKline; Pfizer; Sanofi-Aventis; Servier; Merck/Schering-Plough; Novartis,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Pfizer(Pfizer); Sanofi-Aventis(Sanofi-Aventis); Servier(Servier); Merck/Schering-Plough(Merck & CompanySchering Plough Corporation); Novartis(Novartis),"The EUROASPIRE survey was supported with the aid of unrestricted educational grants, which were given to the European Society of Cardiology by the following companies: Main Sponsors: AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, Servier; Sponsors: Merck/Schering-Plough, Novartis.

In particular, this paper allows for discrete measurement of the durations as happens often in practice. The integrated baseline hazard and all parameters are estimated at the regular rate, root N, where N is the number of individuals. A hazard model is a natural framework for time-varying regressors. In particular, if a flow or a transition probability depends on a regressor that changes with time, a hazard model avoids the curse of dimensionality that would arise from interacting the regressors at each point in time with one another. This paper also presents a new test to detect unobserved heterogeneity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Fifty patients with advanced primary brain tumors and 10 physician experts were recruited from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network institutions and community support agencies. By using a 40-item symptom checklist, patients first selected up to 10 of the most important symptoms/concerns to monitor when assessing the value of drug treatment for brain tumors, then nominated up to 5 of the very most important concerns, and finally generated additional symptoms/concerns. By using the same checklist as patients, physicians rated each symptom/concern as disease- or treatment related. Results: By using the combined input, a 24-item National Comprehensive Cancer Network/Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain Symptom Index (NFBrSI-24) was developed. The NFBrSI-24 showed good internal consistency (alpha = 0.84), significantly differentiated patients with different levels of functional status (F-2,F-47 = 8.21; P < .001), and demonstrated good convergent validity with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General functional, physical, social, emotional, and brain tumor-specific concerns (rho = 0.59, 0.57, 0.40, 0.35, and 0.50, respectively; Ps < 0.05). Conclusions: The NFBrSI-24, an index of the symptoms in advanced brain tumors perceived as most important by both patients and clinicians, improves upon existing measures of brain tumor symptoms through better satisfaction of regulatory requirements for measure development. The findings suggest good reliability and validity, indicating that the NFBrSI-24 is a promising brief assessment of high-priority advanced brain tumor symptoms for research and clinical settings.","[Lai, Jin-Shei; Jensen, Sally E.; Beaumont, Jennifer L.; Raizer, Jeffrey J.; Cella, David] Northwestern Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med Social Sci, Chicago, IL USA; [Abernethy, Amy P.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Med Oncol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Jacobsen, Paul B.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Hlth Outcomes & Behav, Tampa, FL USA; [Syrjala, Karen] Univ Washington, Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Sch Med, Div Clin Res, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Syrjala, Karen] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Duke University; H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Lai, JS (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med Social Sci, 633 N St Clair St,19th Floor, Chicago, IL 60061 USA.",js-lai@northwestern.edu,"Beaumont, Jennifer/AAA-2825-2020","Beaumont, Jennifer/0000-0002-1484-260X; Jacobsen, Paul/0000-0002-4427-8800","Amgen; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals; Bayer; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Centocor; Cell Therapeutics, Inc.; Genentech; Eli Lilly and Company; Merck Company; Novartis; Ortho Biotech; Pfizer; Sanofi-Aventis; Takeda Pharmaceuticals","Amgen(Amgen); AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals(AstraZeneca); Bayer(Bayer AG); Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Centocor; Cell Therapeutics, Inc.; Genentech(Roche HoldingGenentech); Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly); Merck Company(Merck & Company); Novartis(Novartis); Ortho Biotech; Pfizer(Pfizer); Sanofi-Aventis(Sanofi-Aventis); Takeda Pharmaceuticals(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd)","This project was supported by Amgen, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Centocor, Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Genentech, Eli Lilly and Company, Merck & Company, Novartis, Ortho Biotech, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, and Takeda Pharmaceuticals.",,38,18,19,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN,2014,17,1.0,,,,,62,69,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.11.006,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,291RS,24438718.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329847500009,0

TPMT testing could lead to improved prescribing of azathioprine resulting in a reduction in adverse drug reactions as well as an improvement in effectiveness. When allocating scarce resources robust evidence on cost-effectiveness is required. Objective: this study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a TPMT genotyping test to inform azathioprine prescribing in autoimmune diseases. The secondary aim of this study was to demonstrate the complexity of undertaking a trial-based evaluation of a pharmacogenetic test Methods: A prospective economic evaluation was conducted alongside the TARGET (TPMT: Azathioprine Response to Genotype and Enzyme Testing) study, a pragmatic controlled trial that randomized (1:1) patients to undergo TPMT genotyping before azathioprine (n = 167) or current practice (n = 166). Assuming the UK health service perspective and a time horizon of 4 months, resource-use and health status data were collected prospectively for all recruited patients. Results: The mean incremental cost for TPMT genotyping and subsequent care pathways compared with current practice for the 4-month follow-up was 421.06 pound (95% confidence interval 925.15 pound to 89.75) pound. Mean incremental quality adjusted life years were close to zero but negative: 0.008 (95% confidence interval 0.017 to 0.0002). Assuming a threshold of 20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the expected incremental net benefit of introducing the test is 256.89 pound (95% CI -425.94 pound to 932.86) pound. Conclusions: TPMT genotyping potentially offers a less expensive alternative than current practice, but it may also have a small but negative effect on health status. These findings are associated with significant uncertainty, and the causal effect of TPMT genotyping on changes in health status and health care resource use remains uncertain. The results from this study therefore pose a difficult challenge to decision makers.","[Thompson, Alexander J.; Roberts, Stephen A.; Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Newman, William G.; Tricker, Karen] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Genom Med, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Newman, William G.; Tricker, Karen] Cent Manchester Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Elliott, Rachel A.] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester; University of Manchester; University of Nottingham,"Payne, K (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, 4th Floor Jean Mcfarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",katherine.payne@manchester.ac.uk,"Payne, Katherine/AAJ-3728-2020; Elliott, Rachel/P-5894-2018","Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350; Elliott, Rachel/0000-0002-3650-0168; Newman, William/0000-0002-6382-4678; Thompson, Alexander/0000-0003-4930-5107",Department of Health UK [PHGX09A]; National Institute of Health Research (NIHR); NIHR School for Primary Care Research; Research Councils UK,Department of Health UK(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR School for Primary Care Research; Research Councils UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"The TARGET study was funded by the Department of Health UK (reference no.

This renders many plausible network structures inefficient. We show that requiring robustness with respect to stochastic information transmission failures rehabilitates incomplete, redundant network structures. Specifically, we show that star and complete networks are not generally robust to transmission failures, that circular and quasi-circular networks are efficient at intermediate costs in four-player networks, and that if either of them is efficient, then at least one of them is pairwise stable even without reallocation. Thus, incomplete, redundant networks are efficient and stable at intermediate costs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is assumed that the subjective discount factor of a household is an increasing function of its relative income. First, we describe the structure of balanced-growth equilibrium paths, on which the population splits into two groups: the rich and the poor. Secondly, we study sliding equilibrium paths, show that they become balanced from some time onwards and that eventually all the capital is owned by those households that were the richest at the initial state. It follows that the long-run rate of growth depends on the initial distribution of wealth and income. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The parametric regressors may be endogenous while the nonparametric regressors are assumed to be strictly exogenous. The parametric regressors may be stationary or nonstationary and the nonparametric regressors are nonstationary integrated time series. Semiparametric least squares (SLS) estimation is considered and its asymptotic properties are derived. Due to endogeneity in the parametric regressors, SLS is not consistent for the parametric component and a semiparametric instrumental variable (SIV) method is proposed instead. Under certain regularity conditions, the SIV estimator of the parametric component is shown to have a limiting normal distribution. The rate of convergence in the parametric component depends on the properties of the regressors. The conventional rate may apply even when nonstationarity is involved in both sets of regressors.

In addition to income, the analysis considers the sociodemographic population structure, motorization levels, road and health infrastructure and road rule enforcement as potential factors. An original panel data set covering 25 Indian states is analyzed using multivariate regression analysis. Time and state fixed-effects account for unobserved heterogeneity across states and time. The rising motorization, urbanization and accompanying increase in the share of vulnerable road users, that is, pedestrians and two-wheelers, are the major drivers of road traffic crash fatalities in India. Among vulnerable road users, women form a particularly high-risk group. Higher expenditure per police officer is associated with a lower fatality rate. The results suggest that India should focus, in particular, on road infrastructure investments that allow the separation of vulnerable from other road users on improved road rule enforcement and should pay special attention to vulnerable female road users.

In addition to the efficacy, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and tolerability need to be assessed to define treatment benefit, as PROs measure the patient's subjective experience and can be correlated with hard outcomes. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the survival benefit of new therapies and secondary efficacy-related outcomes. Assessment of the number of studies reporting PROs and tolerability was also conducted. Methods: A predefined search strategy was conducted on major academic/governmental databases and conference proceedings (2007-2011). Exclusion criteria were applied. Results: Of 77 studies identified, 26 (34%) evaluated survival as an end point; 14 (18%) assessed PROs/tolerability. In chemotherapy-naive patients (no/minimal symptoms), median overall survival (OS) was 26 months for sipuleucel-T. In relapsed patients, the survival benefit of cabazitaxel/abiraterone was 15 months and that of enzalutamide was 18 months. Denosumab prolonged time to first on-study skeletal-related event (20.7 months denosumab, 17.1 months zoledronic acid; P = 0.0002, noninferiority; P = 0.008, superiority). Similar benefit was documented with radium-223, a new bone-targeted alpha-particle-emitting radiopharrnaceutical. Radium-223 also significantly improved the OS (two-sided P = 0.00185). Specific to PROs, they were incorporated primarily as secondary end points, and improvements in pain response (most commonly evaluated) were variable among the agents. Last, the therapies were associated with unique toxicities requiring careful consideration. Conclusions: The results of this review demonstrate that the therapeutic landscape of MPC has changed dramatically and many therapies in MPC now show OS improvements of about 4 months in the postdocetaxel setting.","[Seal, Brian S.] Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceut Inc, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA; [Asche, Carl V.] Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Peoria, IL 61656 USA; [Puto, Katarzyna; Allen, Pamela D.] Xcenda, AmerisourceBergen Consulting Serv, Palm Harbor, FL USA","Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Peoria; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC","Seal, BS (通讯作者)，Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceut Inc, 6 West Belt, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA.",brian.seal@bayer.com,,"Asche, Carl V/0000-0002-3193-6800",Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals,Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals(Bayer AGBayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals),Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals provided funding for this study.,,78,14,15,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2013,16,5.0,,,,,872,890,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.03.1628,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CL,23947983.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325466600023,0

In routine clinical practice, however, it is commonplace for multiple tests to be used before making definitive diagnoses. This article describes a meta-analytic modeling framework developed to estimate the accuracy of the combination of two diagnostic tests, accounting for the likely nonindependence of the tests. Methods: A novel multicomponent framework was developed to synthesize information available on different parameters in the model. This allows data to be included from studies evaluating single tests or both tests. Different likelihoods were specified for the different sources of data and linked by means of common parameters. The framework was applied to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Ddimer test and the Wells score for deep vein thrombosis, and the results were compared with those of a model in which independence of tests was assumed. All models were evaluated by using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation methods. Results: The results showed the importance of allowing for the (likely) nonindependence of tests in the meta-analysis model when evaluating a combination of diagnostic tests. The analysis also highlighted the relatively limited impact of those studies that evaluated only one of the two tests of interest. Conclusions: The models developed allowed the assumption of independence between diagnostic tests to be relaxed while combining a broad array of relevant information from disparate studies. The framework also raises questions regarding the utility of studies limited to the evaluation of single diagnostic tests.","[Novielli, Nicola; Sutton, Alexander J.; Cooper, Nicola J.] Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Sutton, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",njc21@le.ac.uk,"Montero-de-Paz, Javier/H-2480-2012; de Dios, Cristina/I-5025-2013; Räisänen, Antti/G-2405-2013","Sutton, Alexander/0000-0002-8934-9940; Novielli, Nicola/0000-0001-9314-7092",,,,,43,13,17,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,619,628,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.02.007,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796297.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900022,0

First, based on a survey of secondary school students in Spain in which peers are formed by nominated classmate friends, we find a more powerful positive and significant causal effect of friends' mean BMI on adolescent BMI than previous US-based research. These results are in line with international data, which show that peer group contact tends to vary across countries. Our findings cover a large set of controls, fixed effects, the testing of correlated unobservables, contextual influences and instrumental variables. Second, social interactions are identified through the property of intransitivity in network relationships. Finally, we report evidence of a strong, positive effect of peer pressure on several subgroups of adolescents in an attempt to study their vulnerability to social influences.

This article reports on a discrete choice experiment designed to elicit population preferences regarding the allocation of health gain between hypothetical groups of potential patients. A random-effects probit model is estimated, and a technique for converting these results into equity weights for use in economic evaluation is adopted. On average, the modelling predicts a relatively high social value on health gains accruing to nonsmokers, carers, those with a low income and those with an expected age of death less than 45years. Respondents tend to favour individuals with similar characteristics to themselves. These results challenge the conventional practice of assuming constant equity weighting. For decision makers, whether a formal equity weighting system represents an improvement on more informal approaches to weighing up equity and efficiency concerns remains uncertain.

In particular, we focus on a new condition: update monotonicity for preference rules. Although many so-called impossibility theorems for the choice rules are based on - or related to - monotonicity conditions, this appealing condition is satisfied by several non-trivial preference rules. In fact, in the case of pairwise, Pareto optimal, neutral, and consistent rules, the Kemeny-Young rule is singled out by this condition. In the case of convex valued, Pareto optimal, neutral and replication invariant rules, strong update monotonicity implies that the rule equals the union of preferences which extend all preference pairs unanimously agreed upon by k agents, where k is related to the number of alternatives and agents. In both cases, it therewith provides a characterization of these rules. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In a recent comparison of costs of care between two treatments for type 2 diabetes using a health care claims database, propensity score matching was implemented to adjust for selection bias though it was noted that information on baseline glycemic control was not available for the propensity model. Using data from a linked laboratory file, data on this potential unmeasured confounder were obtained for a small subset of the original sample. By using this information, we demonstrate how Bayesian modeling, propensity score calibration, and multiple imputation can utilize this additional information to perform sensitivity analyses to quantitatively assess the potential impact of unmeasured confounding. Bayesian regression models were developed to utilize the internal validation data as informative prior distributions for all parameters, retaining information on the correlation between the confounder and other covariates. While assumptions supporting the use of propensity score calibration were not met in this sample, the use of Bayesian modeling and multiple imputation provided consistent results, suggesting that the lack of data on the unmeasured confounder did not have a song impact on the original analysis, due to the lack of strong correlation between the confounder and the cost outcome variable. Bayesian modeling with informative priors and multiple imputation may be useful tools for unmeasured confounding sensitivity analysis in these situations. Further research to understand the operating characteristics of these methods in a variety of situations, however, remains.","[Faries, Douglas; Peng, Xiaomei; Pawaskar, Manjiri; Price, Karen] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Stamey, James D.; Seaman, John W., Jr.] Baylor Univ, Dept Stat, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Eli Lilly; Baylor University,"Faries, D (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",d.faries@lilly.com,"Stamey, James/A-7204-2009","Stamey, James/0000-0002-3787-6490",Eli Lilly Company,Eli Lilly Company(Eli Lilly),This research was funded by Eli Lilly & Company.,,32,15,19,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2013,16,2.0,,,,,259,266,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.10.012,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,144AC,23538177.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318910400005,0

The productivity of pharmaceutical innovation has declined in recent years. At the same time, the cohort of large companies who are the leading engines of pharmaceutical R&D has become increasingly concentrated. The concurrent presence of these trends is not sufficient to determine causation. In response to lagging innovation prospects, some companies have sought refuge in mergers and acquisitions to disguise their dwindling prospects or gain R&D synergies. On the other hand, the increased concentration brought on by recent mergers may have contributed to the declining rate of innovation. In this paper, we consider the second of these causal relationships: the likely impact of the recent merger wave among the largest pharmaceutical companies on the rate of innovation. In other words, have recent mergers, which may have been taken in response to lagging innovation, represented a self-defeating strategy that only made industry outcomes worse? (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Self-assessed health status is a leading example. A crucial assumption of the vignette methodology is vignette equivalence: The health status of the person described in the vignette must be perceived by all respondents in the same way. We use data from a survey experiment conducted with a sample of almost 5000 older Americans to validate this assumption. We find weak evidence that respondents' vignette ratings may be sensitive to the sex and, for older respondents, also to the age (implied by the first name) of the person described in the vignette. Our findings suggest that vignette equivalence may not hold, at least if the potentially subtle connotations of vignette persons' names are not fully controlled.

In the proposed mapping, a factor analytic model defines a conversion factor between the scores as the ratio of factor loadings. Hence, the mapping applies to convert true underlying scales and has desirable properties facilitating the alignment of instruments and understanding their relationship in a coherent manner. It is important to note, however, that when DSM means or differences in mean DSMs are estimated, their mapping is still of a measurement error-prone predictor, and the correct conversion coefficient is the true mapping multiplied by the reliability of the DSM in the relevant sample. In addition, the proposed strategy for estimating the factor analytic mapping in practice requires assumptions that may not hold. We discuss these assumptions and how they may be the reason we obtain disparate estimates of the mapping factor in an application of the proposed methods to groups of patients.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI 53726 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Palta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, 610 Walnut St, Madison, WI 53726 USA.",mpalta@wisc.edu,,,National Institute on Aging [P01-AG020679],National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),Grant P01-AG020679 from the National Institute on Aging.,,17,1,1,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2013,16,1.0,,,,,211,214,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.07.009,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,077WN,23337233.0,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314060200025,0
J,"Chen, YJ",,,,"Chen, Yijuan",,,Innovation frequency of durable complementary goods,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dynamic innovation; Durable goods; Complements,PATENTABILITY,"Focused on innovation frequency of durable complementary goods, this paper shows that interdependency of innovation decisions generically gives rise to coordination failure between the producers. More importantly, the coordination failure may arise in opposite directions: Not only may the producers delay introducing new products, they may also introduce new products faster than the social optimum. The possibility of hastened innovations is in contrast to the conclusion from the literature focused on the monopolistic setting. The results provide a caution for policy-makers, and on the other hand serve as benchmarks for future studies incorporating competition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: During a phase III, double-arm, randomized study, patients completed the short form 36 health survey (SF-36), a generic HRQoL questionnaire, at baseline and at weeks 24, 52, and 104. The objectively confirmed measure of hypoglycemia was based on a combination of plasma glucose measure and presence of hypoglycemia-related symptoms. The patient-reported frequency of hypoglycemia was defined as the following item: How often have you felt that your blood sugars have been unacceptably low recently? The association between hypoglycemia and HRQoL was evaluated in intent-to-treat patients (N = 3059) by using repeated-measurements analyses, with SF-36 scores used as explained variables and baseline SF-36 score, age, sex, country, time, and either number of objectively confirmed hypoglycemic events (0, >= 1) or patient-reported frequency of hypoglycemia (continuous variable 0-6) as explanatory variables. Results: During study duration, less than 6% of patients experienced at least one objectively confirmed hypoglycemic event and about half the patients reported unacceptably low blood sugars none of the time. The association between the number of objectively confirmed hypoglycemic events and HRQoL was not statistically significant, while the patient-reported frequency of hypoglycemia was statistically significantly related to all SF-36 scores (P < 0.001), except physical functioning; patients reporting greater perceived frequency of hypoglycemia had worse HRQoL. Conclusions: Using a patient-reported measure of hypoglycemia in the context of a clinical trial could enable the burden of hypoglycemia for patients to be demonstrated.","[Gilet, Helene; Viala-Danten, Muriel] Mapi Consultancy, Lyon, France; [Gruenberger, Jean-Bernard; Bader, Giovanni] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland",Novartis,"Gilet, H (通讯作者)，Mapi Consultancy, Lyon, France.",hgilet@mapigroup.com,"bader, giovanni/JOZ-5456-2023",,Novartis,Novartis(Novartis),Source of financial support: This work was funded by Novartis.,,41,11,11,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1036,1041,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.002,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244805.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300007,0

First, using US Census data for the year 1980, we study the impact of number of children on family arrangements, welfare participation and poverty status. Second, using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for the period 1982-2003, we study the impact on a series of health risk factors. The findings reveal, first, that an increase in family size increases the likelihood of marital breakdown. Second, we find evidence that mothers facing an increase in family size are not only more likely to live with other family members such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, they are also more likely to receive help from welfare programs. Third, consistent with an increase in welfare participation, families (mothers) are more likely to fall below the poverty line, and they face a reduction in total family income. The results using NHIS confirm a negative impact of fertility on marriage stability and an increase in welfare participation measured by the likelihood of using Medicaid and for some samples a reduction in the take-up of private health insurance. Finally, we find evidence that a shock in fertility increases the likelihood of mothers suffering from high blood pressure and becoming obese. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Maximum pseudo-likelihood analysis is then conducted on a large sample of the US industrial and financial firms spanning the period 1991-2011 on a monthly basis. Several commonly used factors and firm-specific attributes are shown to be useful for prediction at both short and long horizons. Our implementation also factors in momentum in some variables and documents their importance in default prediction. The model's prediction is very accurate for shorter horizons. Its accuracy deteriorates somewhat when the horizon is increased to two or three years, but the performance still remains reasonable. The forward intensity model is also amenable to aggregation, which allows for an analysis of default behavior at the portfolio and/or economy level. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, these analyses may be biased by cross-trial differences in patient populations, sensitivity to modeling assumptions, and differences in the definitions of outcome measures. The objective of this study was to demonstrate how incorporating individual patient data (IPD) from trials of one treatment into indirect comparisons can address several limitations that arise in analyses based only on aggregate data. Methods: Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) use IPD from trials of one treatment to match baseline summary statistics reported from trials of another treatment. After matching, by using an approach similar to propensity score weighting, treatment outcomes are compared across balanced trial populations. This method is illustrated by reviewing published MAICs in different therapeutic areas. A novel analysis in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder further demonstrates the applicability of the method. The strengths and limitations of MAICs are discussed in comparison to those of indirect comparisons that use only published aggregate data. Results: Example applications were selected to illustrate how indirect comparisons based only on aggregate data can be limited by cross-trial differences in patient populations, differences in the definitions of outcome measures, and sensitivity to modeling assumptions. The use of IPD and MAIC is shown to address these limitations in the selected examples by reducing or removing the observed cross-trial differences. An important assumption of MAIC, as in any comparison of nonrandomized treatment groups, is that there are no unobserved cross-trial differences that could confound the comparison of outcomes. Conclusions: Indirect treatment comparisons can be limited by cross-trial differences. By combining IPD with published aggregate data, MAIC can reduce observed cross-trial differences and provide decision makers with timely comparative evidence.","[Signorovitch, James E.; Xie, Jipan; Lu, Mei; Betts, Keith A.; Wu, Eric Q.] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Sikirica, Vanja; Erder, M.

Methods: A lifetime Markov model calibrated to the Taiwanese setting simulated the natural history of low-risk (engendering cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 1 and genital warts) and high-risk HPV (engendering CIN1, CIN2/3, and cervical cancer [CC]) infections, screening, and vaccination (100% coverage) for a cohort of 12-year-old girls (N - 153,000). Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from published data and expert opinion. Vaccine efficacy was obtained from each vaccine's respective clinical trials. Price-parity and lifelong protection was assumed for both vaccines. The number of CIN lesions, CC cases, CC deaths and genital wart (GW) cases, and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated. Costs and outcomes (discounted at 3% and 1.5%, respectively) were compared from a payer's perspective. Results: The model estimated that the BV led to an additional, undiscounted, 11,484 CIN1, 1,779 (+34.3% vs. QV) CIN2/3, 188 (+29.0% vs. QV) CC, and 69 (+29.0% vs. QV) CC deaths prevented compared with the QV, while the QV prevented 4,150 GW (+71%). This resulted in an additional 768 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and 11.6 million new Taiwan dollars costs saved for the BV versus the QV after discounting. Conclusion: Both vaccines have a different epidemiological impact with an increased number of CC-related lesions potentially prevented for the BV because of additional cross-protection. In the Taiwanese setting, HPV mass vaccination using the BV was estimated to dominate vaccination using the QV.","[Demarteau, Nadia; Van Kriekinge, Georges] GlaxoSmithKline Biol, B-1300 Wavre, Belgium; [Tang, Chao-Hsiun] Taipei Med Univ, Sch Hlth Care Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Hui-Chi; Chen, Chien-Jen] Acad Sinica, Genom Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Chen, Chien-Jen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Grad Inst Epidemiol, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",GlaxoSmithKline; Taipei Medical University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan University,"Demarteau, N (通讯作者)，GlaxoSmithKline Biol, Rue Fleming 20, B-1300 Wavre, Belgium.",nadia.x.demarteau@gskbio.com,"Chen, Chien-Jen/C-6976-2008; Chen, Chien-Jen/N-4723-2019",,GlaxoSmithKline; Merck Co.; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals,GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Merck Co.(Merck & Company); GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals(GlaxoSmithKline),"Chao-Hsiun Tang has received research grants and honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline and Merck & Co.

Rank values from previous valuation studies can be used as proxies for discrete choice exercises. This study examined rank and TTO data to determine whether the methods differ in sensitivity to the EQ-5D questionnaire dimensions. Methods: We used rank and TTO data for 42 EQ-5D questionnaire health states from the US and UK three-level EQ-5D questionnaire valuation studies, extracting overall ranks of mean TTO and mean rank values, ranging from 1 (best) to 42 (worst). We identified pairs of health states with reversed overall ranks between TTO and rank data and regressed overall rank differences (TTO - ranking) on dummy variables representing impairments on EQ-5D questionnaire dimensions. Results: Forty-three (US) and 41 (UK) health state pairs displayed reversed rank order. Both US and UK regression models on rank differences indicated that respondents rated impairments involving pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression as relatively worse in TTO than in the ranking task. Discussion: Different dimension sensitivity between TTO and ranking methods suggests that combining them could lead to inconsistent tariffs. Differences could be caused by respondents focusing on the first presented dimensions when ranking states or could be related to the longest endurable time for health states involving pain/discomfort or anxiety/depression. The observed differences call into question which method best represents the preferences of the population.","[Rand-Hendriksen, Kim; Augestad, Liv Ariane] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Rand-Hendriksen, Kim; Augestad, Liv Ariane] Akershus Univ Hosp, Hlth Serv Res Ctr, Lorenskog, Norway",University of Oslo; University of Oslo,"Rand-Hendriksen, K (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Pb 1089 Blindern, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",kim.rand-hendriksen@medisin.uio.no,,"Rand, Kim/0000-0001-7692-4099; Augestad, Liv Ariane/0000-0003-3330-5081",Norwegian Research Council; Southern Regional Health Care Authority; Eastern Regional Health Care Authority,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Southern Regional Health Care Authority; Eastern Regional Health Care Authority,The study was indirectly financed by the Norwegian Research Council and the Southern and Eastern Regional Health Care Authorities through PhD grants for the first two authors.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis by using the Mexican National Household Survey of Income and Expenditures for 2008. Households were grouped according to household medical insurance type (Social Security, Seguro Popular, mixed, or no affiliation). OOPE for medicines and health costs, and the probability of occurrence, were estimated with linear regression models; subsequently, the proportion of health expenditures from AE was calculated. The Heckman selection procedure was used to correct for self-selection of health expenditure; a propensity score matching procedure and an alternative procedure using instrumental variables were used to correct for heterogeneity between households with and without Seguro Popular. Results: OOPE in medicines account for 66% of the total health expenditures and 5% of the AE. Households with health insurance had a lower probability of OOPE for medicines than their comparison groups. There was heterogeneity in the health insurance effect on the proportion of OOPE for medicines out of the AE, with a reduction of 1.7% for households with Social Security, 1.4% for mixed affiliation, but no difference between Seguro Popular and matched households without insurance. Conclusion: Medicines were the most prevalent component of health expenditures in Mexico. We recommend improving access to health services and strengthening access to medicines to reduce high OOPE.","[Santa-Ana-Tellez, Yared; Servan-Mori, Edson] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Evaluat & Survey Res, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico; [Wirtz, Veronika J.; Avila-Burgos, Leticia] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Syst Res, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico",Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica; Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica,"Servan-Mori, E (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Evaluat & Survey Res, Ave Univ 655, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico.",eservan@insp.mx,"Avila-Burgos, Leticia/AAR-1815-2021; Wirtz, Veornika/AAG-9712-2019","Santa-Ana-Tellez, Yared/0000-0003-3086-446X; Wirtz, Veronika J./0000-0002-0863-8768; Servan-Mori, Edson/0000-0001-9820-8325",,,,,50,43,46,3,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15,5.0,,,,,593,603,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.01.006,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867767.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100001,0

The duration until retirement is modeled using single and competing risk specifications, observed and unobserved heterogeneity, and flexible baseline hazards. Wealth is used as a proxy for elapsed duration to mitigate the potential selection bias stemming from conditioning on initial participation. The competing risk specification distinguishes complete multiperiod routes to retirement, such as unemployment followed by early retirement. A result on comparison of coefficients across all states is offered. The empirical results indicate a strong impact of health changes on retirement and hence a large potential for public policy measures intended to retain older workers longer in the labor force. Disability responds more to health shocks than early retirement, especially to diseases of the circulatory, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems, as well as mental and behavioral disorders. Some unemployment spells followed by early retirement appear voluntary and spurred by life style diseases.
