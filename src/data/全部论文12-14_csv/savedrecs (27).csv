Theoretical arguments to replace the present system of royalties with one of the different forms of economic rent tax and to increase the average revenue collected are presented. Some of the practical challenges to achieve more efficient special taxation of mineral and energy resources are reviewed. In the Australian context, it is argued that the case for placing the windfall revenue gains of a mining boom into a sovereign wealth fund rather than the normal budget processes is not compelling.","Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Freebairn, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",j.freebairn@unimelb.edu.au,"freebairn, john/O-6199-2015","freebairn, john/0000-0002-1480-4953",,,,,26,5,6,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The results of practical application of EU regional policy differ not only from region to region but even from village to village. Our paper tries to answer the question of the role of internal factors such as characteristics of local governance within the process of rural development. We focused on development of villages within rural areas of the Czech Republic (CR). Our results are based on the research project titled Countryside as a Space for Living or just a Space for Surviving? supported by the Czech Ministry of Agriculture. Statistical data dealing with demographic and economic characteristic from a fifteen-year period (1995-2009) were analyzed. We used increasing number of population during our analyzed period as a rough indicator of village prosperity. This indicator reflects a different level of combination of two factors-rate of population growth and rate of migration in our time period. This philosophy is based on the idea that living village means successful village also in terms of economic prosperity. Rural area of CR consists of 6250 villages according OECD definition. We excluded villages from sub-urban zones and gained an area with 3681 of villages. These villages were statistically divided into four groups in terms of growing or decreasing number of population. To gain a more detailed information about the villages and their strategies we used a combination of questionnaire survey of local population with the interviews of mayors from selected villages. This paper is focused on deeper analyze of mayors interviews. Mayors as a main representative of local governance are the proper persons in terms of strategic development of village. Our results revealed that apart from policy and economic incentives the strategies of mayors and local community activity are the key factors for successful development and village prosperity.,"[Cudlinova, Eva; Rolinek, Ladislav; Leitmanova, Ivana Faltova; Klufova, Renata; Jilek, Milan] Jihoceska Univ Ceskych Budejovicich, Ekonomicka Fak, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Cudlínová, E (通讯作者)，Jihoceska Univ Ceskych Budejovicich, Ekonomicka Fak, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",evacu@centrum.cz; rolinek@ef.jcu.cz; leftman@ef.jcu.cz; klufova@ef.jcu.cz; jilek@ef.jcu.cz,"Leitmanová, Ivana Faltová/G-3237-2019; Klufová, Renata/G-3132-2019; Jilek, Milan/M-7618-2013; Rolínek, Ladislav/V-8649-2018","Jilek, Milan/0000-0002-8422-3927; Rolínek, Ladislav/0000-0003-2587-8226",,,,,19,0,0,0,7,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-652-9,,,,2012,,,,,,,38,48,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics,BG8OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392530500005,0

While the biofuel production and consumption exhibited significant increase over the first decade of the new millennium, this and further increases in biofuel production are driven primarily by government policies. Currently available first generation biofuels are not economically viable in the absence of fiscal incentives or high oil prices (with a few exceptional cases, especially in the case of the most developed Brazilian sugarcane production of ethanol). Also the environmental impacts of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels are quite ambiguous. The literature review of the most recent economic models dealing with biofuels and their economic impacts provides a distinction between structural and reduced form models. The discussion of structural models centres primarily on computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. The review of reduced models is structured toward the time series analysis approach to the dependencies between prices of biofuels, prices of agricultural commodities used for the biofuel production and prices of the fossil fuels.","[Janda, Karel] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Dept Microecon & Math Methods, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Janda, Karel; Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Janda, Karel] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Janda, Karel] Inst Econ, Ctr Econ Res & Grad Educ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kristoufek, Ladislav] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, CR-18208 Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Prague University of Economics & Business; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Janda, K (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Dept Microecon & Math Methods, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",Karel-Janda@seznam.cz,"janda, karel/A-3951-2008; Kristoufek, Ladislav/GOV-5386-2022; Kristoufek, Ladislav/H-3568-2014; janda, karel/GNP-1410-2022","janda, karel/0000-0001-7096-6300; Kristoufek, Ladislav/0000-0003-4843-9373; Kristoufek, Ladislav/0000-0003-4843-9373;","Energy Biosciences Institute at University of California, Berkeley; Czech Science Foundation [P402/11/0948]; Grant Agency of the Charles University [SVV 265 504]; [VSE IP100040]","Energy Biosciences Institute at University of California, Berkeley; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Grant Agency of the Charles University;","Supported by Energy Biosciences Institute at University of California, Berkeley, by the Czech Science Foundation (Grant No. P402/11/0948), by the Grant Agency of the Charles University (Project No. SVV 265 504), and by institutional support grant (No. VSE IP100040).",,77,57,64,11,92,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The process of regionalization has been carried out on the basis on Hampl's et al. (1996a, 1996b) work, transportation accessibility, the development of both current and long-term time series of individual communities' demographic data, and the development of employment and unemployment rates in different economic sectors in the communities of the regions in question. As an intermediate product of the study, a typology based on the European Commission typology has been created using the initial dataset. Regionalization, polarization, disparity, and other related phenomena are some of the current issues awaiting serious in-depth inquiry. Divergence is probably the most salient characteristics of the development in the past few years; divergence can also be traced in the seemingly homogenous landscape of the regions in question. Processes of divergence can be dealt with using several strategies. The top-down strategy (from the center to the regions) has recently been replaced with bottom-up strategies (think globally, act locally, or, in other words, make use of the local potential, ties and relations). The LEADER principle has been gaining more and more ground in the regions recently. This approach is best characterized by network realization, innovations, and the development and perception of identities. According to the materials provided for the preparation of Partnership Agreement for years 2014-2020, the LEADER principle is expected to play an important role in the future. In fact, it was the internal activities that substantially influenced the second phase of regionalization in the given area, the progress and the result of which presents the core of this paper. Finally, the prediction of the possible future development is provided for some of the area's more closely integrated microregions.","[Nevedel, Lukas] Mendelova Univ Brne, Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Nevedel, L (通讯作者)，Mendelova Univ Brne, Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",lukasnevedel@centrum.cz,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-652-9,,,,2012,,,,,,,183,188,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics,BG8OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392530500025,0

Informal financial associations have become a major channel of borrowing. Using data from the 2006 Rural Household Survey, the purpose of this paper is to investigate farmers' borrowing choices between banks, relatives/friends and informal associations. Design/methodology/approach - A simultaneous equation system is estimated using three-stage least squares to study the determinants of borrowing from varying sources and how they are related to each other. Findings - The results show that the relationship between the probability of formal credit market participation and age follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. Education, which serves an indicator of future income, is not significant in any setting. Borrowing from informal associations seems to stand alone and neither of the other two sources has an effect on its success rate. In addition, borrowing from informal associations works as a substitute for borrowing from relatives/friends but not vice versa. Originality/value - In this paper, borrowing from various sources is incorporated in a system of equations; thereby contributing to a better understanding of credit markets in China by providing a bigger and complete picture.","[Yuan, Yan] SW Univ Finance & Econ SWUFE, RIEM, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Gao, Ping] Chengdu Rural Commercial Bank, Credit Div, Chengdu, Peoples R China",,"Yuan, Y (通讯作者)，SW Univ Finance & Econ SWUFE, RIEM, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",yanyuan.tamu@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,12,14,14,75,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In part this is because the available data do not permit adequate treatment of econometric issues that arise in such assessments. This paper, however, attempts to estimate the impact of introducing a minimum wage law in the agriculture sector in South Africa, based on 15 waves of the biannual Labor Force Survey conducted between September 2000 and September 2007. The chosen sample includes six waves before the legislation's effective date (March 2003) and nine afterwards. To assess whether the changes experienced by farm workers are unique, we identify a control group that has similar characteristics to the treatment group. Our econometric approach involves using two alternative specifications of a difference-in-differences model. We test whether employers reduced employment, and whether they responded at the intensive margin by reducing hours of work. The results suggest a significant employment reduction in agriculture from the minimum wage (and particularly a noticeable move away from employment of part-time workers), an increase in wages on average, and a rise in non-wage benefits compliance. Our analysis also indicates that, firstly, overall average of hours worked fell in the post-law period, suggesting that employers adjusted to some extent on the intensive margin. Secondly, it appears that hours of work increased more in areas where wages were lower in the pre-law period, driven largely by the fall in part-time employment.","[Bhorat, Haroon] Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Kanbur, Ravi] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Stanwix, Benjamin] Univ Cape Town, Dev Policy Res Unit, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Cornell University; University of Cape Town,"Bhorat, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",,,,International Development Research Centre [106260-001],International Development Research Centre(International Development Research Centre - IDRC),"Haroon Bhorat is a professor at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, Ravi Kanbur is a professor at Cornell University, and Benjamin Stanwix is a researcher in the Development Policy Research Unit at the University of Cape Town.

Such accounts could be an effective risk management tool for many farmers and could operate without major government subsidization. Relative to the current program, the proposed design should exhibit minimal moral hazard and adverse selection problems, and since farm-level risk does not have to be priced, the proposed design eliminates the premium rating difficulties that weaken actuarial soundness and trigger the need for substantial external subsidies.

Hypothesising a rent-formation model where rents are determined by prices, this paper estimates a threshold autoregressive model which integrates three tests of market failure, namely, inefficiency, bias and asymmetry. There are four results. First, a long-run relationship exists between rents and prices, and the Japanese farmland rental market is efficient. Second, the rent-price elasticity is unity and the market is unbiased. Third, rents are Granger-caused by prices which supports the rent-formation model. Fourth, asymmetry exists where more rapid error-correction occurs immediately after policy reform when rent growth exceeds price growth by 3.6% or more, and rent control has benefitted tenants.","Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Dawson, PJ (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",P.J.Dawson@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,2,2,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

For the sample at hand, the unit root tests only validate a new period of high volatility for wheat and cotton. If in the next couple of years however, corn, rice and soybeans maintain their higher volatility, a new period of high volatility may also be validated statistically. Regarding the factors driving the intrayear volatility GMM estimates show that commodity market fundamentals i.e., the stock-to-use ratio and to a lesser extent the degree of internationalization, are the most systematically statistically significant coefficients among commodities. Over time, consecutive low stock-to-use ratios and a thin international market provoke typically high volatility. Speculative activity and liquidity in the agricultural derivative market have a stabilizing effect on the spot price, if any. Finally, common macro factors significantly impact volatility, especially the volatility of petrol and of exchange rates; their dispersion importance over the sample is quite sizeable. However, it is difficult to establish a link between, on the one hand, loose monetary policy, business cycle and inflation, and, on the other hand, commodity price volatility, as the sign of the estimated coefficient changes depending on the commodity and the estimated elasticities are quite low.","[Ott, Herve] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, IPTS, Seville 41092, Spain; [Ott, Herve] Thunen Inst Market Anal, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Ott, H (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, IPTS, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",Herve.OTT@ti.bund.de,,,,,,,67,21,23,3,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The recent evolution towards an increased use of seasonal wage labour motivates the original distinction of three types of labour: family labour, permanent-wage labour and seasonal-wage labour. Considering the two wage labour types and hiring cost for seasonal workers, our empirical results based on 2000 French data on fruit and vegetable farms suggest that the choice between hiring permanent or seasonal wage labour is not only determined by the seasonality of the activity. Indeed, the characteristics of the local labour market also affect the trade-off between permanent and seasonal wage labour. This result provides insights on the substitutability of the two labour types, especially when the local labour market is tight. Moreover, the substitution of seasonal-wage labour for permanent-wage labour can occur in the agricultural sector as a mean of increasing flexibility as well as reducing costs and commitments. Finally, family labour is found to substitute for wage labour and more specifically for seasonal-wage labour.","[Bignebat, Celine; Perrier-Cornet, Philippe] INRA, UMR 1110, MOISA, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France",INRAE,"Darpeix, A (通讯作者)，French Permanent Representat European Union, 14 Pl Louvain, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",aurelie.darpeix@diplomatie.gouv.fr; bignebat@supagro.inra.fr; perrierp@supagro.inra.fr,,,Region Languedoc-Roussillon (France); INRA (National Institute for Agricultural Research); French Ministry of Agriculture,Region Languedoc-Roussillon (France)(Region Occitanie); INRA (National Institute for Agricultural Research); French Ministry of Agriculture,"Aurelie Darpeix is the contact author, and is currently working at the French Permanent Representation to the European Union, 14 Place de Louvain 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium.

It estimates the scale of the impact and identifies the way of the impact. Especially, the paper takes hukou uniform reform as an example and tests whether hukou reforms helped in eliminating labor market segmentation. Design/methodology/approach - The data sets this paper adopted are the 2000 Census and 2005 Mini Census data in China. Linear model and Probit model are used in estimating hukou's impact. Oaxaca/Blinder decomposition is used in decomposing the difference in occupation distribution among hukou statuses. DID evaluation method is used in comparing the region with hukou uniform reform and the region without to capture the influence of the reform. Findings - The result shows that occupation segmentation based on hukou significantly exists in urban labor market. Hukou uniform reform improved the occupation opportunity of local rural workers but migrating rural workers were somehow crowded out. Migrating urban workers did not benefit from the reform. To conclude these, the reform released employment segmentation between rural and urban workers within the reformed region but strengthened the segmentation between the local residents and outcomers which could influence future labor source and scale in reformed area. Originality/value - The paper evaluates the hukou uniform reform's impact on the labor market using an empirical way for the first time and makes concrete policy recommendations based on these findings.","[Song, Jin] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Shi] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Beijing Normal University,"Song, J (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",songjin@cass.org.cn,,,IDRC/CIGI Young China Scholars Research Network,IDRC/CIGI Young China Scholars Research Network,"The first draft of the paper was presented in the workshop on rural development policy in China, April 27-28, 2013, CAU, Beijing.

Design/methodology/approach - The double-hurdle model is fit to the household data of Sichuan and Xinjiang provinces which is from the National Bureau of Statistics urban household surveys. Findings - The paper finds that consumers' purchasing decisions regarding pork are related to both non-economic and economic factors. The results also indicate large differences among the determinants for decision of how much pork to buy across the three income strata. Low-income households have higher income elasticity than middle-income and high-income households. High-income and middle-income households' level of pork consumption is more sensitive to pork price. High-income households have greater cross-price elasticity. Originality/value - In the previous studies, the non-economic determinants of pork consumption have not been addressed, and neither does the issue of difference pork purchasing behavior across income strata for urban households in western China.

Based on the data from a rural household survey, we first categorize the rural income diversification patterns according to the industry and the location in which the income is generated. Then we apply a Bayesian multinomial probit model to examine the determinants of various types of the rural income diversification. The major results demonstrate that a larger family size stimulates households to undertake various income diversification patterns, but its effects are discounted by an unproductive population structure within the household. Another interesting discovery is that a rural household chooses its income diversification pattern by referring to the surrounding neighbourhood; when most farm families depend on off-farm activities to boost their income, the individual household is more likely to follow the surrounding households by participating in the off-farm or mixed income activities or to migrate out to earn its income.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhao, JM (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jianmei@cufe.edu.cn,,,Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund from the Chinese Ministry of Education [10YJC790393],Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund from the Chinese Ministry of Education,Supported by Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund from the Chinese Ministry of Education (Grant No. 10YJC790393).,,26,13,13,2,17,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Both sets of policies reduced global economic welfare and agricultural trade, and added to global inequality and poverty. Over the past three decades, much progress has been made in reducing agricultural protection in high-income countries and agricultural disincentives in developing countries. However, plenty of price distortions remain. As well, the propensity of governments to insulate their domestic food market from fluctuations in international prices has not waned. Such insulation contributes to the amplification of international food price fluctuations, yet it does little to advance national food security when food-importing and food-exporting countries equally engage in insulating behavior. Thus there is still much scope to improve global economic welfare via multilateral agreement not only to remove remaining trade distortions but also to desist from varying trade barriers when international food prices gyrate. This article summarizes indicators of trends and fluctuations in farm trade barriers before examining unilateral or multilateral trade arrangements, together with complementary domestic measures, that could lead to better global food security outcomes.","[Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] CEPR, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Adelaide; Australian National University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",Australian Research Council; Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation; World Bank,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation; World Bank(The World Bank India),"Thanks are due to the Australian Research Council, the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, and the World Bank for financial assistance.

While regional impacts will be politically important, very little analysis of them has been carried out. This paper contributes to the analysis of this issue by building a small model involving two regions, incorporating the right to emit CO2 as a factor of production with the level of permitted emissions set by the national government. We argue that there is likely to be pressure on governments to use other policies to offset the possible adverse regional economic consequences of the pollution-reduction policy; we also consider a range of such policies. Using numerical simulation, we find that a 10 per cent reduction has relatively small but regionally differentiated economic effects. Standard fiscal policies are generally ineffective or counterproductive while labour market policies are more useful in offsetting the adverse effects.","[Chen, Anping] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Groenewold, Nicolaas] Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Hagger, Alfred J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Econ & Finance, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Jinan University; University of Western Australia; University of Tasmania,"Chen, AP (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",nic.groenewold@uwa.edu.au,,"Groenewold, Nicolaas/0000-0003-3612-4470",,,,,15,1,1,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Complex simulation models contain a number of details that make them suitable for practical management advice, including taking into account the response of the fishermen to implemented management measures. To demonstrate the use of complex management models this paper assesses a number of second best management schemes against a first rank optimum (FRO), an ideal individual transferable quotas (ITQ) system. This is defined as the management scheme which produces the highest net present value over a 25 year period. The assessed management schemes (scenarios) are composed by several measures as used in the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union for the cod fishery in the Baltic Sea. The scenarios are total allowable catches in combination with entry restrictions, and maximum number of days at sea in combination with entry restrictions. These two scenarios are assessed under assumptions of no cooperative behavior and cooperative behavior, and compliance and noncompliance with various management restrictions. Apart from showing the magnitude of the resource rent, the impact on fleet structure and the adjustment paths is shown. The result is that the resource rent gained from these second best management schemes is lower than FRO, the ideal ITQ system, but may in practice not be so different. Le present article vise a illustrer comment les enjeux ou problemes lies a la gestion et a l'economie des peches peuvent etre analyses a l'aide d'un modele complexe fonde sur la theorie bioeconomique classique. Les modeles de simulation complexes renferment des details qui permettent de formuler des conseils pratiques en matiere de gestion, y compris tenir compte de la reaction des pecheurs face aux mesures de gestion mises en place. Afin de demontrer l'utilisation des modeles de gestion complexes, nous comparons quelques plans de gestion de second rang a un optimum de premier rang (OPR), soit un systeme ideal de contingent individuel transferable (CIT). Il s'agit du plan de gestion qui offre la valeur actualisee nette la plus elevee sur une periode de 25ans. Les plans de gestion (ou scenarios) evalues renferment plusieurs mesures semblables a celles qui figurent dans la Politique Commune de la Peche de l'Union europeenne concernant la peche a la morue dans la mer Baltique. Le premier scenario comprend le total autorise des captures (TAC) combine a des restrictions d'acces et le deuxieme comprend un nombre maximum de jours passes en mer combine a des restrictions d'acces. Ces deux scenarios sont evalues selon les hypotheses suivantes: comportement cooperatif et non cooperatif; respect et non-respect des diverses restrictions en matiere de gestion des peches. Nous faisons ressortir l'importance des benefices tires des ressources halieutiques ainsi que les repercussions sur la structure de la flottille et les solutions de rajustement. Les resultats de notre etude indiquent que les benefices tires des ressources halieutiques a partir des plans de gestion de second rang sont inferieurs a ceux tires d'un optimum de premier rang (le systeme ideal de CIT), mais que ces benefices pourraient ne pas etre si differents en pratique.","[Frost, Hans; Andersen, Peder; Hoff, Ayoe] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Frost, H (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",hf@ifro.ku.dk; pean@ifro.ku.dk; ah@ifro.ku.dk,"; Frost, Hans Staby/E-1213-2015","Hoff, Ayoe/0000-0002-3679-3431; Frost, Hans Staby/0000-0002-5680-4695",,,,,40,14,14,0,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Furthermore, farmer demographic, farming system, and technology variables are used to identify matches. Bias is reduced by estimating separate weighted regression functions for the treated and untreated groups.

We adopt a smooth transition vector error correction modelling framework to analyse the impacts of ENSO events on the vegetable oil prices and, more interestingly, to investigate the asymmetric nature of the ENSO dynamics and price responses to ENSO shocks. The results confirm self-exciting type nonlinearities in the ENSO dynamics, and presence of the so-called transactions cost band in the system of vegetable oil prices. These nonlinearities yield the history-specific asymmetries in the vegetable oil price dynamics, wherein effects of ENSO shocks on the ENSO dynamics and the vegetable oil prices vary considerably between different ENSO regimes. In general, positive deviations, ElNino events, result in the vegetable oil price increase, while negative deviations, LaNina events, result in decrease in the prices. We illustrate these effects using generalised impulse-response functions and the derived asymmetry measures.","[Ubilava, David] Univ Sydney, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Holt, Matt] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",University of Sydney; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Ubilava, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",david.ubilava@sydney.edu.au,"Ubilava, David/K-8208-2012; Ubilava, David/AAH-3542-2019","Ubilava, David/0000-0002-8993-6766; Ubilava, David/0000-0002-8993-6766",,,,,51,26,28,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

To this end, it considers two alternative market structures. Namely, the pure ones, where the buyers of a primary commodity are private firms, and mixed ones, where a private firm competes against a producer's cooperative. According to the results, the pure-strategy location equilibrium in both cases involves a distance between the two players larger or equal to 1/4. Nevertheless, the equilibriums are qualitatively different. In the pure duopsony, a large distance is required to prevent a price war while in the mixed duopsony, the private firm tries to stay away from the co-op in order to ensure a strictly positive profit.","[Fousekis, Panos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Panagiotou, Dimitrios] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of Ioannina,"Fousekis, P (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",fousekis@econ.auth.gr; dpanag@cc.uoi.gr,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,11,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The development is evaluated using a database of farms from the Czech Republic since 2000, divided by the share of land included in the LFA. The year 2011 revealed a significant improvement in economic indicators over the previous year. A positive profit appeared in 95% of enterprises and economic results approached the results of 2007. An important trend is the reduction in the number of workers, when in 2011 the number of workers was equal to 70% to that in 2000, while labour productivity is increasing annually by an average of 7%. In the structure of production, the average farm revealed a revenue growth of crop production, the revenue from livestock production was declining, although the opposite trend appeared in mountain areas. In all categories of farms, there is a growing dependence on subsidies. Although the year 2011 was the second most productive since 2000, the profit after deducting subsidies was reached by 13% of farms only.","[Lososova, Jana; Zdenek, Radek] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finances, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Lososová, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",lososova@ef.jcu.cz; zdenek@ef.jcu.cz,"ZDENĚK, Radek/D-6217-2016; Lososová, Jana/D-6237-2016","ZDENĚK, Radek/0000-0001-6945-6485; Lososová, Jana/0000-0001-9610-1436",,,,,31,9,9,0,11,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Using the hedonic wage regression, this paper estimates the compensating wage differential for incremental job mortality risk among Chinese workers. The implied VSL is derived for China and its different regions. The data is from the 2005 China inter-census population survey, consisting of 1.3 million urban and rural workers. The authors also made important improvement in the model specification to explicitly address the missing variable issue in the previous studies. Findings - The paper results indicate that the industry mortality risk has a significant impact on the wage rate. The implied VSL is 1.81 million RMB, a value substantially higher than previous estimates. The results also suggest a sizable urban-rural difference, with the urban VSL being 4.3 times higher than the rural estimate. The strong urban-rural inequality of income could be attributed to the segregation between the urban and rural labor markets. Practical implications The paper findings indicate the importance of reforming the current workers' compensation standard and improving the institutional environment, as well as enhancing the labor protection in the rural labor market. Originality/value - This paper is the first attempt to estimate the value of life in China using the census based data. The paper results contribute to the growing literature in obtaining comparable VSL estimates in the developing countries.","[Qin, Xuezheng] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Lixing] Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yangyang] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University; Tsinghua University,"Li, LX (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",lilixing@ccer.pku.edu.cn,,"Li, Lixing/0000-0002-1178-5830",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71103009]; Ministry of Education of China [10YJC790206]; Peking University School of Economics Research Seed Grant,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Peking University School of Economics Research Seed Grant","The authors are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71103009), the Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 10YJC790206), and Peking University School of Economics Research Seed Grant for their financial support.",,31,18,20,6,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We use ideas from the evolutionary economics and public choice literatures to explain why trajectories of technological change, especially in fisheries, may not be smooth at all, but rather punctuated. The interest of technological change and switching behavior for fisheries economists and managers stems from the fact that control of effective effort, often necessary for sustainable management of the resource, remains a central management problem for that sector worldwide, even in developed countries. However, various policies put in place by governments to support the fishing sector, and often put in place to correct for certain market failures, may inadvertently produce other nonmarket failures, which result in technological lock-ins which are unsustainable. For example, the trawling technique was widely promoted in France in the 1970s and 1980s. Path dependency developed in such a way that the preferred choice of new entrants into the fishery was this technology. Technological lock-in occurred on the trawling technique as the trawling sector also became more politically active, making it ultimately the most widely used technique in the French fisheries sector in the Atlantic. Switching away from this technology has not taken place even with poorer economic performance of that technology. This paper also discusses the influence of state subsidies on the adoption of trawling. Even if trawling was a major innovation in fisheries in the past, its potential for technological adaptations or minor innovations is limited now. These limitations are more obvious during periods of increasing energy prices, especially in the absence of state aid. However, due to collective choice phenomena, switches to more sustainable technologies will occur more slowly.","[Le Floc'h, Pascal] Univ Brest, UEB, Umr Amure, F-29238 Brest 3, France; [Daures, Fabienne; Guyader, Olivier] IFREMER, Umr Amure, ZI Pointe Diable, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Wilson, James] Univ Quebec, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada",Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Ifremer; Ifremer; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; University of Quebec,"Le Floc'h, P (通讯作者)，Univ Brest, UEB, Umr Amure, 12 Rue Kergoat, F-29238 Brest 3, France.",plefloch@univ-brest.fr; fabienne.daures@ifremer.fr; olivier.guyader@ifremer.fr; James_Wilson@uqar.ca,"Wilson, Anthony J/K-9575-2013",,European Commission [KBBE.2011.1.2-10],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research is funded by the European Commission under the seventh framework program (KBBE.2011.1.2-10), within the research project called Socio-economic effects of the main management principles of the future Common Fishery Policy (CFP): impact of new policy framework and opportunities for the fishing sector to develop self- and co-management (Socioec).",,40,4,5,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

In the proposed framework, TFP changes are attributed to the conventional sources of growth (i.e. technical change, scale effect and changes in technical efficiency) and the damage-control effect which consists of three distinct components: the first one is due to changes in the initial pest infestation, the second is a spillover effect arising from neighbours use of preventive inputs and the third is related to abatement effectiveness. The proposed model is applied to a panel of olive-growing farms in Crete, Greece, during the period 19992003. The empirical results indicate that the damage-control effect accounted, on average, for 5 per cent of the annual TFP growth and its main component was the improvements in abatement effectiveness.","[Karagiannis, Giannis] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece; [Tzouvelekas, Vangelis] Univ Crete, Khania, Greece",University of Macedonia; University of Crete,"Karagiannis, G (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",karagian@uom.gr,,"Tzouvelekas, Vangelis/0000-0001-7097-9646",European Community [212120],European Community,"We would like to thank the seminar participants at the Department of Economics in the Swedish Agricultural University (SLU) and in the University of Cyprus, two anonymous reviewers and one of the editors, Paolo Sckokai, for helpful comments and suggestions.

The analysis contrasts the influence of psychological constructs on this decision with those on decisions to specialise in a single farm enterprise or to have multiple farm enterprises. This is one of the first studies to introduce psychological constructs into the study of farm diversification. It is based on a sample of 929 Swedish farms participating in the official Swedish Farm Economic Survey. These data are supplemented with a detailed postal questionnaire to the participating farmers, generating a response rate of 73% and an effective sample size of 679 farmers and their businesses. Data are analysed with factor and multinomial logistic regression analyses. Results show that psychological constructs in TPB (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control) influence farmers decisions regarding the strategy they adopt. Attitude and subjective norm are found to be especially influential in these decisions. Given the prominent role agriculture still has in rural development policy, where the development of new ventures in farm businesses is perceived as the engine for rural economic growth and employment, these findings have clear policy implications.","[Hansson, Helena; Ferguson, Richard; Olofsson, Christer] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Hansson, H (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",helena.hansson@slu.se,"Hansson, Helena/AAR-2089-2021","Hansson, Helena/0000-0001-9609-4387",Swedish Research Council Formas,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),The authors are grateful to the Editor and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier drafts.

A common criticism of such programmes is that they remove the least efficient vessels first, resulting in an increase in average efficiency of the remaining fleet, which tends to increase the effective fishing power of the remaining fleet. In this paper, the effects of a buyback programme on average technical efficiency in Australias Northern Prawn Fishery are examined using a multi-output production function approach with an explicit inefficiency model. As expected, the results indicate that average efficiency of the remaining vessels was generally greater than that of the removed vessels. Further, there was some evidence of an increase in average scale efficiency in the fleet as the remaining vessels were closer, on average, to the optimal scale. Key factors affecting technical efficiency included company structure and the number of vessels fishing. In regard to fleet size, our model suggests positive externalities associated with more boats fishing at any point in time (due to information sharing and reduced search costs), but also negative externalities due to crowding, with the latter effect dominating the former. Hence, the buyback resulted in a net increase in the individual efficiency of the remaining vessels due to reduced crowding, as well as raising average efficiency through removal of less efficient vessels.","[Pascoe, Sean] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, EcoSci Precinct, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Pascoe, Sean] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Punt, Andre E.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Punt, Andre E.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Dichmont, Catherine M.] CSIRO, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Pascoe, S (通讯作者)，CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, EcoSci Precinct, POB 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",sean.pas-coe@csiro.au,"Coglan, Louisa/AAF-2356-2019; Coglan, Louisa/J-1113-2012; Dichmont, Catherine M/A-9528-2008; Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011","Coglan, Louisa/0000-0001-5730-7845; Coglan, Louisa/0000-0001-5730-7845; Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649; Punt, Andre/0000-0001-8489-2488",CSIRO Wealth from Oceans Flagship,CSIRO Wealth from Oceans Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"The study was undertaken as part of the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) project: 'Developing techniques to estimate total allowable catches for the NPF major prawn species', and with support from the CSIRO Wealth from Oceans Flagship.

Anecdotal evidence pointed to a unique result, an increase in demand for whole-grain foods. Contemporaneous decreases in prices of whole-grain foods, relative to refined-grain foods, however, confound the evidence. We show that for whole-grain bread, there was an increase in retail demand even after accounting for price changes.

Because most SSA farmers are risk averse, they may be willing to invest in productive assets that can mitigate the impacts of such risks if their capital constraints are relaxed through external financial assistance. We test this hypothesis by using panel data on investment behavior of Nigerian farmers who received financial assistance on productive assets. The empirical results show that farmers facing higher rainfall risks are more likely to invest in irrigation pumps that can mitigate the impact of rainfall risks, while those facing higher risks of white gari price are more likely to invest in milling machines that enable them to process cassava into flour instead of gari, which supports our hypothesis.","[Takeshima, Hiroyuki] Int Ctr Soil Fertil & Agr Dev, Int Food Policy Res Inst, Abuja, Nigeria; [Yamauchi, Futoshi] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Takeshima, H (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Soil Fertil & Agr Dev, Int Food Policy Res Inst, Plot 1413 Cadestral,Zone AO3,Garki 2, Abuja, Nigeria.",H.takeshima@cgiar.org,"Takeshima, Hiroyuki/AAN-6611-2021; Takeshima, Hiroyuki/AAO-3212-2021","Takeshima, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-1761-408X;",,,,,30,19,21,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

By exploiting periods of high and low appreciation that caused various increases in wealth for farmers owning various shares of their farmland, we examine whether U.S. grain farmers expanded their acres harvested or acres owned in response to an increase in their land wealth. We find that land wealth had little effect on farm size. However, for similarly-sized farms, a larger ownership share (10 percentage points) led to an increase in the growth of land owned (2 percentage points). Because older farmers own more of the land that they farm, greater land appreciation slows the rate at which younger farmers acquire land relative to older farmers.","[Weber, Jeremy G.; Key, Nigel] ARS, USDA, Davis, CA 95616 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Weber, JG (通讯作者)，ARS, USDA, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,,27,14,17,4,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The subsequent rounds of price surges hit landless poor consumers hard, and transferred billions of dollars from them to landowners worldwide. Economists offered a list of highly plausible explanations for the recent jumps in grain price levels. Key findings included the large harvest shortfalls caused by climate change, energy prices, and fertilizer prices, as well as demand increases due to the large and persistent annual income increases in India and China. Several declared various combinations of the above factors to be a perfect storm' in grain markets. In fact little more than a quick series of online searches easily reveals that only the last is plausible as a major cause of recent grain price jumps. In particular there was no major global grain production shortfall. On the other hand biofuels mandates, relatively neglected in many studies, introduced a new source of grain demand that tightened markets and drove up prices. The disconnect between economic analysis and easily verified facts is a disturbing feature of recent economic analyses of grain markets.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Wright, BD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Giannini 207, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bwright@berkeley.edu,,"Wright, Brian/0000-0002-6440-8596",Energy Biosciences Institute - BP,Energy Biosciences Institute - BP,"Brian D.

We account for retail markup endogeneity using a control-function approach in which controls are derived from empirical evidence in the marketing literature. Furthermore, we adopt three test procedures to evaluate this endogeneity and apply our method in an econometric analysis of retail market behavior in the marketing of yogurt in the United States.

I find that when looking across the entire population of smallholders, receiving an additional 100 kg of subsidized fertilizer causes the average household to supply about three fewer days of ganyu. The fertilizer subsidy program also has a small positive effect on the probability that a household demands agricultural labor, with the results approaching statistical significance. In addition, a 10 kg increase in the average amount of subsidized fertilizer acquired per household in a community boosts the median agricultural wage rate by 1.4% in that community. The increase in wage rates translates to a US $1.40 per year increase in average household income in the years after Malawi's subsidy program was scaled up, and a US $1.86 per year increase in average household income for those who sold their labor before the subsidy program was scaled up. This finding suggests that households who sell their labor off farm may experience some small spillover benefit from the program in the form of higher agricultural wage rates.","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Ricker-Gilbert, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jrickerg@purdue.edu,,,Department for International Development (DFID)/Malawi; United States Agency for International Development Malawi Mission (USAID/Malawi); USAID's Economic Growth and Trade Division (EGAT),Department for International Development (DFID)/Malawi; United States Agency for International Development Malawi Mission (USAID/Malawi)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); USAID's Economic Growth and Trade Division (EGAT)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The author gratefully acknowledges funding support for the data collection and analysis in Malawi from the Department for International Development (DFID)/Malawi, the United States Agency for International Development Malawi Mission (USAID/Malawi), and from USAID's Economic Growth and Trade Division (EGAT) to the Food Security III Cooperative Agreement at Michigan State University.

This specification is not only theory-compatible but can also explicitly model a minimum level of consumption not dependent on prices or income. This is described as minimum threshold or nondiscretionary water use. Additionally, the Stone-Geary framework is used to model the subsistence level of water consumption that is dependent on the temporal evolution of consumer habits and stock of physical capital. The main aim of this study is to analyse the impact of water-saving habits and water-efficient technologies on residential water demand, while additionally focusing attention on nondiscretionary uses.

In this study, we use spatial econometric methods to determine how individuals revise their preferences for product attributes when exposed to product recommendations from peers, and how different individuals who vary in their degree of network connectedness exert influence on the product choices of others. We find evidence that consumers look to others for guidance from peers in their preference for subjective, taste-specific parameters, but tend not to respond to peer price choices. Our spatial methods allow us to empirically determine the influence exerted by individual members on the consumption choices of other members of the social network. We find that connected members of the social network are not always the most influential in revising the consumption choices of others.

Investigations of the latter are subject of this article. After having discussed the theoretical possibilities to influence environmental impacts by the funding scheme, several analyses are compiled and complemented by own calculations. The research has shown that agricultural practices within Less Favoured Areas are more environmentally friendly than in other areas. Environmentally friendly in this regard means e. g. a lower use of fertilisers and pesticides, but also a higher participation rate in agri-environmental measures. In addition, the crop structures of farms are analysed, e. g. the share of maize and wheat in farms inside and outside the LFAs. While the results presented in this paper relate mainly to Germany, the information on the European level is also taken into consideration. Finally, based on these investigations, recommendations for the revision of the funding programmes following 2013 are given.","Univ Rostock, D-18059 Rostock, Germany",University of Rostock,"Rudow, K (通讯作者)，Univ Rostock, Justus V Liebig Weg 7, D-18059 Rostock, Germany.",katja.rudow@uni-rostock.de,,,,,,,18,9,11,0,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Particularly, the authors focus on the impact differences between north and south regions. Design/methodology/approach - The authors applied the Ricardian approach which assumes that each farmer wishes to maximize revenue subject to the exogenous conditions of their farm. The climate data are based on actual measurements in 753 national meteorological stations and the socio-economic data covers 8,405 farms across 28 provinces in China. Findings - On average, the rise of annual temperature will hurt farms both in the north or south. The impacts of climate change on both precipitation and temperatures have different seasonal impacts on producers in the north and the south of China. As a consequence, the impact on net farm revenues varies with farms in the north and the south being adversely affected (to different degrees) by a rise in the temperature, but both benefiting from an anticipated increase in rainfall. The results also reveal that irrigation is one key adaption measure to dealing with climate change. Whether in the north or south of China, increasing temperature is beneficial to irrigated farms, while for rainfed farms, higher temperature will result in a reduction in net revenues. The results also reveal that farms in the north are more vulnerable to temperature and precipitation variation than that in the south. Irrigated farms in the south are more vulnerable to precipitation variation than that in the north; but rainfed farms in the north are more vulnerable to precipitation variation than that in the south. Originality/value - Applying empirical analysis to identify the differences of climate change impacts between north and south regions will help policy makers to design reasonable adaptation policies for various regions.","[Wang, Jinxia; Huang, Jikun; Zhang, Lijuan; Li, Yumin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, CCAP, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Wang, JX (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, CCAP, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jxwang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Zhang, Li/GWM-7501-2022; li, Yu/HCI-9086-2022; li, yu/HGL-9518-2022; Li, yu/HHZ-5236-2022",,"National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [70925001, 71161140351]; Ministry of Science and Technology [2012CB955700]; International Development Research Center (IDRC); Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)",National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); International Development Research Center (IDRC)(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res),"The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (70925001, 71161140351), Ministry of Science and Technology (2012CB955700), International Development Research Center (IDRC) and Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR).",,20,12,12,6,63,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Model-based estimates of the emissions from cropland expansion have been used to assess the environmental impacts of biofuel policies. And integrated assessment models have estimated the potential for biofuels to contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement over the coming century. All of these studies feature, explicitly or implicitly, competition between biofuel feed stocks and other land uses. However, the economic mechanisms governing this competition, as well as the contribution of biofuels to global land use change, have not received the close scrutiny that they deserve. The purpose of this article is to offer a deeper look at these factors. We begin with a comparative static analysis which assesses the impact of exogenously specified forecasts of biofuel expansion over the period: 2006-2035. Global land use change is decomposed according to the three key margins of economic response: extensive supply, intensive supply, and demand. Under the International Energy Agency's New Policies scenario, biofuels account for nearly one-fifth of global land use change over the 2006-2035 period. The article also offers a comparative dynamic analysis which determines the optimal path for first and second generation biofuels over the course of the entire 21st century. In the absence of GHG regulation, the welfare-maximizing path for global land use, in the face of 3% annual growth in oil prices, allocates 225 Mha to biofuel feed stocks by 2100, with the associated biofuels accounting for about 30% of global liquid fuel consumption. This area expansion is somewhat diminished by expected climate change impacts on agriculture, while it is significantly increased by an aggressive GHG emissions target and by advances in conversion efficiency of second generation biofuels.","[Hertel, Thomas; Steinbuks, Jevgenijs; Baldos, Uris] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Hertel, T (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",hertel@purdue.edu,,"Stenbuks, Jevgenijs/0000-0003-3548-2196","National Science Foundation [0951576]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0951576] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Science Foundation, grant 0951576 DMUU: Center for Robust Decision Making on Climate and Energy Policy.",,40,35,37,1,80,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Consequently, research focusing on economic growth and poverty reduction has found that sustainable rapid transition out of poverty requires a special emphasis on the agricultural sector. This study contributes to the debate on aid effectiveness by disaggregating total aid into subcategories and specifically investigating the relationship between aid given to the agricultural sector and poverty reduction. If agricultural development is more effective in reducing poverty than some other types of development, then foreign aid directed towards agriculture may be more efficient in increasing the well-being of the poor than aid directed to some other sectors or uses. Our analysis uses panel data for developing aid recipient countries to empirically test this relationship.

On average, rural diversification has not proven to contribute much to poverty reduction and income transfers and agricultural tax abolishment have only helped at the margin. The findings from these two case studies highlight that the scope for reducing poverty in rural lagging regions can still be substantial in agriculture, also when nonagriculture drives national growth.","[Christiaensen, Luc] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Pan, Lei] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wang, Sangui] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",The World Bank; Wageningen University & Research; Renmin University of China,"Wang, SG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",wangsg80@gmail.com,,,World Bank managed Diagnostic Facility for Shared Growth; French Development Agency; Department for International Development of UK; German Technical Cooperation; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency; UNU-WIDER,World Bank managed Diagnostic Facility for Shared Growth; French Development Agency; Department for International Development of UK; German Technical Cooperation; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency; UNU-WIDER,"The authors thank the Chinese authorities of the World Bank's Western Poverty Reduction Project in China (WPRP), Wang Pingping, Assistant Counsel, Department of Rural Surveys of the National Bureau of Statistics of China, and Sari Soderstrom, World Bank Task Manager of the WPRP for making the data available and for their continuous support and feedback.

Thus, this paper shows that the international prices and the farm gate prices of these two products are strongly dispersed around their respective average, from one year to another and within each year. This paper proposes a model of partial stabilization which makes it possible to highlight an alternate mechanism of the coffee and cocoa price stabilization which is relatively efficient compared to the mechanism which currently exists. It shows that a marketing board in the Ivorian coffee and cocoa sector, which constitutes a buff er stock and uses it in a strategic way, has the advantage of reducing significantly the volatility of the international price and the farm gate price.","Univ Cocody Abidjan, Dept Econ, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",Universite Felix Houphouet-Boigny,"Malan, BB (通讯作者)，Univ Cocody Abidjan, Dept Econ, BP V 43, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.",malanben@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,29,5,8,0,29,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors conducted a household survey in Fujian province of 520 randomly selected forest farmers. The authors used a random-effects Tobit model to estimate the impact of land rights and other components on, for example, tenure security and harvest quota, and the impact of tenure types on farmers' investment incentives. Findings - This study produced three main findings: perceived tenure security in the context of frequent agricultural land redistribution negatively affects input intensity; farmers still perceive some tenure arrangements to be more uncertain than others, which discourages them from undertaking investments on such plots; and the harvest quota regulation, introduced to conserve forest stock, has in fact acted as a disincentive in forestry management. Originality/value - Almost all previous studies are based on national or regional data, which have primarily focused on the links between tenure types and investment incentives. In this study, based on the plot-level data, the authors are able to assess not only the impacts of tenure types but also how specific land rights and their components affect farmers' investment behavior.","[Qin, Ping; Xu, Jintao] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Qin, P (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",pingqin2009@gmail.com,,"Xu, Jintao/0000-0001-5588-2942","National Natural Science Foundation of China [70821140353, 70773001]; Ford Foundation; Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI); World Bank; EfD Initiative of the University of Gothenburg",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ford Foundation; Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI); World Bank(The World Bank India); EfD Initiative of the University of Gothenburg,"The financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Number: 70821140353 and 70773001), Ford Foundation, the Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI), the World Bank and the EfD Initiative of the University of Gothenburg are acknowledged.

The mean TE of rice farming in village irrigation was found to be 0.72, although 63% of rice farmers exceeded this average. The most influential factors of TE are membership of Farmer Organisations (FOs) and the participatory rate in collective actions organised by FOs.

To assess the feasibility of a wood biomass-fired power plant in the BC interior, it is necessary to know both how much physical biomass might be available over the life of a plant and its location as transportation cost is likely to be a major operating cost for any facility. To address these issues, we construct a mathematical programming model of fiber flows in the Quesnel Timber Supply Area of BC over a 25-year time horizon. The focus of the model is on minimizing the cost of supplying feedstock through space and time. Results indicate that over the life of the project, feedstock costs will more than double, increasing from $54.60/bone-dry tonnes (BDt) ($0.039/kWh) to $116.14/BDt ($0.083/kWh).","[Niquidet, Kurt; Stennes, Brad] Canadian Forest Serv, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada; [van Kooten, G.

They tend to be high for long periods when global average growth rates are high, and low for long periods when growth rates are low, and to fluctuate around these averages as short term demand departs from expectations. The growth of advanced developing countries is especially influential in determining global demand for resources. Exceptional growth and resource intensity of China have been the main determinants of high energy and metals prices since about 2003. Short term cyclical factors have pushed energy and metal prices higher still, because markets did not anticipate the strength of Chinese demand and supply takes time to catch up. The high resource intensity of Chinese growth has been the result of high investment rates and rapid increases in urban population and the export share of production. Strong growth is likely to continue although at slowly receding rates, but growth will become less resource intensive, leading to moderation of global commodity prices. Strong growth in China and the world are at risk if effective policies are not adopted to break the nexus between economic growth and pressure on the environment.","Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Garnaut, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Alan Gilbert Bldg, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",ross.garnaut@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,26,23,24,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Even when peer monitoring is local, firms may achieve higher profits under collective reputation by decreasing the cost of maintaining customers' trust. The optimal number of firms that share a common reputation is greater when (1) trades are more frequent and public information is disseminated more rapidly, (2) the deviation gain is smaller compared to the quality premium, (3) customers' information regarding firms' quality is more precise, or (4) intragroup information about firms' quality is more global. From a positive perspective, we suggest how social norms can influence the reputation of regional products. We also offer an efficiency explanation for food scares. From a normative point of view, in our model, protection of geographical indications increases and mandatory traceability decreases welfare and incentives to provide quality without taking into account direct implementation costs.","Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Saak, AE (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,"Saak, Alexander/0000-0002-7564-8317",,,,,48,19,21,3,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The importance of authors from North America has fallen since the mid-1990s, and authors from Former Soviet Union countries have not made a large contribution to the literature. A group of roughly 10 authors plays a central role in the literature on agricultural transition, which has become increasingly method-driven and less descriptive or issue-driven over time.

Based on a principal agent framework, in the presence of factor market constraints, as well as capital market failure, efficiently operated cotton parastatals increase sector welfare and efficiency by providing input credits. In equilibrium, outcomes with the principal agent model suggest growers receive the reservation income to participate in cotton production while the principal (cotton company) extracts the surplus above the reservation income. Competitive markets entail more equitable distribution of benefits than with parastatal vertical integration, but credit and factor market constraints can still persist. Promotion of a competitive market system will not support cotton productivity growth unless stakeholders pursue complementary programs to develop credit markets and research and extension institutions. In the presence of current market failures, parastatals may be a second-best solution.","[Tumusiime, Emmanuel] Oxfam Amer, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Brorsen, B.

If this rapid growth continues and is strongest in resource-poor Asian economies, the growth in global demand for imports of primary products also will continue, to the ongoing benefit of natural resource-rich countries. This paper explores how global production, consumption and trade patterns might change over the next two decades in the course of economic development and structural changes under various scenarios. We employ the GTAP model and version 8.1 of the GTAP database with a base year of 2007, along with supplementary data from a range of sources, to support projections of the global economy to 2030. We first project a baseline assuming that trade-related policies do not change in each region but that factor endowments and real GDP grow at exogenously estimated rates. That baseline is compared with two alternative scenarios: one in which the growth rates of China and India are lower by one-quarter and the other in which this slowdown in emerging economies leads to slower productivity growth in the primary sectors of all countries. Throughout the results, implications are drawn out for natural resource-abundant economies, including Australia and New Zealand.","[Anderson, Kym; Strutt, Anna] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Strutt, Anna] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Adelaide; Australian National University; University of Waikato,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352; Strutt, Anna/0000-0003-1776-2231",Asian Development Bank; Australian Research Council; Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation; Waikato Management School,Asian Development Bank; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation; Waikato Management School,"The authors are grateful for helpful referee comments and interactions with Tom Hertel, Terrie Walmsley, Dominique van der Mensbrugghe, Fan Zhai, Rob McDougall, along with participants at the 15th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, Geneva, 27-29 June 2012.

While traditional economic theory suggests that farmland values are determined by the discounted stream of expected returns, previous research has shown that agricultural land values are actually driven by a complex set of factors. This study leverages the unique characteristics of a national land-based USDA survey on farmland values and cash rents to estimate broad, national-level determinants of the market value of cropland and pastureland. Our results support past research findings that indicate farmland values are only partially explained by agricultural returns.

The optimal IRY ranges from year 5 to year 9 as a function of cocoa prices, fertilizer prices, labor prices, and percentage yield loss due to disease outbreaks. Deterministic results project economic gains that exceed currently practiced replacement approaches by 5.57%-14.67% across production systems with reduced, annual income volatility.

Using data from the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, we model the behaviour of the German hog-feed price ratio. A dynamic unobservable time series model which incorporates both a stochastic trend and a stochastic cycle is developed and applied to these data. We find a significant four-year cycle and provide evidence that it is becoming more volatile.","[Parker, Phillip S.] Univ Giessen, Inst Farm & Agribusiness Management, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Shonkwiler, J.

Many economic growth strategies focus on specific interventions (trade openness index, tropical climatic variables, working age population share etc.), but many factors, such as food availability, female education and health outcomes, can potentially have a profound influence on economic growth. To explore this hypothesis more systematically, this paper employs a rich cross-country dataset of 124 countries to examine the impact of food security, using food availability as a proxy on economic growth. This paper examines the impact of food shortages on African economic growth rates. It does so by extending the Barro growth model to include food availability as a right hand-side variable and by distinguishing African countries with food shortages from others. Based on the cross-country regressions results, the paper concludes that the improved food availability indeed contributes to the improved economic growth in general, as well as in Africa.","[Agboola, Mary Oluwatoyin; Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Gazimagusa, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Agboola, MO (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Gazimagusa, Turkey.",agboola.oluwatoyin@emu.edu.tr,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196",,,,,27,2,2,1,16,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

It incorporates the systems of animal-crop production and waste treatment is developed for a pilot pig farm in China in order to simulate the economic and environmental effects of several nutrient budgeting strategies in excreta treatment for resource use. Findings - The results reveal nutrient management deficiencies cause some serious environmental problems. The operations including biogas and composting are economically and environmentally efficient methods for manure management through nutrient budgeting strategy in an intensive animal farming with limited access to cropland. The nutrient budgeting strategy of constrained phosphorus, however, creates better environmental effects and brings more income from the waste treatment than the strategy of constrained nitrogen. The current standard of manure application in cropland which emphasizes on crop requirements for nitrogen should be reconsidered. Originality/value - The paper is an original work and its methodology makes a meaningful contribution to understanding the relations between different nutrient budgeting strategies and their economic and environmental effects.","[Ma, Yongxi] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yongxi; Lu, Wencong] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Bergmann, Holger] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Zhejiang University; University of Gottingen,"Lu, WC (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",Wencl@zju.edu.cn,,,"International Cooperation Project of China Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST: 2009DFA32710, BMBF (FKZ): 0330847F]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [Y13G030168]",International Cooperation Project of China Ministry of Science and Technology; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"The authors would like to show gratitude to the International Cooperation Project of China Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST: 2009DFA32710, BMBF (FKZ): 0330847F) and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Y13G030168) for their funding support to this research work.",,63,7,8,1,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This study examines the economic and epidemiological consequences of various MAP control options in the context of controlling JD in dairy herds. A discrete optimal control model is developed utilizing the disease-specific animal compartment model and maximizing the net present value of a dairy operation. The results identify the optimal control option together with the associated herd dynamics and optimal culling rates of cows in different infection states.

Farmers who live about 10 km from the distribution center face per unit transaction and transportation costs as high as the costs needed to bring the fertilizer from the international port to the input distribution center (about 1,000 km).

To inform debates related to this rationale for input subsidies, this study estimates the effects of fertilizer subsidies on retail maize prices in Malawi and Zambia using market or district-level panel data covering the 2000-2001 to 2011-2012 maize marketing years. Results indicate that roughly doubling the size of Malawi's subsidy program reduces maize prices by 1.2-2.5% on average. In Zambia, roughly doubling the scale of the country's subsidy program reduces maize prices by 1.8-2.8% on average. The results are robust across countries and model specifications, and indicate that the fertilizer subsidy programs in Malawi and Zambia have had a minimal effect on retail maize prices.","[Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Mason, Nicole M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Darko, Francis A.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Tembo, Solomon T.] Indaba Agr Policy Res Inst, Lusaka, Zambia",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Michigan State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Ricker-Gilbert, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jrickerg@purdue.edu,,"Mason, Nicole/0000-0001-6835-7098",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; United States Agency for International Development Mission in Zambia,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); United States Agency for International Development Mission in Zambia(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The authors acknowledge support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa Program, and from the United States Agency for International Development Mission in Zambia.

Past research has employed Cournot models, but we use an auction model, which more closely resembles the actual cattle procurement process. We find that feeders benefit from the MPRA regardless of whether price uncertainty decreases for packers and/or feeders. If the packers' price uncertainty is reduced, the feeder benefits from an increase in competition between the packers.

Here we investigate whether the state-contingent approach offers a tractable framework for representing climatic uncertainty at a farm level. We developed a discrete stochastic programming (DSP) model of a representative wheat-sheep (mixed) farm in the Central West of NSW. More explicit recognition of climatic states, and associated state-contingent responses, led to optimal farm plans that were more profitable on average and less prone to the effects of variations in climate than comparable farm plans based on the expected value framework. The solutions from the DSP model also appeared to more closely resemble farm land use than the equivalent expected value model using the same data. We conclude that there are benefits of adopting a state-contingent view of uncertainty, giving support to its more widespread application to other problems.","[Crean, Jason] NSW Trade & Investment, Orange, NSW, Australia; [Parton, Kevin] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Management & Mkt, Orange, NSW, Australia; [Mullen, John] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Orange, NSW, Australia; [Jones, Randall] Asian Dev Bank, Environm Nat Resources & Agr Div, Cent West Asia Dept, Mandaluyong City, Philippines",NSW Department of Primary Industries; Charles Sturt University; Charles Sturt University; Asian Development Bank,"Crean, J (通讯作者)，NSW Trade & Investment, Orange, NSW, Australia.",jason.crean@industry.nsw.gov.au,"Parton, Kevin/Q-7695-2019","Parton, Kevin/0000-0003-3378-799X",,,,,29,14,15,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Yet most dual economy models focus on the sectoral rather than spatial dimensions of development. This article adopts a dual-dual approach to measuring rural/urban and farm/nonfarm linkages. We develop an economy-wide model of Ethiopia that distinguishes between cities, towns, and rural areas. The model captures detailed sectoral and regional linkages, internal migration flows, and externalities from urban agglomeration. We find larger linkages between agricultural production and small towns and show that redirecting urban growth toward towns rather than cities leads to broader-based economic growth and poverty reduction. In contrast, industry and services, particularly within cities, are far less effective in reaching rural areas and the poor. Africa's current urbanization patterntoward major cities rather than townswill weaken national growth-poverty linkages. Urbanization that takes advantage of the synergistic relationship between agriculture and small towns has the potential to result in a more inclusive growth trajectory.","[Dorosh, Paul] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Thurlow, James] United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Dorosh, P (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",P.Dorosh@cgiar.org,"Thurlow, James/JQW-4545-2023","Thurlow, James/0000-0003-3414-374X; Dorosh, Paul/0000-0001-6049-6018",,,,,35,23,27,3,68,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We examine whether fertilizer use is profitable under current smallholder production conditions, whether risk-related factors affect fertilizer use, and we estimate the returns to inputs in the agricultural production function in the absence of insurance. We then study how these primitives of agricultural production functions relate to insurance demand. The study compares a survey-based estimate of willingness to pay with actual uptake for the weather insurance, finding the stated and actual demand to be almost completely uncorrelated. While those with high marginal returns to inputs say they would purchase insurance, only those with low marginal returns actually do, consistent with the stated purpose of the product as input insurance.

Within a two-sector model, agricultural decline is explained by three basic driving forces (relative price change, Rybczynski effect, and technological gap). In a dynamic (vector autoregression) specification the share of agriculture on gross domestic product the agricultural relative price and the capital intensity are simultaneously determined. The model allows for short-run adjustments with respect to long-run equilibrium and for cross-sectional dependence taking into account interregional linkages. The approach is applied to the panel data set of 20 Italian regions over the period 1951-2002 of intense economic development but still persistent regional disparities. Regularities and differences of decline patterns across regions are investigated. Le present article examine les causes du declin a long terme de lagriculture en periode de croissance economique.

We claim that due to congestion and agglomeration externalities in the rural accommodation market, public support should be integrated into a broader local development policy that regulates the number of accommodation units in one locality. To demonstrate this, we extended an equilibrium model that accounts for product differentiation and oligopolistic competition to address congestion and agglomeration effects, and applied it to data collected in northern Israel. We show that, under the prevailing policy measures, the number of accommodation units can exceed the optimal one, leading to loss of welfare.","[Tchetchik, Anat] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, Dept Hotel & Tourism Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Fleischer, Aliza; Finlkeshtain, Israel] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Tchetchik, A (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, Dept Hotel & Tourism Management, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",anat@som.bgu.ac.il,"; Fleischer, Aliza/J-7900-2016","Tchetchik, Anat/0000-0002-4965-5417; Fleischer, Aliza/0000-0002-6575-4052",Israeli Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development; Center for Agricultural Economics Research; Israeli section of the Regional Science Association International,Israeli Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development; Center for Agricultural Economics Research; Israeli section of the Regional Science Association International,The work leading to this paper was funded by the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development Chief-Scientist fund and by The Center for Agricultural Economics Research.

This has recently been played out with the acrimonious debate that circumscribed the release of the Guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. In this paper, we argue that too much emphasis has been placed on the volume of held water as an indicator of environmental benefit. We also contend that there is an attendant presumption of linearity in the relationship between volumes of held water and environmental benefit which could lead to perverse outcomes. A second problem is that there is too much enthusiasm for contemplating the solutions to water management problems as residing primarily at the federal level of government. These factors stand to ultimately limit the efficient delivery of environmental objectives.","[Crase, Lin] La Trobe Univ, Ctr Water Policy & Management, Wodonga, Vic, Australia; [O'Keefe, Suzanne] La Trobe Univ, Reg Sch Business, Wodonga, Vic, Australia; [Dollery, Brian] Univ New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia",La Trobe University; La Trobe University; University of New England,"Crase, L (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Ctr Water Policy & Management, Albury Wodonga Campus, Wodonga, Vic, Australia.",l.crase@latrobe.edu.au,"Crase, Lin/L-2072-2016","Crase, Lin/0000-0002-3615-7152; Dollery, Brian/0000-0003-2760-865X",,,,,23,9,9,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The U.S. module tracks regional timber markets, timber harvests by species group, and timber product outputs in greater detail than does the global model. This hybrid approach provides detailed regional market analysis for the United States although retaining the broader global market analysis. We describe how the U.S. Forest Products Module is structured within the global model and show projections based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios with long-range assumptions about economic activity, population growth, and wood energy demands. Results show that real prices for industrial roundwood would increase as a result of significant global expansion in wood energy demands. Expansion of global wood energy demands would influence the comparative economic advantages of U.S. versus foreign producers, with U.S. producers gaining some comparative advantages and increased net exports in scenarios where average foreign industrial roundwood prices are projected to increase more than in the United States. These results suggest that national wood energy policies should consider how the impacts of wood energy use on domestic forest product markets depend on trends in global forest product markets.","[Ince, Peter J.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Forest Prod Lab, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Kramp, Andrew] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Off Forest Prod Lab, Madison, WI 53726 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Ince, PJ (通讯作者)，US Forest Serv, USDA, Forest Prod Lab, 1 Gifford Pinchot Dr, Madison, WI 53726 USA.",pince@fs.fed.us; akramp@fs.fed.us; kskog@fs.fed.us,,,,,,,13,14,15,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

This article uses a sample from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, collected from 2001 to 2003, to examine how long-term instability in employment affects the association between employment transitions and the decision to enter and exit SNAP. Empirical models of program entry and exit are estimated for a full sample and for family subgroups of particular interest to program policy-makers.

In stated preference settings, researchers have used elicitation formats with multiple bids and uncertain-response options to learn about individual value distributions. Past efforts have focused on inference involving the expectation of individual densities. This requires stringent and likely unrealistic assumptions regarding the shape or moments of individual value distributions. We propose a Latent Thresholds Estimator that focuses instead on the range, i.e. minimum and maximum willingness-to-pay of individual respondents.

The research aims to reveal the rational addiction evidence of carbonated soft drinks and derive policy implications under this evidence. Consumers' rational addictive evidence for carbonated soft drinks provides a warning for the Chinese government to regulate the industry, due to its bad health consequences. Design/methodology/approach - The authors empirically apply a time-varying parameter model and scanner data set from 46 US cities. Findings - Empirical results provide strong evidence that carbonated soft drinks are rationally addictive, thus opening the door to taxation and regulation. Taking rational addition into account, estimated demand elasticities are much lower than previous estimates using scanner data, which implies a limited role for taxes to curb consumption but a strong role to raise revenue to fund health promotion programs. Originality/value - This is the first study to test the rational addiction nature of carbonated soft drinks, thus adding to the scarce economic literature on food addiction. Although the empirical results derived are based on soft drink consumption in the USA, China is experiencing a similar consumption increase in carbonated soft drinks as in the USA, in the examined period. Therefore, the lessons from the USA are also valuable for the public policy makers in China.","[Liu, Xiaoou] Renmin Univ, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lopez, Rigoberto] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA",Renmin University of China; University of Connecticut,"Liu, XO (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xiaoou2010@gmail.com,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [2011030120]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71103188],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The research is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China 2011030120, and National Natural Science Foundation of China (project number 71103188).",,33,2,6,5,45,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We focus on the policy intervention aimed at achieving a closer coordination among the chain agents and consider the relation between the policy and the spontaneous processes undertaken by the agents. A framework based on four dimensions (state of alignment, enforcement procedures, responsibility and stability) is proposed. This framework supports the hypothesis that the effectiveness of the policy intervention depends on the possibilities of the existence of hybrid governance structures. We analyze the agents' attitudes toward integration and propose two case studies on two integration projects carried out in Central Italy. The results of our study corroborate the hypothesis and suggest that integration entails many supply chain management components. However, our findings suggest that the policy intervention may face limits due to the processes undertaken by the agents.","[Martino, Gaetano; Pampanini, Rossella; Morbidelli, Francesca] Univ Perugia, Dept Agr Econ & Food Sci, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Martino, G (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Agr Econ & Food Sci, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",martinog@unipg.it; rpampa@unipg.it; morbidelli@libero.it,"Martino, Gaetano/AAA-3664-2021","Martino, Gaetano/0000-0001-6827-3185",,,,,48,1,1,0,27,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

An analysis of the possible causes of the situation shows that most of the reasons that are usually put forward are unfounded and fail to provide a satisfactory explanation for the aforementioned state of affairs. Based on a large set of different statistical data, the paper argues that the stagnation of the tourism sector in the Czech Republic in terms of its capacity to contribute to the GDP, gross value added and to state tax revenues is due to other factors. The Czech currency exchange rate to the euro and the US dollar is only on in a series of factors and, more importantly, it does not have a fundamental impact. The stagnation of the sector within the Czech domestic economy is attributable rather to a reduction of tourism activities of the residents. The drop or stagnation of tax revenues from the industry was related more to the increased share of shadow economy in the sector than to other factors.","[Smrcka, Lubos; Schonfeld, Jaroslav] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",,"Smrcka, L (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",smrckal@vse.cz; Jaroslav.schonfeld@vse.cz,,"Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171",,,,,7,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-652-9,,,,2012,,,,,,,267,272,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics,BG8OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392530500037,0

We argue that coffee is grown under conditions that might well subject growers to the market power of downstream intermediaries (processors). Using an approach designed to evaluate the effects of state trading enterprises on trade and welfare, we develop an oligopsony model of intermediaries. In this model, fair-trade processors optimise a welfare function that includes the producer surplus of coffee growers. This concern for growers' welfare among some processing firms helps to alleviate the market power distortion. We calibrate the model to price data reported by a fair-trade organisation and consider the counterfactual removal of fair-trade behaviour by processors. As expected, the income of coffee growers (in aggregate) is reduced, though the effects are quite small.","[Piyapromdee, Suphanit] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hillberry, Russell] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [MacLaren, Donald] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; The World Bank; University of Melbourne,"MacLaren, D (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",d.maclaren@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,18,11,13,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

A unique panel data set allows us to put the effects of recent events in the context of long-run trends in income and poverty. We use data from a nationally representative longitudinal survey of rural households in Bangladesh collected in four waves in 1988, 2000, 2004, and 2008. Nargis and Hossain (Nargis, N., Hossain, M., 2006. Income dynamics and pathways out of rural poverty in Bangladesh, 1988-2004. Agric. Econ. 35, 425-435) analysed income dynamics and poverty incidence for the first three waves, finding a declining trend in both the incidence and severity of poverty, aided in particular by human capital development and off-farm employment opportunities. We update and extend the analysis to include data collected in 2008, at the height of a spike in agricultural prices. We find that the price of a balanced food basket increased by more than 50% during 2000-2008, while household income rose only 15%. As a result the incidence and severity of rural poverty in Bangladesh sunk to pre-2000 levels during 2004-2008. Thus, the price spikes in 2007-2008 helped push an additional 13 million people into poverty in rural Bangladesh. Moreover, we find that the determinants of poverty have not been time-invariant. In particular, agricultural production, which had previously been associated with a higher incidence of poverty, served as a hedge against higher food prices during 2004-2008.","[Balagtas, Joseph V.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Bhandari, Humnath] Int Rice Res Inst, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh; [Cabrera, Ellanie R.; Mohanty, Samarendu] DAPO, Int Rice Res Inst, Social Sci Div, Manila 1301, Philippines; [Hossain, Mahabub] BRAC, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee BRAC,"Balagtas, JV (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",balagtas@purdue.edu,"Bhandari, Humnath/AAA-3301-2021; Balagtas, Joseph/IVV-7427-2023; Balagtas, Joseph/AAL-4244-2021",,,,,,21,22,22,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - In order to identify Korean consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for domestic, Chinese, and US rice, the non-hypothetical experimental auction approach (i.e. the random nth price auction) was utilized. Auction participants were randomly assigned to three treatments: no labelling information, country of origin labelling information, and food miles labelling information to analyze the effects of differing labelling information on consumers' valuation. Findings - The results suggest that Korean consumers have a positive perception of and preference for domestic rice, particularly when country of origin information is provided. However, food miles information alone may not help consumers to distinguish between domestic and Chinese rice. Originality/value - The marketing of imported rice will increase since Korea will be opening its rice market under tariffication after 2015. Therefore, it is necessary for Korea and other exporting countries to identify the feasibility of marketing both domestic and imported rice, and also to investigate which rice from specific countries Korean consumers prefer. Therefore, the authors conducted the random nth price auction using real rice products and cash in transactions.","[Lee, Ji Yong] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Han, Doo Bong; Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Yoon, Jong Min] Korea Rural Econ Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Kansas State University; Korea University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Han, DB (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",han@korea.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2011-330-B00074]; Korea University,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); Korea University,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea-Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2011-330-B00074) and supported by Korea University Grant.,,23,15,16,0,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Recent economic literature helps understand the current negotiation game. New economic and political conditions, in particular the gaining influence of emerging countries, make a multilateral agreement more difficult. Developed countries have given up many of their bargaining chips in previous rounds of negotiation and their remaining agricultural tariffs are not sufficient for extracting the concessions from emerging countries on services, procurement, and intellectual property that would make an agreement possible. The risk of a more fragmented world calls for a revised negotiation agenda and a change in the status of developing countries. Research issues are outlined in order to help revitalize the Doha negotiation agenda.","[Bureau, Jean-Christophe] AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ AgroParisTech INRA, F-75005 Paris, France; [Jean, Sebastien] INRA, UMR Econ Publ AgroParisTech INRA, F-75005 Paris, France",AgroParisTech; INRAE; INRAE; AgroParisTech,"Bureau, JC (通讯作者)，AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ AgroParisTech INRA, 16 Rue Claude Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.",jc.bureau@agroparistech.fr,,"Jean, Sebastien/0000-0003-1895-0955","FOODSECURE project, 7th Framework Research program of the European Commission","FOODSECURE project, 7th Framework Research program of the European Commission(European Union (EU))","The authors thank Antoine Bouet, Christophe Gouel, and the participants of 28th IAAE Conference in Foz do Iguacu, Brazil, August 18-24, 2012 for comments on an earlier version.

Low-income regions such as sub-Saharan Africa are highly dependent on imported fertilizer, and the landed price of imports at the port of entry usually represents a large fraction of the fertilizer supply costs in these regions. This article formally examines the relationship between market concentration and prices from a global perspective. We follow a dynamic panel approach using annual data on urea for a panel of countries and observe that prices are generally higher in more concentrated markets using different measures of concentration and model specifications. Based on additional simulations, we find that a 10% increase in competition could increase fertilizer use by 13-19% and rural incomes by 1-2% in regions like sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, the results highlight the need to further examine the pricing behavior and potential market power exertion of major global producers, which can help to better understand the industry supply chain in developing countries and provide additional insights into the design of policies, including input subsidy programs, intended to promote long-term fertilizer adoption.","[Hernandez, Manuel A.; Torero, Maximo] IFPRI, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Hernandez, MA (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC USA.",m.a.hernandez@cgiar.org,,"Torero, Maximo/0000-0002-4863-3371",,,,,33,26,30,2,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

To assess this, three export development scenarios (low, medium and high risk) are constructed for 17 iron ore mines (over 27 production expansion projects) in West and Central Africa. The projections for African iron ore are compared with the latest medium-term import forecasts and suggest that the development of West and Central African iron ore has the potential to create significant downward pressure on the price of iron ore exports over the medium term. The increased export capacity could push marginal producers - mainly in China but also in India and elsewhere - out of the market.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Acton, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Hurst, L (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Acton, ACT, Australia.",luke.hurst@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,26,7,7,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Within this framework the tendency to postpone exit and termination choices can be rationalised. The validity of the real options theory is assessed by means of economic experiments. Our results show that real options models can predict actual disinvestment decisions better than traditional investment theory. Nevertheless, the reluctance to disinvest observed in the experiments was even more pronounced than that predicted by the theory. This finding suggests that non-monetary aspects such as emotions, attachment to farming and different facets of psychological inertia should be incorporated into disinvestment models.","[Musshoff, Oliver; Maart-Noelck, Syster Christin] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Odening, Martin; Schade, Christian] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Sandri, Serena] German Jordanian Univ, Amman, Jordan",University of Gottingen; Humboldt University of Berlin; German-Jordanian University,"Maart-Noelck, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",syster.maart@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021; Odening, Martin/AAV-9918-2020; Jiang, Ming/A-9840-2008","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Jiang, Ming/0000-0002-1661-0538; Odening, Martin/0000-0001-6427-1641; Schade, Christian D./0000-0001-6879-4976",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),We gratefully acknowledge financial support from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

We use an instrumental variable approach to control for the endogeneity of participation in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). On an average school day, school lunch participants consume more fruits and vegetables, including relatively more at school and less away from school compared to nonparticipants. Meal policies had little effect on NSLP participation itself.

Design/methodology/approach - Data from a survey held in 2008 and 2010 among 259 households in Minle County, Gansu province, covering the years 2007 and 2009, are used to estimate the factors affecting land levelling investments, irrigation canal investments and perceived land tenure security. The authors use the 2SCMIL technique and the IVLS method to estimate a selection model and a non-limited regression model, respectively, and use WP methods to examine the robustness of the results. Findings - The authors' results indicate that perceived land tenure security significantly affects self-governed investments but does not affect individual investments in land quality improvements. In particular, the authors find that households that consider land certificates as important for protecting land rights invest significantly more in irrigation canals construction and maintenance. The authors' results further provide evidence that individual investments in land quality improvement contribute to higher perceived land tenure security. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the available literature on the relationship between land tenure security and land investments by examining the role of perceived (instead of formal) land tenure security and by making a distinction between individual household investments and self-governed land investments. The authors' results provide an explanation for the phenomenon that land readjustments still take place in some parts of China, but not in others.","[Ma, Xianlei; Heerink, Nico; Shi, Xiaoping] Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Land Policy Res, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xianlei; Heerink, Nico; Shi, Xiaoping] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xianlei; Heerink, Nico; van Ierland, Ekko; van den Berg, Marrit] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Heerink, Nico] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University; Wageningen University & Research; Zhejiang University,"Shi, XP (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Land Policy Res, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiaopings1@gmail.com,"Heerink, Nico/AAA-2045-2020","Heerink, Nico/0000-0002-9911-3501","Programme Strategic Scientific Alliances of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW); Ministry of Science and Technologies of P.R.

The health impacts from mining-related pollutants are now well documented. This includes published research being discussed in an editorial of the Medical Journal of Australia (see Munksgaard 2010). On the other hand, negative impacts on property prices, although mentioned, have not been examined to date. This study rectifies this research gap. This study uses a hedonic property price approach to examine the impact of mining- and smelting-related pollution on nearby property prices. The hypothesis is that those properties closer to the lead and copper smelters have lower property (house) prices than those farther away. The results of the study show that the marginal willingness to pay to be farther from the pollution source is AUS $13 947 per kilometre within the 4 km radius selected. The study has several policy implications, which are discussed briefly. We used ordinary least squares, geographically weighted regression, spatial error and spatial autoregressive or spatial lag models for this analysis.","[Neelawala, Prasad; Wilson, Clevo; Athukorala, Wasantha] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Neelawala, P (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",clevo.wilson@qut.edu.au,"Athukorala, Wasantha/CAJ-5658-2022; Athukorala, Wasantha/ABC-6674-2021","Athukorala, Wasantha/0000-0003-3757-4780; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495",,,,,63,13,16,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Income sources and welfare outcomes are compared across strategies and household differences in asset holdings are analyzed using multinomial logit regression. Findings reveal that income diversification is the norm, that a higher degree of specialization does not characterize more remunerative livelihood strategies, that nonfarm income significantly contributes to higher income earnings, that environmental reliance does not vary across strategies, and that small-scale farmers are the largest and poorest livelihood group. Some livelihood strategies are superior to all other strategies in terms of income earned; access to more remunerative livelihood strategies is determined by land ownership, education, and ethnic affiliation. Finally, the article also highlights that additional work is required to determine the most suitable methods for livelihood strategy identification.","[Nielsen, Oystein Juul; Meilby, Henrik; Smith-Hall, Carsten] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Rayamajhi, Santosh] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Forestry, Pokhara, Nepal; [Uberhuaga, Patricia] Univ Mayor San Simon, Forest Sci Sch, Zona Temporal, Cochabamba, Bolivia",University of Copenhagen; Tribhuvan University; Institute of Forestry (IOF) - Nepal; Universidad Mayor de San Simon,"Nielsen, OJ (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",ojn@life.ku.dk,"Smith-Hall, Carsten/L-6015-2018; Meilby, Henrik/E-1404-2015","Smith-Hall, Carsten/0000-0003-3908-3002; Meilby, Henrik/0000-0002-3770-3880","Danish Ministry of Foreign Affair's Council for Development Research (FFU) [104.Dan.8.L.716, 104.DAN.8.L.714, 104.DAN.8-903]",Danish Ministry of Foreign Affair's Council for Development Research (FFU),"Financial support was received from the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affair's Council for Development Research (FFU) through grant nos. 104.Dan.8.L.716, 104.DAN.8.L.714, and 104.DAN.8-903.

This methodology enables the analysts to consider time as a proxy for not measurable effects on growth. The likelihood of a farm's moving from a nongrowth episode into a growth episode is estimated and the impact of various covariates on that likelihood is assessed. The analysis is based upon a balanced panel of annual farm accounts from 616 specialized dairy farms in Germany, covering the financial years 1995/19962008/2009. The results from event history analyses are presented for low and high growth rates. For both groups, it was found that the probability of entering a growth episode, defined as the event to be analyzed, increases over time, e.g., as a consequence of an increasing need to improve competitiveness. Moreover, several covariates, such as the share of subsidies in returns, farmer's age, and milk price, had a significant impact on growth in a farm's milk production. The analysis revealed, however, that the effect-direction of some explanatory variables differed between the two groups.","[Francksen, Tammo; Hagemann, Martin; Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Hagemann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",martin.hagemann@ae.uni-kiel.de,,"Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe/0000-0002-9936-2460",Research Project Pro-Milch under the Kompetenzzentrum Milch Schleswig-Holstein at the University of Kiel [7.2],Research Project Pro-Milch under the Kompetenzzentrum Milch Schleswig-Holstein at the University of Kiel,The authors wish to acknowledge the help provided by Land-data GmbH and ACT GmbH for making available the data used in this study.

This article evaluates impacts based on a test-market experiment in Tasmania. We use a difference-in-differences econometric methodology to quantify the programme-induced shifts in demand, and we use the resulting estimates in a supply and demand modelling framework to quantify the effects of promotion-induced demand shifts on prices, quantities, and measures of economic well-being. We estimate a conservative benefitcost ratio for Tasmanian producers of 7.6:1 if they were to bear the entire cost and 11.4:1 if the programme were financed by a levy on production (or spawn).

We use the double hurdle and Heckman models, which allow us to demonstrate that a number of variables has different effects on participation and income from nonfarm activities. For example, residing in remote areas and lack of capital are found to stimulate participation in nonfarm activities, but decrease nonfarm income. Results are robust, but using the Heckman model seems to produce more accurate results for returns to education and gender under the presence of selection bias. Overall, nonfarm activities are found to be most important for the poor, who are pushed out of agriculture due to limited and poor land resources. This indicates that equipping poor households to enable them to move towards better remunerative nonfarm activities should be a priority for Kyrgyz rural policy makers.","[Atamanov, Aziz] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Van den Berg, Marrit] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Wageningen University & Research,"Atamanov, A (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands.",azizatamanov@hotmail.com,,"Van den Berg, Marrit/0000-0001-5369-8850",,,,,30,17,18,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

However, concerns for other citizens may dampen the political importance of the elderly. Fixed effects regressions on municipality-level panel data for 1999-2007 suggest that LTC generosity slightly decreases in response to an aging population.

We do this via a 'self selection of complexity' design in which respondents choose whether to face choice sets comprising 3, 4 or 6 alternatives. We link this approach with the emerging Excessive Choice Effect (ECE) literature. We find that 30% of the sample opt for the largest sets. We test whether this choice of complexity reveals information about respondents' capability/commitment. We find that it does since those with lowest initial error variance levels are most likely to later select the highest level of task complexity. We argue that this result offers insights regarding the design of more cognitively efficient DCE designs. We consider the matching of respondents to the appropriate level of task complexity as analogous to the principal-agent problem with asymmetric information. Rather than trying to understand respondents' cognitive capability or commitment ex ante we propose that participants self-select designs that achieve the researcher's objective of minimizing error variance.","[Burton, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Rigby, Dan] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Western Australia; University of Manchester,"Burton, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",michael.burton@uwa.edu.au; dan.rigby@manchester.ac.uk,"Rigby, Dan/A-9606-2009; burton, michael/A-9541-2009","rigby, dan/0000-0003-0820-5740; burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093",CSIRO,CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),Funding from the CSIRO Flagship Collaboration Fund is gratefully acknowledged as is the input of Jo Pluske and Phil Vercoe in the execution of the project.

This study considers agent heterogeneity explicitly in the evaluation of policies for nonpoint pollution control through the integration of decomposition and calibration procedures for programming models. The application concerns the regulation of nitrate leaching from intensive dairy production in the Waikato region of New Zealand. Failing to represent firm heterogeneity leads to widely different estimates of mitigation costs, relative to where heterogeneity is considered. Variation in baseline emissions and the slopes of abatement cost curves between firms renders a differentiated policy less costly than a uniform standard. However, the relative values of these policies are not broadly different, as firms required to do the most abatement intensive farms with large baseline pollutant loads can do so more cheaply, on average.","[Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Western Australia; University of Waikato,"Doole, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, WA, Australia.",gdoole@waikato.ac.nz,"Pannell, David/B-4476-2008","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491",,,,,30,16,18,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Most analysts consider storage to function as a price stabilizer, while others place it at the core of an explanation of intriguing features of commodity price series, such as skewed distributions. Most studies have been developed in the context of the theory of competitive storage where random shocks affect supply or demand. Recently, the endogenous chaotic behavior of markets has become another possible hypothesis regarding the origin of commodity price fluctuations. We develop a nonlinear cobweb model with intra- and interannual storage, risk averse agents, and adaptive expectations. Like the theory of competitive storage, this nonlinear cobweb model with storage can reproduce some of the stylized facts of agricultural commodity prices (autocorrelation of first rank, low kurtosis, and skewness). In addition, the effects of storage on price variation are mixed. In the presence of interannual storage, chaotic price series show less variation compared to a situation without interannual storage but we find that storage contributes to the endogenous volatility of prices by making chaotic dynamics more likely.","[Mitra, Sophie] Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Boussard, Jean-Marc] Acad Agr France, F-75006 Paris, France",Fordham University,"Mitra, S (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, 441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",mitra@fordham.edu,,"Mitra, Sophie/0000-0001-7283-6630",,,,,43,27,28,1,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Over the years, there has been a sharp increase not only to the volume, but also to the value of the traded agricultural products. The territorial structure of both exports and imports has narrowed to a decisive extent, primarily to the trade with the countries of the EU27. The commodity structure of agricultural trade has adapted very strongly both to the world and especially to the European market and it has furthermore reacted to the changes in the structure of the individual national markets. In the course of the years, the commodity structure has profiled so that there has been a limitation of aggregation with a strong comparative advantage on the market of the EU countries in relation to the aggregations that did not held this advantage. The analysis that has been performed indicates that the process of the accession to the EU has been reflected positively in the results of agricultural trade especially in the case of Poland. In the case of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the entry into the EU likewise has not led to a worsening of the results in the area of agricultural trade. Only in the case of Hungary, one does find serious structural problems after the entry into the EU in the case of agricultural trade. It can be assumed that these problems can be attributed for the most part to the Hungary's current economic problems.","[Svatos, Miroslav; Smutka, Lubos] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Svatos, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",svatos@pef.czu.cz; smutka@pef.czu.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Svatos, Miroslav/H-4459-2018","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Svatos, Miroslav/0000-0002-2831-287X","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 604070906, 6046070906]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Projects No. MSM 604070906).; This paper is a part of the research project carried out by the authors within the framework of the grant No. 6046070906, funded by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.",,36,18,18,1,31,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Beijing, one of the largest pork markets in urban China, was chosen and 400 consumers were randomly interviewed using questionnaires and finally a logistic model was employed to analyze consumers' willingness to pay for traceable pork. Findings - The authors found that consumers' perception of pork traceability system is subject to a comparatively low level. Purchasing of traceable pork is affected by gender, self-evaluation of health, awareness of the traceability system, concern about food safety, and the stochastic price willing to pay. Originality/value - The paper is the first to quantify Chinese consumers' valuation for traceable pork and it helps pork producers and marketers understand consumers' willingness to pay a small premium of 4.5 RMB/kg (0.7 USD) for traceable pork. This finding has imperative policy implications that could help the government deal with the high cost associated with the use of a pork traceability system.","[Wang, Zhigang] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Shi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Pei] Calif State Univ Fresno, Agr Business Dept, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Song, Shunfeng] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Song, Shunfeng] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; California State University System; California State University Fresno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Zhejiang University,"Wang, ZG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ohshigo@hotmail.com,,,,,,,47,19,21,6,64,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This paper looks at the historical justifications of the single desk authority of the CWB and reviews previous research examining its performance. In a simulation of price discrimination based on 2013 wheat markets, a possible premium of $7.60/metric tonne is generated assuming a price discriminating CWB. The implications of recent changes in the grain market are discussed, including the increasing area seeded to canola in Canada and the removal of the single desk for the Australian Wheat Board. While the model, as assumed, suggests the CWB's market power was increased by these changes, these gains are reliant on the model assumptions and are modest compared to the recent rise in grain prices and the potential for gains and losses observed in recent export basis variation.","Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Brewin, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, 353-66 Dafoe Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",derek_brewin@umanitoba.ca,"Brewin, Derek/ABB-1374-2020","Brewin, Derek/0000-0003-4514-5441",,,,,57,4,4,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

It is found that high (low) farmland prices relative to rents have historically preceded extended periods of low (high) net rates of return, rather than greater (smaller) growth in rents. Our analysis shows that this attribute is shared with stocks and housing, and the financial literature provides ample evidence that other assets feature it as well. The long-run relationship linking farmland prices, rents, and rates of return is analyzed. Based on this relationship, we conclude that recent trends are unlikely to be sustainable. The study explores the expected paths that farmland prices and rates of return might follow if they were to eventually conform to the average values observed in the historical sample, and concludes with a discussion of the policy implications. Recommendations for policy makers include close monitoring of farmland lending practices and institutions to allow early identification of potential problems, and identifying in advance appropriate interventions in case recent farmland market trends were to suddenly change.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Lence, SH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",shlence@iastate.edu,"Lence, Sergio/L-3587-2017","Lence, Sergio/0000-0002-8296-3200",,,,,41,13,17,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Many MFIs target women because more women than men are poor, especially in rural areas. Studies show that women manage money differently from men and have different leadership styles. Thus, in credit unions and financial firms, female and male managers achieve different results. In microfinance, gender diversity on the board of MFIs is beneficial, and loans authorized by female loan officers have lower default rates. Motivated by these findings, we ask whether MFIs with a female Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are more efficient at serving the poor without jeopardizing financial sustainability. We adapt the banking approach to managerial (in)efficiency to account for the outreach and sustainability goals of the MFIs, and evaluate whether MFIs' outreach efficiency differs by the gender of their respective CEOs. We estimate a stochastic frontier cost function using the Battese-Coelli (1995) model and the true random effects estimators using panel data from over 250 MFIs. We find that MFIs with female CEOs have significantly higher outreach efficiency than MFIs with male CEOs. Similar results are found with a two-step stochastic frontier approach. Overall, the results suggest that promoting gender diversity at the top levels of MFI management is likely to have both social and financial benefits.","[Hartarska, Valentina; Nadolnyak, Denis] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Mersland, Roy] Univ Adger, Kristiansand, Norway",Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Agder,"Hartarska, V (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",hartarska@auburn.edu,,"Mersland, Roy/0000-0002-6683-2737",,,,,74,34,37,6,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Additionally, the study applies a selectivity-based approach for the multinomial logit model to assess the relationship between DMSs and the financial performance of the business. Results suggest that both management and marketing skills significantly affect direct-to-consumer sales. Farmers choosing the strategy of sales only through direct-to-consumer outlets report earnings that are significantly lower than earnings from the other marketing strategies. Marketing skills prove to be beneficial to direct-to-consumer (DTC) earnings. Finally, the selectivity correction terms in the direct sales model are significantly negative in the choice of DTC, indicating the presence of sample selection effects. Accounting for selectivity is essential to ensure unbiased and consistent estimates.","[Park, Timothy] USDA, FED, ERS, Washington, DC 20520 USA; [Mishra, Ashok K.] Louisiana State Univ, Louisiana State Univ AgCtr, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Wozniak, Shawn J.] USAID Peru Alternat Dev, Lima 33, Peru",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Mishra, AK (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Louisiana State Univ AgCtr, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, 128 Martin D Woodin Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",amishra@lsu.edu,"Mishra, Ashok K./J-7228-2019","Mishra, Ashok K./0000-0002-0988-1428",Louisiana State University Experiment Station [LAB 94163],Louisiana State University Experiment Station,"We would like to thank two anonymous referees for useful comments, and appreciate the comments and advice of Sarah Low, Todd Kuethe and Stephen Vogel in developing the manuscript.

The results reveal a highly liquid corn market that mostly offers order execution at minimum cost. The BAS responds negatively to volume and positively to price volatility, but also affects volume traded and price volatility. While statistically significant, these responses on a cents/bushel or a percentage basis are generally small. Liquidity costs are also virtually impervious to short-term changes in demand for spreading and trend-following trader activity, as well as differences from day-of-the-week changes in market activity. Much larger cents/bushel and percentage changes in BAS occur during commodity index trader roll periods and on USDA report release days. The roll period findings indicate a sunshine trading effect, while announcement effects identify the importance of unexpected information and adverse selection on order execution costs. Overall, our research demonstrates that the transition to electronic trading in the corn futures market has led to low and stable liquidity costs, despite the market turbulence in 2008-2009.","[Wang, Xiaoyang; Garcia, Philip; Irwin, Scott H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Wang, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",wang150@illinois.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022; Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848",,,,,54,27,31,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Design/methodology/approach - Measuring is based on using the gravity trade model and econometric panel data analysis for the period 1998-2009. Findings - Agro-food exports from the BRIC countries, particularly Brazil and China, have increased. The Russian Federation has experienced stagnating and volatile patterns. Brazil and India have strengthened market shares in the existing importing markets, while the Russian Federation has experienced severe deterioration. The export of existing products is more important than of new products. Agro-food exports are positively associated with IQ and the size of the gross domestic product in exporting and importing countries, but negatively with distance. Research limitations/implications - Among IQ variables, the focus is on the indices of legal structure and security of property rights and freedom to trade internationally in agro-food importing countries and the BRIC exporting countries. Practical implications - Different institutions and their quality can affect agro-food exports differently. The impact of institutions is not uniform across product groups. Originality/value - This paper adds the impacts of IQ on agro-food exports. Except for processed products for final household consumption, agro-food exports from the BRIC countries are positively associated with the quality of the legal structure, the security of property rights and the freedom to trade internationally as IQ in exporting and importing countries.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia; [Ferto, Imre] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Fogarasi, Jozsef] Res Inst Agr Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Fogarasi, Jozsef] Partium Christian Univ, Fac Econ, Oradea, Romania",University of Primorska; Corvinus University Budapest; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si,"Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Fogarasi, József/ABD-8846-2021","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372; Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Fogarasi, Jozsef/0000-0001-7989-8375",COMPETE Project [312029]; European Community,COMPETE Project; European Community,"This publication was generated as part of the COMPETE Project, Grant Agreement No. 312029 (www.compete-project.eu/), with the financial support from the European Community under the Seventh Framework Programme.

In particular, it addresses two important questions: i) whether consumers are willing to pay a premium for food products carrying these claims; and ii) whether local and organic claims are complements or substitutes. A choice experiment designed to estimate two-way interactions was undertaken in Spain for eggs. The findings show first, that consumers are willing to pay a positive premium price for an enhanced method of production (that of barn, free-range and/or organic instead of cage produced eggs) as well as for the proximity of production (local, regional and national over imported). Second, the findings show that consumer preferences for the claims are heterogeneous with two consumer segments being identified: origin preference, the larger segment, and the production method preference. Results show that organic and local claims were complements for the larger first segment but that free-range and local/regional claims were substitutes for the second smaller segment. These results provide the marketing chains with insights applicable for pricing strategies.","[Gracia, Azucena; Lopez-Galan, Belinda] Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Unidad Econ Agr & Recursos Nat, Zaragoza, Spain; [Barreiro-Hurle, Jesus] FAO, Agr Dev Econ Div, I-00100 Rome, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Gracia, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Unidad Econ Agr & Recursos Nat, Zaragoza, Spain.",agracia@aragon.es,"López-Galán, Belinda/R-8483-2018; , Azucena/N-6263-2019; barreiro-hurle, jesus/A-7042-2008","López-Galán, Belinda/0000-0002-6347-2908; barreiro-hurle, jesus/0000-0002-6422-6047",,,,,62,97,108,3,98,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The authors then estimated the effects of demographic variables, labor migration, and other household characteristics on income growth using a dynamic panel data model. Findings - The study obtained important findings on income mobility and income inequality in rural China. First, annual income inequality in rural China was smoothed during this period after a decline from 2003, with the largest contribution from the income of migration work. Second, income mobility remained rather stable and relatively high, with higher mobility in the interior provinces than in the coastal provinces. Third, the income levels of the poor and the wealthy households converged during this period after controlling other factors. Fourth, income growth depends on in the households' demographic composition, their human capital accumulation, and their chances of getting migration jobs.

We look at the ability of these choice data to predict farming decisions for an in-person sample of 68 farmers. A coarse version of our risk preference measure has substantial explanatory power but in an unexpected direction: a farmer who was more risk averse under our measure was less likely to have diversified his operation and less likely to have a crop insurance contract. A fine version of our risk preference measure has essentially no explanatory power.

In this article we explore one of the major challenges that China is facing in the transition from middle to high income: the management of inequality. In particular, we explore the possible roots of future inequality that is associated with a nation's underinvestment in the human capital of broad segments of its population. To meet this goal, we describe two challenges that China faces in the light of rising wage rates and highly unequal income distribution today. We first discuss the structural and institutional barriers that are discouraging many students (and their parents) from staying in school to achieve the levels of learning that we believe are necessary for preparing individuals for employment in the coming decades. We also identify severe nutritional and health problems. We believe that these nutrition and health problems, unless addressed, will continue to create human capital deficiencies in poor areas of rural China and locking in decades of hard-to-address inequality.","[Zhang, Linxiu; Yi, Hongmei; Luo, Renfu; Liu, Changfang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, LICOS, Katholic Univ Leuven, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University","Yi, HM (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yihm.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023","Yi, Hongmei/0000-0002-6934-0498","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71110107028, 70903064, 71103171, 71033003]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZZD-EW-06]; Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research [2011RC102, 2012ZD008]; Stanford Center for International Development",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Stanford Center for International Development,"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial assistance of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71110107028, 70903064, 71103171, and 71033003), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KZZD-EW-06,) and its Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (2011RC102, 2012ZD008).

This provides novel insight into the cost-effective management of dual pollutants of water courses in Australia. A strong degree of complementarity between the two pollutants is highlighted, given the adsorption of phosphorus to sediment that augments the value of gully and streambank management for mitigation. However, the relationship between the two pollutants is asymmetric. A 30 per cent reduction in phosphorus yield achieves a 75 per cent reduction in sediment yield in one catchment, while a 30 per cent reduction in sediment yield achieves only a 12 per cent reduction in phosphorus yield. Sediment abatement costs are low given the efficiency of gully and streambank management. A 30 per cent phosphorus reduction lowers profit by 3-7 per cent, while a 30 per cent sediment reduction lowers profit by around 1 per cent. Land-use optimisation requires spatial heterogeneity in land-use and gully/streambank management responses. Overall, this research demonstrates the need to determine whether one pollutant is more important than another, while recognising the potential that mitigation practices possess for the reduction of multiple emissions during their evaluation.","[Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Roberts, Anna M.] Dept Primary Ind, Rutherglen, Vic, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Waikato,"Doole, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia.",gdoole@waikato.ac.nz,"Vigiak, Olga/ABA-4538-2021; Pannell, David/B-4476-2008","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Romera, Alvaro Jorge/0000-0001-5184-3364; Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491",,,,,15,16,17,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We do this by examining the determinants of willingness to pay for weather insurance among 1,400 Ethiopian households that have been tracked for 15 years as part of the Ethiopian Rural household Survey. This provides both historical and current information with which to assess the determinants of demand. We find that educated, wealthier individuals are more likely to purchase insurance. Risk aversion is associated with low insurance take-up suggesting that models of technology adoption can inform the purchase and spread of weather index insurance. We also assess how willingness to pay varied as two key characteristics of the contract were varied and found that basis risk reduces demand for insurance particularly when the price of the contract is high, and that provision of insurance through groups is preferred by female headed households and individuals with lower levels of education.","[Hill, Ruth Vargas; Hoddinott, John; Kumar, Neha] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Hill, RV (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",r.v.hill@cgiar.org,"Kumar, Neha/GSI-5286-2022",,,,,,45,89,102,4,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

However, many of the advances in BT recommended by researchers would be too costly to implement. This paper presents two choice experiment (CE) studies on marine areas in Sweden where respondents from local and distant populations were surveyed. BT for attributes relevant to the European Union's Water Framework Directive and the implementation of special consideration zones in marine areas were evaluated by equivalence tests. A comparison of the performance between a general BT model including only easily available socio-economic information and a statistically best-fitting model that requires the collection of more detailed information shows very similar results. Using a general model saves money and time since the information needed can be easily obtained from public databases and it does not lead to any significant reductions in accuracy or reliability. The issue of including socio-economic information in CE modeling for BT is important, since the model specification will determine the type of information that must be collected at the policy site; however, the results are inconclusive as to whether it improves BT or not.

Notwithstanding, there is a dearth of literature examining the relative trade restrictiveness of tariff barriers across a broad range of agro-food sectors. This represents an important research gap, which this study sets out to fill. Furthermore, this research reconciles the application of zero-inflated models with a sectorally disaggregated analysis. More specifically, employing a fully specified gravity equation, a Poisson estimator and variants of the Poisson model (Negative Binomial, Zero-Inflated Poisson, and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial) provide statistically significant and theoretically consistent estimates, while allowing for the inclusion of zero-trade values. A panel data model with fixed effects is also employed to improve the estimation of the parameters of interest. Estimation results reveal that in the vast majority of sectors examined, import tariffs are found to be statistically significant, whereas export refunds exhibit a statistically smaller role due to the nonsystematic nature of their application in world food markets. Model simulations of tariff barrier eliminations reveal limited trade gains, although there is encouraging evidence of low and lower middle per capita income country trade gains in wheat, red meat, dairy, sugar, and (particularly) rice markets.","[Philippidis, George] Govt Aragon, Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev ARAID, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Resano-Ezcaray, Helena] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Vet Sci, Dept Agr & Agr Econ, E-50013 Zaragoza, Spain; [Sanjuan-Lopez, Ana I.] Govt Aragon, Ctr Agrofood Res & Technol CITA, Dept Agrofood Econ & Nat Resources, Zaragoza 50059, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Sanjuán-López, AI (通讯作者)，Govt Aragon, Ctr Agrofood Res & Technol CITA, Dept Agrofood Econ & Nat Resources, Avda Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",aisanjuan@aragon.es,,"Resano Ezcaray, Maria Helena/0000-0002-4905-3694","Department of Environment, Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) of the United Kingdom; Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Agroalimentaria (INIA) [RTA 00107-00-00]","Department of Environment, Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) of the United Kingdom; Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Agroalimentaria (INIA)(Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA))","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Department of Environment, Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) of the United Kingdom and the Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Agroalimentaria (INIA) (project RTA 00107-00-00).

In the last decade, Hungary has been left behind by world trends as represented by the increasing share of the premium and super-premium wines (which utilise higher knowledge) in the export development. According to our survey, one cause of this might be the inappropriate use and management of knowledge and skills which is 'conditio sine qua non' for wine making. The Hungarian wine regions (usually with resource-based, fordist type resource endowment) are rather knowledge users. We have found (based on the PCA estimation) that two principal components cover 77% of the total variance: 'Size' and 'Innovation capabilities'. However, although the use and spread of skills is a basic component in explaining the differences of variation among the companies, it is not unambiguous in formulating the business success measured in different indicators. Because the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) have limited resources in capital accumulation and knowledge creation, they need to maintain living network connections in order to expand their constrained innovation capabilities. Instead of the 'closed' type of innovation and knowledge accumulation, they utilise the 'open' way of acquiring knowledge, where they necessarily share their specific information with their partners, but at the same time, they are supplied with new knowledge which might be vital for their own progress. The majority of the Hungarian vine- and wine makers are not open enough in the different phases of the innovation process. However, our analysis proves that if they showed up mutuality especially in knowledge sharing with their competitors, they could improve their positions significantly. We conclude that the Hungarian wine enterprises keeping the idea generation as well as its further development, elaboration and the adequate use within the frame of the company can achieve market success.","[Toeroek, Aron; Toth, Jozsep] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Török, A (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",aron.torok@uni-corvinus.hu; jozsef.toth@uni-corvinus.hu,"Torok, Aron/AAO-7820-2020; Toth, Jozsef/ABI-6303-2020","Torok, Aron/0000-0001-6769-7103;",Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) [K 84327]; [TAMOP-4.2.1/B-09/1/KMR-2010-0005],Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA)(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA));,"The research was supported by the TAMOP-4.2.1/B-09/1/KMR-2010-0005 and the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA), K 84327 Integration of small farms into modern food chain.

The results indicate mean reversion (i.e., orders of integration smaller than one) in some of the agricultural prices like corn, milk, and barrow and gilts when the disturbances are autocorrelated. Further, we examine the stability across time in the degree of dependence, and the results indicate that the fractional differencing parameters have not remained constant across time. When we take into account a structural break we find that during the first subsamples, the series are stationary though highly persistent, with orders of integration close to 0 and with large autoregressive coefficients.

Delaying reforms resolves some uncertainty by gaining valuable information and saves transaction costs. Implementing reforms without waiting increases welfare by adjusting domestic policies to changed market parameters. Optimal policy timing is found by balancing the trade-off between delaying reforms and implementing reforms without waiting. Our theory offers an explanation of why countries differ with respect to the length of their policy reforms and why applied studies often judge agricultural policies to be inefficient when actually they may not be.,"[Mittenzwei, Klaus; Bullock, David S.; Salhofer, Klaus] Univ Illinois, Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Mittenzwei, Klaus; Bullock, David S.; Salhofer, Klaus] Tech Univ Munich, D-8000 Munich, Germany",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Technical University of Munich,"Mittenzwei, K (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",klaus.mittenzwei@nilf.no,"Salhofer, Klaus/ACN-4362-2022","Salhofer, Klaus/0000-0002-4119-648X",Research Council of Norway [178334],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This research has been funded by the Research Council of Norway under grant no. 178334.

The decision of the public institution to either share their knowledge, or protect and cross-license their IP with the rival firm, is a strategic choice. While the profit-maximizing private research firms have an incentive to protect and secure their intellectual property (IP), under some conditions they choose to cross-license their technology rather than forgo access to the public IP. The budget constrained public firm, with an objective of maximizing farmers welfare, can have an incentive to share its IP but under certain conditions has an incentive to incur transaction costs to protect and cross-license its technology to obtain access to the private technology. The theoretical model shows that public incentives to protect IP are likely to be stronger in a research industry with significant corporate presence. A survey of Canadian wheat and canola breeders reveals that public breeders are far more secretive in the canola sector than in the wheat sector, a dichotomy that is consistent with the theoretical results. Le present article examine les avantages du partage de connaissances dans un secteur dactivite ou une institution publique et une firme privee mettent au point de nouvelles varietes vegetales differencies et les vendent a des agriculteurs heterogenes. La decision de linstitution publique de partager ses connaissances ou de proteger sa propriete intellectuelle (PI) et de proceder a la concession de licences reciproques avec la firme rivale constitue un choix strategique. Bien que les firmes de recherche privees axees sur la maximisation des benefices aient interet a proteger leur PI, dans certaines conditions, elles choisissent de proceder a la concession de licences reciproques plutot que de renoncer a lacces de la PI du secteur public. Linstitution publique a budget restreint, qui vise entre autres a maximiser le bien-etre des agriculteurs, peut tirer profit du partage de sa PI mais, dans certaines conditions, elle a interet a assumer les couts de transaction pour proteger sa technologie et proceder a une concession de licences reciproques afin dobtenir lacces a la technologie du secteur prive. Le modele theorique montre que les avantages publics lies a la protection de la PI risquent detr plus importants dans un secteur de la recherche ou la presence des entreprises est forte.

Standard deviation (SD) type of measures, including variance and the coefficient of variation, have been commonly used for estimating realized volatility. These methods are relatively simple to calculate and focus on the width of the data. Despite these merits, they have a shortcoming in that the statistics can be amplified when the time series is nonstationary. This study suggests a new way to measure price variation. The structural breaks in the unconditional mean of a time series are determined, and then the conventional SD type of measures for each regime are calculated. This method addresses the weak point of the SD type of measure and is a competitive alternative to the conditional variance type or the trend deviation type of measures when the time series at comparison have notably different data-generating processes or have nonstationarity.","[Jin, Hyun Joung] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Taeho] Univ Incheon, Dept Business Adm, Inchon, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Incheon National University,"Jin, HJ (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",hyunjin@cau.ac.kr; thkim@incheon.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean government [NRF-2010-327-B00129],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korean government(Korean Government),This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Korean government (NRF-2010-327-B00129).,,22,7,7,3,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We investigate how policy and market factors influence firms (or other potential inventors) decisions on innovation or imitation by developing a model that emphasizes expected market size, appropriability and technological opportunity. We empirically test the model using provincial pesticide innovation data from a rapidly developing country, China. We find that the government encouraged local innovation by opening regions to more international trade, by increasing investments in public research and education, and by strengthening intellectual property right (IPR) enforcement to meet its WTO TRIPS obligations. Moreover, while IPR enforcement and increases in market size are important in encouraging innovation, empirical evidence is mixed as inventors respond to these factors differently. Policies to increase expected market size could increase copying rather than inducing R&D investments, and extended patent life may reinforce the original standing of infringers as well as inventors.","[Shi, Guanming] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Pray, Carl] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Shi, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Taylor Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",gshi@wisc.edu,,,Graduate School Research Grant of Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF),Graduate School Research Grant of Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF),This research was partially funded by the Graduate School Research Grant of Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF).,,23,6,6,0,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Decisions such as the timing of harvesting and investment in new plantations depend on future price expectations and policy makers often are concerned about the persistence of price shocks for stabilization purposes. Previous research on the topic has been mixed and focused on the question of whether prices are integrated of order one (i.e., have a unit root) and are nonstationary or if they are integrated of order zero and are stationary and mean-reverting. In an effort to understand the price process for two key forest products (lumber and pulp), time-series tests were applied to over 40 years of monthly pricing data. Using a modified DickeyFuller test, we rejected the null hypothesis of a unit root on most series. However, a separate test also soundly rejected a stationary null hypothesis. Such a finding led us to test whether forest products prices are fractionally integrated, exhibiting long memory. Estimates of the memory parameter (d) for various lumber price series ranged between 0.68 and 0.81 and for pulp it was 0.64. This implies that prices are both mean-reverting (in the sense that shocks die out) and nonstationary.","[Niquidet, Kurt; Sun, Lili] Canadian Forest Serv, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada",Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Niquidet, K (通讯作者)，Canadian Forest Serv, Pacific Forestry Ctr, 506 W Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.",kurt.niquidet@nrcan.gc.ca; lili.sun@nrcan.gc.ca,"Sun, lili/GQH-2057-2022",,,,,,87,6,6,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Design/methodology/approach - Two methods of analysis are employed. The first method looks back in time and estimates what US crop prices would have been during the 2005 to 2009 marketing years under two scenarios. The second method of analysis is forward looking and examines the market impacts of the blender tax credit and mandate on the distribution of prices in the 2011 calendar and marketing year. Findings - The results developed in the previous two sections show that US ethanol policies modestly increased maize prices from 2006 to 2009 and that market impacts of the policies will be larger under tighter market conditions. Practical implications - More flexible US biofuel policy including removing the blenders tax credit, which does not help US biofuel industry as long as the mandates are in place, and relaxing blending mandates when feedstock supplies are low. Originality/value - This report makes three contributions to understanding the extent to which US biofuel policies contribute to higher agricultural and food prices. First, estimates of the impact of US ethanol policies on crop and food prices reveal that the impacts of the subsidies were quite modest. The second contribution is to provide estimates of the impact on agricultural commodity prices and food prices from market-driven expansion of ethanol. The final contribution of this report is improved insight into how current US biofuel policies are expected to affect crop prices in the near future.","Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Babcock, BA (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",babcock@iastate.edu,,,,,,,5,23,37,0,50,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The paper analyses the reasons of these changes and tries to describe the future development expected after 2010. The article also examines the cost and profitability of growing grapes and wine prices. The current production potential of the Czech Republic is 19 633.45 hectares of vineyards. As compared with 1960, the total acreage of vineyards increased nearly three times and the number of the most frequent varieties has also increased. As far as the percentages of Muller Thurgau, Green Veltliner, Italian Riesling and Sankt Laurent varieties is concerned, it is anticipated that their acreages will further decrease, whereas those of Rhein Riesling, Sauvignon, Lemberger and Zweigeltrebe are expected to grow. The results from the survey of consumer behaviour in the wine market in the CR point to the connection between the structure of the vineyards and consumer demand. Lemberger, Cabernet Sauvignon, Muller Thurgau, Gruner Veltliner, Pinot Blanc, Saint Laurent, Blue Portugal, Chardonnay, Riesling and Bohemia Sekt have been the most popular varieties of the market research.","[Chladkova, Helena; Tomsik, Pavel] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Management, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Sedlo, Jiri] Winegrower Assoc Czech Republ, Velke Bilovice 69102, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Chládková, H (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Management, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",chlad@mendelu.cz; tomsik@mendelu.cz; jiri.sedlo@svcr.cz,"Chladkova, Helena/Q-5643-2016","Chladkova, Helena/0000-0002-9037-2689","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6215648904]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [QF 3276]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic); Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Projects No. MSM 6215648904) and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (Projects No. QF 3276).",,17,2,3,1,17,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

As a result, the use of repeated rounds with price feedback has become standard practice in the applied experimental auction valuation literature. We conducted two experiments to determine how rationally subjects behave with and without price feedback in a second-price auction. Results from an auction for lotteries show that subjects exposed to price feedback are significantly more likely to commit preference reversals. However, this irrationality diminishes in later rounds. Results from an induced value auction indicate that price feedback caused greater deviations from the Nash equilibrium bidding strategy. Our results suggest that while bidding on the same item repeatedly improves auction outcomes (i.e., reduced preference reversals or bids closer to induced values), this improvement is not the result of price feedback.","[Corrigan, Jay R.] Kenyon Coll, Gambier, OH 43022 USA; [Drichoutis, Andreas C.] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Rousu, Matthew C.] Susquehanna Univ, Dept Econ, Selinsgrove, PA 17870 USA",University System of Ohio; Kenyon College; University of Ioannina; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Susquehanna University,"Corrigan, JR (通讯作者)，Kenyon Coll, Gambier, OH 43022 USA.",corriganj@kenyon.edu; adrihout@cc.uoi.gr; jayson.lusk@okstate.edu; rnayga@uark.edu; rousu@susqu.edu,"Drichoutis, Andreas/AAM-6580-2020; Corrigan, Jay/AAH-1630-2020","Drichoutis, Andreas/0000-0002-4082-4560;",,,,,42,29,30,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Using a large cross-sectional farm household level dataset, we estimate the impact of the source of health insurance on health care expenditures of farm households in the United States. Results suggest that farm households purchasing individual health insurance directly from vendors are likely to spend more on health care than those with other sources of health insurance.

The targeting of the objectives of the LFA measure was analysed on the cases of the selected types of the small and large farms and also the amounts of support, devoted to reach these objectives. The paper further analyses economic results of the small and large farms in the LFA within the CR, and evaluates the impacts of the current LFA measures, where the payment distribution is based only on the grassland area, regardless of the farm size in the CR. Based on these analyses, it was suggested to distribute the LFA payments in the CR per 1ha of utilised agricultural area of farm. Also, it was showed that it would be suitable to introduce a graded decrease of the LFA payments rates according to the farm size. The analysis proves that the economic survival of the large farms, measured as the farm net value added per one annual work unit, will not be endangered.","[Stolbova, Marie; Micova, Michala] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Stolbová, M (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 75, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic.",stolbova.marie@uzei.cz; micova.michala@uzei.cz,"Micova, Julia/I-3037-2014",,,,,,19,10,10,0,8,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

A case study is presented for a region within the South-west Australia Biodiversity Hotspot (Nature 403, 853). This Biodiversity Hotspot is a focus for conservation investment as it combines a relatively high level of biodiversity with severe threat to the biodiversity from agriculture. The conservation planning model developed determines the optimal set of bush fragments for conservation. This model can also be used to assess the trade-off between the budget and a vegetation species metric. Results from the case study show that, without an effective conservation scheme that at least fences fragments, significant plant biodiversity losses will occur in the North East Wheatbelt Regional Organisation of Councils region of the WA wheatbelt over a 10-year period. A perfect price discriminating auction scheme could reduce the costs of conservation by around 17 per cent relative to a fixed-payment scheme; however, a fixed payment on outcome (measured as change in the species metric) scheme represents a viable second-best alternative, to a conservation auction, where conservation spending is spatially targeted.","[White, Ben; Sadler, Rohan] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"White, B (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",benedict.white@uwa.edu.au,"White, Benedict/D-1434-2011","White, Benedict/0000-0001-7256-2449",DAFF,DAFF,"The authors wish to thank two anonymous reviewers and the journal associate editor for helpful comments and suggestions.

This study makes estimations of monthly (i.e., seasonal) versus annual global acreage response models for the world's principal staple food crops: wheat, corn, soybeans, and rice. Primary emphasis is given to the magnitude and speed of the allocation process. Estimation of intra-annual acreage elasticity is crucial for expected food supply and for input demand, especially in the light of the recent short-term volatility in food prices. The econometric results indicate that global crop acreage responds to crop prices and price risks, input costs as well as a time trend. Depending on respective crop, short-run elasticities are about 0.05 to 0.40; price volatility tends to reduce acreage for some of the crops; comparison of the annual and the monthly acreage response elasticities suggests that acreage adjusts seasonally around the globe to new information and expectations. Given the seasonality of agriculture, time is of an essence for acreage response. The analysis indicates that acreage allocation is more sensitive to prices in the northern hemisphere spring than in winter and the response varies across months.","[Haile, Mekbib G.; Kalkuhl, Matthias; von Braun, Joachim] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Haile, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",mekhaile@uni-bonn.de,"von Braun, Joachim/AAA-7044-2020","von Braun, Joachim/0000-0001-6571-4838; Kalkuhl, Matthias/0000-0003-4797-6628; Haile, Mekbib/0000-0002-5480-531X",Bayer CropScience AG; Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany,Bayer CropScience AG(Bayer AG); Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany,"We thank Ulrich Koester, Getaw Tadesse, and three anonymous referees for valuable comments and Marc Mueller and Lukas Kornher for discussions.

Cereal demand and interest rate shocks combined with low stocks affect intra-annual volatility, while other explanatory factors include exchange rate and crude oil price shocks. The derivatives market activity appears to have no significant effect on either intra-or inter-annual volatility.

Geographical indication producers engage in informative advertising by associating their true quality premium (relative to a substitute product) with a specific label emphasizing the GI's geographic origin. The extent to which the names/words of the GI label can be used and/or imitated by competing products-which depends on the strength of GI protection-determines how informative the GI promotion messages can be. Consumers' heterogeneous preferences (vis-A -vis the GI quality premium) are modeled in a vertically differentiated framework. Both the GI industry and the substitute product industry are assumed to be competitive (with free entry). The model is calibrated and solved for alternative parameter values. Results show that producers of the GI and of the lower-quality substitute good have divergent interests: GI producers are better off with full protection, whereas the substitute good's producers prefer intermediate levels of protection (but they never prefer zero protection because they benefit indirectly if the GI producers' incentives to promote are preserved). For consumers and aggregate welfare, the preferred level of protection depends on the model's parameters, with an intermediate level of protection being optimal in many circumstances.","[Menapace, Luisa] Tech Univ Munich, D-80290 Munich, Germany; [Moschini, Gian Carlo] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA; [Moschini, Gian Carlo] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA USA",Technical University of Munich; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Menapace, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, D-80290 Munich, Germany.",,,", Luisa/0000-0002-8684-302X",,,,,35,21,20,4,84,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

It is possible that farmers will adjust their expenditure patterns in subsequent periods after year-over-year market trends become more apparent to them.,"[Murekezi, Abdoul; Jin, Songqing; Loveridge, Scott] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Murekezi, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Justin S Morrill Hall Agr,446 West Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",akmurekezi@gmail.com,"Jin, Songqing/W-4340-2019","Jin, Songqing/0000-0001-8514-7930",,,,,31,3,3,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We find that even if vessel sizes change over time, the quota price can converge to the fundamental value conditioned on the vessels chosen. We also find that subjects choose their vessel type to maximise their profits based on the quota trading prices in the previous period. This result implies that the efficiency of quota markets in the beginning period is important because any inefficiency in quota markets may affect vessel sizes in ensuing periods. Moreover, we find that the initial allocations may significantly influence vessel sizes through two channels: first, a higher initial allocation to a subject increases the likelihood that the subject invests in a large-sized vessel; second, the quota price may be higher and more unstable under unequal allocation than under equal allocation; thus, whether the allocation is equal influences subjects' choice of vessel type.","[Tanaka, Kenta] Musashi Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Higashida, Keisaku] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University; Tohoku University,"Tanaka, K (通讯作者)，Musashi Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",keisaku@kwansei.ac.jp,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23330087]; Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI); Ministry of the Environment, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23330087] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI); Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science under the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B, 23330087), Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI), and the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.

Such production processes are consistent with Kremer's O-ring production theory in which a single mistake in any one of several complementary tasks in a firm's production process can lead to catastrophic failure of the product's value. In hog production, mistakes that introduce disease or pathogens into the production facility can cause a total loss of the herd. Consistent with predictions derived from the O-ring theory, we provide evidence that the most skilled workers concentrate in the largest and most technologically advanced farms and are paid more than comparable workers on smaller farms. These findings suggest that worker skills, new technologies, and farm size are complements in production. The complementarities create returns to scale to large hog confinements, consistent with the dramatic increase in market share of very large farms over the past 20 years.","[Yu, Li] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Orazem, Peter F.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Central University of Finance & Economics; Iowa State University,"Yu, L (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yuli.isu@gmail.com,"Orazem, Peter/D-6525-2016; Yu, Li/AAI-9671-2020","Orazem, Peter/0000-0003-2092-5089;",,,,,36,3,4,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Yet, several articles provide evidence of imperfect competition and price discrimination in the wheat trade. However, these studies focused on traditional high-quality wheat exporters such as Canada and the United States. In contrast, this article investigates whether Russian wheat exporters exercise market power in eight selected importing countries using the residual demand elasticity (RDE) model. The article makes two major contributions. First, it focuses on a nontraditional exporter, who exports mainly wheat of mediocre quality to low- and middle-income countries. Second, the RDE model is estimated for the first time using a nonlinear estimator, the instrumental variable Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator. This is important because the double logarithmic functional form can provide biased results in the presence of heteroskedasticity. The results indicate that Russian wheat exporters can exercise market power in only a few markets, while they are price takers in the majority of importing countries.","[Pall, Zsombor; Perekhozhuk, Oleksandr; Glauben, Thomas; Prehn, Soeren; Teuber, Ramona] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Perekhozhuk, O (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",perekhozhuk@iamo.de,"Perekhozhuk, Oleksandr/J-9964-2017; Teuber, Ramona/P-6565-2014; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Teuber, Ramona/AAE-1925-2019","Teuber, Ramona/0000-0001-6283-0438; Glauben, Thomas/0000-0003-0640-9387",,,,,23,14,15,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Stratified and randomly sampled household data are used to describe the disposal of domestic waste in rural China, including domestic garbage and organic waste (human excreta, livestock waste, and kitchen waste); econometric models are estimated to quantify the major determinants of household domestic garbage and human excreta disposal. Findings - While about 30 percent of the domestic garbage in 2008 was discharged to appropriately designated places, more than 40 percent of the garbage was discharged casually. Organic waste at the time of data gathering was still largely used in agricultural production, although a falling trend has been evidenced in recent years. Based on econometric analysis, it becomes clear that income growth, rising population density, and transportation improvements have significantly improved domestic garbage disposal, but negatively affected the recycling of human excreta. The provision of an adequate garbage collection service has the most positive effects on garbage management. Originality/value - The analyses are based on primary survey data. The results will have significant policy implications on the management of rural domestic waste to maintain better rural environment.","[Liu, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71103013, 70925001, 71033003]; IGSNRR-CAS [2012ZD2008]",National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); IGSNRR-CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This research is supported by National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (71103013, 70925001, 71033003); IGSNRR-CAS (2012ZD2008).

The production activity that transforms inputs into agricultural outputs involves direct use of weather inputs (temperature, solar radiation available to the plant, and precipitation). Previous studies of the impacts of climate change on agriculture have reported substantial differences in outcomes such as prices, production, and trade arising from differences in model inputs and model specification. This article presents climate change results and underlying determinants from a model comparison exercise with 10 of the leading global economic models that include significant representation of agriculture. By harmonizing key drivers that include climate change effects, differences in model outcomes were reduced. The particular choice of climate change drivers for this comparison activity results in large and negative productivity effects. All models respond with higher prices. Producer behavior differs by model with some emphasizing area response and others yield response. Demand response is least important. The differences reflect both differences in model specification and perspectives on the future.

The FP was introduced first in the world so that farmland may be liquidated by the lifetime mortgage of farmland. However, it differs from conventional lifetime or reverse mortgages because its annuity program is implemented by the government according to the actuarial model whose variables are adjustable from the viewpoint of the elderly welfare. By introducing a simple standard of comprehensive farming assets into the FP model, the FAP model augments this social security measure, the step-by-step improvement of which is also expected to formulate the future policy implications of regional economic revitalisation as well as the elderly welfare for other countries.","[Park, Gil H.; Cho, Deokho] Daegu Univ, Gyongsan 712714, South Korea",Daegu University,"Cho, D (通讯作者)，Daegu Univ, Gyongsan 712714, South Korea.",chodh@daegu.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2012S1A3A2033821],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),Supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (Project No. NRF-2012S1A3A2033821).,,35,0,0,0,8,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Even though developing countries have a comparative advantage in biofuels production, they were shut out of rich countries' biofuel markets by trade discriminating biofuels policies. Developing countries would not have been able to take full advantage of the price spike in the short run anyway given the low supply elasticities and the long time required for biofuel production to come online, unlike for corn-ethanol.

It decomposes the TFP index into six finer components (technical change, technical-, scale- and mix-efficiency changes, residual scale- and residual mix-efficiency changes). Results reveal that TFP grew at an average rate of 0.57% p.a. led by the Chittagong, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Dinajpur and Noakhali regions. TFP growth is largely powered by technological progress estimated at 0.74% p.a. Technical efficiency improvement is negligible (0.01% p.a.) due to stagnant efficiency in most of the regions. Decline in scale efficiency is also negligible (0.01% p.a.), but the decline in mix efficiency is high at 0.19% p.a. Decomposition of the components of TFP changes into finer measures of efficiency corrects the existing literature's blame of a decline in technical efficiency as the main cause of poor TFP growth in Bangladesh. Among the sources, farm size, R&D investment, extension expenditure and crop specialisation positively influenced TFP growth, whereas the literacy rate had a negative influence on growth. Policy implications include encouraging investment in R&D and extension, land reform measures to increase average farm size, promotion of Green Revolution technology and crop diversification.","[Rahman, Sanzidur] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Salim, Ruhul] Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Curtin Business Sch, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Plymouth; Curtin University,"Rahman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",srahman@plymouth.ac.uk,"Rahman, Sanzidur/AAO-6993-2020","Rahman, Sanzidur/0000-0002-0391-6191",British Academy Small Research Grant,British Academy Small Research Grant,"Ruhul Salim is a Associate Professor of Economics at the School of Economics and Finance, Curtin Business School, Curtin University, Perth, Australia.

Attention focuses on the consequences of an increasingly diverse population on demand for food. The notion of dietary acculturation is discussed in the context of a fragmenting market for foods in Canada. A research agenda is presented with the intent to stimulate research that addresses the role of ethnicity in shaping demand for food in Canada. As Canada becomes more ethnically diverse, the landscape of the Canadian food environment will evolve. Understanding the impact of such change on demand for foods in Canada will become increasingly important. Such understanding can help inform the supply side of the market in terms of retail and food service location decisions, as well as decisions related to the marketing mix. Dans le present article nous analysons l'interaction entre l'immigration, la diversite ethnique et la demande alimentaire au Canada et examinons tout particulierement les repercussions de l'accroissement de la diversite ethnique sur la demande alimentaire. Nous abordons la notion d'acculturation alimentaire dans un contexte de segmentation du marche alimentaire au Canada.

The purpose is to discuss policy options available to the authorities and their implications in terms of trade-offs between goals. We apply a multi-objective programming model to the sardine and anchovy artisanal fisheries in central southern Chile. The results suggest that the regulatory system generates inefficient solutions for profit and employment maximisation goals. Moreover, the fleet structure of the artisanal organisations is central for the outcomes obtained by different policy simulations. To improve effort assignment, the authorities should seek to increase flexibility in the system.","[Castillo, Carlos; Dresdner, Jorge] Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion,"Castillo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Concepcion, Chile.",jdresdne@udec.cl,"Castillo, Carlos/JJE-5679-2023","Dresdner Cid, Jorge/0000-0002-8371-4628",,,,,30,6,6,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The results of the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag bounds testing approach to co-integration show that there is a positive and stable long-run equilibrium relationship between India's agricultural exports and GDP of agriculture. We find a unidirectional causal link running from farm exports to gross domestic product of agriculture. It indicates that in India, agricultural products export Granger causes the growth in GDP of agriculture, which supports the export-led growth hypothesis.

We provide a simple parametric functional form to represent the state-contingent technology. Using simple numerical examples, we illustrate how optimal inputoutput choices are dramatically affected when firms have different preferences and information sets.

Such parameters are derived here from a theoretically consistent, dual translog cost model of U.S. protein and energy feed markets. Own-price elasticities ranged from a relatively inelastic 0.139 for feedgrains to a relatively elastic 0.568 for meat and bone meal (MBM). The cross elasticity for ethanol co-products and oilseed meals (0.168) is larger than the elasticity with co-products and feedgrains (0.024). Higher prices for protein feeds likely result in some substitution of feed grains for some protein (e.g. corn by oilseed meals 0.125), which may also partially account for the relatively small feedgrains cross elasticity. Policies implemented as a result of bovine splongiform encephalopathy adversely affected the share of total costs attributed to MBM, but had a positive effect on oilseed meal cost share.","[Mathews, Kenneth H., Jr.] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC USA; [McConnell, Michael J.] US Int Trade Commiss, Agr & Fisheries Div, Off Ind, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Mathews, KH (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, Washington, DC USA.",KMathews@ERS.USDA.GOV,,,,,,,40,1,3,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

This article analyzes the economics and strategy of bundling and bundle pricing of biotech traits in seeds. When the bundling of genes/traits is decided by biotech firms, firms may choose among subadditive pricing, component pricing, or superadditive pricing strategies. We argue that complementarity among component genes contributes to subadditive pricing, while substitution among components contributes to superadditive pricing. The nature of bundle pricing is explored empirically using U.S. seed corn data from 2000 to 2007. We document that subadditive bundle pricing of traits is commonly found in the seed corn market. However, we also present evidence of superadditive pricing and component pricing. The presence of different pricing and bundling strategies suggests a rapidly advancing and complex market. The preponderance of subadditive pricing suggests that trait bundling offers benefits to farmers exhibiting strong demand for multiple complementary genetic traits.","[Shi, Guanming; Chavas, Jean-Paul; Stiegert, Kyle] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Meng, Xiangyi] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Publ Finance & Policy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Shi, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Taylor Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",gshi@wisc.edu,"Meng, Xiangyi/AAJ-3830-2020","Stiegert, Kyle/0000-0001-6835-6132",USDA-NRI [144-QS50]; USDA CSREES [WIS0134]; Food System Research Group (FSRG); Graduate School Research Grant of Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF),USDA-NRI(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA CSREES(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); Food System Research Group (FSRG); Graduate School Research Grant of Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF),"This research was supported in part by USDA-NRI grant #144-QS50, a USDA CSREES Hatch grant #WIS0134, Food System Research Group (FSRG) grant and the Graduate School Research Grant of Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF).",,25,4,7,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We present and explore an analytical framework that yields different activity choices as optimal solutions to a simple utility maximization problem. By classifying the range of activities of rural households into a few distinct categories based on their profitability and by considering portfolios of farm and non-farm activities, we provide novel insights into diversification behaviour of rural households. The evidence shows that while the poor are mainly agricultural labourers and work in the low-return non-farm sector, the better-off diversify in high-return non-farm activities. As expected, we find strong evidence that education plays a major role in accessing more remunerative non-farm employment. A somewhat less intuitive finding is that larger household size is associated with higher probability of diversification into the high-return non-farm sector. The finding that the farm size is not a constraint to diversification in lucrative non-farm employment is also surprising. Geographical location plays a role in diversification behaviour of rural households indicating the importance of local context.","[Rahut, Dil Bahadur] S Asian Univ, New Delhi, India; [Scharf, Maja Micevska] Roosevelt Acad, Middelburg, Netherlands; [Scharf, Maja Micevska] Webster Univ, Leiden, Netherlands",,"Rahut, DB (通讯作者)，S Asian Univ, New Delhi, India.",micevskascharf41@webster.edu,"Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022","Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271; Micevska, Maja/0000-0001-7943-8504",,,,,27,40,46,0,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Our results show that discount functions are quasi-hyperbolic in shape, and that obesity and drinking are positively related to the discount rate.

Some observations in Australian urban communities,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,choice experiment; consumer preferences; enforcement; urban water restrictions; water policy,NONMARKET VALUATION; DESIGN,"Mandatory water restrictions continue to be the immediate response to urban water shortages in most major cities in southern Australia. Whilst generally rejected by economists on efficiency grounds, restrictions and the enforcement regimes used to invoke them are, nonetheless, viewed by some in the community as a positive way of dealing with water scarcity. Given the likelihood that urban water restrictions will persist for some time, there is value in understanding householders attitudes in this context. The impact and acceptability of differing approaches to enforcement is of particular interest, because this has wider ramifications for the administration of policy generally. This paper uses the results from a choice experiment to investigate the interplay between different components of a water restriction regime. In stark contrast to prevailing views that focus on the community benefits from sharing the pain of water shortages, results point to the significance of being able to inform on ones neighbours as a component of the enforcement regimes.","[Cooper, Bethany] La Trobe Univ, Fac Law & Management, Albury Wodonga, Vic, Australia; [Rose, John] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",La Trobe University; University of Sydney,"Cooper, B (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Fac Law & Management, Albury Wodonga, Vic, Australia.",b.cooper@latrobe.edu.au,"Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021; Cooper, Bethany/E-5425-2016; Crase, Lin/L-2072-2016","Cooper, Bethany/0000-0002-7484-1772; Crase, Lin/0000-0002-3615-7152; Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980",Consumer Utilities Advocacy Centre; North East Water Authority,Consumer Utilities Advocacy Centre; North East Water Authority,Funding for the work reported on here was provided by the Consumer Utilities Advocacy Centre and North East Water Authority.

Consumers cannot predict ex ante performance of the product based on the credence attributes due to information asymmetry, and they need a signal that they can trust in purchasing a food product with high credence attributes. Consumers are likely to use a brand name as a surrogate of the quality and the safety guarantee in purchasing food products with credence attributes. An effective brand management appears to be a major prerequisite for the creation of superior customer value (i.e. brand equity) and successful positioning of credence goods. This study empirically validates four determinant conceptualization of brand equity for credence goods by utilizing the Latent Variable Structural Equation Modeling (LVSE). Findings support the four factor model of brand equity for credence goods. The main objective of this study is to illustrate how consumers place value on major product cues in making purchasing decision of credence products. The findings show that brand loyalty and attribute based components (i.e. perceived value) appears to have the dominant role in determining a brand's equity.","Hanyang Univ, Fac Business, Sch Business, Seoul 133791, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Kim, RB (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Fac Business, Sch Business, 17 Haengdang Dong, Seoul 133791, South Korea.",Kimrby@gmail.com,"KIM, BOYOUNG RENEE/B-9861-2018",,Social Science Korea (SSK) Research Grant of the National Research Foundation of Korea [B00096],Social Science Korea (SSK) Research Grant of the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),Supported by the Social Science Korea (SSK) Research Grant of the National Research Foundation of Korea (Project No. B00096).,,41,9,9,5,63,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

According the existing empirical studies in the past, we expect that the US Farm Bill 2008 will exert an influence on the agricultural production and rural poverty in developing countries, especially China. In order to fully capture such an effect, we link two equilibrium models together: the multinational CGE model - GTAP and the China's partial equilibrium model - the China's Agricultural Policy Simulation and Projection Model (CAPSiM). A scenario based on the US Farm Bill 2008 will be constructed and compared with the baseline. A more liberalized scenario is also built for the simulation.

Both the precautionary saving theory and the Buffer-Stock saving theory would predict a positive effect of this event on consumption. The purpose of this paper is to empirically study the effects of medical insurance on durables consumption in rural China. Design/methodology/approach - Using China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data, the authors study the effects of medical insurance on durable goods consumption in rural China through a panel binary choice model. Findings - It is found that households with medical insurance have a significantly higher level of durables consumption, and their probabilities of purchasing durables increase by 2.0 per cent-4.4 per cent, which support the precautionary saving theory and the Buffer-Stock saving theory. Originality/value - Unlike previous studies, the authors focus on the effects of medical insurance on the consumption of durables, which have a big weight in household wealth and are more sensitive to income uncertainty.","[Du, Zaichao] SW Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Ying, Meiling] SW Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Du, ZC (通讯作者)，SW Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",duzc@swufe.edu.cn,"Du, Zaichao/HCJ-0350-2022","Ying, Meiling/0000-0002-3012-9791",,,,,21,11,11,3,78,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Bt eggplant, the first GE food crop to get approval for environmental release in 2009, has not yet been commercialized. An indefinite moratorium on its commercialization was imposed by the Minister of Environment and Forests in 2010. We examine the regulatory framework in India and use the cases of Bt cotton and Bt eggplant regulation to examine the types and sources of nonmarket failures associated with the regulatory policy. We also analyze the demonstrated and likely effects of regulatory uncertainty on social welfare and development of the agri-biotech industry.

Such views challenge the notion of consumer sovereignty and the validity of traditional approaches of economic welfare analysis. While behavioural economics might improve the effectiveness of policies that are already justified on some other market-failure grounds, this article argues that the existence of cognitive failures, alone, do not justify government regulation. If one abandons the idea that consumers know what is in their best interest, judging the merits of policies becomes arbitrary and reflects only what a paternalist wants for others. The typical behavioural economic experiment occurs with college students devoid of real-world context. The biases found in such setting may not extrapolate well to conditions where people have more experience and knowledge, and where they can learn from past mistakes. Even when behavioural biases persist in the 'real world', consumers face incentives to engage in activities that protect them from the adverse consequences of the biases, and public policies that shield people from such consequences reduce incentives to self-regulate. The article concludes with some ideas for future research and a discussion of the merits of freedom of choice.","Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Lusk, JL (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jayson.lusk@okstate.edu,,,Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station,Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station,"Many of the ideas covered in this article first appeared in my book, The Food Police.

Although retailers tend to pass higher wholesale prices through to consumers quickly and completely, they often do not pass on trade promotions. Currently, asymmetric pass-through is commonly thought to result from retailers' exercise of market power. Alternatively, it may be because of consumer search behavior and retailers' competitive response. We test this theory using a panel threshold asymmetric error-correction model applied to wholesale and retail scanner data for ready-to-eat cereal for a number of retailers in the Los Angeles metropolitan market. We find that consumer search behavior contributes significantly to imperfect pass-through. By allowing pass-through to depend on market power and consumer search costs, we find results that are contrary to the conventional wisdom. Namely, market power causes retail prices to fall quickly and rise slowly, whereas consumer search behavior causes retail prices to rise quickly and fall slowly-precisely the rockets and feathers phenomenon.","[Richards, Timothy J.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Gomez, Miguel I.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lee, Jun] Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade, Seoul, South Korea",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Cornell University; Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET),"Richards, TJ (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",trichards@asu.edu; mig7@cornell.edu; jlee@kiet.re.kr,"Gomez, Miguel I./AAD-3707-2019","Richards, Timothy/0000-0001-8832-9609",,,,,72,28,31,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Our analysis focuses on demand for seed, characterising smallholders with a high predicted demand for hybrid seed who were not reached by the subsidy programme. We use cross-sectional data from the 2010 agricultural season and an instrumented control function approach to test the hypothesis that the subsidy on hybrid maize seed in Zambia is selectively biased. Consistent with other literature, we find that the subsidy is a recursive determinant of seed demand, but in 2010, its recipients had more land, more assets, and lower poverty rates. Findings illustrate the social costs of the programme as currently designed and highlight the need to build alternative supply channels if poorer maize growers are to grow hybrid seed.","[Smale, Melinda] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Birol, Ekin; Asare-Marfo, Dorene] IFPRI, HarvestPlus, Washington, DC USA",Michigan State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Smale, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",msmale@msu.edu,,,,,,,30,6,9,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

An underlying premise is that small farms are productive in the African context and that smallholders do not forgo economies of scale-a premise supported by the often observed phenomenon that staple cereal yields decline as the scale of production increases. This article explores a research design conundrum that encourages researchers who study the relationship between productivity and scale to use surveys with a narrow geographic reach in order to produce more reliable results, even though results are better suited for policy decisions when they are based on data that are broadly representative. Using a model of endogenous technology choice, we explore the relationship between maize yields and scale using alternative data. Since rich descriptions of the decision environments that farmers face are needed to identify the applied technologies that generate the data, improvements in the location specificity of the data should reduce the likelihood of identification errors and biased estimates. However, our analysis finds that the inverse-productivity hypothesis holds up well across a broad platform of data, despite obvious shortcomings with some components. It also finds surprising consistency in the estimated scale elasticities.","[Larson, Donald F.; Kilic, Talip] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Otsuka, Keijiro; Matsumoto, Tomoya] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",The World Bank; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Larson, DF (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",DLarson@worldbank.org,"Larson, Donald/L-3918-2016","Larson, Donald/0000-0002-1318-3243; Kilic, Talip/0000-0002-3642-3123; Matsumoto, Tomoya/0000-0002-1570-2713",World Bank's Research Supplemental Budget; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25101002] Funding Source: KAKEN,"World Bank's Research Supplemental Budget; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank Gerald Shively and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions on early drafts.

Diet quality is a direct input to health, is often used as a proxy for well-being, and is an outcome variable for a wide variety of economic interventions. For the population as a whole, we find significant improvements across all levels of diet quality. Further, we find improvements for both low-income and higher-income individuals alike. Counterfactual distributions of dietary quality are constructed to investigate the extent to which observed improvements can be attributed to changes in the nutritional content of foods and to changes in population characteristics. We find that 63% of the improvement for all adults can be attributed to changes in food formulation and demographics. Changes in food formulation account for a substantially larger percentage of the dietary improvement within the lower-income population (19.6%) vs. the higher-income population (6.4%).","[Beatty, Timothy K.

Specifically, a spatial general equilibrium framework is developed to analyze the consequences of adopting an agri-environmental policy promoting the provision of positive farming externalities. We use a static monocentric model of an open city where agricultural bid-rents and agricultural amenities vary endogenously in space, and where the positive externalities associated with agricultural production are valued by households. Consistent with empirical evidence of the potential side effects that conservation policies may have in terms of urbanization patterns and land price changes, we show that under certain conditions implementing an agri-environmental policy may promote additional suburban development. Moreover, we demonstrate that the emergence of disconnected suburban areas may be significantly influenced by the location of land regulated by an agri-environmental policy. Finally, we discuss distributional aspects and show that while introducing an agri-environmental policy has a negative impact on most residential land value, it can have positive effects on farmland and residential land located within the regulated areas, suggesting the non-neutrality of such policies regarding the agents' assets.","[Coisnon, Thomas] Univ Angers, Angers Econ & Management Res Grp, GRANEM Grp Rech Angevin Econ & Management, Angers, France; [Oueslati, Walid] Univ Angers, GRANEM, Angers, France; [Oueslati, Walid] Newcastle Univ, Ctr Rural Econ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Salanie, Julien] Univ Lyon, GATE Grp Anal & Theorie Econ Lyon St Etienne, Lyon, France; [Salanie, Julien] Univ St Etienne, St Etienne, France",Universite d'Angers; Universite d'Angers; Newcastle University - UK; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Jean Monnet,"Coisnon, T (通讯作者)，Univ Angers, Angers Econ & Management Res Grp, GRANEM Grp Rech Angevin Econ & Management, Agrocampus Ouest, Angers, France.",,"OUESLATI, Walid/D-1454-2015","OUESLATI, Walid/0000-0001-5611-0362; Julien, Salanie/0000-0002-4000-3092; Coisnon, Thomas/0000-0001-5123-9925",French Ministry of Environment (PAYTAL) [convention 11-MUTS-PDD-3-CVS-019]; Region Pays de la Loire; European Union [FP7-PEOPLE-2010-IEF - 273191 - LUPUS],French Ministry of Environment (PAYTAL); Region Pays de la Loire(Region Pays de la Loire); European Union(European Union (EU)),"Thomas Coisnon is a PhD student at GRANEM (Groupe de Recherche Angevin en Economie et Management/Angers Economics and Management Research Group), Agrocampus Ouest, Universite d'Angers (University of Angers), France.

Agricultural futures markets have experienced a similar pattern and simplistic linear models seem to be no longer reliable when analysing their functions. Against this background, this study contributes to the literature by adopting a non-linear smooth transition approach to examine the relationship between prices for first and second nearby futures contracts of seven agricultural commodities. Our main objective is to distinguish between contango and backwardation regimes when analysing the relationship between the futures spread and changes in the first nearby futures price. Our findings reveal that a linear framework neglects important dynamics, as futures prices adjust only under specific circumstances, and that the predictive power of the futures spread is much stronger during backwardation regimes.","[Beckmann, Joscha; Czudaj, Robert] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, Essen, Germany; [Beckmann, Joscha] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Czudaj, Robert] Univ Appl Sci, FOM Hsch Oekon & Management, Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Czudaj, R (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, Essen, Germany.",robert.czudaj@uni-due.de,"Czudaj, Robert L./I-2286-2019; Beckmann, Joscha/J-4234-2019","Czudaj, Robert L./0000-0002-3313-8204;",,,,,87,25,28,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

This study uses a Symmetric Generalised McFadden cost function to analyze the relationship between costs of production and the provision of biodiversity for Swedish milk farms. Biodiversity indicators are based on the number of valuable plant species present at the farm and are modeled as an output in the cost function. The results show that the marginal cost of biodiversity increases with higher provision, and that an increased provision of biodiversity also increases the costs of market commodities such as milk and beef. The upward slope of the marginal cost of biodiversity and its competitive relationship with market goods questions the efficiency of support schemes based on voluntary programmes with a flat-rate per hectare compensation. Instead, the results support targeted environmental policy schemes with zonings and/or the use of biodiversity indicators.","[Gullstrand, Joakim] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [De Blander, Rembert] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium; [De Blander, Rembert] Katholieke Univ Leuven, CES, Louvain, Belgium; [Waldo, Staffan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",Lund University; Universite Catholique Louvain; KU Leuven; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Gullstrand, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",joakim.gull-strand@nek.lu.se,"waldo, staffan/AHA-9201-2022; De Blander, Rembert/HGE-6452-2022","De Blander, Rembert/0000-0003-2146-1618",European Community's Seventh Framework programme [212292],European Community's Seventh Framework programme(European Union (EU)),"Joakim Gullstrand is the corresponding author and is with the Department of Economics, Lund University, Box 7082, S-220 07 Lund, Sweden.

Ten African governments spend roughly US$1 billion annually on input subsidy programs (ISPs), amounting to 28.6% of their public expenditures on agriculture. This article reviews the microlevel evidence on ISPs undertaken since the mid 2000s. We examine the characteristics of subsidy beneficiaries, crop response rates to fertilizer application and their influence on the performance of subsidy programs, the impacts of subsidy programs on national fertilizer use and the development of commercial input distribution systems, and finally the impact of ISPs on food price levels and poverty rates. The weight of the evidence indicates that the costs of the programs generally outweigh their benefits. Findings from other developing areas with a higher proportion of crop area under irrigation and with lower fertilizer pricesfactors that should provide higher returns to fertilizer subsidies than in Africaindicate that at least a partial reallocation of expenditures from fertilizer subsidies to R&D and infrastructure would provide higher returns to agricultural growth and poverty reduction. However, because ISPs enable governments to demonstrate tangible support to constituents, they are likely to remain on the African landscape for the foreseeable future. Hence, the study identifies ways in which benefits can be enhanced through changes in implementation modalities and complementary investments within a holistic agricultural intensification strategy. Among the most important of these are efforts to reduce the crowding out of commercial fertilizer distribution systems and programs to improve soil fertility to enable farmers to use fertilizer more efficiently. The challenges associated with achieving these gains are likely to be formidable.","[Jayne, T.

Massive imports of food grains to Asia, if they occur, will aggravate the world food shortage, which will have significant implications for the poverty incidence in the world. I argue that in order to avoid such a tragedy, Asia should expand farm size to reduce labor cost by adopting large-scale mechanization, sub-Saharan Africa should realize a green revolution in grain production, and Latin America should further expand its grain production capacity.","Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Otsuka, K (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",otsuka@grips.ac.jp,,,Global COE Program of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25101002] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Global COE Program of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I appreciate the useful comments and suggestions on the earlier version of the article from Jonna P.

The implied posterior distributions of the marginal willingness to pay values are compared graphically and are used in validation regressions. We find strong bimodality of taste distribution as the emerging feature, with different groups of subjects having low and high valuations for these labels. The best fitting model shows that CO2 and food miles valuations are much correlated. CO2 valuations can be high even for those respondents expressing low valuations for food miles. However, the reverse is not true.

These findings indicate that existing literature may overstate the impact of farm payments on the economic well-being of farm households.","[Pandit, Mahesh] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Agr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Pandit, M (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",,"Lund, Crick/F-4405-2011; Verhey, Ruth/R-8895-2019; Verhey, Ruth/ACV-3318-2022; Mishra, Ashok K./J-7228-2019","Verhey, Ruth/0000-0002-5959-1891; Mishra, Ashok K./0000-0002-0988-1428",,,,,35,5,5,0,28,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

However, empirical evidence indicates that repeated choice tasks influence choice outcomes through order effects. The study reported in this article employs a split sample approach based on field surveys to expand the research on effects of repeated-binary DCE elicitation formats. A single-binary elicitation format is used as the baseline. Our results indicate that choice outcomes may vary across the single-binary and repeated-binary elicitation formats. The choice between the two elicitation formats may imply a trade-off between decreased choice precision in the single-binary and order effects that may be explained by strategic misrepresentation of preferences, cost uncertainty effects and reference effects in the repeated-binary elicitation format.","[Scheufele, Gabriela; Bennett, Jeff] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Scheufele, G (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",gabriela.scheufele@anu.edu.au,"Bennett, Jeff W/A-1084-2008; Scheufele, Gabriela/AAV-1141-2021","Scheufele, Gabriela/0000-0003-4431-694X","Australian Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities under the Commonwealth Environment Research Facility","Australian Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities under the Commonwealth Environment Research Facility(Australian Government)","Funding for the research presented in this article was provided by the Australian Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities under the Commonwealth Environment Research Facility.",,43,8,11,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Among women, exceeding these standards is roughly 13 percentage points more likely among African-Americans than whites, representing a challenge to the military, which strives for a racially-diverse officer corps. Simulations indicate that further increases in weight and fat of just 1 would result in a 16.5 increase for men, and 10.9 increase for women, in ineligibility for admission to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

This has caused many researchers to either ignore the zero trade flows or replace the zero with a small positive number. Both of these actions bias the resulting parameter estimates of the gravity equation. In this study, we correct for this misspecification by using the Heckman selection model to estimate bilateral trade flows for 46 agrifood products, for the period 19902000, for 52 countries. In our sample, selection bias rarely affects the signs of variables but often has a substantial effect on the magnitude, statistical significance and economic interpretation of the marginal effects. Hence, treating zero trade flows properly is important from both a statistical and an economics perspective.","[Ul Haq, Zahoor] Abdul Wali Khan Univ Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan; [Meilke, Karl; Cranfield, John] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Ul Haq, Z (通讯作者)，Abdul Wali Khan Univ Mardan, Coll Chowk, Dept Management Sci, Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan.",zahoor.haq@awkum.edu.pk,,"Cranfield, John/0000-0002-3475-6709; Haq, Zahoor/0000-0001-6813-6746","Ontario Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs; Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy and Competitiveness Research Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada","Ontario Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs; Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy and Competitiveness Research Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada)","Financial support for this project was provided by the Ontario Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy and Competitiveness Research Network which is funded by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

These mutually linked exchanges involve rights to use, to access, or to control and allocate land, labour, skills or information. From the perspective of public service economics, we identify the actors involved in landscape stewardship and distinguish entrepreneurial strategies for service provision based on resource orientation, user orientation or competiveness orientation. The difficulties in evaluating the quality of services in general and landscape stewardship in particular result in substantial uncertainty. Three types of contracts that cope differently with this uncertainty can be distinguished: contracts focusing on the technical process, on the intended outcome or on the choice of suppliers based on trust and features of their performance potential. We conclude that a service economics perspective can add to the understanding of landscape stewardship. Due to the fact that public service is already a well-known and broadly acknowledged concept in society, public service economics could possibly provide more rapid progress towards a better co-ordination of supply and demand for landscape qualities than other more novel concepts.","[Penker, Marianne; Enengel, Barbara] BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Aznar, Olivier] French Natl Res Inst Sci & Technol Environm & Agr, Clermont Ferrand, France","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; INRAE","Penker, M (通讯作者)，BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria.",marianne.penker@boku.ac.at,"Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009; Penker, Marianne/IVV-5492-2023","Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346; Penker, Marianne/0000-0002-5185-9558; Aznar, Olivier/0000-0003-0390-7786",French Ministry of Environment,French Ministry of Environment,"Marianne Penker and Barbara Enengel are associate professor and researcher, respectively, at the Department of Economics and Social Sciences at BOKU University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna in Austria.

EU product standard harmonisation is measured using data at the 8-digit combined nomenclature product level. EU harmonisation generates short- and long-run pro-competitive effects: on average, an increase of 50 per cent in the sales-weighted coverage ratio of EU harmonisation leads to a decrease in mark-ups of 7 per cent after 1 year and by 11.5 per cent in the long-run.

In addition, poor health negatively impacts the off-farm participant decision for the China's rural residents. Therefore, more attention should be given to the health investment of migrant workers so as to improve their health and increase their off-farm income.","[Qin, Lijian] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Finance & Publ Adm Sch, Bengbu City 233030, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Yu, Shuangquan] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Coll Foreign Languages, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenggang] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Wang, Chenggang] Texas A&M Univ, Texas AgriLIFE Res, Lubbock, TX USA; [Jiang, Zhongyi] Minist Agr, Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Anhui University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang Gongshang University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M AgriLife Research; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs,"Qin, LJ (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Finance & Publ Adm Sch, Bengbu City 233030, Anhui, Peoples R China.",qinlj28@163.com,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,24,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Dried distillers grain with soluble (DDGS) was found to be a more cost-effective source of energy, amino acids, and phosphorus than either corn, soybean meal, or canola meal, and consequently, its inclusion in the ration reduces feed costs by approximately 13% across the three growth phases for a representative Ontario pig farm. It would require a significant increase in the relative price of DDGS before it would not be part of the least-cost feed formulation at the maximum rate allowed (25% of the ration). The inclusion of DDGS increases the protein and phosphorus content of the ration, and consequently, the manure content of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, if DDGS makes up more than 15% of the ration. The resulting savings to fertilizer costs associated with DDGS will depend on factors such as fertilizer prices, crop needs, and manure nutrient changes, but the benefits, regardless of the scenario, are significantly smaller than the savings to feed costs. Consequently, the use of DDGS in the swine ration is determined primarily through its ability as a cost-effective source of energy and phosphorus, but the saving has been less than the overall feed ingredient price increase since 2006. Les augmentations de prix des ingredients entrant dans la composition des aliments pour animaux qui ont touche defavorablement les eleveurs de betail peuvent etre contrebalancees par lutilisation de coproduits issus de lune des raisons possibles de ces augmentations de prix, a savoir la production dethanol. Les solubles de distillerie (DDGS) se sont revelees une source denergie, damino-acides et de phosphore plus economique que le mais, le tourteau de soya ou de canola, et leur utilisation dans les rations a permis de diminuer les couts des aliments pour animaux denviron 13 p. 100 au cours des trois phases de croissance sur une ferme porcine typique en Ontario. Il faudrait que le prix relatif des DDGS augmente considerablement pour que les DDGS nentrent pas dans la formulation des aliments pour animaux a moindre cout au taux maximal permis (25 p. 100 de la ration). Lajout de DDGS accroit la teneur de la ration en proteines et en phosphore et, par consequent, la teneur du fumier en azote et en phosphore a condition que les DDGS constituent plus de 15 p. 100 de la ration. Les economies de couts des engrais liees a lutilisation des DDGS dependent de certains facteurs tels que le prix des engrais, les besoins des cultures en elements nutritifs et les changements dans les elements nutritifs du fumier mais les avantages, peu importe le scenario, sont significativement moins eleves que les economies de couts des aliments pour animaux. En consequence, lutilisation de DDGS dans la ration pour porcs est principalement determinee par la capacitea constituer une source denergie et de phosphore economique, mais les economies sont inferieures aux avantages alimentaires globaux.","[Skinner, Stewart; Weersink, Alfons] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [deLange, Cornelius F.] Univ Guelph, Dept Anim & Poultry Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Weersink, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",stuskinner@gmail.com; aweersin@uoguelph.ca; cdelange@uoguelph.ca,"Weersink, Alfons/O-1521-2019","Weersink, Alfons/0000-0001-5081-3593","Ontario Ministry of Agricultural Food and Rural Affairs; Ontario Pork; Business Economics Group, Wageningen University","Ontario Ministry of Agricultural Food and Rural Affairs; Ontario Pork; Business Economics Group, Wageningen University","The authors thank the CJAE editor and reviewers for their constructive comments.

Under regulation 1698/2005, agri-environmental scheme design has been established in such a way as to use CC as the baseline against which prescriptions and payments are identified. In this framework, agri-environmental payments to farmers are justified only for the component of public goods produced (if any) above the CC prescription level. This constraint has become a major determinant of the design of agri-environmental schemes in all EU Member States in which both instruments are implemented. This paper investigates farmer participation, compliance choices and the socially optimal level of monitoring when CC and agri-environmental schemes are jointly considered, and when information about compliance is asymmetrically distributed between farmers and the public regulator. The results show that the two policy instruments interact with each other, with agri-environmental payments actually providing incentives for CC, when the CC monitoring and sanction system does not guarantee full compliance. However, the numerical example in Emilia-Romagna (Italy) demonstrates that with the present combination of controls and sanctions, farmers have very little incentive to be compliant with both cross compliance and agri-environmental schemes. Hence, the results highlight that monitoring in CC or in AES does not have the same effect on the farmers compliance. This underscores the need for further research in this field, particularly as provision of environmental goods becomes more important in the future CAP.","[Bartolini, Fabio] Univ Pisa, Dept Agron & Ecosyst Management, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Gallerani, Vittorio; Viaggi, Davide] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Econ & Engn, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Raggi, Meri] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Pisa; University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Bartolini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Agron & Ecosyst Management, I-56100 Pisa, Italy.",fabio.bartolini@unibo.it,"Raggi, Meri/D-1260-2011; Viaggi, Davide/A-3223-2009; Bartolini, Fabio/C-5232-2011","Raggi, Meri/0000-0001-6960-1099; Bartolini, Fabio/0000-0002-8946-3110",,,,,30,25,27,0,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

We find that the existence of clusters of microenterprises in the same district increases the likelihood of a rural household to start a nonfarm enterprise. Similarly, clustering of big manufacturing firms in the same zone is found to increase the likelihood of farm households to start a nonfarm enterprise. Nonfarm enterprises operating in clusters are also found to have a lower probability of exit than those operating outside of clusters. The study further investigates the impact of entry and exit into and from nonfarm enterprises on farm household's well-being using as indicators total household income, the food security status of a household, and the household's ability to raise enough money in case of emergency. Using propensity score matching to account for selection bias, we find that entry into nonfarm enterprises significantly increases household's income and food security status. Exit from nonfarm enterprises, on the other hand, is found to significantly reduce household's income.","[Ali, Merima; Peerlings, Jack] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Ali, M (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",merima.ali@wur.nl,"Peerlings, Jack/C-8473-2015",,ESSP/IFPRI; EDRI; NUFFIC,ESSP/IFPRI; EDRI; NUFFIC,"We would like to thank anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

However, the lack of micro-level data, as well as computational requirements, necessitate the aggregation of individual producers into representative units when working at the sectoral level. This usually leads to unrealistic extreme specialization in supply responses. In 1982, McCarl introduced the historical crop mixes approach to avoid extreme specialization. We extend this approach by generating additional synthetic crop mixes using supply response elasticities and systematically varied commodity prices. In addition to avoiding extreme specialization, this approach provides flexibility when future supply responses can be vastly different from past responses.

The study is complementary to the large amount of microeconomic research that highlights the importance of support to agricultural industry. Data for the analysis are taken from the OECD Producer and Consumer Support Estimates database and the World Bank World Development Indicators 2010 database. The Producer Support Estimate - PSE (expressed in absolute value, in percent of the total farm revenues and per 1 hectare of agricultural land) was taken as the dependent variable, whereas the selected indicators describing the performance of the economies (e.g. GDP per capita, unemployment, fiscal balance, government debt, government expense and tax revenue, exchange rate, agriculture share in GDP and employment, agricultural raw materials exports and imports) were the independent variables. Utilizing these variables, a simple linear regression analysis was conducted and resulted in many significant associations. In the period analyzed, there was a wide gap between the most and least farm supporting countries in terms of the annual average percentage PSE and the PSE per hectare. Substantial differences between the countries in the variability of the PSE over the time occurred. The empirical results obtained from the regression models reveal, among other, that when the countries were becoming richer, the percentage PSE was generally decreasing. Mixed results were obtained for the relationship between the percentage PSE and unemployment, as in some countries it was negative, while in the others positive. Expansionary fiscal policy exerted opposite effects on the PSE in different countries. Labour productivity in agriculture was inversely correlated with the percentage PSE.","[Zawojska, Aldona] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Zawojska, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, 166 Nowoursynowska Str, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",aldona_zawojska@sggw.pl,"Zawojska, Aldona/C-9397-2011","Zawojska, Aldona/0000-0003-3668-0127; Siudek, Tomasz/0000-0001-8400-5631",,,,,48,4,4,2,19,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This has occurred while the shift from low to high food prices has induced a shift in (demographic or social) location of the hunger and poverty effects, but the total number of undernourished and poor people has declined over the same period. We suggest that the observed pattern can be explained by the presence of a global urban bias on agriculture and food policy in developing countries, and we discuss whether this global urban bias may actually benefit poor farmers. We argue that the food price spikes have succeeded where others have failed in the past: to move the problems of poor and hungry farmers to the top of the policy agenda and to induce development and donor strategies to help them.","[Guariso, Andrea; Squicciarini, Mara P.; Swinnen, Johan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Licos Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium; [Guariso, Andrea] Stockholm Univ, IIES, Stockholm, Sweden; [Squicciarini, Mara P.] Res Fdn Flanders, FWO, Brussels, Belgium",KU Leuven; Stockholm University,"Guariso, A (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Licos Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium.",andrea.guariso@kuleuven.be,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021; Guariso, Andrea/AAM-9787-2020","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978; Guariso, Andrea/0000-0003-2128-7322",KU Leuven (Methusalem Program); VLIR-UOS VLADOC; FWO,KU Leuven (Methusalem Program); VLIR-UOS VLADOC; FWO(FWO),"This research was financially supported by the KU Leuven (Methusalem Program), VLIR-UOS VLADOC, and FWO.",,57,7,9,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Using a large meta-data set of willingness-to-pay for diverse outdoor activities across various regions of the United States as an example, we find strong potential for contexts that would not traditionally be considered as transfer candidates to form information pools.

Design/methodology/approach - To understand the factors behind the wage change, the authors use the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition ( Oaxaca, 1973; Blinder, 1973) method to study the hourly wage change over this five-year period. Findings - The focus is on the rural-urban migration decision, the wage structure of migrants, the labor market segmentation between migrants and urban natives, and the changes of these aspects from 2002 to 2007. The paper finds that prior migration experience is a key factor for the migration decision of rural household members, and its importance keeps increasing from 2002 to 2007. The results show that there is a significant increase in wages among both migrants and urban natives over this five-year period, but migrants have enjoyed faster wage growth, and most of the increase of wages among migrants can be attributed to the increase of returns to their characteristics. The authors also find evidence suggesting convergence of urban labor markets for migrants and for urban natives during this five-year period. Research limitations/implications - In order to make the 2002 and 2007 data sets comparable, the authors had to restrict the observations with fixed residence only, and can only include seven cities. These limit the representativeness of the sample. When interpret the findings in this paper, it is important to keep this in mind. Originality/value - Due to the scarcity of data, there are few studies on the dynamics of the migrating population and the migrant labor market. Since the urban natives and migrants are still segmented in the labor market, the migrant labor market may have its own characteristics, and also, because of the increasing importance of the migrants in Chinese society, knowledge of the evolution of the migrant labor market is crucial for grasping the whole story behind the Chinese economic miracle.","[Qu, Zhaopeng Frank] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Renmin University of China,"Zhao, Z (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.",mr.zhong.zhao@gmail.com,,"Zhao, Zhong/0000-0003-3587-400X","IZA; ARC/AusAid; Ford Foundation; Ministry of Labor and Social Security of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of the Renmin University of China [10XNJ016]; Funds of Humanities and Social Science of Ministry of Education in China [10YJC790209]; Young Scholar Research Funds of Business School, Nanjing University","IZA; ARC/AusAid(Australian Research CouncilAustralian Aid (AusAID)); Ford Foundation; Ministry of Labor and Social Security of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of the Renmin University of China; Funds of Humanities and Social Science of Ministry of Education in China; Young Scholar Research Funds of Business School, Nanjing University","The authors would like to acknowledge helpful comments from Xin Meng, Shi Li, and participants in the first CIER/IZA Annual Workshop: Research in Labor Economics in 2009 and the 2009 International Symposium on Contemporary Labor Economics at the Xiamen University.

Since it was shown by Schmidt (Review of Economics and Statistics 58: 238) that the second step is equivalent to constrained maximisation of a likelihood function, we extend this idea and offer a copula-based approach to the estimation of the parameters of both meta- and group frontiers in a one-step setting. In this way, we ensure a single data-generating mechanism for the estimated parameters, expand the set of potential meta-frontiers and account for the fact that shocks to the individual production units may be correlated with shocks to the local technological environment as a whole. We apply our estimation methodology to a data set on the world agriculture and find that the deviations from the group frontiers are positively correlated with deviations from the meta-frontier, which is a conclusion that is impossible to reach without accounting for stochastic dependence between the two deviation types represented by a copula.","Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Commerce & Econ, Seoul 143701, South Korea",Konkuk University,"Repkine, A (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Commerce & Econ, 120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 143701, South Korea.",repkine@konkuk.ac.kr,,"Repkine, Alexandre/0000-0002-7831-3846",,,,,19,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We assess the extent to which impacts are related to a) the source of income affected - whether only from agricultural or total business income; b) the channel of the impact - through land use and/or labour input; and c) the level of impacts through time. In addition, we assess the appropriateness of the level of the ELS payment. We find that: a) entering the ELS scheme could negatively affect cereal farm incomes - in particular, the total business income; b) that negative impacts arise primarily in relation to the use of land resources; c) that impacts may diminish over a relatively short period of time; and d) that the ELS payment broadly compensates for losses without providing over compensation. Given the diminishing negative impact over time, the level of ELS payment might need to be reviewed in the longer term, although policy evaluation should consider the wider implications for efficiency of alternative payment levels. We also discuss some limitations of the approach and potential extensions.","[Udagawa, Chihiro] Cambridge Ctr Housing & Planning Res, Cambridge, England; [Hodge, Ian] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Reader, Mark] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Rural Business Unit, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Hodge, I (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",idh3@cam.ac.uk,,,Rural Business Research,Rural Business Research,"Chihiro Udagawa is a Research Associate in the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research.

The evolution of the labor market in sugarcane production in the country is analyzed together with its regional patterns of expansion, to illustrate how changes in the recent expansion are modifying the traditional pattern of labor demand in the activity. At the same time, the distributional effects of sugarcane expansion, as well as it's impacts on food security and land use change was approached with the aid of general equilibrium simulation models. The analysis shows that both the average earnings and the average years of schooling in sugarcane production are actually higher than in general agriculture in Brazil, and that this is linked to the growing increase in production in the Southeast and Central-West. Sugarcane production in these regions is more capital intensive and has a much higher productivity than in other traditional regions in Northeast Brazil. The study concludes that the expansion in sugarcane production according to actual patterns does not have a negative effect on poverty, and has only minor impacts on food prices and deforestation. The increase in the regional economic imbalances within the country appears to be the problem that requires attention.","Univ Sao Paulo, Depto Econ Adm & Sociol, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz ESALQ, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Ferreira, JBD (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Depto Econ Adm & Sociol, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz ESALQ, Av Padua Dias 11, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",jbsferre@usp.br,,,,,,,9,6,8,0,47,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The analysis contributes to the literature by measuring the quantitative effects of seed (as compared to fertilizer) subsidies on indicators of household well-being rather than input demand. We apply a combination of econometric approaches to a nationally representative, balanced panel of smallholder maize-growing households, and invoke the chain rule to generate quantitative estimates of impacts per kilogram of subsidized seed. Our findings demonstrate that in the initial years of the program, subsidized seed enhanced the well-being of smallholder maize growers according to each indicator, but by small magnitudes. Simple calculations suggest high private and social benefit-cost ratios when benefits are measured in terms of household income, although magnitudes are sensitive to seed price and administrative costs.","[Mason, Nicole M.; Smale, Melinda] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Mason, NM (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",masonn@msu.edu,,"Mason, Nicole/0000-0001-6835-7098",United States Agency for International Development Mission in Zambia,United States Agency for International Development Mission in Zambia(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support from the United States Agency for International Development Mission in Zambia.

However, predictions from a markup-pricing model such as high correlations between retail price and farm price and among prices across retailers in a city are not supported empirically. We document three common alternatives to markup pricing: fixed (constant) pricing, periodic sales, and high-low pricing. These results inform the development of a structural model of the vertical market chain in order to study the relationship among retailers and producers in a prototypical fresh produce market. A series of simulations under different pricing regimes are conducted to evaluate these pricing strategies' affects on farm price, farm income, and the variability of farm income. Results show that the alternative pricing strategies to markup pricing exacerbate farm price and income volatility compared to markup pricing. This enhanced farm-price volatility is also generally detrimental to farm income.","[Li, Chenguang] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA USA",University College Dublin; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Li, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,45,9,9,1,19,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

The results show strong increases in ownership of productive agricultural assets, in time devoted to household farms, and in food types consumed from own production, coupled with a sharp decrease in ganyu labor, which is often used as a coping mechanism once food stores have been depleted. These results are most likely achieved by helping farmers overcome credit and liquidity constraints.

However, the present study attempts to judge the essence of the Green Revolution in rice cultivation and its actual reflection regarding the factor contribution over four decades in West Bengal, India. The study measures the extent of technological change in rice cultivation using the Divisia-Tornqvist 'Iheil index model for computing the total factor productivity (TFP) of rice for the state of West Bengal. Subsequently, the spatial change in the TFP as well as a comparative study on productivity, input use, break-up of cost components and economic return in the paddy cultivation over different size classes across all agro-climatic zones of West Bengal has been made in order to identify the most promising zone regarding technological advancement in rice cultivation. The study reveals that technological change in rice cultivation has occurred in the state of West Bengal for the entire four decades while its extent has not been equally disseminated in decades. The effect of the productivity change was robust in the 2nd decade (1981-1982 to 1991-1992) with a 4.19% TFP growth rate indicating that the good effect of the Green Revolution has began to start regarding the technological change in rice cultivation over West Bengal. On the other hand, the TFPrice results in the state have given a dismal picture in the later phases under study where it starts dedining with the change of time. At the end decade (2001-2002 to 2009-2010), the TFP growth has been found to be negative (-0.69) reflecting ill effects of a higher use of inorganic fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides to corrupt the soil fertility status of the state. It is the quality HYV seed that dominates among all factor contributors for the overall TFPrice change along with the human labour use. Farm mechanization enters after the 90s indicating a major reform in the context of the technology adoption by the rice growers in the state. The region-wise scenario of rice cultivation in the state has proved that the Gangetic Alluvial tract has been the better technology adopter with higher TFP indices as compared to the problematic regions like the Red Lateratic zone and the Coastal Saline belt, the reason of which might be the improved fertility status of soil with a large number of progressive paddy growers operating in terms of a better knowledge gaining, a better education and extension.","[Chatterjee, Soumitra; Gupta, Saurav] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani, W Bengal, India",Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University,"Chatterjee, S (通讯作者)，Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Res Directorate, AICRP Integrated Farming Syst, Nadia 741235, W Bengal, India.",soumitra.soum123123@gmail.com; saurav.bckv@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,1,2,2,20,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The results show that the parental migration increases the probability of deficiency in the energy and protein intake of children left at home. Although several studies have pointed out that the parental remittances can increase the economic well-being of their children at home, this study points to an undesired cost of the parental migration. Governments should establish effective policies to promote the benefits of migration while minimizing the potential costs.

Design/methodology/approach - The simulation was conducted using a static spatial equilibrium model (SEM) of the world cotton market. First, a base model was specified to provide a good representation of the world cotton market's conditions. Second, simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of replacing the SSD and subsidizing cotton producers pursuant to the current or potential WTO rules on domestic cotton support. Findings - The results of the simulations suggest that China's cotton farmers are bound to incur losses. In either case, cotton subsidies permitted by the current or potential WTO rules are not sufficient to compensate for the cost to China's cotton producers if the SSD is eliminated. Research limitations/implications - It should be pointed out that these findings could suffer from a bias, primarily because the authors assumed that the WTO's blue box subsidies have no incentives for farmers to produce, and no substitution between cotton and alternative products. Thus, additional work is needed to reflect a more realistic situation in future studies. Originality/value - The simulation estimation contributes to a better understanding of the issue of whether China should replace the current SSD with cotton subsidies to protect cotton producers.","[Wang, Xuejun] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fukuoka 812, Japan; [Maeda, Koshi] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fukuoka 812, Japan; [Mao, Xuefeng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Renmin University of China,"Wang, XJ (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fukuoka 812, Japan.",wangxj@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23580306] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,16,2,2,1,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The paper provides empirical evidence on the price transmission among the producer, wholesale, and retail markets of liquid milk in Slovakia, using the monthly data from 1993 to 2010. The empirical analysis is based on the Granger causality and the Johansen cointegration tests and on the asymmetry tests (Houck approach and error correction model approach). The causality test results show that the changes in producer prices cause changes in the wholesale and retail prices; there is a feedback from the retail to producer prices. Moreover, the direction of causality between the wholesale and retail prices flows in both directions. The long-run elasticities of price transmission are, as expected, greater than the short-run elasticities. The cointegration results indicate that the wholesale and producer prices as well as the retail and producer prices are cointegrated, but there is no evidence of cointegration between the wholesale and retail prices. The results of an asymmetric error correction models suggest that the price transmission in the Slovakian liquid milk market is asymmetric both in the short- and long-runs.","[Weldesenbet, Tesfu] Minist Agr & Rural Dev Slovak Republ, Agr Policy & Budget Sect, Bratislava 81266, Slovakia",,"Weldesenbet, T (通讯作者)，Minist Agr & Rural Dev Slovak Republ, Dobrovicova 12, Bratislava 81266, Slovakia.",Tesfu.Weldesenbet@land.gov.sk,,,,,,,30,13,13,0,11,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)-plus provisions included in recent free trade agreements between the developed and developing countries show a tendency of the developed world to impose their high standards for protection of plant intellectual property on the developing world. While stronger intellectual property rights can increase international exchange in seed, market power effect can lead to a reduction in exports of seed to foreign markets. This article estimates the impact of intellectual property rights on U.S. seed exports. The estimation is performed at a crop level using Heckman selection model. The results reveal that the impact of intellectual property rights varies across different types of cropsopen-pollinated, genetically modified, and hybrid crops. While TRIPS provisions are important to facilitate transfer of genetically modified crops, they play a minor role for open-pollinated and hybrid crops. The results also show that plant breeders rights envisioned by the UPOV system can be important to promote seed exchange when proper mechanisms are put in place to enforce these rights.","Univ Regina, Dept Econ, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",University of Regina,"Galushko, V (通讯作者)，Univ Regina, Dept Econ, 3737 Wascana Pkwy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",viktoriya.galushko@uregina.ca,,,University of Regina,University of Regina,"The author thanks the University of Regina for providing a start-up research grant to conduct the research.

Theoretical models for asset-rich (i.e., high-caste) households, rich in land and livestock, and asset-poor (i.e., low-caste families) households are presented to provide logical explanations for the existence of a livestock rental market and the synergy between livestock and land rental markets participation. A combination of double hurdle models and bivariate-ordered probit models were used to test the implications of the models. Consistent with the theoretical models, land- and livestock-rich high-caste households were more likely to rent out land and/or livestock, whereas land- and livestock-poor and credit constrained low-caste households were more likely to rent livestock and land from others. Participation in the two markets was positively correlated, indicating a synergistic relationship that may be due to production and transaction costs reducing benefits. Policies that can enhance the allocative efficiency of livestock and land rental markets can improve equity as well as efficiency of land use in Nepal. Provision of livestock credit to land-poor low-caste households is also crucially dependent on their access to more long-term contracts for land.","[Aryal, Jeetendra P.; Holden, Stein T.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci UMB, Dept Econ & Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Aryal, JP (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci UMB, Dept Econ & Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",jeetendra.aryal@umb.no,"Holden, Stein/AAD-4502-2019","Holden, Stein T./0000-0001-7502-2392; Aryal, Jeetendra/0000-0002-9128-5739",Department of Economics and Resource Management at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Norway,Department of Economics and Resource Management at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Norway,"We are indebted to the Department of Economics and Resource Management at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Norway for part of the financial support required for conducting the field survey.

Using aggregate national data, we build a mixed-frequency herd dynamics econometric model of the U.S. milk supply that updates and substantially amends the model first proposed by Chavas and Klemme. We implement a dynamic residual-based bootstrap technique that can be used in testing for changes in nonmarginal simulated long-run supply responsiveness, and trace the evolution of long-run milk supply elasticity from 1975 through 2010. Several papers in the past have suggested that long-run supply elasticity increases with dairy farm size, which implies that increased importance of large farms would increase aggregate long-run supply responsiveness. Contrary to this conclusion, we find a declining trend in long-run supply elasticity from 1975 through 2005. Persistence of such a decline would be a major cause for worry, as ever larger price swings would be needed to equilibrate the market in face of demand shocks. However, we find that milk supply is becoming more responsive since 2005 both to milk and feed price changes. Increasing responsiveness to feed prices further justifies focusing the next generation of the dairy policy instruments on managing dairy profit margins rather than just revenue streams.","[Bozic, Marin] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Kanter, Christopher A.; Gould, Brian W.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53716 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Bozic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Appl Econ, 317C Ruttan Hall,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",mbozic@umn.edu,,,,,,,26,8,13,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

More than a decade later, significant changes to the means tested arrangements are yet to be introduced, whilst the pressure to achieve long-term reform mounts linked to increases in public expenditure and ever growing demand for better services. This paper examines the pros and cons of alternative options for reforming the English long-term care funding arrangements by examining the rationale for and consequences of the recent long-term care developments in Germany, Japan and France. In particular, the paper examines the implications of the reform options adopted in the different countries examined for equity and efficiency in the use of long-term care resources and for the sustainability of the long-term care system as a whole.","[Forder, Julien] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Fernandez, Jose-Luis; Forder, Julien] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, PSSRU, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Kent; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Forder, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.",j.forder@lse.ac.uk,"Hayashi, Mayumi/G-8961-2013; Fernandez, Jose-Luis/D-2451-2010","Hayashi, Mayumi/0000-0002-5666-8718; Fernandez, Jose-Luis/0000-0002-4190-7341","BUPA, an international healthcare group base in the UK","BUPA, an international healthcare group base in the UK","This paper builds on research commissioned and funded by BUPA, an international healthcare group base in the UK.

These are not as clearly defined for agroforestry, a practice experiencing increased interest in the USA. This study examined the barriers preventing the adoption of agroforestry within a household level theoretical framework informed by transaction costs and multifunctionality, using survey data from 353 Missouri (USA) landowners. Costs of establishing or managing trees, the time required to manage, and the lack of tree management experience are perceived as the most influential barriers limiting implementation of agroforestry on the farm. A principal component factor analysis of the perceived barriers identified two factors: the first, labeled Transaction Costs, related to information access and perceived establishment costs; the second factor, labeled Profitability Concerns, was associated with perceptions of the effects of agroforestry on farm profitability and agricultural production. Overall, Transaction Costs appears to be a greater barrier to implementation of agroforestry. Cluster analysis yielded three types of landowners: environmentalists, agriculturalists, and disengaged, who differ in their perceptions of these barriers. Statistical tests revealed differences among clusters on their farmland attributes, multifunctionality indicators, and their resources for adopting agroforestry. Environmentalists appear as more likely to adopt agroforestry, followed by the agriculturalists. Policy implications are also discussed.","[Valdivia, Corinne] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Barbieri, Carla] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Gold, Michael A.] Univ Missouri, Ctr Agroforestry, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Valdivia, C (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 210 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",valdiviac@missouri.edu; barbieric@missouri.edu; goldm@missouri.edu,,"Barbieri, Carla/0000-0001-8079-2316",University of Missouri Center for Agroforestry [58-6227-1-004]; ARS [CR 826704-01-2]; US EPA,University of Missouri Center for Agroforestry; ARS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service); US EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"Our appreciation to Dr. Laura McCann (University of Missouri) and to the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and helpful insights on earlier versions of this paper.

The main objective of this study is to investigate the determinants of farmers perception and their decision to participate in cooperatives, using a unique dataset from recently collected survey data of farming households in Chinas Jilin Province.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the impacts of China's agricultural technological changes on its regional disparity. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of multiple regions and multiple sectors to investigate the impacts of agricultural technological changes on regional disparity. The CGE model structure includes production side, demand side, and market clearing conditions. Findings - The results suggest that agricultural technological changes significantly reduced China's agricultural regional disparity and accounted for 40 percent reduction in agricultural regional disparity in terms of agricultural GDP per capita. Agricultural technological changes, however, led to an increase in China's overall regional disparity and accounted for 6 percent increase in its overall regional disparity in terms of per capita GDP. Practical implications - China's GDP has been growing very rapidly since 1978 and agricultural GDP has been playing a decreasing role in China's overall GDP. Regional disparity in non-agricultural GDP per capita overweighted the equalization of agricultural GDP per capita. The results imply that the Chinese government should resort more to non-agricultural development to fight against the enlarging regional disparity. Originality/value - China's agricultural technological changes have led to an increase in China's overall regional disparity while the changes have significantly reduced China's agricultural regional disparity.","[Wang, Xiuqing; Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaoyun] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiuqing] China Agr Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Xin, X (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",xinxian@cau.edu.cn,"Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023",,Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2005EP010007-1],"Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","The earlier version of this paper is a contributed paper prepared for presentation at the International Association of Agricultural Economists Conference, Beijing, China, August 16-22, 2009 and the authors would like to thank comments received at the conference.

The purpose of this paper is to answer the following questions: Has China's agricultural output experienced a structural break toward a more stable state? When did the break point happen? What factors did play key roles during the transformation? Design/methodology/approach - This study applies the nonlinear structural break regime switching analysis which includes two different models: one with the structural break only in the variance and one with the structural break in both shift parameters and the variance. Findings - The empirical results showed that it took five years for agricultural development in China to finish the reform that began in 1980. The agricultural growth had become more stable after the break point which was around 1985-1986. Both the primary industry and agricultural sector had transformed from a low growth rate, high volatility state to a high growth rate, low volatility state: Among the different driving factors, the Household Responsibility System (HRS) and preferential policies for agricultural products played the most important roles in the early stage of the economic reform. Originality/value - The authors first study the structural break of China's agricultural output by the regime switching model. From the empirical results, the structural break point was determined to be around 1985-1986, after which China's agricultural output had become more stable.","[Lu, Jie] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Angang; Yan, Yilong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Tsinghua University,"Lu, J (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lujie@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,27,3,3,1,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - An Engel curve model is fit to the household data of nine food categories and 35 food items, and both conditional and unconditional expenditure elasticities of demand are calculated and reported for the nine food groups and the 35 food items. Findings - Working's model fits the data well, and the elasticity estimates are all reasonable in terms of economic theory, size and signs. The results indicate a relative large range in income sensitivity among the nine food groups and 35 food items in response to changes in household food expenditure levels. Originality/value - The research analyzes unique and rich urban household survey data collected by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is the most comprehensive analysis to date in terms of the number of food items studied for which expenditure elasticities are calculated. These elasticities may be used to study household food consumption patterns, to calculate caloric or nutrient elasticities, to study obesity in China, to study policy prescriptions in terms of taxes and subsidies on food, to infer welfare and affluence, and may be used as inputs into econometric models such as those used by the World Bank, IFPRI, and others.","[Seale, James L., Jr.] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bai, Junfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wahl, Thomas I.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Lohmar, Bryan T.] Bunge China, Shanghai, Peoples R China",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Chinese Academy of Sciences; North Dakota State University Fargo,"Seale, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jseale@ufl.edu,"Wahl, Thomas/D-3272-2013","Wahl, Thomas/0000-0003-2154-6742","National Natural Science Foundation of China [70903062]; Economic Research Service, US Department of Agriculture [58-8000-8-0027]; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program [09093019]; NIFA, US Department of Agriculture; Commodity Credit Corporation, US Department of Agriculture [2010-27]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Economic Research Service, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program; NIFA, US Department of Agriculture; Commodity Credit Corporation, US Department of Agriculture","The authors thank the Editor Xian Xin and an anonymous referee for useful comments.

Psychologists have developed two main tools, namely time pressure and cognitive load, to disentangle the two motives. This implies values of willingness to pay (WTP) may be sensitive to time pressure and cognitive load levels in practice. An experiment with 233 students was conducted in China to study the willingness to pay for organic food with consideration of different time pressures and cognitive load levels. Results show that (1) increasing cognitive load could significantly reduce consumers' WTP for organic food; and (2) time pressure does not have a significant impact on WTP values. Such results suggest researchers should be particularly cautious about the cognitive load situations of respondents during a WTP survey.","[Yu, Xiaohua; Yan, Binjian] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaohua] Univ Gottingen, CRC PEG, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Gao, Zhifeng] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Gottingen; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Yu, XH (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Weigang 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xyu@uni-goettingen.de,"Gao, Zhifeng/AFD-7759-2022","Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081; Gao, Zhifeng/0000-0003-2984-8278","German Research Foundation (DFG) [RTG 1666]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [70903039, 71333008, 71273006]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are very grateful to the editor Prof. Gerald Shively, Dr. Te Bao, and three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

In response to expected increasing food prices and greater food price volatility, national governments are pursuing a variety of policies. Some policies amplify price fluctuations while others attempt to prohibit price signals from reaching domestic markets. Extreme weather events, irrational expectations by speculators, sensationalism by the news media, oil price fluctuations and the pursuit of self-interests by international organisations, NGOs and the private sector, have created a sense of uncertainty and heightened political risks among many governments, pushing governments towards crisis management, short-term political interventions and bandaid solutions. This paper discusses these interventions, the associated policy challenges and related policies. The paper will argue that food price volatility will continue to be with us, but that real food prices need not increase. It will further show that the main bottlenecks in expanding food production in most low-income developing countries are found outside the farm and that government intervention in the food system should focus on improvements in rural infrastructure, domestic markets and policies to facilitate efficiency and effectiveness in postharvest value chains and input sectors. Full costing of environmental damage is suggested to be pursued to help assure sustainability.","[Pinstrup-Andersen, Per] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Pinstrup-Andersen, Per] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",Cornell University; University of Copenhagen,"Pinstrup-Andersen, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",pp94@cornell.edu,,,,,,,40,7,7,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Nonetheless, there is one issue, which is barely mentioned in the literature: how to enforce the contract terms when traders offer credit in cash rather than input advances? This article aims to describe an innovation in farming contracts, used by fresh fruit and vegetable wholesalers in Turkey, which involves a kind of private voucher system. Drawing on original data collected from wholesalers-a segment in the supply chain hardly covered in the literature-we investigate the factors determining contract adoption using a two-limit Tobit model.

We examine distributional and well-being effects of nonfarm employment of rural households in the Himalayas. We account for heterogeneity of nonfarm employment, and estimate a system of structural equations to better understand the causal linkages between nonfarm employment and household well-being. The results confirm that disaggregating nonfarm employment activities matters for understanding the relationship between nonfarm employment and rural welfare. While low-return nonfarm employment is associated with lower income inequality, high-return nonfarm activities have a disequalizing effect on the distribution of household incomes. We also find that the ability to engage in high-return nonfarm activities is associated with higher economic well-being. Poor households, on the other hand, tend to rely on low-return activities that do not contribute to improved well-being.","[Scharf, Maja Micevska] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Scharf, Maja Micevska] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [Rahut, Dil Bahadur] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Socioecon Program, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Scharf, Maja Micevska] Webster Univ Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Scharf, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.micevska@uva.nl,"Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022","Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271; Micevska, Maja/0000-0001-7943-8504",German Corporation for Technical Cooperation,German Corporation for Technical Cooperation,"Maja Micevska Scharf is a researcher at the University of Amsterdam and CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.

This involves an adequate measurement of poverty and appropriate approaches for defining poverty lines. This paper analyzes the extent to which poverty measures are sensitive to alternative ways of adjusting national lines by spatial price differences. First, we analyze how moving from national to regional poverty lines has an impact on the incidence and intensity of poverty. Second, we show how poverty patterns vary with alternative definitions of poverty thresholds. Using data from all Spanish regions, our results show that regional levels of poverty change with each threshold, and the orderings of regions do not remain robust to the choice of poverty lines. We also show that re-rankings are more relevant for explaining differences in the regional distribution of poverty than gap-narrowing effects when a region-specific poverty line is used. A second finding resulting from probability models and decomposition methods is that poverty profiles vary as different lines are used. In general terms, our findings provide general support to the notion that poverty policies that do not address the problem of spatial price differences might yield relevant assignment errors.","[Ayala, Luis] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Appl Econ 2, Madrid, Spain; [Jurado, Antonio; Perez-Mayo, Jesus] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad de Extremadura,"Ayala, L (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Appl Econ 2, Madrid, Spain.",luis.ayala@urjc.es,"Ayala, Luis/AAA-2231-2019; Pérez-Mayo, Jesús/D-9424-2016; Ayala, Luis/ABF-8664-2021; Jurado, Antonio/GYJ-7544-2022","Pérez-Mayo, Jesús/0000-0001-6757-7857; Jurado, Antonio/0000-0003-1407-5954",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2010-21668-C03-01]; Junta de Extremadura and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [PRI08A137],Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Junta de Extremadura and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),Luis Ayala acknowledges financial support from the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (ECO2010-21668-C03-01).

Tests of market price co-integration (Johansen maximum likelihood test and residual-based tests) as well as threshold error correction techniques were performed for this purpose. The results suggest that Russian wheat prices were co-integrated with EU and U.S. wheat prices but not with Canadian wheat prices. Ukrainian wheat prices were found to be co-integrated with French wheat prices only. The estimated long-run wheat price transmission elasticities were estimated to be equal to 1.04 between Russian and French (a representative country of the EU) wheat prices, 1.16 between Russian and U.S. wheat prices, and 1.05 between Ukrainian and French wheat prices.

We organized a discriminatory auction where farmers were asked to make bids on spreading gypsum on their fields to reduce phosphorus loads to surface waters. The parcel-specific bids were ranked based on their load reduction-compensation ratios. To assess load reductions, we built an environmental benefit index (EBI) based on three factors: P-status of the soil (phosphorus available for crops), field slope and location with respect to waterways. As the per tonne price of gypsum delivery from the factory was higher for small quantities, the auction format allowed bundling of field parcels to reduce transportation costs. We evaluate auction's ability to target the environmental (or abatement) measures to field parcels with the highest load reduction potential and analyse the economic efficiency of the auction by comparing the pilot auction with simulated bidding behaviour and with hypothetical flat rate payment schemes. The pilot auction targeted the environmental measures effectively.

In the course of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), five global agro-economic models were used to analyze a future scenario with global demand for ligno-cellulosic bioenergy rising to about 100 ExaJoule in 2050. From this exercise a tentative conclusion can be drawn that ambitious climate change mitigation need not drive up global food prices much, if the extra land required for bioenergy production is accessible or if the feedstock, for example, from forests, does not directly compete for agricultural land. Agricultural price effects across models by the year 2050 from high bioenergy demand in an ambitious mitigation scenario appear to be much smaller (+5% average across models) than from direct climate impacts on crop yields in a high-emission scenario (+25% average across models). However, potential future scarcities of water and nutrients, policy-induced restrictions on agricultural land expansion, as well as potential welfare losses have not been specifically looked at in this exercise.","[Lotze-Campen, Hermann; Popp, Alexander; Schmitz, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [von Lampe, Martin] OECD, TAD, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Kyle, Page; Wise, Marshall] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Hasegawa, Tomoko] Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, NIES, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Havlik, Petr; Valin, Hugo] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [van Meijl, Hans; Tabeau, Andrzej] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, NL-2585 DB The Hague, Netherlands; [Willenbockel, Dirk] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Wageningen University & Research; University of Sussex,"Lotze-Campen, H (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Telegrafenberg A 31, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",lotze-campen@pik-potsdam.de,"Willenbockel, Dirk/AAC-2191-2021; Lotze-Campen, Hermann/AAA-5093-2020; Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Popp, Alexander/N-7064-2014; Valin, Hugo/Z-1557-2019; Kyle, Page/AFP-3602-2022; van Meijl, Hans/G-6223-2015; Tabeau, Andrzej/AAE-8214-2019; Hasegawa, Tomoko/AAB-2616-2019","Willenbockel, Dirk/0000-0002-6840-0954; Lotze-Campen, Hermann/0000-0002-0003-5508; Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; Popp, Alexander/0000-0001-9500-1986; Valin, Hugo/0000-0002-0618-773X; van Meijl, Hans/0000-0002-2455-6869; Hasegawa, Tomoko/0000-0003-2456-5789; Kyle, Page/0000-0002-1257-8358; Havlik, Petr/0000-0001-5551-5085","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); British government; EU; Integrated Assessment Research Program of the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); British government; EU(European Union (EU)); Integrated Assessment Research Program of the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy","This article is a contribution to the global economic model intercomparison activity undertaken as part of the AgMIP Project (www.agmip.org).

Using the data from a unique household survey in rural China, this paper aims to examine the importance of local spillovers in the diffusion of two major durable goods, washing machine and refrigerator. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a 1999 rural household survey of durable goods consumption conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China, the authors examine the likelihood of rural households adopting a washing machine and a refrigerator during 1998-1999, respectively. Findings - The estimation results indicate that a household is more likely to buy its first durable good in villages where a large share of households already own one. Further evidence suggests that these patterns are unlikely to be explained by unobserved local characteristics. When examined in more detail, the extent of local spillovers appears to be positively related to the household education level. Originality/value - First, the study reveals the importance of local spillovers in the diffusion of these two durables. Specifically, 64 percent of washing machine adoptions during 1998-1999 are due to these spillovers. For refrigerator adoptions, the proportion is 55 percent. Second, to the authors' best knowledge, the authors are among the first to test and provide evidence on the interaction between education level and local spillovers based on the learning hypothesis.","[Rong, Zhao] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yao] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Rong, Z (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",rongzhao1974@yahoo.com.cn,"Rong, Zhao/GXZ-5977-2022; Rong, Zhao/Y-9403-2019",,Southwestern University of Finance and Economics,Southwestern University of Finance and Economics,"The authors would like to thank Shihe Fu, Han Li, and Yan Yuan for their helpful comments.

In the article, there are calculated the expenditure elasticities and the own and cross non-compensated price elasticities of main vegetable products of these countries by using the LA-AIDS model. There are used the elasticity estimates to decompose the recent demand fluctuations into price effect, income effect and population effect for each country. Th en the ways for the government to improve the protein and energy intake after calculating the vegetable protein and calories elasticities are compared. Wheat and rice in these countries are relatively price inelastic. For these three countries, the population development (as well as the revenue for India and Bangladesh) appears to be the most important and regular cause of the augmentation of demand for vegetable products. A combination of income and price policies may be more effective in influencing the consumption pattern. The government should aim at improving the income level of most vulnerable consumers (low income group) in these countries.","[Yaseen, Muhammad Rizwan; Ali, Qasim] Govt Coll Univ, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Mehmood, Irfan] Pakistan Agr Res Council, Faisalabad, Pakistan",Government College University Faisalabad; National Agricultural Research Council - Pakistan,"Yaseen, MR (通讯作者)，Govt Coll Univ, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",rizwany2001@yahoo.com,"Yaseen, Muhammad/HRD-0037-2023; Yaseen, Muhammad rizwan/JVM-8525-2024","Yaseen, Muhammad rizwan/0000-0002-1019-6989",,,,,33,1,1,0,9,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Profits accrued while dealing in e. g. commodity futures do not just depend on the development of the futures or the underlying commodity, but on the transaction costs as well. In the commodity futures markets, transaction costs - usually addressed as the bid/ask spread - are influenced if not set by the market makers (liquidity providers) and other intermediaries that broker the contracts. This paper tests the assumption that liquidity providers have the ability to shift prices, and this ability is negatively correlated with the degree of competition. Using Roll's measure (1984) to estimate the bid/ask spread, the authors can show that liquidity providers do have an influence on prices. To put this result into context, the margin for market makers is calculated on the basis of transactions in wheat-futures at the Euronext Paris that took place in May 2012, ranges between 0.0047% and 0.0055%.

The supplementary seed voucher program, implemented alongside the ERI adopted a randomized control trial to grant randomly selected farmers access to subsidized certified improved rice seed using the seed voucher system (SVS). In this study, we provide a consistent estimate of the impact of the SVS on Poverty reduction, using mixed methodologies such as inverse propensity score weighing (IPSW) and the local average treatment effect (LATE) estimation techniques. Results show that the SVS has a positive and statistically significant impact on annual household income and per capita consumption expenditure. This study shows that availability of good quality seed at an affordable price can raise agricultural productivity, increase household income and contribute to poverty reduction.","[Awotide, Bola Amoke] Univ Ibadan, Dept Agr Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Karimov, Aziz] United Nations Univ World Inst Dev Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Diagne, Aliou; Nakelse, Tebila] Africa Rice Ctr, Impact Assessment Program, Cotonou, Benin",University of Ibadan; CGIAR; Africa Rice Center,"Awotide, BA (通讯作者)，Univ Ibadan, Dept Agr Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria.",bawotide@yahoo.com,"Karimov, Aziz A./ABD-3423-2021","Karimov, Aziz/0000-0001-8223-5687",USAID,USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This study benefited immensely from the financial support of USAID and the scientific support of the Africa Rice Center, Cotonou, Benin.

Two theories guide the discussion: (i) high ICs increase the overall cost of the programme and thus reduce the funding efficiency and(ii) high ICs increase the practical efficiency of programmes because they are associated with more targeted and more effective measures.

Among the many factors that affect farm livelihoods, access to credit has been identified as a significant barrier preventing the escape from poverty. While there has been significant research on credit constraints in developing countries, there is surprisingly little information pertaining to the actual impacts of credit constraints on household well-being. The objective of this paper is to investigate the impacts of credit constraints on various factors affecting farm households, such as physical and human capital formation, agricultural inputs applications, consumption smoothing, and wage-seeking behavior using direct elicitation. This paper contributes to the literature and policy debates by comparing the effects of credit constraints in China and India as surveyed in 20082009. The analytical results and data demonstrate that binding credit constraints adversely affect a broad range of production and livelihood choices. We empirically show that credit constraints negatively affect food consumption, farm input applications, and health and educational attainments.","[Kumar, Chandra S.] Govt Odisha, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India; [Turvey, Calum G.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kropp, Jaclyn D.] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Cornell University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Turvey, CG (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",cgt6@cornell.edu,,,Cornell University,Cornell University,"Funding for this research was provided by W.I.

The suggestion from the combined National Sample Survey and Palanpur data is of a slow process of nonfarm diversification, whose distributional incidence, on the margin, is increasingly pro-poor. The village-level analysis documents that the nonfarm sector is not only increasing incomes and reducing poverty, but appears as well to be breaking down long-standing barriers to mobility among the poorest segments of rural society. Efforts by the government of India to accelerate the process of diversification could thus yield significant returns in terms of declining poverty and increased income mobility. The evidence from Palanpur also shows, however, that at the village-level a significant increase in income inequality has accompanied diversification away from the farm. A growing literature argues that such a rise in inequality could affect the fabric of village society, the way in which village institutions function and evolve, and the scope for collective action at the village level. Failure to keep such inequalities in check could thus undermine the pro-poor impacts from the process of structural transformation currently underway in rural India.","[Himanshu] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi 110067, India; [Lanjouw, Peter; Murgai, Rinku] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Stern, Nicholas] London Sch Econ, London WC2 2AE, England","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; The World Bank; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science","Lanjouw, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",Planjouw@worldbank.org,,"Himanshu, Himanshu/0000-0002-7200-2510; Lanjouw, Peter/0000-0002-4150-7890",UK Department of International Development,UK Department of International Development,"This article arises out of an ongoing project to resurvey the village of Palanpur in 2008-2009 funded by the UK Department of International Development.

Here, a discrete choice experiment is used to estimate how the community values the ecology of the Ningaloo Marine Park, with a view to understanding the drivers of social welfare in relation to marine conservation. A novel aspect of this research is that it not only considers the values people hold for conservation outcomes, but also their preferences for how those outcomes are achieved. The results indicate that management process does have an impact on individuals' preferences for conservation. By considering management process within the choice model, we gain a richer understanding of the relationship between social welfare and marine conservation.

Using county-level, administrative data on redemption of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by store type from May 2007 to May 2010, this paper investigates aggregate responses of SNAP participants to economic and policy changes. Results show that SNAP benefit increases, in general, are associated with a greater percentage of redemptions at superstores. However, other circumstances associated with the large increase in benefits enacted in April 2009 as a part of the stimulus bill reverse the positive effect. Estimates are stable across a number of specifications that also control for gas prices, store-type density, local unemployment and state policies. Results suggest that economic incentives deserve further consideration as an alternative to store development in food desert communities.","[Andrews, Margaret; Ploeg, Michele Ver] ERS, Food Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC USA; [Bhatta, Rhea] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Lehigh University,"Ploeg, MV (通讯作者)，ERS, Food Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC USA.",sverploeg@ers.usda.gov,,"Ver Ploeg, Michele/0000-0001-8476-7281",,,,,27,10,24,0,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

As such, the price ratio between fish meal and soybean meal has received much attention as an indicator of changing market conditions. In recent years, the price ratio between these two commodities has become more volatile. Several authors have suggested that the traditional relationship between fish meal and soybean meal has broken down and that this is evidence of increased demand pressure on fish meal. In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that there are two regimes for the relative price between fish meal and soybean meal. The empirical results support this hypothesis, with the low-price regime representing the traditional stable relative price. The continued linkages between the fish meal and the soybean meal markets indicate that aquaculture is reducing its dependency on marine proteins in favour of vegetable proteins.","[Asche, Frank; Oglend, Atle] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway; [Tveteras, Sigbjorn] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CTR Catolica, Lima, Peru",Universitetet i Stavanger; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway.",fran-k.asche@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020; Tveteraas, SIgbjorn/Y-2283-2019","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728;",,,,,41,59,66,4,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The crisis had an impact on all segments of the merchandise trade, whereby the trade in agricultural and food products was affected the least by the crisis. In the case of the Czech Republic, the crisis of the global and national economy was reflected in the case of agricultural trade primarily by the way of a decline in the rate of the growth of export, which was very high in the period prior to the crisis. As far as the territorial structure and commodity structure of agricultural trade is concerned, their development in the years 2008-2011 was not affected in any largely significant manner.

Our estimates show that crop price levels, crop and livestock farm income, compliance costs, and greenhouse gas emissions are all sensitive to whether and how the cellulosic mandate is waived.

However, in certain markets for alcoholic drinks particularly wine price is not only a cost but also an indicator of quality, guiding consumer choice. There is, perhaps, a higher probability of ex post satisfaction with products at higher prices in a market with potential adverse selection. The pricequality proxy interacts with discounts, where the full price of the product before discount (referred to as the External Reference Price in the marketing literature) is used as a quality reference. This study shows that an alcohol tax in the presence of discounting may increase the perceived value of the product, and therefore persuade consumers to prefer the purchase of more expensive wines with the highest discount. As a consequence, consumers could favour products with higher alcohol content which contradicts the objectives of the policy. Consequently, for an alcohol tax to be effective discounting of alcoholic beverages (in particular, wine) should be regulated to avoid the policy backfiring.","[Panzone, Luca A.] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Panzone, Luca A.] Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Panzone, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",luca.panz-one@manchester.ac.uk,"Panzone, Luca/I-3086-2019","Panzone, Luca/0000-0003-2382-3635",,,,,62,6,8,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

A partial generalized ordered logit is used to test the main predictions of the model and a Brant test on threshold constancy is performed to identify the household-specific factors affecting labor market participation. The results show that liquidity constraints and market imperfections matter in the choice of the labor strategy adopted.

Economists have invoked at least five distinct theories of ownership or property rights in their work. Unfortunately, authors frequently fail to acknowledge the existence of competing theories of property rights that stand as conceptual rivals to the theory that they, often implicitly, invoke. Nowhere is this problem more evident than in the literature on regulatory takings, a literature that has a justifiable reputation for its inconsistent conclusions. Other fields in which theories of property rights play an important role include intellectual property, the economics of contracts, competition analysis and policy, externalities, and the economics of information. This article compares and evaluates five competing theories of property rights that have been advanced and used by economists: classical liberalism, utilitarianism, legal positivism, pragmatism, and modern libertarianism. These theories present divergent accounts of the origin and the nature of ownership claims. They also conceptualize the evolution of ownership institutions as well as ownership patterns quite differently. There are also important differences in incentives that exist under institutional regimes based on each theory.","[Fox, Glenn] Univ Guelph, Canadian Agr Econ Soc, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Fox, Glenn] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Fox, G (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Canadian Agr Econ Soc, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",gfox@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,67,4,5,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Using simulation modeling, we examine implications of standard culling plus emergency ring vaccination strategies on animal loss and economic welfare loss compared to a standard culling base. Additionally, breakeven risk aversion coefficient analysis is used to examine emergency vaccination as a risk management strategy. Results indicate that response enhanced with emergency vaccination is inferior to standard culling under short diagnostic delays because it causes, on average, greater animal and national economic welfare losses. We find that emergency vaccination does have merit as a risk management strategy, as it can reduce the likelihood of an extreme outbreak.","[Hagerman, Amy D.] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [McCarl, Bruce A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Carpenter, Tim E.; O'Brien, Joshua] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, CADMS, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ward, Michael P.] Univ Sydney, Fac Vet Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Sydney,"Hagerman, AD (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",ahagerman@ers.usda.gov,"McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011; Ward, Michael Patrick/GRX-1851-2022; Ward, Michael Patrick/W-1897-2019; Ward, Michael Patrick/C-5758-2009","Ward, Michael Patrick/0000-0002-9921-4986; Ward, Michael Patrick/0000-0002-9921-4986; Hagerman, Amy/0000-0001-9275-8780",Department of Homeland Security National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Defense,Department of Homeland Security National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Defense(United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS)),The research was partially funded through the Department of Homeland Security National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Defense from January 2009 until December 2010.,,34,21,26,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

This issue is important when policy management options are represented in labeled experiments, as it is easier to represent management options as mutually exclusive choice alternatives, but combinations of management options may be more relevant in the policy world. This issue is tested with a case study application to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. A split-sample experiment is implemented where one survey includes four labeled alternatives: a status quo option and three specific policy management options (restricted choice). The other survey provides respondents with an unrestricted choice set by including a fifth alternative choice, labeled as a combination of management options. The results provide some evidence that adding a combination policy alternative does change the way that respondents view trade-offs, but that choice behavior and subsequent value estimates are consistent across the two survey formats.","[Rolfe, John; Windle, Jill] Cent Queensland Univ, Ctr Environm Management, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia",Central Queensland University,"Rolfe, J (通讯作者)，Cent Queensland Univ, Ctr Environm Management, Bruce Highway, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia.",j.rolfe@cqu.edu.au; j.windle@cqu.edu.au,"Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017","Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040",Environmental Economics Research Hub; Australian Department of Environment and Water Heritage; Arts,Environmental Economics Research Hub; Australian Department of Environment and Water Heritage(Australian Government); Arts,"This research has been supported through the Environmental Economics Research Hub, funded by the Australian Department of Environment and Water Heritage and the Arts under the Commonwealth Environment Research Facility.",,32,7,7,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

CWD is a prion disease that affects wild cervids and is found in Saskatchewan and Alberta. There are no known human health risks from CWD but the condition is fatal for cervids. The methodological approach employed utilizes both revealed and stated preference data collected from resident hunters using a computer-based survey. The results suggest that while hunting behavior is not significantly altered by current CWD levels and management programs, there would be some changes given higher prevalence and spread levels of the disease. To avoid a situation of high CWD spread and prevalence, hunters would be willing to pay on average $20.35 per trip to keep CWD at current levels. This translated into just under a million dollars of direct economic value. Although the estimate is not large compared to other provincial economic activities, when added up over a number of years the economic losses could be substantial.","[Zimmer, Natalie M.

However, in studies to date examining farmers exposure to pesticides, the costs of ill health and their determinants have been based on information provided by farmers themselves. Some doubt has therefore been cast on the reliability of these estimates. In this study, we address this by conducting surveys among two groups of farmers who use pesticides on a regular basis. The first group is made up of farmers who perceive that their ill health is due to exposure to pesticides and have obtained at least some form of treatment (described in this article as the general farmer group). The second group is composed of farmers whose ill health has been diagnosed by doctors and who have been treated in hospital for exposure to pesticides (described here as the hospitalised farmer group). Cost comparisons are made between the two groups of farmers. Regression analysis of the determinants of health costs show that the most important determinants of medical costs for both samples are the defensive expenditure, the quantity of pesticides used per acre per month, frequency of pesticide use and number of pesticides used per hour per day. The results have important policy implications.","[Athukorala, Wasantha; Wilson, Clevo; Robinson, Tim] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Athukorala, W (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",wasantha.athukorala@qut.edu.au,"Athukorala, Wasantha/CAJ-5658-2022; Athukorala, Wasantha/ABC-6674-2021","Athukorala, Wasantha/0000-0003-3757-4780; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495",,,,,23,17,18,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

This article uses panel data from rural Ethiopia on individual nutritional status to test for an effect of public transfers on adult body mass index (BMI). Results show that among adult household members, male members are the primary beneficiaries of food aid as male and female aid recipients tend to invest aid receipts in male household members. These results are consistent with a theory in which additional resources are allocated to members of the household whose market returns are higher or those who engage in activities that expend higher levels of energy. For high-asset households, female household members benefit if the aid recipient is a female. Women in low-asset households appear to be adversely affected by aid receipts, and evidence suggests that women with little bargaining power suffer the most. The results suggest that aid receipts are useful in mitigating fluctuations in adult BMI over a short time period.","Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College,"Broussard, NH (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, 500 E 9th St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",nbroussard@cmc.edu,,,,,,,39,10,12,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Specially designed survey questions allow one to fully observe the demand tendency from farmers and partially observe the supply tendency from insurance companies. Using bi-vairate probit model, a joint estimation of insurance decisions of both supply and demand sides suggested that factors perform different roles in affecting insurance participation. Findings - Farmer's age and education have positive impacts on insurance demand, but are indifference to insurance providers. Insurance suppliers care about farmers' experience in the fields when providing insurance services, however, on the demand side, farmers' experience occasionally results in overconfidence and hence, impedes farmers' insurance purchasing. Production scales, proxy by sow inventory, are put more weight by farmers than insurance suppliers when making decisions. Production efficiency measures perform as incentives for farmers to purchase insurance. While suppliers prefer customers who use vaccine, farmers tend to treat vaccine as a substitute for insurance to prevent disease risk. Social implications - Results from bi-vairate probit model offer deeper understandings about livestock insurance choices and provide further insights to improve policy design and promote participation. Originality/value - The study designed a special questionnaire and firstly used bi-vairate probit model to offer more understandings about demand and supply sides of livestock insurance.","[Zhang, Yuehua] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Cao, Ying] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",Zhejiang University; Cornell University,"Zhang, YH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhangyuehua@zju.edu.cn,,"Cao, Ying/0000-0002-5907-8959",,,,,39,2,2,3,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

To this end, the farm-level income records from the FADN data for the period 1990-2009 are used to calculate Gini coefficients and Gini elasticities. Bootstrap sampling procedures are applied to test for significant differences of the estimated parameters over time. The Gini coefficients estimated in our analysis show that the household income inequality in Swiss agriculture only slightly increased from 0.21 to 0.24, but the farm income inequality strongly increased from 0.27 to 0.38 in the considered period. We find furthermore that increasing off-farm incomes and direct payments would decrease the household income inequality. Especially direct payments that support farmers producing under adverse production conditions in the hill and mountain regions have found to be well targeted and thus contribute to the reductions in income inequality in agriculture.","[El Benni, Nadja; Finger, Robert; Lehmann, Bernard] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Mann, Stefan] Res Stn Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Ettenhausen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"El Benni, N (通讯作者)，ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",elbennin@ethz.ch,"Benni, Nadja/AAG-2907-2020; Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742",,,,,33,13,14,1,8,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

There exists a large number of low-efficiency, small-scale farms, and productivity inequality between small and large farms keeps increasing, which is a possible driving force behind the Melamine scandal in 2008. Design/methodology/approach - Using the stochastic frontier production function, this paper estimates and compares the changes in technology and technical efficiency between backyard, small-scale, medium-scale and large-scale dairy farms in China over the period between 2004 and 2008. Findings - There are compensating effects between technology and technical efficiency. However, low yield for backyard farms is mainly caused by traditional low-yield varieties, even though the technical efficiency is very high, which cannot compensate for the low technology. Research limitations/implications - The author put the assumption of constant return to scale mainly due to the data availability. Such an assumption implies that there are no scale-effects between the different scales in productivity, and the productivity difference is explained by technology and technical efficiency. Practical implications - In order to solve the structural problems, Chinese governments should help small-scale farmers to adopt new high-yield varieties, to subsidize small-scale farmers, and to train farmers to master the complicated skills for raising high-yield varieties. Originality/value - The paper gives another possible explanation for the Melamine scandal of milk powder in 2008. If the structural problem cannot be solved, similar food safety scandals could happen once again.","Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Yu, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, Gottingen, Germany.",xyu@uni-goettingen.de,,"Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081",,,,,8,33,35,0,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Results suggest that not only the quantity demanded, but also the demand elasticities vary across species, seasons, and geography; not only does the degree of competition among finfish products vary considerably over space, but substituting products themselves change. These results highlight the importance of studying consumer demand behavior at species level, across seasons and geography, particularly as it sheds important light on some important policy issues such as the potential substitution between catfish and tilapia in the U.

In this article, we examine the assumptions underpinning the method used to determine LGM-Dairy premiums. Analysis of the milk-feed dependence structure is conducted using copula methods, a rich set of tools that allow modelers to capture nonlinearities in dependence among variables of interest. We find a significant relationship between milk and feed prices that increases with time-to-maturity and severity of negative price shocks. Extremal, or tail, dependence is the propensity of dependence to concentrate in the tails of a distribution. A common theme in financial and actuarial applications and in agricultural crop revenue insurance is that tail dependence increases the risk to the underwriter and results in higher insurance premiums. We present, to our knowledge, the first case in which tail dependence may actually reduce actuarially fair premiums for an agricultural risk insurance product. We examine hedging effectiveness with LGM-Dairy and show that, even in the absence of basis or production risk, hedging horizon plays an important role in the ability of this tool to smooth farm income over feed cost margins over time. Rating methodology that accounts for tail dependence between milk and feed prices extends the optimal hedging horizon and increases hedging effectiveness of the LGM-Dairy program.","[Bozic, Marin] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Newton, John] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL USA; [Thraen, Cameron S.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Gould, Brian W.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Bozic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,"Thraen, Cameron Scott/H-2220-2014",,Minnesota Milk Producers Assocation; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center,Minnesota Milk Producers Assocation; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center,"The authors are grateful to David Hennessy, two anonymous referees, as well as various conference and seminar participants for valuable insights that have substantially improved this work.

As the overall percentage of maize farmers growing hybrids tops 80% and the seed industry matures, the slow pace of hybrid replacement on farms, and the continued dominance of the seed industry by Kenya Seed Company, may dampen productivity. Our econometric analysis identifies the factors that explain farmer demand for hybrid seed, and the age of hybrids they grow, considering hybrid seed ownership. Male-headed households with more education, more assets, and more land plant more hybrid seed. Scale of seed demand per farm is differentiated by agroecology. We find a strong farmer response to the seed-to-grain price ratio, which we interpret as evidence of a commercial orientation even on household farms. However, despite the dramatic increase in the number of hybrids sold and the breadth of seed suppliers as seed markets liberalize, an older hybrid still dominates national demand.","[Smale, Melinda] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Olwande, John] Egerton Univ, Tegemeo Inst Agr Policy & Dev, Nairobi, Kenya",Michigan State University; Egerton University,"Smale, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 202 Agr Hall,446 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",msmale@msu.edu,,,,,,,35,40,45,3,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Understanding exit behavior is one key to future farm structure, management of abandoned land, depopulation of rural areas, and agricultural policy, including government program payments. This study empirically estimates the determinants of exit decisions of farm households. Particular attention is given to the roles of intensity of government payments and off-farm work decisions of farm couples in the exit decision. Using a large farm-level survey and controlling for endogeneity, results indicate that farm households with reduced intensity of government payments are more likely to exit farming. Households where the operator spouse works off the farm are more likely to exit farming. Additionally, households with older farmers, with the farm operator and spouse raised on a farm, and households operating farms located in Northern Great Plains are more likely to exit farming.","[Mishra, Ashok K.; Fannin, J.

Organized clusters are being called the cluster initiative. In recent years, there was a relatively rapid development of cluster initiatives also in the territory of the Visegrad countries due to the national programs and subsidies from the EU structural funds.

Hence, this study estimated the price and income (expenditure) elasticities of demand for the commonly consumed vegetables among households in the Ogun State, Nigeria. Data were collected with the use of a well-structured questionnaire administered to one hundred and twenty (120) households that were randomly selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. The data were analysed by simple descriptive statistics and estimation of a Nonlinear Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (NQAIDS) of vegetable demand behaviour of households sampled. The results show that income elasticity of demand for Bitter leave (-3.43) and the Eggplant (-3.67) are elastic, while income elasticity of demand for Tomato (0.27), to which about one-third of vegetables expenditure are devoted, is inelastic. The results further revealed that own-price elasticities of demand carry the expected negative signs for all the vegetables and are generally inelastic. Estimates of cross price elasticities show the dominance of substitutability among the vegetables with only few cases of complementarities.","[Otunaiya, Abiodun O.] Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Farm Management, Coll Agr Sci, Ayetoro, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Shittu, Adebayo M.] Fed Univ Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Farm Management, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria","University of Agriculture, Abeokuta","Otunaiya, AO (通讯作者)，Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Farm Management, Coll Agr Sci, Yewa Campus, Ayetoro, Ogun State, Nigeria.",aootunaiya@gmail.com,"OYAWOYE, Professor Enoch Olayiwola/AHH-5083-2022","Shittu, Adebayo/0000-0002-0857-0337; Otunaiya, Abiodun O./0000-0003-0367-9074",,,,,28,2,2,0,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The results show that producers are generally technical, mix, and scale efficient, but the results for input and output mix efficiencies vary. The outcomes for input mix efficiency suggest that producers face some rigidity in their production decisions. In contrast, output mix efficiency suggests that most producers adjust their output mixes to account for different seasonal conditions and enterprise mixes.","[Tozer, Peter R.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, IMPACT Ctr, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Villano, Renato] Univ New England, UNE Business Sch, Armidale, NSW, Australia",Washington State University; University of New England,"Tozer, PR (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, IMPACT Ctr, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",,"Tozer, Peter/AEW-0894-2022; Villano, Renato Andrin/I-3680-2017","Villano, Renato Andrin/0000-0003-2581-6623; Tozer, Peter/0000-0002-2429-7414",,,,,25,10,12,1,20,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

Not accounting for this preference will cause the gains from liberalisation to be overestimated. The period that is analysed is 2004-2007, departing from that in previous studies, which do not cover this period of greater deregulation. Rather than use border trade flow data as is customary, we acknowledge the actions of a state trading enterprise and construct and use a unique data set which should better gauge import penetration in the Japanese market for rice. Econometric estimation fails to reject the hypothesis that the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries prevents imports from affecting the price of domestically produced rice. In the absence of precisely estimated parameter values, simulations of liberalisation are conducted under a range of parameter values and the effects on social welfare calculated. The tariff equivalents of the government's support to rice producers are also estimated with values for the period in excess of 100 per cent.","[Fell, James; MacLaren, Donald] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Fell, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",james.fell@alumni.unimelb.edu.au,,"Fell, James/0000-0002-2666-3246",,,,,37,3,3,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In this study, using choice experiments, we compare the results obtained through the two valuation techniques for environmental features of the Burren landscape in western Ireland. Consistent with previous studies, stated values using the conventional approach are found to be significantly higher than those obtained through the inferred valuation approach. In particular, this study highlights the dissimilarities in relative preferences observed between the two landscape attributes (rocky limestone pavements and orchid-rich grasslands) from the two questioning formats. While respondents were indifferent between the two habitats, they believed the average other' to be significantly more concerned about the conservation of the rocky limestone pavements. We attribute this divergence in preferences to be a consequence of additional normative motives perceived by respondents with regard to the conservation of orchid-rich grasslands.","[Yadav, Lava; van Rensburg, Thomas M.; Kelley, Hugh] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Yadav, L (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland.",lava.yadav@nuigalway.ie,,,Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food; BurrenLIFE project,Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food; BurrenLIFE project,"This paper was written as part of a Rural Stimulus Funded project financed by the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, and was also part funded by the BurrenLIFE project.

Technology adoption depends on the farmers' beliefs and motives. Many researchers have found that there is a significant difference between intention and the actual behaviour. What an individual intends to do may not be what an individual actually does. Therefore, this paper tries to address the above issue with the farmers of the Southern Moravian region of the Czech Republic. Further, the study tries to identify other possible variables that explain behaviour in the agricultural technology adoption decisions. The theory of planned behaviour has provided a useful framework for explaining the farmers' behaviour. The results showed that intention has explained the behaviour. However, the attitude, the perceived behavioural control, the farmers' age and the farmers' education also show a significant relationship with behaviour. In order to increase the adoptability of new technologies, all these variables have to be taken into consideration by the policy makers and agricultural professionals when designing the agricultural development programmes as well as the technology dissemination programmes.","Coconut Res Inst Sri Lanka, Technol Transfer Div, Lunuwila, Sri Lanka",,"Herath, CS (通讯作者)，Coconut Res Inst Sri Lanka, Technol Transfer Div, Lunuwila, Sri Lanka.",hmcsherath@yahoo.com,,,,,,,19,14,17,2,31,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Recently, a significant price fluctuation of agricultural commodities in the global market has increased concerns over its impact on the economic stability in those developing countries such as China, which has a large import and export of agricultural commodities every year. This paper attempts to study the short-term impact from price fluctuations of the world agricultural commodities upon the China's domestic agricultural market by investigating the dynamic correlation between the price change in the world and Chinese market in the copula framework. Our findings suggest a weak but strengthening short-run impact with an asymmetric nature. At the same time, diversified short-run impacts are observed in four main agricultural commodity markets. Empirical results show that the world price fluctuation has a volatile but decreasing influence on the China's rice market. This volatility of price impact is also observed in the wheat market but it has an escalating trend. The corn market experiences an intensified price shock with a distinct stage characteristic and the soybean market is under the strongest influence from the international price fluctuation.","[Jiang, Yu; Wang, Yu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yujiang@nju.edu.cn; yuwang@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,32,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The estimation procedure used in this study is implemented in three steps: first, the price/unit value information is estimated; second, the parameters for a set of demand systems are estimated; and third, the J-test and likelihood ratio testing are used to determine the most suitable model for the data set. Findings - The results indicate that households spend more on apparel than home textiles and other textile products if they purchase textile products from small stores. It also indicates that they would spend more on home textiles and other textiles if they purchase from chain stores and supermarkets. Originality/value - The estimation of Chinese textile consumption presents a significant challenge to both academic researchers and industry, due to China's large population, income inequality, different consumption channels, and other related issues. First, the results presented in the paper provide a clear indication for textile producers, exporters, and others to choose their distribution channels to target specific customers; second, the disaggregated textile expenditure and price elasticity estimates from this article can be used in various analytical procedures (i.e. simulation models) to evaluate the welfare effects of domestic policies and international trade policies. Quantification of the welfare impacts of domestic policies and international trade policies would be more meaningful if disaggregate textile elasticity estimates are used in simulation models.","[MacDonald, Stephen] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC USA; [Pan, Suwen] World Agr Econ & Environm Serv, Columbia, MO USA; [Hudson, Darren] Texas Tech Univ, Cotton Econ Res Inst, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Tuan, Francis] World Agr Econ & Environm Serv, China Div, Columbia, MO USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Pan, SW (通讯作者)，World Agr Econ & Environm Serv, Columbia, MO USA.",span@waees-llc.com,,,ERS-USDA,ERS-USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The authors thank ERS-USDA for providing financial support and CCI for providing the survey data.

Using household-panel data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) from 1995 to 2005, we estimate total expenditure elasticities of food expenditures, food quantities, and food quality for normal-weight, overweight, and obese households, respectively. The expenditure elasticities of quality derived for obese households for meat, bread, fruits, and dairy were found to be 1520% higher than those of normal households. Hence, a change in economic resources causes obese households to adjust the quality of purchased foods significantly more flexibly than normal-weight households. Only few differences were found for quantity and expenditure reactions. Our results emphasize that policies aiming to reduce obesity should consider deviations in consumption behavior of normal and obese consumers in terms of quality.","Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Staudigel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",Matthias.Staudigel@agrar.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,37,6,6,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The model consists of a system of equations that allows estimation of oligopoly power of dairy co-operatives and downstream firms, exploiting federal milk marketing order regulations to identify co-operatives' marginal cost. A key finding is that co-operatives use their market power to raise the farm price of milk by almost 9% above marginal cost, resulting in an income transfer of more than $600 million per year in markets regulated by federal milk marketing orders.","[Cakir, Metin] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada; [Balagtas, Joseph V.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of Saskatchewan; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Cakir, M (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",,"Balagtas, Joseph/IVV-7427-2023; Balagtas, Joseph/AAL-4244-2021",,Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University; Purdue Research Foundation,Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University; Purdue Research Foundation,"Metin Cakir is an assistant professor in the Department of Bioresource Policy, Business, and Economics at the University of Saskatchewan.

A multivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model with Cholesky decomposition is used to incorporate price volatility into the rational expectations supply response model for each meat category and as a result the conditional covariance matrix remains positive definite without imposing any restrictions on the parameters. The empirical results confirm the existence of rational behaviour by meat producers in the four examined markets and indicate that price volatility is a major risk factor in Greek meat production. Furthermore, the last Common Agricultural Policy reform is found to have a negative impact on beef and lamb production in Greece.","[Rezitis, Anthony N.] Univ Western Greece, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, Agrinion 30100, Greece",,"Rezitis, AN (通讯作者)，Univ Western Greece, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, G Seferi Str 2, Agrinion 30100, Greece.",arezitis@cc.uoi.gr,"Rezitis, Anthony N./AAO-4276-2021","Rezitis, Anthony N./0000-0002-2226-2269",,,,,37,10,11,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

A comprehensive document called the Agenda 21 provided an explanation how to achieve a sustainable economic development. Along the tools presented in the document, there emerged in practice a new regionalism which is based on the preferential trade agreements. Currently, regional agreements are of a more complex nature, so that they may include environmental cooperation, too. The aim of this paper is to illustrate, on the case of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a possible approach of regional agreements to environmental cooperation. The paper is divided into four sections. The first one summarizes a general approach to addressing environmental issues within the integration groupings. The second tries to answer the question of whether the NAFTA confirms the general approach to the regional environmental governance. The third deals with the meaning and the failure of the regional governance for the assessment of the cross-border impact of the NAFTA/NAAEC on the environment. The fourth and last section gives an answer to whether the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), as the environmental part of the NAFTA, is a good basis for the effective environmental governance in North America.","Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cihelková, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",cihelka@vse.cz,,,"Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic [MSM 6138439909]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6138439909 Governance in the Context of Globalized Economy and Society).",,18,3,4,3,36,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This information enables policy makers to integrate societal concerns and values into risk management and communication regarding food safety and to enhance the public confidence in the authorities' approach to the food safety management. The purpose of this study is to understand how consumers evaluate the quality of the food risk management practices that are performed by the government and to determine the underlying psychological factors influencing consumer evaluations of food risk management quality (FRMQ). A comparative survey study was conducted in China and Korea, and the measurement scales used in the structural model were found to be configurally and metrically invariant between these two countries. The results show the difference in the perception of Chinese and Korean consumers regarding their evaluation for the FRMQ. While the perceived expertise of food risk managers was found to be the most important determinant in China, the proactive consumer protection was found to be the most important one in Korea. The scepticism in risk assessment and the communication practice was found to be second most important factor both in China and Korea.

The problem of the regional tourism development is not the insufficient financial support, but rather the unsystematic and ineffective usage of the financial resources. Although the EU financial support has been oriented on the support of the domestic and foreign demand in Czech regions in the past, the relative share of the regions was diminishing against Prague significantly. The aim of the paper is the proposal of a product development model interconnecting the national, regional and local level of the destination management system as well as the proposition of the communication strategy encouraging the sales of the regional tourist product. The case study method, the analysis of quantitative data regarding the incoming tourism and the analysis of the data reflecting the perception of the Czech Republic as a tourist destination have been employed in the paper. Some extracts of the document Tourism marketing strategy of the Czech Republic 2013-2020 have been used, since the author participated on the project working out substantially. The national marketing strategy in the international market is an output of one of the Integrated Operation Programme named Rebranding and marketing support of incoming tourism guaranteed by the Czech Tourism. In terms of the marketing strategy the product development is the crucial point of the tourism as well as regional development. The proposed three layers model of the product development defines the role of the individual levels of the destination marketing management (national, regional and local) and the role of the private sector in the partnership marketing. The product development and distribution have to be supported by effective communication connecting the national, regional and local level and based o the partnership among the tourism and non-tourism branches. The communication without the product development or the communication which follows the traditional models and emphases the ATL tools seem to be ineffective and lack purpose in the long-term. Prague is the very central point of the product development and its communication in the Czech Republic however the employment of Prague is insufficient in terms of tourism potential, perception or brand. Tourism can work fully as the regional development incentive only on the assumption that the destination management is based on the similar principles as a commercial company incl. the marketing performance monitoring and evaluation.","[Palatkova, Monika] Vysoka Skola Obchodni Praze Ops, Vedouci Katedry Ekonomiky Cestovniho Ruchu, Spalena 14, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",,"Palatková, M (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Obchodni Praze Ops, Vedouci Katedry Ekonomiky Cestovniho Ruchu, Spalena 14, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",monika.palatkova@vso-praha.eu,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-652-9,,,,2012,,,,,,,209,221,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics,BG8OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392530500029,0

Causes and implications,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Agriculture; Farms; Cereals; Farm exit; Grain production; Household survey data,INCOME; EXIT; AGRICULTURE; MIGRATION; DECISION; LABOR; WORK,"Purpose - The number of farms engaged in grain production in China has been declining in recent years. Limited efforts have been devoted to examine why producers quit from grain production and how such exits affect China's grain output. Such information, however, is invaluable in understanding whether the exit from grain production should be encouraged and if so, how. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors that influence farmers' decision to quit from grain production, with a view to drawing implications for devising policies to deal with such exits. Design/methodology/approach - Both descriptive statistics and econometric techniques are used to analyse a set of unique and comprehensive farm-level survey data to identify key factors that affect farmers' decision to quit from grain production. Findings - Key factors that influence a farm to quit from, or stay in, grain production include: family size, the share of farming labour out of total family labour, per capita arable land, the proportion of land used for grain production, the share of family income from grains. It was also found that the level of grain prices and the sunk cost in farming, chiefly in grain production, also affect the likelihood that a household will stay or exit from grain production. Further, farmers in more economically developed regions are more likely to quit from grain production. Originality/value - The paper's findings clearly indicate that farms with a larger scale of grain production and earning higher income from grain are the major contributors to China's grain production. Potential exists for China to raise its total grain output if the land from those exiting farmers is readily made available to larger producers, enabling them to further benefit from the economies of scale.","[Zhan, Jin-Tao] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yan-Rui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Zhang, Xiao-Hui] Minist Agr, Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zhang-Yue] James Cook Univ, Sch Business, Townsville, Qld, Australia",Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Western Australia; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; James Cook University,"Zhan, JT (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",jintao.zhan@hotmail.com,"; Wu, Yanrui/C-2458-2013","Zhou, Zhang-Yue/0000-0001-6328-4109; Wu, Yanrui/0000-0002-8966-1459","Faculty of Law, Business and the Creative Arts of James Cook University","Faculty of Law, Business and the Creative Arts of James Cook University","The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the Faculty of Law, Business and the Creative Arts of James Cook University, through a Faculty Research Grant.",,40,10,12,6,63,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In particular, we analyse the relevance of taking into account policy-induced production and market responses in an ex-ante inequality analysis.

Computable general equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium (PE) models are currently being expanded to include land-use change and energy markets so that the effects of various policy measures on agricultural production can be assessed. Agent-based modelling (ABM) or multi-agent systems (MAS) have been suggested as a complementary tool for assessing farmer responses to climate change in agriculture and how these are affected by policies. MAS applied to agricultural systems draw on techniques used for Recursive Farm Programming, but include models of all individual farms, their spatial interactions and the natural environment. In this article, we discuss the specific insights MAS provide for developing robust policies and land-use strategies in response to climate change. We show that MAS are well-suited for uncertainty analysis and can thereby complement existing simulation approaches to advance the understanding and implementation of effective climate-related policies in agriculture.","[Berger, Thomas; Troost, Christian] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Berger, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Stuttgart, Germany.",i490d@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Berger, Thomas/0000-0003-3316-9614; Troost, Christian/0000-0003-4626-7117",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FOR-1695],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Thanks are due to David Harvey and two anonymous referees for their most helpful comments.

By applying a spatial production function to the province-level data in 2000 and 2007, spatial heterogeneity in the variance of provincial total factor productivity and the input factor-output elasticities was identified across the country. Results show that the disparities in agricultural activities and geographic conditions affected return from input factors. Empirical findings from a spatial spillover model also suggest that changes in the input factor-output elasticities varied significantly across Turkey between 2000 and 2007, after the policy reform.

The paper focuses on the potential of the cost controlling in agricultural production. The analysis is based on data from the comparable sample surveys of costs and yields of agricultural commodities carried out by the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Information, Prague, and the Research Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics, Bratislava, in the period 2007-2012. The authors apply the contribution margin calculation and the gross margin calculation. Using target costing, the upper limits of variable and fixed costs are set to reach the break-even point. One of the main finding is that the average costs per litre of milk are by 15.3% higher in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic. It is caused by a significantly lower milk yield in Slovakia. Cost controlling based on the knowledge about the structure of the average costs of milk production can help farmers to better manage their business.","[Foltinova, Alzbeta] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dept Enterprise Econ, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia; [Spicka, Jindrich] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Business Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Economics Bratislava; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Foltínova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",afoltin@euba.sk; jindrich.spicka@vse.cz,"Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544; Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0002-9266-9435","Slovak Academy of Sciences VEGA [1/0026/12]; University of Economics, Prague [MF/F3/4/2013]","Slovak Academy of Sciences VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); University of Economics, Prague","Supported by the Slovak Academy of Sciences VEGA (Project No. 1/0026/12) and by the University of Economics, Prague (Project No. MF/F3/4/2013).",,23,11,11,2,18,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We use an integrated assessment model that includes a climate scenario generator, a climate-biophysical response framework and an economywide analytical framework. For the climate scenario generator, we use data from the OzClim database of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. For the climate-biophysical response framework, we use the DairyMod model with inputs of changes in climate variables from OzClim to quantify climate change effects on pasture growth and productivity. For the economywide analytical framework, we use the National Integrated Assessment Model to quantify the economic implications of these effects on the dairy sector. The simulated pattern of regional changes in dairy output is not a simple function of the changes in dairy productivity. Our results show that the relative size of productivity changes across regions affects the relative competitive advantage of dairy-producing regions. Several factors affect the regional distribution of simulated dairy-output changes, including substitution among sources of dairy output and competition for inputs like supplementary feed. An increased output in regions with moderate reductions in dairy productivity may occur because the severely climate-affected regions absorb the greatest loss in output.","[Hanslow, Kevin] Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Gunasekera, Don] CSIRO, CMAR, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Cullen, Brendan] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Land & Environm, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Newth, David] CSIRO, CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Monash University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Melbourne; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Hanslow, K (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",don.gunasekera@csiro.au,"Newth, David J/A-1848-2011","Cullen, Brendan/0000-0003-2327-0946",,,,,38,13,14,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We focus on farm-level studies in Malawi, identifying consistent and contrasting research results in order to draw important policy lessons and provide suggested avenues for future research. While national production estimates suggested dramatic increases in maize production and productivity during the years of the FISP, the farm-level studies found relatively modest increases in maize production and yields over the same period. Consistent with the farm-level results of modest maize production increases, there has been a relative increase in real maize prices and the country continued to import maize during most of the subsidy program years. Furthermore, there is evidence that better-off households gained substantially more than poorer households when they participated in the program. Together these findings cast some doubt on the FISP's ability to reduce food insecurity and poverty. We propose a number of policy lessons and suggestions for rigorous investigation, including research that directly measures the causal impacts of the FISP program on poverty in Malawi.","[Lunduka, Rodney] Int Inst Environm & Dev, London WC1X 8NH, England; [Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Fisher, Monica] Ethiopia Off, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Lunduka, R (通讯作者)，Int Inst Environm & Dev, 80-86 Grays Inn Rd, London WC1X 8NH, England.",rodney.lunduka@iied.org,,"Fisher, Monica/0000-0002-6669-6261",,,,,59,85,96,0,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Applying the model of DEA and Tobit, using the household survey data, this paper investigates the effects of the farmer stratum differentiation on the efficiency of farmland use. The empirical results showed that the type of farmer differentiation was positive and statistically significant at 5% level. The regression coefficient is 0.295; this result implies that if this variable improves one percentage, the efficiency of farmland use will increase by 29.5%. The farmer horizontal differentiation and farmer vertical differentiation pass the significance test at the 1% and 5% level, respectively. This indicates that they all have a significant positive impact on the farmland use efficiency. We conclude that corresponding measures should be implemented to further facilitate the farmer differentiation. Another implication of our results is that the policies matched with the farmer differentiation and transfer should be gradually perfected, and then they will provide a better environment of the society and economy for free migration of farmers.","[Hengzhou, Xu; Tong, Chen] Tianjin Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Hengzhou, X (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Sch Management, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",xuhengzhou@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203157, 41101537]; Research Center of Public Resources Management of Tianjin University",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Center of Public Resources Management of Tianjin University,The authors are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71203157 and 41101537) and the Research Center of Public Resources Management of Tianjin University for providing financial support to the research.

These results thus suggest the definition of the Common Agricultural Policy differentiated and adapted to the existing four clusters of countries.

More specifically, the paper examines the effects of these institutions on both nutrition and safety aspects of raw milk quality. Design/methodology/approach - Using data collected from 396 households in Inner Mongolia, this paper adopts a multiple linear regression model (OLS/FGLS) and a zero-inflated Poisson regression model to test two hypotheses proposed according to theory and descriptive analysis. Findings - The empirical results indicate that both production pattern and transaction style significantly affect raw milk quality. Production pattern has a more significant effect on raw milk nutrition, while transaction style has a more significant effect on raw milk safety. Research limitations/implications - Current government policies focus on reducing household production and regulating private milk collection stations. From a comprehensive quality perspective, these policies are not effective in that they cannot guarantee raw milk safety and have little effect on improving raw milk nutrition. Alternatively, promoting dairy farmers' specialized cooperatives may be a more effective policy measure. Originality/value - In contrast to other studies, this paper adopts a comprehensive quality perspective that examines both nutritional and safety characteristics rather than focusing on any single quality indicator, separately analyzing the factors influencing raw milk nutrition and raw milk safety.

We take the novel approach of expressing all benefits and costs of establishing plantations in terms of $ per gigalitre (GL) of water removed annually from river flows, setting upstream demands on the same basis as downstream demands. For the Macquarie Valley, a New South Wales sub-catchment of Australias Murray-Darling Basin, we project changes in land and water use and changes in economic surpluses under two policy settings: without and with a policy requiring permanent water entitlements to be purchased from downstream parties, before plantation establishment. Without the policy, and given a high stumpage value for trees ($70/m3), upstream gains in economic surplus projected from expanding plantations are $639 million; balanced against $233 million in economic losses by downstream irrigators and stock and domestic water users for a net gain of $406 million, but 345 GL lower mean annual environmental flows. With the policy, smaller gains in upstream economic surplus from trees ($192 million), added to net downstream gains ($138 million) from sale of water, result in gains of $330 million with no reduction in environmental flows. Sustaining the 345 GL flow for a $76 million (406330) reduction in gains to economic surplus may be seen to cost only $0.22 million/GL; but this is much lower than the market value of the first units of that water to agriculture and forestry.","[Nordblom, Thomas L.; Hume, Iain H.] EH Graham Ctr, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia; [Finlayson, John D.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Finlayson, John D.] Western Australia, Dept Agr & Food, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Nordblom, TL (通讯作者)，EH Graham Ctr, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia.",tom.nordblom@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Nordblom, Thomas L/B-8545-2011","Hume, Iain/0000-0002-8282-9597; Nordblom, Thomas/0000-0002-9892-5102",NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI); Charles Sturt University (CSU) through the EH Graham Centre for Agricultural Innovation (CSU and NSW DPI); Future Farm Industries CRC; Rural Industries Research & Development Corporation; Murray-Darling Basin Authority; Victoria Department of Primary Industries; University of Western Australia,"NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI); Charles Sturt University (CSU) through the EH Graham Centre for Agricultural Innovation (CSU and NSW DPI); Future Farm Industries CRC(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Rural Industries Research & Development Corporation; Murray-Darling Basin Authority; Victoria Department of Primary Industries; University of Western Australia","The research project 'Developing environmental service policy for salinity and water' was supported by the NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI), Charles Sturt University (CSU) through the EH Graham Centre for Agricultural Innovation (CSU and NSW DPI), Future Farm Industries CRC, the Rural Industries Research & Development Corporation, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Victoria Department of Primary Industries and the University of Western Australia.

An analysis of weekly store-level scanner data in a differences-in-differences approach results in a 5% increase in organic milk sales relative to conventional milk sales.

There is, however, limited recent evidence on their impact. We propose an indirect method to estimate bird-inflicted crop losses by fitting a production function with a damage abatement component and pest intensity slope dummies on a panel database of rice farmers in the Senegal River Valley. This allows us to estimate both bird damage and marginal productivity of bird control at different levels of bird pressure. Annual bird damage is found to average around 13.2% of the potential rice production during the wet seasons of 20032007, which translates into an average annual economic loss of 4.7 billion FCFA (7.1 million). Our results are consistent with farmers perceived bird-inflicted crop losses, averaging 15.2%. More alarmingly, we observe declining marginal productivities of bird control under increasing bird pressure. Farmers indicate that at high bird pressure, the efficacy of traditional bird scaring methods is inadequate, which suggests that predictive (monitoring), preventive (population control) and protective (insurance) measures against massive invasions are more urgent than improving the average efficacy of curative measures (pest control). These findings are especially relevant to farmers and policy-makers who are currently struggling to implement an ambitious food self-sufficiency programme in Senegal.","[Demont, Matty; Diagne, Mandiaye] Africa Rice Ctr AfricaRice, St Louis, Senegal; [de Mey, Yann] Hasselt Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, BE-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium",CGIAR; Africa Rice Center; Hasselt University,"Demont, M (通讯作者)，Africa Rice Ctr AfricaRice, BP 96, St Louis, Senegal.",m.demont@cgiar.org,"de Mey, Yann/B-3894-2012; Demont, Matty/C-7284-2013","de Mey, Yann/0000-0002-1430-5564; Demont, Matty/0000-0001-9086-5654",European Union; Flemish Interuniversity Council - University Cooperation for Development (VLIR-UOS),European Union(European Union (EU)); Flemish Interuniversity Council - University Cooperation for Development (VLIR-UOS),"Yann de Mey is with the Centre for Environmental Sciences, Hasselt University, Agoralaan Gebouw D, BE-3590, Diepenbeek, Belgium.

Design/methodology/approach - A differential production approach is used to estimate China's demand for imported soybeans and soybean oil. The empirical demand estimates are then used to derive conditional and unconditional elasticities of demand for each exporting country with respect to changes in domestic and import prices, and the price of resources used in soybean meal and oil production. Findings - Results indicate that both country-of-origin and product form competition exist in the Chinese market. Estimation results indicate that China's soybean meal prices significantly impacted its soybean and soybean oil imports. Seasonality is detected in China's soybean imports, but not in soybean oil imports. Practical implications - The findings suggest that, in addition to country-of-origin competition, product form competition should be considered when analyzing China's soybean demand. Originality/value - This paper contributes to a better understanding of China's soybean import market by integrating both country-of-origin competition and product form competition into a single demand framework.","[Chen, Wei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Marchant, Mary A.] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Food & Agr Educ Informat Syst, Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Muhammad, Andrew] Econ Res Serv, Market & Trade Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC USA",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Chen, W (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",chen.wei@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,"MUHAMMAD, ANDREW/0000-0002-4825-9324",USDA National Research Initiative (NRI) Competitive Grants Program [2005-35400-15413]; Leading Academic Discipline Program; 211 Project for Shanghai University of Finance and Economics [2009330194],"USDA National Research Initiative (NRI) Competitive Grants Program; Leading Academic Discipline Program(Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project); 211 Project for Shanghai University of Finance and Economics(Ministry of Education, China)","This research is funded by the USDA National Research Initiative (NRI) Competitive Grants Program as grant #2005-35400-15413.

Tonga or Batonga (i.e. people of Tonga) is linguistic and ethnic group living in in the the Southern province of Zambia. Its population represents approximately 12 % from 13 million of Zambian inhabitants. About 300 000 Tonga natives can be found also in neighbouring countries: northern Zimbabwe, Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique. The population of Tonga is divided into two wider groups which inhabits different ecological niche. The first of them, Plateau Tonga, traditionally dedicates itself to farming and livestock breeding. The second one, Valley or Gwembe Tonga, uses irrigation economy and cultivates maize and millet. Southern province, where the world famous Victoria Falls are situated, is actually the most visited part of Zambia. That is why the main income of Tonga (e.g. in the Mukuni Village) comes from the tourism. Tourism helps the people to realize various local development projects. However, the influence of touristic activities is not always positive, because it widely contributes to the social and cultural change of the Tonga tribe.","[Horak, Miroslav] Mendelova Univ Brne, Fak Reg Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Ustav Jazykovych & Kulturnich Studii, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Horák, M (通讯作者)，Mendelova Univ Brne, Fak Reg Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Ustav Jazykovych & Kulturnich Studii, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",miroslav.horak.ujks@mendelu.cz,"Horák, Miroslav/D-8000-2018","Horák, Miroslav/0000-0001-8327-8785",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-652-9,,,,2012,,,,,,,99,105,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics,BG8OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392530500013,0

At present, the formation of the state of Czech agriculture reflects a new form of business environment. These processes are reflected not only in our country but in the wider area of the EU's common agricultural market, especially in the ongoing changes in the CAP. One aspect of this change that is currently being discussed is the impact of increase in non-market coordination across verticals in commodity markets and the question of the possibility of agricultural enterprises to participate in the current and constantly emerging / transforming commodity chains / networks, often operating globally, and thus possible exclusion of some farms segments from these processes and participation in creating value. In this paper, this issue is discussed on the basis of theoretical and empirical arguments and even relativized initial thesis that small farms are a priori excluded from these processes and customer-supplier relations will occur primarily to the preference of large farms.","[Zdrahal, Ivo] Mendelova Univ Brne, Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Teritori, Trida Gen Piky 7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Zdráhal, I (通讯作者)，Mendelova Univ Brne, Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Teritori, Trida Gen Piky 7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ivo.zdrahal@mendelu.cz,"Zdrahal, Ivo/E-4335-2018","Zdrahal, Ivo/0000-0002-6631-8228",,,,,18,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-652-9,,,,2012,,,,,,,310,317,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics,BG8OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392530500044,0

Our analyses suggest that the implementation details of the 2013 CAP reform will largely determine the impact of the SPS on land markets.

The observed R&D spending behavior is consistent with a determination that the reported rates of return are perceived as implausible by policy makers. We examine this notion by scrutinizing 2,242 investment evaluations reported in 372 separate studies from 1958 to 2011. We find that the internal rate of return (IRR) is the predominant summary measure of investment performance used in the literature despite methodological criticisms dating back more than a half century. The reported IRRs imply rates of return that are implausibly high. We investigate the reasons for these implausibly high estimates by analytically comparing the IRR to the modified internal rate of return (MIRR). The MIRR addresses several methodological concerns with using the IRR, has the intuitive interpretation as the annual compounding interest rate paid by an investment, and is directly related to the benefit-cost ratio. To obtain more credible rate of return estimates, we then develop a novel method for recalibrating previously reported IRR estimates using the MIRR when there is limited information on an investment's stream of benefits and costs. Our recalibrated estimates of the rate of return are more modest (median of 9.8% versus 39% per year); however, they are still substantial enough to question the current scaling back of public agricultural R&D spending in many countries.","[Hurley, Terrance M.; Rao, Xudong; Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Hurley, Terrance M.; Rao, Xudong; Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Minnesota, Int Sci & Technol Practice & Policy InSTePP Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Hurley, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,"Rao, Xudong/S-3960-2019; Rao, Xudong/C-6004-2019","Hurley, Terrance/0000-0003-2135-7570; Pardey, Philip/0000-0002-8012-1341; Rao, Xudong/0000-0002-5025-8347",University of Minnesota; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"lTerrance M.

The two model families differ in their scopepartial versus economy-wideand in how they represent technology and the behavior of supply and demand in markets. The CGE models are deep structural models in that they explicitly solve the maximization problem of consumers and producers, assuming utility maximization and profit maximization with production/cost functions that include all factor inputs. The PE models divide into two groups on the supply side: (1) shallow structural models, which essentially specify area/yield supply functions with no explicit maximization behavior, and (2) deep structural models that provide a detailed activity-analysis specification of technology and explicit optimizing behavior by producers. While the models vary in their specifications of technology, both within and between the PE and CGE families, we consider two stylized theoretical models to compare the behavior of crop yields and supply functions in CGE models with their behavior in shallow structural PE models. We find that the theoretical responsiveness of supply to changes in prices can be similar, depending on parameter choices that define the behavior of implicit supply functions over the domain of applicability defined by the common scenarios used in the AgMIP comparisons. In practice, however, the applied models are more complex and differ in their empirical sensitivity to variations in specificationcomparability of results given parameter choices is an empirical question. To illustrate the issues, sensitivity analysis is done with one global CGE model, MAGNET, to indicate how the results vary with different specification of technical change, and how they compare with the results from PE models.","[Robinson, Sherman; d'Croz, Daniel Mason] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [van Meijl, Hans; Tabeau, Andrzej; Kavallari, Aikaterini] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, NL-2585 DB The Hague, Netherlands; [Willenbockel, Dirk] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Valin, Hugo; Havlik, Petr] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Masui, Toshihiko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Sands, Ron] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Wise, Marshall; Calvin, Katherine] Pacific NW Natl Lab, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Schmitz, Christoph; Dietrich, Jan Philipp] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [von Lampe, Martin] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, F-75775 Paris 16, France",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Wageningen University & Research; University of Sussex; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Willenbockel, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",d.willenbockel@ids.ac.uk,"Valin, Hugo/Z-1557-2019; Willenbockel, Dirk/AAC-2191-2021; Tabeau, Andrzej/AAE-8214-2019; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel/M-4254-2016; Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Dietrich, Jan Philipp/ABG-3548-2021; van Meijl, Hans/G-6223-2015","Valin, Hugo/0000-0002-0618-773X; Willenbockel, Dirk/0000-0002-6840-0954; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel/0000-0003-0673-2301; Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; Dietrich, Jan Philipp/0000-0002-4309-6431; van Meijl, Hans/0000-0002-2455-6869; Calvin, Katherine/0000-0003-2191-4189; Havlik, Petr/0000-0001-5551-5085; Sands, Ronald/0000-0002-2864-0339","Integrated Assessment Research Program in the Office of Science of the United States Department of Energy; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [A-1103]; climate change research program of NIES; EU; BMBF; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security; United States Department of Agriculture; United Kingdom Department for International Development","Integrated Assessment Research Program in the Office of Science of the United States Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); climate change research program of NIES; EU(European Union (EU)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security(CGIAR); United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); United Kingdom Department for International Development","This article is part of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project's global economic model intercomparison (AgMIP; http://www.agmip.org).

The analysis is based on discrete choice experiments with 128 German farmers. Participants were asked to choose between a greening option with a given set of management prescriptions and an opt-out alternative with a stipulated cut of the single direct payment. A binary logit model is used to identify the variables affecting the likelihood of greening being chosen. In addition, latent class estimations are carried out to group respondents into latent classes of compliers and non-compliers. We find that farmers' choices are driven by greening policy attributes, personal and farm characteristics, and interactions between these two groups of variables. Farmers perceive greening as a costly constraint, but not all farmers are equally affected and not all greening provisions are regarded as equally demanding. Specialised arable farms on highly productive land and intensive dairy farms are most likely to opt out of greening and voluntarily forgo part of their single payment entitlements. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for improving the design of a second-best policy.","[Schulz, Norbert; Breustedt, Gunnar; Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Latacz-Lohmann, U (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",ulatacz@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de,,"Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe/0000-0002-9936-2460",,,,,37,113,121,5,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply a systematic, quantitative method to analyze the integration between US and Chinese maize markets. Based on the residuals of the variables through error correction model, the directed acyclic graph (DAG) among six price variables is conducted. With consideration of the dependence on and direction of six price variables, the variance decomposition of each variable is calculated. Findings - This paper shows that the vertical price transmission passes from wholesale price to farm-gate price. The horizontal price transmission ranges from spot price to futures price at the domestic market and from the American spot price to domestic spot price, from the American spot price to domestic futures price and from the American futures price to domestic futures price. The American maize spot and futures prices, and in particular the spot price, have greater effects on domestic maize prices contemporaneously. It also indicates that the American spot price is the leader price in the long run at both maize markets. Originality/value - This paper contributes by using the DAG method in this paper. It also contributes by helping policy makers and market participants find the leading prices and offers insight into ways of gaining power of price setting in the maize market.","[Yan, Yunxian; Tian, Lu; Zhang, Yuejie] Jilin Agr Univ, Econ & Management Coll, Changchun, Peoples R China",Jilin Agricultural University,"Yan, YX (通讯作者)，Jilin Agr Univ, Econ & Management Coll, Changchun, Peoples R China.",jlauyyx@126.com,,,"Humanities and Social Science Project under the Ministry of Education of PRC [08JA790055, 11YJC790227]",Humanities and Social Science Project under the Ministry of Education of PRC,The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

We take account of the existence of long-run threshold effects and short-run price transmission asymmetries (PTAs). We find evidence of threshold effects in both periods (EQS and post-EQS) in all three countries and the presence of short-run PTAs during the post-EQS period in all countries, but not during the EQS period. Our results indicate that the threshold values are smaller in the post-EQS period, suggesting that retail prices became more responsive to changes in international prices. However, the speed of adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium decreases during the post-EQS period in the three countries. In the short run, non-linear impulse response analyses indicate that a shock in international prices was more persistent during the EQS period than in the post-EQS period. Moreover, we find evidence of short-run PTAs in the post-EQS period, with differences across countries. We find support for the rockets and feathers' principle in the United States; in contrast, retail prices respond faster when international prices are falling in Germany and France. We explain these differences in terms of market structures.","[Lee, Jun] Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade KIET, Seoul, South Korea; [Gomez, Miguel I.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET); Cornell University,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade KIET, Seoul, South Korea.",jlee@kiet.re.kr,"Gomez, Miguel I./AAD-3707-2019",,,,,,38,24,26,0,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The estimates provide a natural measure of the expected benefit to the firm of investing in RD.

We explore the consequences of three different methods for measuring on-farm emissions: national accounting methods, an amended version of those methods and use of best-available local data. Estimated emissions under the three methods can vary widely; for example, on a case study farm in Western Australia, local data indicated 44 per cent lower emissions than did the national accounts method. If on-farm emissions are subject to an emissions price, the impact on farm profit is large and varies considerably with different measurement methods. For instance, if a price of $23/t of CO2-e applies then farm profit falls by 14.430.8 per cent depending on the measurement method. Thus, the choice of measurement method can have large distributional consequences. On the other hand, inaccurate measurement results in relatively minor deadweight losses. On-farm sequestration through reafforestation may lessen the impact of an emissions price on farm businesses, although it will require a high carbon price to be viable, especially if sequestration rates are underestimated or low.","[Thamo, Tas; Kingwell, Ross S.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, Sch Agr & Resource Econ M089, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Thamo, Tas; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Kingwell, Ross S.] Australian Export Grains Innovat Ctr, S Perth, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Thamo, T (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, Sch Agr & Resource Econ M089, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",tas.thamo@uwa.edu.au,"kingwell, ross/AAK-2952-2021; Kingwell, Ross/AAU-9315-2020; Pannell, David/B-4476-2008","Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488; Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Thamo, Tas/0000-0002-3463-6299",University of Western Australia; Grains Research and Development Corporation; Australian Research Council; Future Farm Industries CRC,"University of Western Australia; Grains Research and Development Corporation(Grains R&D Corp); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Future Farm Industries CRC(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme)","The authors are grateful to the University of Western Australia, Grains Research and Development Corporation, the Australian Research Council and the Future Farm Industries CRC for their funding and support.

This article estimates the effects of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) on maize market prices in production and consumption regions in Zambia using a vector autoregression model and monthly data from July 1996 through December 2008. In recent years, FRA has become the dominant buyer of smallholder maize in Zambia. Simulations show that FRA activities stabilized market prices throughout the July 1996December 2008 study period and raised mean prices between July 2003 and December 2008 by 1719%. The price raising effects of FRA policies have assisted surplus maize producers but adversely affected net buyers of maize in Zambia, namely urban consumers and the majority of the rural poor. The increase in maize price stability is unlikely to have had substantial welfare effects on poor households. In contrast, relatively wealthy producers are likely to have benefited from the higher average and more stable maize prices resulting from FRA policies.","[Mason, Nicole M.; Myers, Robert J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Mason, NM (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",masonn@msu.edu,,"Mason, Nicole/0000-0001-6835-7098",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Zambia Mission; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Zambia Mission(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"The authors thank Thom Jayne and an anonymous reviewer for providing helpful comments on this article.

The general conclusion is that RTAs increase members trade by as much as 150%, on average. In this article, we demonstrate that previous empirical work likely misrepresents the impact of RTAs because of considerable heterogeneity in the depth of economic integration pursued by these agreements. Contrary to previous studies, the results reveal that RTAs are not universally trade creating, and some agreements appear to provide very little benefit. Deep integration agreements, on the other hand, are largely responsible for the impressive agricultural trade flow increases reported in the literature. Testing the hierarchy of RTAs largely confirms the theory: the benefits of regionalism are an increasing function of the depth of economic integration.","Virginia Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Grant, JH (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 216-I Hutcheson Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",jhgrant@vt.edu,,,ERS/U.S. Dept. of Agriculture [58-3000-8-0135]; VAES Hatch Project [135869],ERS/U.S. Dept. of Agriculture; VAES Hatch Project,"Jason H.

The resultant four farm types are analysed based on the data from the Swiss Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) as well as the spatial data on available jobs. Only 17% of dairy farms have neither on-farm wage labour nor off-farm family labour. 60% have family members involved In off-farm activities. On average, 0.3 annual work units (AWU) are employed in off-farm activities, earning double the on-farm income per AWU. In line with the literature, we found that the likelihood of on-farm wage labour increases with the farm size and the degree of diversification. Involvement in off-farm activities is more likely if the farm manager is young and has a spouse with a non-agricultural education. Furthermore, private consumption per consumer unit has a positive marginal effect on the likelihood of off-farm work. Finally, no evidence was found of available jobs within a range of 10 kilometres acting as a proxy for the local labour demand for off-farm activities, leading us to the condusion that involvement in off-farm work is an option for most of the analysed dairy farms.","[Lips, Markus; Schmid, Dierk; Jan, Pierrick] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn, CH-8356 Ettenhausen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Lips, M (通讯作者)，Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn, CH-8356 Ettenhausen, Switzerland.",markus.lips@agroscope.admin.ch; dierk.schmid@agroscope.admin.ch; pierrick.jan@agroscope.admin.ch,,,,,,,33,4,4,1,13,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The main objective is an empirical analysis of the determinants of the implementation of ecological production technology, whereby not only is their definition focused on, but also the quantification of the level of their effect. The primary methodological tool for achieving the objective is a binary choice model, which was estimated in three variants - probit model, logit model and linear probability model. These estimations are conducted on the basis of the unbalanced panel data from 531 agricultural businesses - legal entities obtained over the time period 2004-2008. Results of the analyses indicate that the transition to and implementation of the organic production technology is negatively affected primarily by the higher age of the farmers and the high productivity of labour. On the other hand, the subsidies for the support of organic agriculture, as well as a high return on cost can be considered as the factors which positively influence the implementation of the organic technology. Given this fact, it is possible, through agricultural policy, to effectively influence the number of organically managing farmers, as well as the acreage of the organically managed land. And from the achieved outputs, the type of farm is subsequently characterised where a transition to organic farming may most likely be expected.","[Mala, Zdenka; Maly, Michal] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Maly, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",malaz@pef.czu.cz; maly@pef.czu.cz,"Malý, Michal/H-6171-2018; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021","Malý, Michal/0000-0001-7382-1895; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6046070906]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6046070906 - The economics of resources in Czech agriculture and their effective utilization within multifunctional agricultural-food systems).",,26,27,29,2,61,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

When analyzing farm performance, these different outputs should be modelled separately. In this study, we investigated Swiss dairy farms located in the plain, hill and mountainous regions for the period between 2003 and 2009. For the representation of production technology, we employed a parametric output distance function and modeled particular public goods and services as a separate output. The resulted elasticities of agricultural output coincided with the corresponding shares of this output. However, the elasticities of particular public goods and services were higher than the corresponding shares. This might be related to the fact that this output contains different kinds of direct payments, production of which does not require additional inputs or trade-off with other outputs. Our results showed that the level of productivity in the plain region did not depend on the scale of production, but more on the improvement in the technical efficiency. However, in the hill and mountainous regions, there was potential for scale adjustments. Sample farms in these regions showed significant decreasing returns to scale, which suggests that the average farm in these subsamples could improve its productivity by scaling down its production. Our results might also be confirmation of decelerated structural change, since decreasing returns to scale might reflect an obstacle to growth. We found the wide range of the efficiency scores for Swiss farms, which indicates potentials for improvements. Among others, off-farm income as well as high level of ecological services showed significantly positive influence on the technical efficiency of Swiss farms in all three regions.","[Mamardashvili, Phatima] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmid, Dierk] Res Stn Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Ettenhausen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Mamardashvili, P (通讯作者)，ETH, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",phatimam@ethz.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation.

In doing so, the authors use newer methods of threshold cointegration analysis for time series from 1999 until 2008. Besides the existence of a long-run equilibrium, asymmetric price adjustments can be demonstrated. This is especially the case for the EU live pigs, where price variations of the basis are higher and exhibit lower standard deviation. The results also perfectly show that cash prices follow the futures market more than the other way round. Furthermore, a grid search has revealed that the residual-based threshold in either market is near zero and therefore coherent with economic interpretation. Thus, at least theoretically, arbitrageurs in those markets are able to exploit the price differences between the two markets and reap no-risk monetary benefit. Hence, the results are in line with the statement that speculating the basis generates a better return.","[Ziegelbaeck, Martin] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Dept Econ & Social Sci, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Kastner, Gregor] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Stat & Math, A-1020 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Vienna University of Economics & Business","Ziegelbäck, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",ziegelbaeck@hedging.eu; gregor.kastner@wu.ac.at,"Kastner, Gregor/C-8857-2016","Kastner, Gregor/0000-0002-8237-8271",,,,,34,2,2,0,27,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This study analyses the impacts of these sugarcane expansions on economic growth. The effects are examined at the municipality level in Brazil as a whole and in the main sugarcane producing regions, the North-Northeast (NE) and the Centre-South (CS). In this latter region, an additional distinction is made between the state of Sao Paulo (SP) and the Centre-South region excluding Sao Paulo (CSex) since the bulk of the recent expansion took place in SP while most of the future expansions are planned in CSex. Estimators based on the propensity score are used to construct two types of counterfactual scenarios. The estimations in the first scenario show that municipalities in NE and CSex that expanded sugarcane production experienced economic growth as a result. No significant effect was found in SP. The second scenario focuses on CSex and establishes that sugarcane non-expanding municipalities in this region would have had higher economic growth if they had increased sugarcane production. The results of this study suggest that future sugarcane plantations should indeed be located in CSex because they contribute to economic growth.",,,"Deuss, A (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Econ, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",deuss@andrew.cmu.edu,,,Cornell University Department of Applied Economics and Management; Mario Einaudi Center at Cornell University; Cornell University Graduate School; Latin American Studies Program at Cornell University,Cornell University Department of Applied Economics and Management; Mario Einaudi Center at Cornell University; Cornell University Graduate School; Latin American Studies Program at Cornell University,"Annelies Deuss is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics, Department of Economics, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA.

Our application is in the use of gestation stalls (crates) in pork production. Our findings suggest that effects of both the mixture of attributes included in the design and consumer inferences on the specific attributes presented in experiments influence estimated willingness-to-pay and consumer welfare. Implications are that when researchers limit their studies to the use of a unique choice experiment design, resulting willingness-to-pay estimates might not be robust to different specifications.","[Pozo, Veronica F.; Tonsor, Glynn T.; Schroeder, Ted C.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Tonsor, GT (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",gtt@agecon.ksu.edu,,,,,,,37,15,21,0,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

Unlike investments in equities, commodity futures markets produce no earnings; the source of returns is thus unclear. This paper examines returns to static long-only U.S. commodity futures investments over five decades and finds that returns to individual futures markets are zero, and the returns to futures market portfolios depend critically on portfolio weighting schemes. Historical portfolio returns are not statistically different from zero and are driven by price episodes such as that of 1972-1974. In other periods, portfolio returns are zero or negative. Overall, the case for long-only investment in commodities may not be as strong as that implied in some studies (e.g., Gorton and Rouwenhorst, 2006a). If so, the growth in long-only commodity investments may naturally subside and ease the policy debate regarding speculative position limits.","[Irwin, Scott H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Sanders, Dwight R.] So Illinois Univ Carbondale, Dept Agribusiness Econ, Carbondale, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Irwin, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",dwights@siu.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848",,,,,45,20,23,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Average beef exports from Australia are approximately 65 per cent of the total amount of beef produced, about 1.3 million tonnes. Australia is particularly vulnerable to diseases that are not endemic to the country and could close or disrupt its export markets for beef. In this study, we construct a bioeconomic optimisation model of the Australian beef industry that captures production and consumption decisions, domestically and internationally, and the impacts on the beef industry of a potentially catastrophic disease, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). This study analyses localised to large-scale outbreaks and suggests that changes in economic surplus because of FMD range from a positive net gain of $57 million to a net loss of $1.7 billion, with impacts on producers and consumers varying depending on the location of the outbreak, control levels and the nature of any trade ban.","[Tozer, Peter] Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia; [Marsh, Thomas L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",University of New England; Washington State University,"Tozer, P (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Agr Econ Bldg W40, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia.",prt_consulting@live.com.au,"Tozer, Peter/AEW-0894-2022","Tozer, Peter/0000-0002-2429-7414",,,,,25,18,20,0,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The findings suggest that nursing home quality can be lower in markets with a greater supply of nursing homes. Further, assisted living facility market structure is found to have a mixed effect on nursing home quality.

We use seemingly unrelated and recursive bivariate probit regressions to test the endogeneity and joint decision making of pigeonpeamaize production. A double hurdle model is used to analyze the determinants of the intensity of technology adoption conditional on overcoming seed access constraints. To address the impact of adoption on welfare, the article employs both propensity score matching and switching regression techniques. Results from bivariate probit models show that unobservable factors cause both decisions to be correlated but the finding does not support the conjecture that both decisions are made jointly. Overall the analysis of the determinants of adoption identifies inadequate local supply of seed, access to information, human capital, and access to private productive asset as key constraints for pigeonpea technology adoption. The causal impact estimation from both the propensity score matching and switching regression suggests that maize/pigeonpea adoption has a positive and significant impact on income and consumption expenditure among sample households.","[Asfaw, Solomon] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Amare, Mulubrhan] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, D-30419 Hannover, Germany; [Shiferaw, Bekele] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Nairobi, Kenya",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Leibniz University Hannover; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Asfaw, S (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org United Nations, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",solomon.asfaw@fao.org,,"Shiferaw, Bekele/0000-0002-3645-320X",Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation (MBGF); ICRISAT,Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation (MBGF); ICRISAT(CGIAR),We would like to thank the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation (MBGF) and ICRISAT for their financial support to this study.

Design/methodology/approach - Survey data collected from 80 agri-food SMEs in Jiangsu Province were used for empirical testing: The authors applied an ordered logit regression approach for model estimation. Findings - The results demonstrate that strong guanxi networks, high level of transaction-specific investments and inter-personal trust significantly contribute to a high level of relationship satisfaction for agri-food SMEs in China. In addition, inter-personal trust shows a. moderating effect on the relationship between transaction-specific investments and relationship satisfaction. Practical implications - Business relationships play a critical role in the modern market environment. Relational arrangements (based on guanxi and inter-personal trust) should be further enhanced in order to yield satisfied business relationships for SMEs in China. Originality/value - The paper extends our understanding of relationship (guanxi) marketing, as well as marketing practices for agri-food SMEs in China.","[Lu, Hualiang] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Shuyi] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Trienekens, Jacques H.; Omta, S.

This paper sets out to discuss the contribution that the industrial district theory can make to the debate on the spatial dynamics of agri-food systems in the age of globalisation. To this end, the first part of the paper analyses the contribution of the industrial district approach in the relationship between industry and territory; the second part studies the evolution of the concept of the agri-food system and the main determinants of the spatial dynamics in modern agri food systems. This paper supports that the industrial district theory can shed a new light on the spatial dynamics of agri-food systems, and can offer an alternative to the mainstream approach. In using the local community as a unit of analysis, the ID theory gives a key role to human agents of production and their knowledge and the agri-food system can be seen as 'a global network of places: each place being specialized in a different component of the system.","[Sforzi, Fabio; Mancini, Maria Cecilia] Univ Parma, Dept Econ, Fac Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy",University of Parma,"Mancini, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Parma, Dept Econ, Fac Econ, Via JF Kennedy 8, I-43100 Parma, Italy.",fabio.sforzi@unipr.it; mariacecilia.mancini@unipr.it,"Sforzi, Fabio/AGX-0065-2022",,,,,,64,13,14,3,21,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

At the same time, concern is being expressed regarding another bubble in farmland prices. This paper studies and compares the farmland price to cash rent ratio (P/rent) with the price to earnings (P/E) ratio of stocks. We find that the farmland P/rent ratio has reached historical highs and is currently at the level of the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 during the tech bubble. Data from 1911 to 2012 are used to estimate the beta of farmland, a measure of the risk that farmland adds to a diversified portfolio. The beta is found to be very low over this period. Farmland returns are also regressed against expected and unexpected inflation, and we find that farmland moves relatively close to one-to-one with inflation. We also report 10- and 20-year holding period returns for farmland and find that the relationship between return and the cyclically adjusted P/rent ratio is strongly negative. Moreover, the current cyclically adjusted P/rent ratio is extremely high, indicating a reason for caution when investors are considering farmland purchases.","[Baker, Timothy G.; Boehlje, Michael D.; Langemeier, Michael R.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Baker, TG (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,"USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [IND010590]; Center for Commercial Agriculture, Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue University","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project; Center for Commercial Agriculture, Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue University","Timothy G.

For this, we use the 2008 Consumer Expenditure Survey for the United States. We find that higher levels of education contribute to greater household expenditures on both fresh and processed fruits and vegetables. We find a nonlinear effect on fresh fruits and vegetables, indicating that education impacts the quality of purchases as well. Although nutritional education is often touted as important for a healthful diet, these results highlight how investments in human capital via formal education can potentially improve dietary quality as well.","[Berning, Joshua] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Hogan, John J.] Univ Richmond, Sch Law, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Richmond,"Berning, J (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jberning@uga.edu,,,University of Connecticut Faculty Large Grant,University of Connecticut Faculty Large Grant,"This work was part of John Hogan's master's thesis at the University of Connecticut.

We find that a measure, combining experiments rooted in expected utility theory and measures derived from surveys, explains spot and contractual sales, but does not exhibit substantially greater explanatory power than its underlying components. Survey-based measures are generally more significant indicators of marketing choices, but experimental measures reveal how risk attitudes vary over a range of probable outcomes, which is important in light of increased commodity price volatility.

Their management is complicated through variability arising from climate and soil influences. This paper compares the implications of input-based policies and direct restrictions on leaching to achieve 10 and 20 per cent reductions in nitrogen (N) load, in the context of pasture-based New Zealand dairy farms. The most important mitigation practices on these farms are de-intensification (involving reductions in N fertiliser application and stocking rate) and the application of nitrification inhibitors. A stylised conceptual model, incorporating both sources of variability, is used to identify the implications of alternative policies. Direct restriction of estimated N leaching is the most cost-effective policy to reduce N leaching by 10 and 20 per cent. These results indicate the general insufficiency of input-based mechanisms for water quality improvement, given the low correlation between input use and leaching, possible substitution with unrestricted inputs and their failure to motivate the use of mitigation strategies. Additionally, model output indicates that inherent variability in water quality, mainly due to climate influences, can dominate the benefits of regulatory action in any given year.","[Doole, Graeme J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Romera, Alvaro J.] DairyNZ, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Western Australia; University of Waikato; DairyNZ,"Doole, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia.",gdoole@waikato.ac.nz,"Vigiak, Olga/ABA-4538-2021; Pannell, David/B-4476-2008","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Romera, Alvaro Jorge/0000-0001-5184-3364; Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491",,,,,48,16,17,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We find that the planting restriction has crowded out fruit and vegetable acreage nationally, and most notably in selected Sunbelt states, a region that specializes in horticultural crop production.

Effort responses can be quantitatively important-for our case they explain the entire treatment effect on the treated as measured in a conventional economic RCT.

The policy incentives offered in the choice experiments included an ideal index-based crop insurance contract, an index insurance contract with basis risk, cash payments, and fertilizer subsidies. Prior to implementing the choice experiments, the farmers participated in a workshop utilizing small group-based dynamic learning games that demonstrated how index-based crop insurance contracts function. The choice experiment results indicate that most farmers preferred cash payments to index insurance contracts, even when the insurance contracts offered substantially higher expected returns. Further, more risk averse farmers were more likely to prefer cash payments than less risk averse and risk loving farmers.","[Marenya, Paswel] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Smith, Vincent H.] Montclair State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Nkonya, Ephraim] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm Policy & Technol Div, Washington, DC USA",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Montclair State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Smith, VH (通讯作者)，Montclair State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",vsmith@montana.edu,,,International Food Policy Research Institute; Montana State University Agricultural Experiment Station,International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); Montana State University Agricultural Experiment Station,"Paswel Marenya is a research economist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) Ethiopia.

In the case of a renewable energy initiative such as an AD with large sunk costs and volatile returns, the value of deferring investment may be significant enough to offset the returns suggested by the net present value (NPV) approach. For a 150 cow herd, net revenues should be approximately $1.1 million before the AD is installed using the real options approach as compared to $0.5 million with the NPV approach. An AD is close to generating a positive NPV for a 600 cow herd if for either a 1% increase in the electrical price or decrease in the cost. However, farmers need not invest today and there is a value to delaying this decision from potential improvements in the technology that increase the efficiency and/or decrease operating costs of the AD. The real options analysis indicates that this option to delay investment has a value of approximately $300,000 for a typical Ontario dairy farm. Thus, either significant grant funding or higher feed-in-tariff rates are required to induce the increased adoption of AD technology in Ontario today even for the largest of dairy farms. Considering the probability of government support potentially ending, increases the value of investing today but a significant option value to defer still exists. Dans le present article, nous analysons la rentabilite des digesteurs anaerobies pour les exploitants de ferme laitiere en Ontario a l'aide de la methode des options reelles qui tient compte des politiques gouvernementales d'etablissement des prix actuelles et proposees et de l'incertitude entourant l'investissement. Dans le cas d'un projet d'energie renouvelable comme l'installation d'un digesteur anaerobie, qui comprend des couts irrecuperables importants et des rendements volatils, la valeur associee au report de l'investissement peut etre suffisamment importante pour contrebalancer les rendements avances par la methode de la valeur actualisee nette. Dans le cas d'une exploitation de 150 vaches, il faudrait que les recettes nettes atteignent pres de 1,1 million de dollars pour justifier l'installation d'un digesteur anaerobie selon la methode des options reelles comparativement a des recettes nettes de 0,5 million de dollars selon la methode de la valeur actualisee nette. Dans le cas d'une exploitation de 600 vaches, un digesteur anaerobie peut generer une valeur actualisee nette positive si le prix de l'electricite augmente de 1% ou si les couts diminuent de 1%. Toutefois, les exploitants ne sont pas tenus d'investir immediatement. Le report de la decision d'investir permettrait de profiter des progres technologiques eventuels qui augmenteraient l'efficacite ou diminueraient les couts d'exploitation d'un digesteur anaerobie. Selon l'analyse des options reelles, la valeur liee a la decision de reporter l'investissement est d'environ 300,000$ dans le cas d'une exploitation laitiere typique en Ontario. Ainsi, pour favoriser l'adoption de la technologie de la digestion anaerobie en Ontario, meme chez les exploitants de ferme laitiere de grande taille, les subventions ou les tarifs du Programme de tarifs de rachat garantis (TRG) devront etre plus eleves. La probabilite que le gouvernement abolisse son soutien accroit la valeur de l'investissement maintenant, mais l'option visant a reporter l'investissement comporte tout de meme une valeur significative.","[Anderson, Robert C.; Weersink, Alfons] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Weersink, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Room 222,JD MacLachlan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",rander02@uoguelph.ca; aweersin@uoguelph.ca,"Weersink, Alfons/O-1521-2019","Weersink, Alfons/0000-0001-5081-3593",,,,,20,13,16,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

We find that cross-price elasticities of demand are small, so consumers are unwilling to substitute between food-at-home and any type of FAFH or among types of FAFH.

The paper aims to discuss these issues Design/ methodology/ approach - The paper employs Balassa's index of revealed comparative advantage and Vollrath's indices of revealed competitive advantage in order to measure the competitiveness of Egyptian cotton exports. An Almost Ideal Demand System( AIDS) approach was then used to estimate demand parameters for Chinese cotton imports from Egypt and major supply sources during the period 1992-2011. Findings - Results show that Egypt has experienced dramatic declines in its cotton comparative advantage over the analyzed period. The estimation results of the AIDS model indicate that Egypt's market share is positively affected by both own and US export prices, but negatively influenced by export prices of other competitors in the Chinese market. Results also indicate that Egyptian cotton is substitutable for cotton imports from all other regions, especially for US cotton. Moreover, additional Chinese expenditure on cotton imports would favor other suppliers. Finally, demand for Egyptian cotton was found to be more sensitive to price changes and there is a greater tendency for China to switch to Egyptian cotton than the other way around should relative prices change. Originality/value - This paper is original and novel in that; despite numerous studies have been done on China's demand for cotton and the several studies have been carried out on export and marketing of Egypt's cotton, the issue of cotton trade between Egypt and China has rarely been empirically examined. Furthermore, our results update important parameter estimates, particularly import demand elasticities of cotton. For Egypt, the study provides useful policy implications that could help policy makers to improve informed decision making with regard topromoting cotton exports to the Chinese market. For China, the study helps understanding the interrelationship between the Chinese cotton market and other emerging exporting markets, while focusing on the Egyptian market.","[Abu Hatab, Assem] Suez Canal Univ, Dept Econ & Rural Dev, Al Arish, Egypt; [Abu Hatab, Assem] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Romstad, Eirik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, As, Norway",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Suez Canal University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Abu Hatab, A (通讯作者)，Suez Canal Univ, Dept Econ & Rural Dev, Al Arish, Egypt.",assem@assemhatab.info,"Abu Hatab, Assem/J-6823-2019","Abu Hatab, Assem/0000-0002-6764-1887",,,,,46,13,17,1,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Evidence from Taiwan,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health and social insurance programme; farm labour supply; land set-aside,MATCHING METHODS; FRINGE BENEFITS; CARE; SECURITY; PARTICIPATION; BEHAVIOR,"To protect farmers from health care costs and risks to livelihood, most countries have developed special health and social insurance programmes specifically for farmers. While numerous studies have examined the determinants of participation in these programmes, little is known about how they influence famers' land and labour allocations. Without government-sponsored health and social insurance, farmers may seek off-farm employment in order to obtain similar benefits. Conditioning eligibility for social insurance on minimum land holdings and on-farm work days can lead to delayed retirement and other forms of job lock. We investigate these issues using a unique dataset of 703,287 farms in Taiwan. After controlling for non-random participation in Taiwan's social insurance programme, we find that the programme increases (decreases) on (off) farm labour supply, and decreases the amount of set-aside land. This suggests that payments from social insurance substitute for those issued through land set-aside programmes to some extent, and that failing to account for this substitution increases the cost of achieving both programmes' objectives.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Meyerhoefer, Chad D.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA USA; [Just, David R.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, New York, NY 10021 USA",National Taiwan University; Lehigh University; Cornell University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 1,Roosevelt Rd,Sec 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,"Just, David R/K-7302-2012","chang, hung-hao/0000-0003-2296-134X",National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC99-2410-H-002-063],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","Hung-Hao Chang is an Associate Professor with the Department of Agricultural Economics, National Taiwan University, Taiwan, No 1, Roosevelt Rd, Sec 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.

This has been due in part to a lack of suitable price data, but it has also been due to the assumption that prices matter less in the United States, where households spend a relatively small fraction of their income on food. In this article we examine the role that local food prices play in determining food insecurity in the United States by using newly-developed price data. We examine whether low-income households participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps) are more likely to be food insecure in areas where food prices are higher. We find that the average effect of food prices on the probability of food insecurity is positive and significant: a one-standard deviation increase in food prices is associated with increases of 2.7, 2.6, and 3.1 percentage points in household, adult, and child food insecurity, respectively. These marginal effects amount to 5.0%, 5.1%, and 12.4% increases in the prevalence of food insecurity for SNAP households, adults, and children, respectively. These results suggest that indexing SNAP benefits to local food prices could improve the ability of the program to reduce food insecurity and economic hardship more generally in areas with high food prices.","[Gregory, Christian A.; Coleman-Jensen, Alisha] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Coleman-Jensen, A (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA.",cgregory@ers.usda.gov,"Coleman-Jensen, Alisha/AAD-3150-2020","Coleman-Jensen, Alisha/0000-0003-3008-2070",,,,,40,96,106,3,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

The tests identify a break in trend in 1974 and an intercept shift in 1985. These results point to slower productivity growth in agriculture beginning in 1974. Prior to 1974, productivity grew at an annual rate of 1.71, but this slowed to 1.56 after 1974.

A product-line gravity equation that accounts for zero trade flows is developed to investigate the trade impact of different pest-mitigation measures. While the results suggest that phytosanitary treatments generally reduce trade, the actual restrictiveness of these measures diminishes dramatically as exporters accumulate experience, and it vanishes when exporters reach a certain threshold. The results have important policy implications considering the number of empirical studies that find a negative impact of non-tariff measures on trade.","[Peterson, Everett; Grant, Jason] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Roberts, Donna] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Market & Trade Econ Div, Washington, DC USA; [Karov, Vuko] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Peterson, E (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",petrsone@vt.edu,,,Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at Virginia Tech; Economic Research Service [43-EAEL5-80055]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture's (NIFA) Agricultural and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) [2010-65400-20437],Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at Virginia Tech; Economic Research Service; National Institute of Food and Agriculture's (NIFA) Agricultural and Food Research Initiative (AFRI),"Peterson is a professor, and Grant is an assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at Virginia Tech.

Main findings from the current body of literature are that input subsidies provide some measurable but relatively small positive benefit to recipient households well-being. In addition, most studies find that subsidized inputs crowd out commercial input purchases, mitigating the extent to which subsidy programs contribute to total fertilizer use and crop production.

Studies have shown that, as the income effect dominates, government payments tend to reduce off-farm labor of farm operators and spouses. But that may not be true if one accounts for fringe benefits associated with off-farm employment. Additionally, with looming budget deficits and the possibility of a reduction in decoupled government payments, farm families may be facing an altered economic environment. Our study addresses this issue by examining the links between government farm program payments and the ever-important role of fringe benefits in the off-farm employment of farm couples. Results from farm-level data actually show that the marginal effect of government payments on hours worked off-farm will decrease in magnitude when accounting for fringe benefits, ceteris paribus. These results support the notion that farm households' welfare loss stemming from reduced decoupled payments may be overstated when models exclude fringe benefits from the estimation of off-farm labor supply.","[Mishra, Ashok K.] Louisiana State Univ, AgCtr, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Mishra, AK (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, AgCtr, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",Amishra@lsu.edu,"Mishra, Ashok K./J-7228-2019","Mishra, Ashok K./0000-0002-0988-1428",USDA Cooperative State Research Education & Extension Service; Hatch [0212495]; Louisiana State University Experiment Station [LAB 93872],USDA Cooperative State Research Education & Extension Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); Hatch(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Louisiana State University Experiment Station,"The views expressed here are not necessarily those of the Economic Research Service or the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

This requires the application of a modified version of Heckman's two-step method to estimate a random-effects double-hurdle model for unbalanced panel data. The age of the farmer, household size, and irrigation use are significant determinants of the decision of farmers to adopt herbicides as an alternative to manual weeding, while economic variables such as the price of herbicides, total income, and access to credit determine the level of herbicide use. Determinants of both adoption and level are land ownership, farm area, and the method of crop establishment. These results are potentially relevant when designing policies to reduce excessive herbicide use or to encourage the adoption of alternative weed control methods such as integrated weed management.","[Beltran, Jesusa C.] Philippine Rice Res Inst PhilRice, Sci City Munoz 3119, Nueva Ecija, Philippines; [Beltran, Jesusa C.; White, Benedict; Burton, Michael; Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand",Philippine Rice Research Institute; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; University of Waikato,"Beltran, JC (通讯作者)，Philippine Rice Res Inst PhilRice, Sci City Munoz 3119, Nueva Ecija, Philippines.",jcbeltran20@yahoo.com,"Pannell, David/B-4476-2008; White, Benedict/D-1434-2011; burton, michael/A-9541-2009","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491; burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093; White, Benedict/0000-0001-7256-2449; Beltran, Jesusa/0000-0003-2332-9661",,,,,51,15,16,2,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The article uses the linear static model applied to various consumer-perceived factors influencing the retail price of the conventional, organic and Fair Trade coffee available in the Czech Republic. The quantitative research is supported by the questionnaire for the analysis of the attitude of regular Fair Trade buyers towards the perceived quality and price expectations of the Fair Trade coffee. Even after the stratification of the coffee market into low and high market products and brands, the Fair Trade quality shows a very strong influence on the final retail price. The efficiency of Fair Trade expressed in terms of the ratio of the price premium paid by the consumer and the price premium received by the producer is in the current stage of the Fair Trade market questionable.","[Hejkrlik, Jiri; Mazancova, Jana; Forejtova, Karolina] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hejkrlík, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",hejkrlik@its.czu.cz,"Mazancová, Jana/AAK-2685-2020; Hejkrlik, Jiri/L-9689-2013","Mazancova, Jana/0000-0002-7735-5606; Hejkrlik, Jiri/0000-0002-1337-5261","Institute of Tropics and Subtropics, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [51140/1312/513114]","Institute of Tropics and Subtropics, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague","The research was conducted in the framework of internal grant of the Institute of Tropics and Subtropics, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (Project No. 51140/1312/513114).",,38,5,6,3,59,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The result may help policymakers choose a desired subsidy scheme to ensure food security for the urban poor facing food price surge. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis consists of three parts: constructing an empirical model on provincial panel data in 1993-2009 estimating the impact of grain price on food security among urban residents by different income level; evaluating the potential costs of shifting to income subsidy aiming to maintain the real income levels of the low income, lowest income or the poor residents if grain price increases by 20 percent; and comparing with the cost of price subsidy to achieve the same policy goal. Findings - The paper finds that, food price surge will hurt the urban poor much more seriously than the high income population; the rich residents may receive more benefit from price subsidy; and income subsidy has obviously a cost advantage while the targeted people benefit more. Originality/value - The obvious value of the paper is to show that income subsidy is much more desired than price subsidy, if the policy goal is to help the poor during food price surge.","[Huang Chunyan; Zhong Funing; He Jun] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang Chunyan] Yangzhou Univ, Sch Business, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University; Yangzhou University,"Zhong, FN (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",fnzhong@njau.edu.cn,"huang, chunyan/HNS-1814-2023",,National Social Science Major Project [08ZD015]; Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Research General Project [11YJC790062],National Social Science Major Project; Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Research General Project,This paper is funded by National Social Science Major Project (08&ZD015) and Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Research General Project (11YJC790062).,,26,2,3,1,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

India has been highly competitive in the exports of hen-eggs-in-shell and eggs-dried, whereas India needs to maintain its competitive position with respect to eggs-liquid and live-ducks. India could not retain its competitive position in live chicken exports due to the rising production cost coupled with the onslaught of the Avian Influenza (AI) in the recent years. Spreading of the AI put a heavy toll on poultry exports, especially chicken meat and eggs-liquid due to a complete ban on Indian poultry products imposed by many of the importing countries. The SDI indicated that poultry products' exports were more diversified during the post-WTO period. On the basis of the available data on the average ad-valorem applied duties faced by the Most Favoured Nations (MFN), the producers' price in various countries for chicken meat and eggs (hen-egg-in shell) and shipping charges from India to various countries, the lucrative export destinations for such poultry products were identified.","[Saran, Sandeep; Gangwar, Lal Singh] Cent Avian Res Inst, Poultry Econ & Agribusiness Res PEAR Sect, Izatnagar 243122, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kumar, Sarvesh] Cent Avian Res Inst, PEAR Sect, Inst Technol Management Unit, Izatnagar 243122, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Avian Research Institute; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Avian Research Institute,"Saran, S (通讯作者)，Cent Avian Res Inst, Poultry Econ & Agribusiness Res PEAR Sect, Izatnagar 243122, Uttar Pradesh, India.",ssaran@rediffmail.com,"Singh, Sanjay Kumar/M-3276-2019","Singh, Sanjay Kumar/0000-0002-5760-1865",,,,,13,4,4,2,17,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The Logit model was applied to test the determinants of repayment performance of RCCs' group lending. The authors used the survey data of 245 farm households in Guizhou province, collected in 2008. Findings - The empirical results indicate that there is a serious mismatch between joint liability mechanisms and the social and economic conditions in rural China. Mechanisms such as threatening to withhold defaulters' future loans from RCCs failed to work. In addition, higher household incomes also did not improve repayment performance. However, factors such as a higher degree of acquaintanceship in a group, migrant income, and employment in government agencies, positively improved the chances of repayment. Practical implications - Group lending is more suitable for poorer areas with few opportunities for migration and limited access to finance. In addition, constructing the trustworthy relationship between micro-lenders and customers and designing diverse and flexible financial services to meet heterogeneous demands are equally important. Originality/value - This paper is an attempt to empirically explore the determinants of repayment performance in group lending programs in China. The results provide meaningful policy implications for the government and rural financial institutions.","[Zhang Qinlan; Izumida, Yoichi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Zhang, QL (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",zql629@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,4,5,2,50,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Comprehensive IMS data is used to analyze the international diffusion of 845 molecules from 14 different anatomic therapeutic categories using non-parametric survival analysis. The paper focuses on two main regulatory changes that substantially reshaped the barriers to entry: the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, and the establishment of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 1995. We find that legal transaction costs have a significant impact on timing of launch. Stringent market authorization requirements for new pharmaceutical products in the United States after 1962 resulted in a significant U.S. drug lag in the introduction of pharmaceutical innovation vis--vis Europe from 19601984. However, financial incentives stemming from the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act proved effective in closing this lag. A more streamlined EMA regulatory approval process has reduced barriers to entry in Europe, thereby enabling quicker diffusion of pharmaceutical products, yet a marked pattern of delay in the adoption of innovation is still evident due to local differences in pricing regulations. Any new molecule launch strategically takes place first in higher-priced European Union (EU) markets as a result of the threat of arbitrage and price dependency across EU Member States.","[Varol, Nebibe; Costa-Font, Joan; McGuire, Alistair] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Costa-Font, Joan] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Costa-Font, Joan] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, CEP, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Varol, N (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.varol@lse.ac.uk,"Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919",Merck Foundation Trust; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Merck Foundation Trust; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),We are grateful for the financial support provided by Merck Foundation Trust.,,46,4,4,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Can cultivated land rental markets emerge in the face of rapidly developing off-farm labor markets? The purpose of this paper is to measure the correlation between the emergence of off-farm employment and cultivated land rental in China. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a panel data from 2000 and 2008, the authors constructed econometric models to identify the impact of off-farm employment on the decisions of households to rent out and rent in cultivated land.

The regulatory measure is in fact a limit on effort because the number of sea lion deaths is calculated from an estimated mortality rate per standard unit of effort measured in tows. During recent years, vessels have been observed to increase the median time per tow, suggesting that the industry is expanding the capacity of an unregulated input in response. This paper formalises the current situation analytically by constructing a bioeconomic model that captures the idiosyncrasies of the squid fishery and the imposed regulation. Reducing the regulatory constraint to an isoperimetric problem can show how the current management regime may skew incentives leading to the observed increase in tow time. An extension to the current regulatory framework by introducing a spatial dimension to the estimated sea lion mortality rate may lead to more efficient behaviour. Despite retaining an upper limit on sea lion deaths, the profit-maximising squid industry is given the incentive to increase effort in areas of high squid density relative to sea lion density.","Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Kahui, V (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",viktoria.kahui@otago.ac.nz,,,,,,,32,4,4,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

An example is purse seine fisheries that target several species over the season but are specialized in the sense that each species are targeted individually. Such fisheries are typically modeled as either independent single species fisheries or using standard multispecies functional forms characterized by jointness in inputs. We argue that production of each species is essentially independent but that jointness may be caused by competition for fixed but allocable input of vessel capacity. We develop a fixed but allocatable input model of purse seine fisheries capturing this particular type of jointness. We estimate the model for the Norwegian purse seine fishery and find that it is characterized by nonjointness, while estimations for this fishery using the standard models imply jointness.","[Hansen, Lars Garn; Jensen, Carsten Lynge] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Hansen, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",lgh@ifro.ku.dk,"Hansen, Lars Garn/D-3992-2014; Jensen, Carsten Lynge/E-4601-2015","Hansen, Lars Garn/0000-0003-0498-8901; Jensen, Carsten Lynge/0000-0002-9609-4982",,,,,29,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

It uses the year of arrival in the former homelands as an instrument for land access and size. This identification strategy is based on the fact that African households were forcibly relocated to the homelands during the apartheid. Due to increasing population pressure, later arrivals were less likely to be assigned land. The results show that land has a large positive effect on household welfare. Because the homelands are relatively disadvantaged areas, these results provide a lower bound for the positive effects of land on household welfare.","London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AZ, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lovo, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Tower 3, London WC2A 2AZ, England.",s.lovo@lse.ac.uk,,"Lovo, Stefania/0000-0001-6231-4142",,,,,29,3,3,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

A promising development to address these declines is technical change regarding groundwater substitutes such as desalination and wastewater recycling. However, because these technologies are energy intensive, optimal implementation also depends on future energy price trends. We provide an operational model for the case of reverse-osmosis seawater desalination. In an application to the Pearl Harbor Aquifer in Hawaii, we find that allowing the cost of desalination to increase at an average annual rate of 2.4% over the next century results in a substantially steeper efficiency price path for water. The higher prices decrease optimal groundwater extraction and induce a slower head drawdown over a longer period of time, thereby delaying the transition to desalination by over 30 years. Because the rise in energy costs exacerbates efficiency losses from under-pricing, any delay in implementing efficiency pricing will cause either a greater future increase in prices or the need for rationing. Reforming prices sooner rather than later may be more politically feasible, given that consumers may be more amenable to a gradual rise in prices today than a sudden doubling or tripling of prices ten years from now. Using this as a foundation, we outline a research agenda for extending the framework to other groundwater substitutes and for adapting to climate change.","[Roumasset, James] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Roumasset, James] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wada, Christopher A.] Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System,"Wada, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",cawada@hawaii.edu,"Wada, Christopher/I-8105-2016","Wada, Christopher/0000-0002-4916-9769",United States Geological Survey through the University of Hawaii at Manoa Water Resources Research Center [2012HI361B],United States Geological Survey through the University of Hawaii at Manoa Water Resources Research Center,This research was supported in part by the United States Geological Survey Grant No. 2012HI361B through the University of Hawaii at Manoa Water Resources Research Center.,,21,2,3,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Previous research has analysed determinants of farmer participation in groups, equating participation with group membership. However, within groups the commitment of members can vary, as marginal benefits and costs are not the same for all individuals, and opportunities to free-ride exist. Low participation in collective activities may reduce the ability of groups to provide useful services to its members. This article investigates determinants of member participation intensity, using the example of farmer groups in Kenya. The role of individual and group characteristics is analysed with survey data and regression models. Previous benefits that members received through the group positively influence their intensity of participation in group meetings and collective marketing, suggesting that reciprocity motives play a role. Low participation can mostly be attributed to structural and institutional conditions, such as group size and the timing of payments for collective product sales. More diversified farmers are less likely to sell collectively when group marketing activities only concentrate on one particular commodity. Since smallholders are often highly diversified, the focus of farmer groups should also be broadened. Further policy implications are discussed.","[Fischer, Elisabeth; Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Qaim, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",mqaim@uni-goettingen.de,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research was financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

This article identifies the determinants of horizontal and vertical intra-industry agri-food trade between New Member States (NMS) and the EU-27 in 1999-2010, by applying static and dynamic models with different specifications to panel data. Results show that IIT is mainly of a vertical nature in the NMS, though the majority of NMS export low quality agri-food products to EU-27 markets. Factor endowments are negatively related to agri-food horizontal intra-industry trade (HIIT), but positively to vertical intra-industry trade (VIIT). Economic size is positively and significantly related to both types of IIT, while distance and IIT are found to be negatively related in both cases. Results also suggest that HIIT and VIIT are greater if a New Member State exports agri-food products to another NMS while EU accession has had positive and significant impacts on both HIIT and VIIT, suggesting that economic integration fosters IIT.","Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Jambor, A (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",attila.jambor@uni-corvinus.hu,,"Jambor, Attila/0000-0001-8089-7222",Hungarian Scientific Research Fund Project [83119]; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,Hungarian Scientific Research Fund Project; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences),"The author gratefully acknowledges two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

A two-stage Heckman procedure is used to estimate these relationships from a systematically designed set of simulations with a highly detailed mixed integer bio-economic farm-level model. The resulting meta-models are then used to analyse how MAC vary across farm-level conditions and GHG measures. We find that simpler GHG indicators lead to significantly higher MAC, and that MAC strongly increase beyond a 1-5% emission reduction, depending on farm attributes and the chosen indicator. MAC decrease rapidly with increasing farm size, but the effect levels off beyond a herd size of 40 cows. As expected, the main factors driving gross margins per dairy cow also significantly influence mitigation costs. Our results indicate high variability of MAC on real life farms. In contrast to time consuming simulations with the complex mixed integer bio-economic programming model, the meta-models allow the distribution of MAC in a farm population to be efficiently derived and thus could be used to upscale to regional or sector level.","[Lengers, Bernd; Britz, Wolfgang; Holm-Mueller, Karin] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Lengers, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany.",bernd.lengers@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823",German Science Foundation (DFG) [HO 3780/2-1],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The research is funded by a grant of the German Science Foundation (DFG) with the reference number HO 3780/2-1.

The efficiency of the market outcome and speed of adjustment towards equilibrium have been studied in the literature to validate economic expectations. However, only a few real world examples outside the financial sector exist. In 2000, Germany implemented a sealed-bid double auction mechanism for trading milk quota. The two main features of this mechanism are: (1) a sealed-bid double auction that produces excess demands that are covered by state reserves free of charge, and (2) a variable price band that is used to exclude price bids above a certain range. To study these regulations a sealed-bid double auction experiment is simulated and run with students. It is shown that the regulations lead to significant losses in welfare that are caused by direct effects and by an imperfect adjustment of individual bidding behaviour. Further, learning effects throughout the experiments appear to be very limited. Thus, complex auction mechanisms may need to be thoroughly tested before being introduced in the real world.","[Loy, Jens-Peter] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Glauben, Thomas] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe, Halle, Germany; [Requate, Till] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Weiss, Christoph R.] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",University of Kiel; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); University of Kiel; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Loy, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Kiel, Germany.",jploy@ae.uni-kiel.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Loy, Jens-Peter/JKJ-3029-2023","Weiss, Christoph/0000-0001-5260-6520; Loy, Jens-Peter/0000-0002-4965-1862",Vienna University of Economics and Business,Vienna University of Economics and Business,"Jens-Peter Loy gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Vienna University of Economics and Business during a research visit in March 2012.

New product attributes are added in attempts to differentiate products and to attract consumers. Credence attributes, in particular those related to eco-labels and fishing method, have become more common. But little is known about how these and other credence attributes are valued in the retail market. In addition, little is known about price differences between private labels. To estimate the value of these attributes, weekly in-store observations of selected frozen whitefish products were conducted in seven UK retail chains in the city of Glasgow. An estimated hedonic model shows a substantial price premium for fishing method (line-caught), a premium for both home (Scottish) and non-home country of origin (Icelandic) and a premium for the Marine Stewardship Council eco-label. An uncertified eco-label owned by a large seafood manufacturer leads to reduced price. The study also reveals substantial price differences between private labels for whitefish. The results contribute new insights regarding opportunities for differentiation by credence attributes which may lead to more sustainable and effective resource use along the value chain for frozen whitefish.","[Sogn-Grundvag, Geir; Larsen, Thomas Andre] Norwegian Inst Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res N, N-9192 Tromso, Norway; [Young, James A.] Univ Stirling, Sch Management, Mkt & Retail Div, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",Nofima; University of Stirling,"Sogn-Grundvåg, G (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res N, Muninbakken 9-13,POB 6122, N-9192 Tromso, Norway.",geir.sogn-grundvag@nofima.no,,"Sogn-Grundvag, Geir/0000-0002-1893-0674",Fishery and Aquaculture Industry Research Fund; Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs,Fishery and Aquaculture Industry Research Fund; Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs,"James A.

Private companies fund nearly all food processing research and development (R&D) and perform a growing share of production-oriented R&D for agriculture. In addition, institutional partnerships for public-private research collaboration are growing in the United States and other countries. This article outlines the major forces driving these changes and offers an interpretive framework to explore some of the implications for the volume and nature of research performed by the public and private sectors. One of the critical issues is whether public agricultural research complements and thereby stimulates additional private agricultural R&D investments. Another important issue concerns the role and contribution of alternative public-private partnership arrangements. To date, changes in the institutional structure of public and private agricultural research have outpaced systematic investigation, and new theoretical and empirical research is needed to help guide policy and address key societal challenges, such as climate change, clean energy, water scarcity, food safety, and health.","[Fuglie, Keith O.; Toole, Andrew A.] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Toole, Andrew A.] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Fuglie, KO (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",kfuglie@ers.usda.gov,,"Fuglie, Keith/0000-0002-7601-0542",,,,,61,53,62,0,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The main aim of the paper is to analyze the impact of the temporary contract in agriculture on the probability of remaining employed in this sector. There is used a discrete-time competing risks duration model with two sub-samples, consisting of seasonal contracts and fixed-term contracts. The results show that while the probability of a worker finding a job increases with the number of temporary jobs already amassed in his or her career, this probability decreases with the number of interruptions in employment. There is also shown the effect of time dependence on the transition probabilities. Whether the temporary contract is seasonal or not, the risks of exiting towards non-employment are greatest for the shortest contracts, but the prospects for finding a job do improve thereafter. In the specific case of the fixed-term contract, the chances of converting this to a permanent contract are greater at the legal limit. Finally, the most highly qualified workers are those who leave the agricultural sector. Nevertheless, the risks of exiting are relatively low: agricultural jobs require a specific capital which is difficult to transfer to other sectors.","[Bellit, Sonia] Agrosup Dijon, INRA, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Bellit, Sonia] CCMSA, Bagnolet, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon,"Bellit, S (通讯作者)，Agrosup Dijon, INRA, UMR 1041, CESAER, 26 Bd Docteur Petitjean,BP87999, F-21000 Dijon, France.",sonia.bellit@dijon.inra.fr,,,,,,,28,4,4,1,12,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/ methodology/ approach - Probit model, Tobit model and Semi-parametric model are used to provide empirical evidences. Findings - Drawing upon an unique farm survey in 2003, the authors find that in rural China, FLR is more likely to follow egalitarian rule and PLR takes productivity of households into consideration. Econometric analysis provides two main findings. First, FLR has positive effect on household land rental behavior, possibly because egalitarian FLR creates a mismatch between household agricultural ability and land size and after FLR households have to participate in land rental market to adjust the mismatch. Second, PLR has negative effect on household land rental behavior which supports that land reallocation and land rental market are substitutes ( Brandt et al., 2004). Originality/ value - The main contribution of this study is to show that FLR and PLR in rural China are motivated by two different rationales ( i. e. FLR by egalitarian concerns and PLR by efficiency concerns).","Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Che, Y (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",tccheyi2005@hotmail.com,,,,,,,41,9,9,4,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Many instruments are already used to identify the creative accounting and the frauds and new ones are still being searched for. One of the suitable approaches is the use of the database Farm Accountancy Data Network (FAND) and environmental indicators. Monitoring of material balances and wastes in the form of environmental costs and also parts of the material balances can be a basis for the creation of the model for the detection of the material flow cost accounting.

Using Irish micro data over the period 1997-2010, we estimate the Q model of investment and test for financing constraints using a measure of internal finance dependence. Our econometric method controls for censoring, heterogeneity and endogeneity. We find that financing constraints are binding and the impact of constraints becomes much more acute following the financial crisis. Constraints are found to be well above pre-crisis levels and especially elevated in 2007, 2008 and 2009.

Design/ methodology/ approach - This paper uses a randomly sampling survey of 139 food enterprises in China. After statistical significance and statistical power were examined, canonical correlation analysis was used as the main data analysis technique of this research. Findings - Based on the environment-strategy paradigm, the authors found that the changes of the competition environment, resource environment, and institution environment in the food industry have significant association with food companies' strategic reactions such as public relations, networking with firms and futurity after food safety incidents in the food market were disclosed. Originality/value - The paper is the first to quantitatively examine the relationships between the changes of food companies' environments and the strategic reactions of food companies after the media disclosed that there were food safety incidents in the food markets. The findings of this paper send novel and important messages to government decision makers and the public, evidencing how food companies strategically respond to external environmental changes, and suggesting that the institution-builder as well as the media have more work to do in the aftermath of food safety incidents.","[Zeng, Kaisheng; Luo, Xiaohui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yinglin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Mem Hosp, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Zeng, KS (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zengksh@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,,,,,32,2,2,3,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The purpose of this article is to review the evidence from recent studies that investigate the empirical relationship between index investment and price movements in agricultural futures markets. One line of research uses time-series regression tests, such as Granger causality tests, to investigate the relationship between price movements and index positions. This research provides little evidence in support of the Masters Hypothesis in agricultural futures markets. A second line of research uses cross-sectional regression tests and studies in this area provide very limited evidence in favor of the Masters Hypothesis for agricultural futures markets. A third line of research investigates whether there is a significant relationship between commodity index trading and the difference, or spread, between futures prices of different contract maturities on the same date. These studies report a range of results depending on the type of test. However, the bulk of the evidence indicates either no relationship or a negative relationship, which is once again inconsistent with the Masters Hypothesis. Overall, this growing body of literature fails to find compelling evidence that buying pressure from commodity index investment in recent years caused a massive bubble in agricultural futures prices. The Masters Hypothesis is simply not a valid characterization of reality.","Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Irwin, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 344 Mumford Hall,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",sirwin@illinois.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848",,,,,53,31,33,1,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Not accounting for this attribute non-attendance' leads to biased parameter estimates, and hence biased estimates of willingness to pay. Various methods exist to account for non-attendance in the analysis of choice data, with limited agreement as to which method is best'. This paper compares modelling approaches that can account for non-attendance, based on stated and inferred attribute non-attendance. Respondents' stated non-attendance is incorporated in the specification of multinomial and mixed logit models. Inference of non-attendance is based on equality constrained latent class models. Results show that model fit is significantly improved when attribute non-attendance is taken into account, and that welfare estimates are lower when incorporating non-attendance. The inference based on equality constrained latent class models provides the best model fit. There is little concordance between stated and inferred non-attendance, suggesting that respondents may not answer attendance statements truthfully.","Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Kragt, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, M089-35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",marit.kragt@uwa.edu.au,"Kragt, Marit E./D-3185-2011","Kragt, Marit E./0000-0001-6847-4817","Environmental Economics Research Hub through the Commonwealth Environmental Research Facility of the Australian Department of Environment, Water Heritage and the Arts; Landscape Logic through the Commonwealth Environmental Research Facility of the Australian Department of Environment, Water Heritage and the Arts","Environmental Economics Research Hub through the Commonwealth Environmental Research Facility of the Australian Department of Environment, Water Heritage and the Arts; Landscape Logic through the Commonwealth Environmental Research Facility of the Australian Department of Environment, Water Heritage and the Arts","This study was part of the author's PhD research at the Australian National University.

More specifically, the performance is assessed with respect to trend estimation, prediction of future yield levels, and the estimation of expected indemnity payments. In agreement with earlier findings, other estimators are found to be superior to OLS in simple regression problems if yield distributions are outlier contaminated and heteroscedastic. While this conclusion is also valid for subsequent applications such as yield prediction and the estimation of expected indemnity payments, the difference between the considered estimators becomes less distinct. For these applications, we find particularly the M-estimator to be a good compromise between high-breakdown (very robust) estimators and the very efficient OLS-estimator. Because no regression technique dominates all others in all applications and scenarios for error term distributions, our results underline that the choice of the estimation technique should be dependent on the purpose of the crop yield data analysis. However, alternative estimators such as M-, MM-, and TS-estimator can reduce (and bound) the risk of unreliable or inefficient crop yield data analysis in crop insurance applications.","Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Finger, R (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",robert.finger@wur.nl,"Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742",Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The article is a contribution to the activities of the National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate) supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

A nonzero threshold captures strategic behaviors and adjustment costs that are not observable with small price changes around a zero threshold. Fish farming, because of greater control over supply, is expected to produce less asymmetry than wild harvesting. Asymmetry is notwithstanding found for both wild cod and farmed salmon marketed in France, but only with consistent thresholds and operating in opposite ways. The results are discussed with regard to the trade restrictions imposed by the Common Fisheries Policy.

We use the farm type extension of the common agricultural policy impact (CAPRI) model, which captures farm heterogeneity across the EU. The first scenario (NUTS1) assumes uniform per-hectare payments at the NUTS1 level. The second scenario (MS-CONV) equalises the per-hectare rates inside each Member State (MS) and partially harmonises the single payment scheme (SPS) across MS in line with the 2011 Commission proposal. The third scenario simulates a uniform per-hectare payment at the EU level. Depending on the implementation of the SPS, the NUTS1 flat rate induces a substantial redistribution of payments across farm types and NUTS2 regions, particularly in regions that apply the historical SPS. The MS-CONV and EU flat-rate schemes have more significant impacts at the EU-wide level. In the EU-15, almost all farms lose payments from MS-CONV and EU-wide flat rates, whereas in the EU-10, almost all farm types gain from these scenarios. Our conservative estimates indicate that the flat-rate payments could redistribute up to 8.5 billion. Lower land rental costs partially offset the losses of farm income in the EU-15 from payment redistribution. Land rents drop for all flat-rate scenarios across most sectors and farm sizes in the EU-15. In the less productive new MS, the landowners rental income is largely unaffected by the introduction of the flat rate.","[Gocht, Alexander] Thunen Inst Rural Studies, Braunschweig, Germany; [Britz, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany; [Ciaian, Pavel; Gomez y Paloma, Sergio] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, IPTS, Seville, Spain",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; University of Bonn; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Gocht, A (通讯作者)，Thunen Inst Rural Studies, Braunschweig, Germany.",alexander.gocht@vit.bund.de,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823; Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors are grateful to Eurostat and Unit L.3 Microeconomic Analysis of EU Agricultural Holdings of the European Commission for granting access to the FSS and the FADN data, respectively.

Positive information that links health and the consumption of organic food influences both steps of the decision process. Our dataset includes information about consumers media habits, which allows us to disentangle the direct effects of media information from the indirect effects of this information as it is disseminated through the population.

To understand the possible impacts of such an innovation, we derive and calibrate a partial-equilibrium model using parameters for consumer vaccine uptake from stated-preference work under an array of assumptions concerning industry moral hazard, consumer awareness and alternative preventive effort exercised by consumers. We simulate three scenarios in the U.S. beef sector: the introduction of a vaccine, the tightening of pathogen standards for beef production and the simultaneous introduction of both vaccinations and tighter standards. Our simulation shows that all policies can increase aggregate surplus given most calibrations; though, the largest effects are attributed to vaccine introductions, which reduce expected damages from foodborne illness among vaccinated consumers without shifting firm costs. However, unaware consumers and aware consumers who choose not to vaccinate experience no change in expected damages when a vaccine is introduced but face a higher price of food because of the stronger demand of food from vaccinated consumers.","[Marette, Stephan] INRA, UMR Econ Publ, Paris, France; [Roe, Brian E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Teisl, Mario F.] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, Orono, ME USA",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Marette, S (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR Econ Publ, Paris, France.",marette@agroparistech.fr,"Teisl, Mario/K-2502-2019; Roe, Brian/A-7386-2009","Teisl, Mario/0000-0002-2021-9208; Roe, Brian/0000-0003-4228-2889",,,,,20,2,2,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

This paper focuses on how the ownership structure of on-shore wind power plants (external, farmer or community) affects the size and distribution of impacts within the rural part of a region. Empirical analysis is based on a regional computable general equilibrium model of North East Scotland with the results compared to those generated from a standard social accounting matrix multiplier analysis. With no local ownership, while rural GDP increases, there is almost no effect on household incomes due to the limited direct linkages of the on-shore wind sector. Local ownership increases the household income benefits but there are still limited positive spill-over effects on the wider economy unless factor income is re-invested in local capital. With re-investment, farm household ownership gives rise to the largest increase in total household income but community ownership gives rise to the largest increase in rural (non-farm) household incomes and welfare. The results contribute to the on-going debate about the opportunity cost of external asset ownership in rural areas.","[Roberts, Deborah] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Dept Real Estate, Old Aberdeen, England; [Phimister, Euan] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Old Aberdeen, Scotland; [Phimister, Euan] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen Ctr Res Energy Econ & Finance, Old Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"Roberts, D (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Dept Real Estate, Edward Wright Bldg, Old Aberdeen, England.",e.phimister@abdn.ac.uk; deb.roberts@abdn.ac.uk,"Roberts, Deborah/G-8693-2013","Roberts, Deborah/0000-0003-0018-6039; Phimister, Euan/0000-0002-6483-0113","EU [FP6-SSP-2005-006469, Fp7-SSH-216672, 1514082009 A08GR]",EU(European Union (EU)),"The paper builds on research made possible through a number of grants including the EU 6th framework project 'TERA' FP6-SSP-2005-006469, the EU 7th framework project 'CAP-IRE' Fp7-SSH-216672, and the EU project 'RURAL ECMOD' 1514082009 A08GR.

Therefore, the personality of a manager who is a holder of specific knowledge, abilities, skills, traits, motives, attitudes and values becomes increasingly important as it is the main source for gaining a competitive advantage. Managerial competencies, i.e. the individual characteristic necessary to reach the required level of a manager's performance, together with an efficient management thus become the key factor of success. The article focuses on the identification of managerial competencies in knowledge-based organizations in the Czech Republic. The first part of the article focuses on the theoretical approaches to managerial competencies, competency models and knowledge-based organizations. The second part of the article deals with the proposed methodology for the identification of managerial competencies. The final part summarizes the benefits and difficulties of applying the competency-based approach as a tool of the efficient management of organizations for the purpose of achieving a competitive advantage.

The paper discusses simulated impacts on farm income and agricultural markets from implementing the European flat rate hectare payment corrected for the purchasing power disparities across the Member States while reducing the overall budget outlays for direct payments by 50% and dismantling the remaining coupled support to ruminants. The results are an outcome of a comparative static analysis against a reference scenario which assumes the Health Check policy in 2020. The model results suggest a drop of the agricultural gross value added by 9% at the aggregate EU27 level compared to the reference scenario. Impacts differ between the Member States groups, Member States and regions, depending on the share of premiums in the income from agriculture, specialization and competitiveness of production. The largest reduction is projected for the suckler cow herd, dropping by 6% compared to the reference scenario. The drop is caused by removing the coupled support and affecting mostly the herds in Spain and France.","[Kozar, Maja] Agr Inst Slovenia, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Kempen, Markus; Britz, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany; [Erjavec, Emil] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana, Slovenia",Agricultural Institute Slovenia; University of Bonn; University of Ljubljana,"Kozar, M (通讯作者)，Agr Inst Slovenia, Hacquetova Ulica 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",maja.kozar@kis.si,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823",,,,,33,1,1,2,20,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Then we have examined the determinants of the vertical and total intra-industry trade in the agricultural sector by using the panel technique. Based on the obtained results, it has confirmed that economic development (both per capita income and HDI) has a positive and significance effect on the Iran's bilateral intra-industry trade. Also, the results verify the Linder hypothesis. In sum, the Iran's foreign trade in agricultural sector is mainly based on comparative advantage. Specifically, there is a negative and significant relationship between the revealed comparative advantage and the industry trade. In addition, the endowment of land affects positively the high vertical intra-industry trade.

An empirical implementation of the model relies on data on water price and irrigation technology adoption observed in a California irrigation district over the period 1999-2002.

But is it helpful for these farmers, given that it is likely to be applied when farm output is depressed and many poor farmers in developing countries need to buy food? Stochastic simulations for 31 countries suggest that use of this safeguard in line with the proposed WTO rules would raise the world poverty headcount by an average of 24million. The adverse poverty impact of the duty is larger when the quantity safeguard is triggered than it would be in other years, because lower farm output reduces the benefits to poor farm households from higher prices.","[Ivanic, Maros; Martin, Will] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Ivanic, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mivanic@worldbank.org,"Martin, William/E-6226-2011","Ivanic, Maros/0000-0002-5156-4055; Martin, William/0000-0002-2824-1303",,,,,17,8,8,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We simultaneously estimate both risk and time preferences and examine how demographic and socio-economic characteristics are correlated with each preference. The empirical basis for our analysis is a panel data survey of 211 households conducted in Mali and Burkina Faso in 2007 and 2011, and economic experiments conducted with the heads of these households in 2011. The theoretical basis for our analysis is a discounted utility model. We apply prospect theory and quasi-hyperbolic discounting to estimate the present values of future utility streams. We apply a maximum likelihood approach to jointly estimate risk and time preferences, and to investigate the correlations among the preference parameters and observable characteristics. We find that, on average, the West African cattle farmer is generally more risk averse and more patient than similarly-situated respondents from Asia. Additionally, risk and time preferences are correlated with wealth, education, and religion. We find that constraints in wealth and education are associated with greater risk aversion and impatience. Furthermore, time spent in a Koranic school is positively related to the overweighting of small probabilities, greater risk-taking behavior, and patience.","[Liebenehm, Sabine; Waibel, Hermann] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Agr Econ, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Liebenehm, S (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Agr Econ, Hannover, Germany.",,,"Liebenehm, Sabine/0000-0001-5337-6923",German Research Foundation (DFG) [WA 1002/8-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Sabine Liebenehm is a Researcher and Herman Waibel is the Director, both at the Institute of Agricultural Economics, Faculty of Economics and Management, Leibniz University of Hanover, Germany.

Evidence from an Exogenous Change,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agriculture; subsidies; employment effect; single farm payment; common agricultural policy; EU,POLICY; IMPACTS,"This study uses aggregated municipality data, for the years 2001-2009, to explore whether direct payments to farmers affect agricultural employment in Swedish municipalities. The decoupling reform in 2005 included a new grassland support payment accompanied by management obligations that had unexpectedly high redistributive consequences as it greatly increased common agricultural policy payments to municipalities with large areas of grassland. In some municipalities, total payments more than doubled. Thus, since the reform seems exogenous to the behaviour of farmers and the regional economy, the reform can be used to identify a subsidy effect. We find that a permanent increase in agricultural employment can be attributed to the new grassland support. Our results indicate that the grassland support generates an additional job at a cost of SEK 250,000, relative to the average agricultural wage of SEK 333,000. However, the subsidy effect is largely keeping jobs in agriculture, i.e. the grassland support may be slowing down the process of structural change in grassland regions.","AgriFood Econ Ctr, Lund, Sweden",,"Nordin, M (通讯作者)，AgriFood Econ Ctr, Lund, Sweden.",martin.nordin@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,31,12,13,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Evidence from Nigeria,AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fertilizer subsidies; Input vouchers; Nigeria; Sub-Saharan Africa,DEMAND,"Government distribution of subsidized fertilizer in Sub-Saharan Africa is often characterized by cumbersome administrative processes and diversion of the product from the proclaimed beneficiaries. This study uses propensity score matching techniques to analyze an input voucher program in Nigeria that was meant to demonstrate an alternative and more efficient distribution mechanism for subsidized fertilizer. We find that participants in the 2009 voucher program received more bags of subsidized fertilizer than nonparticipants and also paid significantly lower prices compared to those who purchased directly from the market. On average, however, participating in the voucher program did not improve the timeliness of fertilizer receipt or the quality of the product. Where statistically significant, participating in the program increased the likelihood that the product was received late and that some complaint about the product's quality was made. As many developing countries; particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa adopt the use of input vouchers or scale up already existing programs, this study demonstrates when the distribution of subsidized fertilizer via vouchers improves farmers' timely access to good and more affordable fertilizer.

Or aujourd'hui, les chercheurs et directeurs de cooperatives constatent une baisse de ces deux niveaux de participation. Ce papier a pour objectif de construire une typologie des adherents de cooperatives agricoles du secteur cerealier francais au regard de leurs comportements de participation puis d'identifier les determinants qui expliquent l'appartenance des adherents a une des classes de la typologie a partir d'un modele probit multinomial. Nous faisons l'hypothese que les attitudes de confiance et d'implication organisationnelles manifestees par l'adherent envers sa cooperative peuvent expliquer ces differences de comportements aux cotes de variables individuelles liees a l'adherent et son exploitation agricole et de variables liees a la cooperative a laquelle il adhere. L'analyse des comportements de participation permet de regrouper les 290 adherents de l'echantillon en trois classes distinctes: << les individualistes >>, << les bons soldats >> et << les engages >>. Les resultats du probit multinomial sur ces 3 classes montrent notamment un effet significatif de l'attitude d'implication organisationnelle, de la presence de stockage a la ferme et de la taille de la cooperative sur la probabilite d'etre individualiste par rapport aux deux autres classes. When a farmer joins an agricultural cooperative, he or she undertakes to participate in the cooperative economically, as a co-operator, and also in its administration, as an associate. Yet, today, researchers and directors of cooperatives are observing a drop in member participation in both spheres. The goal of this paper is to build a typology of the members of grain farmer agricultural co-operatives in France, based on the members' participation, and then use a multinomial probit model to identify the factors that come into play and result in a member belonging to a given category in the typology. We make the hypothesis that attitudes with respect to organizational involvement and the member's confidence in his or her co-operative can explain these differences in behavior, along with individual variables tied to the member and his or her farm business, and variables associated with the co-operative to which the member belongs. Following the analysis of the participation behavior of the 290 members in the sample, the members can be grouped into three distinct categories: individualists, good soldiers, and engaged. The results of the multinomial probit model on these three categories show, in particular, that attitude toward organizational involvement has a significant effect, as do the presence of storage on the farm and the size of the cooperative on the probability of being an individualist rather than a good soldier or engaged.","[Barraud-Didier, Valerie] INP ENSAT, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Henninger, Marie-Christine] Univ Toulouse II Le Mirail, Lab Dynam Rurales, UMR MA 104, F-31058 Toulouse 9, France; [Triboulet, Pierre] INRA, AGIR UMR1248, F-31320 Castanet Tolosan, France",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse - Jean Jaures; INRAE,"Barraud-Didier, V (通讯作者)，INP ENSAT, UMR AGIR Ave Agrobiopole, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",valerie.barraud-didier@ensat.fr; marie-christine.henninger@univ-tlse2.fr; Pierre.Triboulet@toulouse.inra.fr,"Triboulet, Pierre/AAP-1103-2021",,,,,,56,5,5,3,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the panel data of 25 provinces from 1958 to 1962 to make the benchmark estimations by POLS and endogeneity-elimination estimations by 2SLS, employing the great advance in agricultural cooperative movement between 1954 and 1956 and the rural population density as the IVs for the radicalism of communal dining system during the Great Leap Forward. The beta coefficients and Gfields decomposition are also presented to assess the relative importance of various factors on famine. Findings - The empirical study finds that the communal dining system does play a critical role on the famine. The evidences of the beta coefficients and Gfields decomposition basing on previous estimations also show that communal dining system is the most important cause on the famine. Social implications - The lesson from communal dining system on famine provides reference for resolving the current Three Agrarian Issues in China. It is important to allow peasants to exit from the compulsive collective system. Originality/value - The paper discovers the institutional root of the famine by the endogeneity-elimination estimations of IVs and the assessment of relative importance of various factors on famine by beta coefficients and Gfields decomposition.","[Liu, Yuan; Wei, Xiahai] S China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wen, James G.] Trinity Coll, Dept Econ, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [Wen, James G.] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Adv Res Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",South China Normal University; Trinity College; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，S China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",hope428@163.com,"wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023",,"MOE(Ministry of Education of PRC) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [09YJC790099]; Trinity College of USA; China Scholarship Council, through Institute of Cotton Research, Anyang, China","MOE(Ministry of Education of PRC) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Trinity College of USA; China Scholarship Council, through Institute of Cotton Research, Anyang, China","The grant from MOE(Ministry of Education of PRC) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Project No. 09YJC790099) and Trinity College of USA are deeply appreciated.

In response, the Canadian government established standards to regulate their labeling. However, many retail and media outlets offer varying definitions that fit their needs. Consumers utilize this often conflicting information to formulate their understanding of local and organic. The aim of this study was to investigate consumer understanding and perception of local and organic food, especially in regard to production characteristics. The results indicate that local is predominantly defined as decreased miles to transport, whereas organic is defined as food produced without the use of synthetic pesticides. However, a fairly large percentage of consumers perceive inaccurate definitions as being characteristics of local and organic. Furthermore, consumers with accurate definitions of local and organic share a similar consumer profile, while consumers with misguided perceptions do not. We also see that characteristics such as ethnic heritage, personal characteristics, geographic region, and length of stay in Canada not only influence consumer understanding and perception, but also the geographic boundaries associated with local.","[Campbell, Benjamin L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Mhlanga, Saneliso; Lesschaeve, Isabelle] Vineland Res & Innovat Ctr, Vineland Stn, ON L0R 2E0, Canada",University of Connecticut,"Campbell, BL (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 3107 Horsebarn Hill Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",ben.campbell@uconn.edu; saneliso.mhlanga@vinelandresearch.com; isabelle.lesschaeve@vinelandresearch.com,,,"Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","We gratefully acknowledge funding from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, New Directions and Growing Forward programs that were instrumental in conducting this research.",,24,41,45,0,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Using data aggregated at the level of the 589 municipalities of a highly urbanized country (Belgium), we found that the same determinants enter these equations, with slight differences in parameter values: land prices decrease with distance to central business district (developable land: -2.7% per km; farmland: -2.5% per km), and increase with the population of the commune as well as with its demographic growth and with the average income of its inhabitants.","[Cavailhes, Jean] INRA, UMR 1041, CESAER, F-21079 Dijon, France; [Thomas, Isabelle] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Thomas, Isabelle] Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Geog, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Thomas, Isabelle] Natl Fund Sci Res, Brussels, Belgium",Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; INRAE; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,"Cavailhès, J (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR 1041, CESAER, 26,Blvd Docteur Petitjean,BP 87999, F-21079 Dijon, France.",Jean.Cavailhes@dijon.inra.fr; isabelle.thomas@uclouvain.be,"Thomas, Ian S/B-8253-2011","THOMAS, Isabelle/0000-0003-3386-2427",,,,,61,9,10,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

This paper provides a comparative analysis of these payments and quantifies the impact of such payments in the presence of debt constraints. The main findings are that CCPs are more distorting than SFP.

Political cycles are conditional on certain factors; for example, elections have a stronger effect on support under right-wing cabinets.

A better model fit results from allowing the unconditional variance to slowly change over time. Moreover, the persistence of volatility shocks is shown to be much weaker than what standard GARCH models imply. Combining the volatility results with monthly macroeconomic indicator data, we find that decomposing realized volatility into high- and low-frequency components better reveals the impact of slowly-evolving aggregate variables on price volatility. Moreover, over the period 1990-2005, most of the macroeconomic variables had similar effects within the same commodity category (e.g. grain), but their effects differed across commodity groups (e.g. grain versus livestock). Over the period 2006-2009, however, commodity-specific factors dominated common factors.","[Karali, Berna] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Power, Gabriel J.] Univ Laval, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Laval, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Laval University,"Karali, B (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",bkarali@uga.edu; Gabriel.Power@fsa.ulaval.ca,,"Karali, Berna/0000-0001-7969-7506","NIFA (formerly CSREES) Hatch [RI-9262]; Institut de Finance Mathematique de Montreal [IFM2]; Centre Inter-universitaire de Recherche sur le Risque, les Politiques Economiques et l'Emploi (CIRPEE)","NIFA (formerly CSREES) Hatch; Institut de Finance Mathematique de Montreal; Centre Inter-universitaire de Recherche sur le Risque, les Politiques Economiques et l'Emploi (CIRPEE)","The authors acknowledge constructive comments from Wally Thurman, two anonymous reviewers, and the editor.

We examine the long-run investment and consumption choices under two scenarios: (i) when the water availability constraint is binding and (ii) when it is not binding. We then compare the two scenarios to derive conditional convergence hypotheses regarding the impact of water availability on long-run agricultural growth. Panel data from Wyoming are used to test these conditional convergence hypotheses. We find that Wyoming counties exhibit strong conditional convergence in agricultural growth. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that water availability is not a determinant but can be a constraint on long-run agricultural growth. Higher water use leads to higher growth in agricultural yield per capita but when water rights constrain water use in a county, as we found in southeastern Wyoming, there are significant losses in agricultural growth.","[Chaudhry, Anita M.] Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Econ, Chico, CA 95929 USA; [Barbier, Edward B.] Univ Wyoming, Coll Business, Dept 3985, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",California State University System; California State University Chico; University of Wyoming,"Chaudhry, AM (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Econ, Butte Hall 603, Chico, CA 95929 USA.",achaudhry@csuchico.edu,,,Wyoming Water Development Commission; U.S. Geological Survey,Wyoming Water Development Commission; U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey),"We wish to acknowledge the financial support of Wyoming Water Development Commission and U.S. Geological Survey.

Furthermore, we find that farmers using the multinational channel are more efficient than farmers in the cooperative channel, but equally profitable.

The analysis is performed using Italian and international weekly spot (cash) price data over years 20062010, a period of generalized turbulence of agricultural markets. Firstly, the properties of price time series are explored; then, interdependence across prices is specified and estimated by adopting appropriate cointegration techniques.

Therefore, the paper aims to analyze the influence of production uncertainties on world's wheat and corn prices. Design/methodology/approach - In a specially designed two-step method, at first, the contributions of deterministic and uncertainty factors to wheat and corn production in around 100 countries are decomposed. Then, a panel model is applied to estimate the combined impact of each type of factors on the prices. Furthermore, the authors decompose the explained variances of the panel models in order to determine the importance of each type of factors for price adjustments. Findings - The uncertainties in wheat production do significantly affect both wheat and corn prices on a global scale, whilst those of corn do not. Moreover, the variance decompositions reveal that deterministic factors contribute much more to the explanation of world food prices than indeterministic factors. Practical implications - As deterministic factors are much more important than uncertainty factors for explaining market price movements, farmers should organize themselves to coordinate production in order to stabilize world food prices. Originality/value - The paper proposes a simple methodology, which enables scholars to integrate production uncertainties into food price analyses.","[Meyer, Stefan] Univ Goettingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, Gottingen, Germany; [Yu, Xiaohua] Univ Goettingen, Courant Res Ctr, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Meyer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, Gottingen, Germany.",smeyer5@gwdg.de,,"Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081",,,,,15,6,7,1,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This is consistent with the need to assess the likely impact of agricultural policies on the environmental and social dimensions of sustainability. The model was applied to a specific study area to explore the likely consequences of a recently proposed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union.

Korean rice farms tend to be very small and highly specialized. Our analysis examines the productivity effects associated with both farm size and farm specialization/diversification in Korean agriculture. Relying on farm-level panel data, the analysis studies farm productivity in a multi-input multi-output context, accounting not only for changes in inputs and technical change in rice production, but also for the role of diversification in the production of other crops in current and previous periods. We find positive but small productivity gains from farm diversification. These gains come mostly from complementarity effects across farm outputs, with minimal effect of scale economies. The positive complementarity effects work against nonconvexity effects, which provide strong productivity incentives for rice farms to specialize.","[Kim, Kwansoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Seoul, South Korea; [Chavas, Jean-Paul; Barham, Bradford; Foltz, Jeremy] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Kim, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 599 Gwanak Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",kimk@snu.ac.kr,"Foltz, Jeremy/AAX-6903-2021",,National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean Government [NRF-2010-013-B00009],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korean Government(Korean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2010-013-B00009).,,38,29,33,3,73,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We pay attention specifically to the role of levy-based funding under INIA, which was established in 1990. Our results indicate that the creation of INIA was associated with a revitalization of funding for agricultural R&D in Uruguay, which spurred sustained growth in agricultural productivity during the past two decades when productivity growth was stagnating in many other countries. The econometric results were somewhat sensitive to specification choices. The preferred model includes two other variables with common trends, a time-trend variable and a proxy for private research impacts, as well as a variable representing the stock of public agricultural knowledge that entailed a lag distribution with a peak impact at year 24 of the 25-year lag. It implies a marginal benefit-cost ratio of 48.2, using a real discount rate of 5 per cent per annum and a modified internal rate of return of 24 per cent per annum. The benefit-cost ratio varied significantly across models with different lag structures or that omitted the trend or the private research variable, but across the same models, the modified internal rate of return was very stable, ranging from 23 per cent per annum to 27 per cent per annum. These results suggest that the revitalized investment in research spending under INIA has been very profitable for Uruguay and that a greater rate of investment would have been justified.","[Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Robert Mondavi Inst, Ctr Wine Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Alston, Julian M.; Tumber, Kabir P.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,,julian@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,"USDA Economic Research Service [58-6000-7-0116]; University of California, Davis; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics","USDA Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); University of California, Davis(University of California System); Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics","Bervejillo is a freelance agricultural economist based in Uruguay.

Exploiting the variations these shifts have afforded, we use a sequence of decennial agricultural censuses to examine Brazilian policy implications for agricultural competitiveness and efficiency. Total factor productivity is decomposed into best-technology and efficiency elements, each subject to policy influence. We find technology growth, at 4.5% per annum, to have been extraordinarily high, particularly in the south. But because productivity among average producers has fallen rapidly behind that on the technical frontier, total productivity growth has been a much more modest 2.6% per year. Public agricultural research programs most benefit the country's technological leaders, widening the gap between frontier and average producer. Credit, education, and road construction policies instead narrow that gap.

The empirical analysis is implemented for primary agricultural and processed food products, using a panel dataset covering trade between and within OECD countries. Primary agricultural products are often blended and associated with reference prices. Conversely, processed food products exhibit higher levels of product differentiation. The empirical results confirm expectations by emphasizing the magnifying effects of uncertainty aversion on home bias in the case of processed food products but not in the case of primary agricultural products. These magnifying effects are primarily associated with processed food products destined for final household consumption. Other results reveal significant variations between different countries (based on geo-economic and national income categories). Our results also indicate that home bias and uncertainty aversion effects on home bias have not decreased over time. The empirical results remain robust under different estimation methods.","Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",University of Lethbridge,"Ghazalian, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",pascal.ghazalian@uleth.ca,,"Ghazalian, Pascal/0000-0002-6230-6879",,,,,58,11,11,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

It finds that over a two-year period 13 of LTCI policies lapse. It also finds that the probability of an LTCI lapse increases with a lack of consumer knowledge about their policys benefit provisions, with prior encounters with the long-term care system, with less expensive policies, and with less generous policies. These findings raise the possibility that some policyholders may not understand their coverage limitations, and learn about them only after actually using long-term care services. Greater consumer awareness of LTCI policy features and limitations may help reduce lapse rates and increase the stability of the LTCI market.","[Li, Yong] Competit Hlth Analyt Inc, Louisville, KY USA; [Jensen, Gail A.] Wayne State Univ, Inst Gerontol, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Jensen, Gail A.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Wayne State University; Wayne State University,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Competit Hlth Analyt Inc, Louisville, KY USA.",yli1@humana.com,,,,,,,20,7,9,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

We study the period 19762005. The analysis is based on duality applied to the production theory. The output supplies and conditioned input demands are estimated from a translog multi-output, multi-input restricted profit function, where the total production credit is used as proxy of the total expenditure. Farmer expectations with respect to crop prices are incorporated to the estimation based on the quasi-rational expectation model. The output and input responses to the total expenditure are positive and statistically significant except for cotton, wheat, fertilizer, and pesticides. The short-run output supply response to own prices is inelastic, except for wheat, which presents elastic response to its price. Acreage has a positive impact on the output supply and it is influenced by land productivity. The main conclusion is that farmers face budget restrictions to purchase inputs, and a government credit program might increase the agricultural supply.","[de Castro, Eduardo Rodrigues] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Teixeira, Erly Cardoso] Univ Fed Vicosa, Vicosa, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal de Vicosa,"de Castro, ER (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Campus Sorocaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",eduardo@ufscar.br,,,Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education Faculty (CAPES); Brazilian Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq),Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education Faculty (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Brazilian Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the comments from three anonymous referees which have significantly contributed to improve the article.

However, there is much more economic development work to be done in rural China, as issues such as an aging agricultural workforce, land-use rights, and water shortages persist. At the same time, increased urbanization and the rising middle class are changing the demand for food in China.

Design/methodology/approach - Derived from the Becker's household production and consumption theory, the authors econometrically specified household expenditure function on food away from home. Box-Cox transformed double-hurdle models were estimated. The data were collected in 2007 in Beijing China by the authors, using a diary-based method designed specifically for this study. Findings - Household income, time opportunity cost and other socio-demographic and economic factors were found to be important determinants of household participation and expenditure decisions for dining out. However, the importance of these factors varied by type of food facility and type of meal. Meanwhile, the estimated elasticities with respect to income were correspondingly higher than those for developed countries, suggesting that the demand for food away from home by Chinese households is still in an upward trend. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to analyze Chinese household food consumption away from home by type of food facility and type of meal. Besides, this study uses an exclusive dataset collected from a seven-day diary-based survey. The data include more specific information on food away from home than the Urban Household Income and Expenditure (UHIE) survey data conducted by National Bureau of Statistics of China. The ME data were extensively used in previous studies on food consumption in China, but are believed to significantly underestimate food away from home consumption.","[Bai, Junfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Natl Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Caiping] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Fangbin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wahl, Tom] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Central University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics; North Dakota State University Fargo","Zhang, CP (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Natl Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",cpzhang77@gmail.com,"Zhang, Caiping/AAQ-5944-2020",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [70903062, 71003114]; Agricultural Food Research Initiative of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture/USDA [2010-65400-20489]; Emerging Markets Program Agreement Commodity Credit Corporation/USDA [2010-27]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars/State Education Ministry of China [211]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Agricultural Food Research Initiative of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture/USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Emerging Markets Program Agreement Commodity Credit Corporation/USDA; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars/State Education Ministry of China(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese ScholarsMinistry of Education, China)","The authors thank the editor Xian Xin and two anonymous referees for useful comments.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors analyze the historical spot and futures price time series from China's sugar spot market and China's Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (CZCE) within a co-integration framework. Findings - It is found that China's sugar spot market has the pricing power, even though the futures market leads the spot market in price discovery. The phenomenon of observed separation of price discovery in spot market from pricing power in futures market may be caused by: irrational speculation in CZCE sugar futures market; oligopoly and local government politics; or the operational efficiency of the wholesale spot market, especially for its comparative advantages of information accessibility in the sugar producing areas.

The current methodological appliance of the DOE is represented by the set of scientific methods for identifying the significant and/or critical parameters associated with the process and thereby determining the optimal settings for those process variables which are able to enhance the performance and capability of the response (e.g. the selected character of a product quality). However, recent researches have shown that the application of these techniques in the food-processing industry and agricultural production are limited due to the lack of statistical knowledge required for their effective implementation (especially in small and medium-sized manufacturing companies). Therefore, this paper focuses on the modified DOE methods (for use in a community of scientists and product engineers), which overcome the problem of statistics by taking a unique approach using graphical tools. The same outcomes and conclusions are reached as by those approaches using statistical methods and the potential users will find the concept in this paper both familiar and easy to understand. In this way, it will ensure a broad practical application of the methodology that is described in this paper. From the theoretical point of view, the main objective of the paper is to optimize the barcode printing processes on food packaging through the effective application of the DOE techniques in order to discover the significant process parameters which affect the means of the so-called Z-module (defines the nominal width of the narrow elements), GS1 International (defines certain size ranges), PCS measurement (means Print Contrast Signal measurement) and also in order to discover the key parameters which affect their variabilities.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hron, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",hron@pef.czu.cz,"Hron, Jan/C-6378-2017","Hron, Jan/0000-0001-6618-7136",Czech Science Foundation [P403/12/1950],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Grant No. P403/12/1950).,,11,2,2,2,18,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Results show that USDA reports contain substantial information for market participants. Strongest price reactions to the releases are found immediately after the market opens, and market reactions persist for approximately ten minutes. The electronic corn futures market quickly incorporates this new public information, and little evidence exists to support systematic under-or overreactions in prices.

In impaired watersheds where both point and nonpoint sources contribute to pollution, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is encouraging the use of point-nonpoint trading to reduce the cost of point sources to meet their permit requirement, and to encourage nonpoint sources to voluntarily contribute more towards meeting overall water quality goals. The EPA guidance encourages trading programs to set a nonpoint source eligibility baseline that extracts some extra abatement from nonpoint sources. Research has shown that setting an eligibility baseline that is substantially more stringent than current management could discourage nonpoint source participation and significantly hinder trading. In this paper we examine how choosing the eligibility baseline for agricultural sources affects the efficiency goal of trading (reducing costs to point sources), as well as how it affects the EPA goal of encouraging nonpoint abatement. Using data from the Chesapeake Bay Watershed we find that eligibility baselines set to encourage additional nonpoint source abatement reduce the supply of credits in a market; the more stringent the baseline, the fewer the trades and the smaller the overall abatement from nonpoint sources. A subsidy to farmers for reducing the cost of meeting a baseline encourages greater nonpoint source abatement, but may not benefit the trading market.","[Ribaudo, Marc; Savage, Jeffrey] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Ribaudo, M (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",mribaudo@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,52,15,16,3,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Methods that livestock producers use to mitigate thermal stress-including modifications to animal management or housing-tend to increase production costs. We use operation-level economic data coupled with finely-scaled climate data to estimate how the local thermal environment affects the technical efficiency of dairies across the United States. We then use this information to estimate the possible decline in milk production in 2030 resulting from climate change-induced heat stress under the simplifying assumptions that the production technology, location of production, and other factors are held constant. For four climate model scenarios, the results indicate modest heat-stress-related production declines by 2030, with the largest declines occurring in the southern states.","[Key, Nigel; Sneeringer, Stacy] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Key, N (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",nkey@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,46,88,107,2,73,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

These elasticities were based on seemingly unrelated regressions and three-stage least squares estimates of the translog cost function and input cost share functions. In contrast to previous studies, we dissaggregate machinery inputs into three categories: large, medium, and small. In addition, the issue of endogeneity in output quantity and input prices is also addressed.

We find no evidence that wolf packs with home ranges that overlap ranches have any detrimental effects on calf weights. Other non-wolf factors, notably climate and individual ranch-specific husbandry practices, explained the majority of the variation in the weight of calves. However, ranches that experienced a confirmed cattle depredation by wolves had a negative and statistically significant impact of approximately 22 pounds on the average calf weight across their herd, possibly due to inefficient foraging behavior or stress to mother cows. For ranches experiencing confirmed depredation, the costs of these indirect weight losses are shown to potentially be greater than the costs of direct depredation losses that have, in the past, been the only form of compensation for ranchers who have suffered wolf depredations. These results demonstrate a potentially important and understudied aspect of economic conflict arising from the protection and funding of endangered species recovery programs.","[Ramler, Joseph P.; Kellenberg, Derek] Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Hebblewhite, Mark] Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol Program, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Sime, Carolyn] Univ Montana, Sch Law, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Kellenberg, D (通讯作者)，Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",derek.kellenberg@mso.umt.edu,"Hebblewhite, Mark/AAI-8101-2020; hebblewhite, mark/G-6164-2013","Hebblewhite, Mark/0000-0001-5382-1361;","Blackfoot Challenge, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; NASA [NNX11AO47G]; Montana Stockgrowers Association; NASA [NNX11AO47G, 140138] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","Blackfoot Challenge, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Montana Stockgrowers Association; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","Joseph P.

The focus on returns by sector of employment is motivated by our finding that most agricultural graduates are employed in non-agricultural jobs. In that study, a sample of alumni graduating from a large Midwestern public university between 1982 and 2006 shows that alumni with majors more specialized in agriculture earned a premium from working in the agriculture industry, but this advantage has diminished over time. Agricultural graduates with more general training earn more outside than inside agriculture. Higher-ability graduates in more industry-focused curricula tend to sort into the agricultural industry, while higher-ability graduates in broader curricula tend to choose jobs outside of agriculture. All graduates are more likely to accept agricultural employment when the farm economy is strong, but agricultural graduates who enter agricultural jobs when the farm economy is weak suffer lifetime earnings reductions. These findings suggest that greater levels of specialization may limit a graduate's ability to adjust to changing economic circumstances. Agriculture degree programs could benefit from curriculum innovations that focus on developing more generalized skills.","[Artz, Georgeanne M.; Kimle, Kevin L.; Orazem, Peter F.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Artz, GM (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",gartz@iastate.edu,"Orazem, Peter/D-6525-2016","Orazem, Peter/0000-0003-2092-5089",,,,,30,4,7,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

It manifests itself in many forms and causes a range of effects. The aim of this study was to analyze the economic losses from soil erosion and compaction in relationship to agriculture in Albania. On-site effects of these two degradative processes affect farmers directly through reducing production and increasing the costs of farming. Calculation of economic losses was performed by using the replacement and lost production methods. According to our assessments, the wheat and maize yield losses due to the soil compaction are 112 164 tons or US$ 40.2 million, and the plant nutrient losses due to the water erosion are 69 609 tons or US$ 98 million. Economic losses from the erosion and compaction in the agricultural area in Albania are at least US$ 138.2 million per year or about 5.5% of the agricultural GDP. Based on the assessed economic losses from soil degradation, it can be concluded that the soil conservation in Albania is economically viable.","[Binaj, Agim; Veizi, Pirro; Gjoka, Fran; Kasa, Elian] Agr Univ Tirana, Tirana, Albania; [Beqiraj, Enkeleida] Polytecn Univ Tirana, Tirana, Albania",Polytechnic University of Tirana (UPT),"Gjoka, F (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Tirana, Tirana, Albania.",fgjoka2001@gmail.com,"Gjoka, Fran/AEZ-6443-2022",,,,,,27,3,3,2,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The Slovak wine market is a market in the phase of growth, the wine consumption per capita in 2011 reached 14.7 Lt.; the domestic production covered only 46% of the domestic consumption. The level of the industry concentration is high, the 6 largest companies produce more than 18.5 mill. Lt. of wine -50% of the total domestic production. Wine legislation is comparable to the Czech legislation, the purchasing power of the customers shows a positive development, but the cheap table wine imports still represent more than 50% of the total domestic consumption. The opportunity for Czech exporters is the factor represented by the size and growth of the market and the legislation, too. The situation is rather more positive for the re-export of cheap wine from other countries than the direct export of Czech wine to Slovakia in case of other analyzed factors.","[Kucerova, Renata] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Management, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kucerová, R (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",renata.kucerova@mendelu.cz,"Kucerova, Renata/Q-3377-2016",,,,,,22,6,8,0,7,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The main objective of the paper is to highlight the main changes which occurred. The paper is also identifying the role of agriculture in the Russian economy and society development. On the basis of the results coming from the paper, it is possible to characterize the Russian agriculture as follows. After a significant decline in the early 90s and the long process of transformation, the Russian economy including agricultural sector is starting to recover and it is stabilizing. The slowdown of the Russian agricultural performance was stopped (the millstone is the year 2000). At present, the Russian agrarian sector is under the process of recovery especially because of the massive state support (market protection and subsidies coming into agriculture). Agriculture is an important part of the Russian economy. Russia is characterized by large areas of agricultural land, one third of its population lives in the rural areas. The Russian Federation produces many of agricultural products and foodstuffs. However, the country is not self-sufficient in many products. The highest level of the import dependence is observed for meat, vegetables and fruits. Primary products dominate in the structure of Russian exports. Food and agricultural products amount for about only 2% of the Russian total export. The share of agricultural products in the Russian import is more significant and it amounts to 14%. However, in 2000s, there is a significant growth of the foreign trade turnover due to the expansion of both imports and exports. Currently, Russia is seeking not only to achieve a high level of self-sufficiency in basic agricultural products, but also it is trying to be a significant driver in the area of the international trade in agricultural products and foodstuff","[Svatos, Miroslav; Smutka, Lubos; Ishchukova, Natalia] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Smutka, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",svatos@pef.czu.cz; smutka@pef.czu.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Svatos, Miroslav/H-4459-2018","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Svatos, Miroslav/0000-0002-2831-287X",Government of the Russian Federation [074-U01],Government of the Russian Federation,"The paper was prepared within the project Socio-economic practices of sustainable development in the new industrialization.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper comprises three stages: decomposing China's agricultural export data (1999-2008) into highly disaggregated three distinct parts; with the Kaplan-Meier (KM) nonparametric estimation, discovering the practical source of stable and long-term export growth, and the threshold at which the short-run trade relationships deriving from newly established ones convert into long-run ones successfully; by semi parametric estimation through Cox proportional hazard model, preliminarily examining the possible impact of different factors on the trade relationship's hazard rate and duration. Findings - The paper reveals that China agri-food trade pattern at the product level is surprisingly dynamic with newly established trade relations being more likely to fail. While the frequent volatilities of short-term relations at the extensive margin could be used to evaluate the source of short-term export growth especially and effectively, the pattern of negative dependence together with the threshold effect of duration indicates, only when these short-term relations live longer than four years will they substantially contribute to a stable and prolonged export growth. Simultaneously, trade duration significantly correlates to importing country's development status, region it belongs to, product processing degree, export experience and geographical space between trading partners. Research limitations/implications - To avoid the likelihood of misleading when estimating quantitatively the source of long-term export growth, researchers should be cautious in accurately evaluating the impacts of all possible factors on the two trade margins' performances, which is beyond the scope of this paper though, and a matter of ongoing work on the research agenda. Practical implications - The study presents a set of important policy implications. Now that turnovers along the extensive margin have little impact on long-term China agri-food export growth, it turns out that improving export survival would result in significantly higher and stable export growth. Originality/value - By distinguishing the survival of trade relationship channels from their deepening, the discoveries in the paper are crucial to understand the different role the intensive and extensive margins play in China agri-food export growth. The diversified hazard rates of export relations in different duration intervals suggest that the constant hazard rate assumption in Melitz and Bernard et al. is in some sense not appropriate.","[Tian, Dongwen; Li, Rui; Yao, Wei; Huang, Li] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Beihang University,"Tian, DW (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",dwtian@buaa.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173007]; Special Fund of Fundamental Scientific Research of Beihang University [30-1450],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Fund of Fundamental Scientific Research of Beihang University,This paper is a partial fruit for project Decomposition of the export growth pattern of China - based on an extended heterogeneous firm trade model supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71173007) and has also been supported by Special Fund of Fundamental Scientific Research of Beihang University (No. 30-1450).,,32,5,5,1,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The underlying assumption in conventional DEA is that input and output data are measured with precision. However, production agriculture takes place in an uncertain environment, and, in some situations, input and output data may be imprecise. We present an approach of measuring efficiency when data are known to lie within specified intervals and empirically illustrate this approach using a group of 29 dairy producers in Pennsylvania. Compared to the conventional DEA scores that are point estimates, the computed fuzzy efficiency scores are interval bound allowing the decision maker to trace the performance of a decision-making unit at different possibility levels.","[Mugera, Amin W.] Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Mugera, Amin W.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Mugera, AW (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, Crawley, WA, Australia.",amin.mugera@uwa.edu.au,"Mugera, Amin/E-6749-2012","Mugera, Amin/0000-0002-5199-2201",,,,,41,28,30,3,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In a deterministic dynamic framework, we consider a fish stock with two age groups, juveniles and adults, exploited by two countries having a different impact on the age groups. A regulatory agency defines an annual total allowable catch and its allocation between the two countries. We consider allocations satisfying a set of constraints representing viability conditions. The constraints include a minimal quota and minimal profit for each country. We compare intertemporal viable trajectories with the trajectory resulting from a cooperative game in which the two countries agree on the maximization of the fishery's total profit. While the cooperative solution consists in allocating the whole fishing effort to the most efficient country, the viable solution ensures a limitation of inequalities but reduces the overall economic outcome. The results are illustrated for the Bay of Biscay anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus L.), exploited by Spain and France, with two different types of gear, the purse seine for Spain and the pelagic trawl for France. Le present article se penche sur la viabilite de la gestion d'une peche transfrontaliere. Dans un cadre dynamique et deterministe, nous examinons un stock de poissons compose d'individus de deux classes d'age, soit des juveniles et des adultes, et exploite par deux pays qui ont des repercussions differentes sur ces classes d'age. Un organisme de reglementation determine les captures annuelles totales autorisees et leur allocation entre les deux pays. Nous examinons les allocations qui satisfont un ensemble de contraintes representant des conditions de viabilite. Ces contraintes comprennent un quota et un profit minimums pour chaque pays. Nous comparons les trajectoires intertemporelles viables avec les trajectoires issues d'un jeu cooperatif dans lequel les deux pays sont d'accord sur la maximisation du profit total de la peche. Tandis que la solution du jeu cooperatif consiste a allouer tous les efforts de peche au pays le plus efficace, la solution viable restreint les inegalites, mais reduit les resultats economiques totaux. Les resultats illustrent la peche a l'anchois (Engraulis encrasicolus L.) dans le golfe de Gascogne, laquelle est exploitee par l'Espagne et la France qui utilisent deux types d'engins de peche : la senne coulissante dans le cas de l'Espagne et le chalut pelagique dans le cas de la France.","[Curtin, Richard] AZTI Tecnalia, Div Marine Res, E-48395 Txatxarramendi Ugartea, Sukarrieta, Spain; [Martinet, Vincent] INRA, UMR Econ Publ 210, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",AZTI; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE,"Curtin, R (通讯作者)，AZTI Tecnalia, Div Marine Res, E-48395 Txatxarramendi Ugartea, Sukarrieta, Spain.",rcurtin@azti.es; vincent.martinet@grignon.inra.fr,"Martinet, Vincent/X-4953-2019; Curtin, Richard W/B-8337-2009","Curtin, Richard/0000-0003-4095-9606; Martinet, Vincent/0000-0002-7135-8849",,,,,58,2,2,1,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The process of dividing the state, building a new business structure and the EU accession influenced the current form of Czech and Slovak agricultural trade and also particularly the competitiveness of Czech and Slovak agricultural and foodstuff products in relation to the EU market and also in relation to the world market. The process of transformation of agricultural production and trade in both countries has also affected their relationships. For this reason, the primary objective of this paper is to highlight the changes that have occurred in relation to the Czech and Slovak agricultural trade performance development - and in particular the changes in the mutual export and import operations are analysed. During the period 1994-2010, agricultural exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia became considerably more dynamic than those in the opposite direction. Czech agricultural and foodstuff products have gradually established themselves and have gained comparative advantages over Slovak agrarian production. As a result of this development, a gradual increase of the negative balance of Slovak agricultural trade has occurred in relation to the Czech Republic. Since the Slovak agrarian sector has in recent years significantly decreased its own production capacity, in the future a continuation of the current trend can be expected.","[Bielik, Peter; Hupkova, Daniela] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Smutka, Lubos; Svatos, Miroslav] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Bielik, P (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",peter.bielik@uniag.sk; smutka@pef.czu.cz; svatos@pef.czu.cz; daniela.hupkova@uniag.sk,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Bielik, Peter/AAL-5561-2020; Svatos, Miroslav/H-4459-2018; Hupkova, Daniela/E-5605-2019","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Svatos, Miroslav/0000-0002-2831-287X; Hupkova, Daniela/0000-0002-3038-3669",,,,,29,18,18,1,24,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The model is applied to study the case of 201 farmers' cooperatives in Taiwan. Findings - The empirical results suggest that there exist significant discrepancy in terms of the performance among the four departments of the farmers' cooperatives. Furthermore, the wide discrepancy in the returns to scale warrant further deregulations by easing restrictions on their consolidation with other cooperatives to operate over broader geographical areas. Originality/value - An empirical study on Taiwan's farmers' cooperatives is used to demonstrate its applicability and how they can effectively allocate their fixed resources in a multi-activity environment.

Design/methodology/approach - Using primary data collected by the authors on three types of infrastructure projects in villages across China, they created measures of project quality for each village. They then used both descriptive and multivariate approaches to examine how quality varies from village to village and factors correlated with quality. Findings - Between-project within-village quality differences are small and project design has little explanatory power. Between-village variations are large. There are strong correlations between the ways villages govern themselves and project quality. The authors conclude that it is difficult to make good projects work in communities that lack good governance. Originality/value - Disaggregated data on the quality of infrastructure (and its determinants) were collected by the authors to allow for variation in the type of infrastructure projects (roads, irrigation, and drinking water) and variation in village governance, making it possible to identify and contrast the effects of project design and village governance factors on project quality. As its chief contribution, this work identifies potential ways to improve the quality of infrastructure projects in rural development.","[Liu, Chengfang; Zhang, Linxiu; Huang, Jikun; Luo, Renfu; Yi, Hongmei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yaojiang] Northwest Univ, Coll Econ Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Food Secur & Environm Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Northwest University Xi'an; Stanford University","Liu, CF (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",cfliu.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022","Yi, Hongmei/0000-0002-6934-0498","National Natural Science Foundation of China [70903064, 71033003]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZZD-EW-06]; Institute for Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research-CAS [2011RC102]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Institute for Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research-CAS,"The authors acknowledge the financial support for follow-up research provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (70903064, 71033003), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KZZD-EW-06), as well as the Institute for Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research-CAS (2011RC102).

A panel data set, which contains 46 cross-sections and 1840 observations, is used for exports of the selected agricultural commodities to countries from 1971 to 2010. Our empirical results based on a gravity equation show that while the exchange rate volatility does not exert a significant effect on the Turkish agricultural commodity exports, the real exchange rate has a statistically significant effect on the agricultural commodity export flows. Regardless of the region chosen, raisins and tobacco exports are very much sensitive to the real exchange rates. It means that any depreciation in the Turkish Lira leads to higher exports for these commodities. We have also some interesting results on other commodities. Exports of dried figs show no sensitivity to the exchange rate or its volatilities, except for the EU countries. For the full sample, exports of citrus, grape and hazelnuts increases as the TL depreciates. The sensitivity of hazelnut to the real exchange rates varies among regions.","[Yanikkaya, Halit] Gebze Inst Technol, TR-41400 Gebze, Turkey; [Kaya, Huseyin] Bahcesehir Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kocturk, Osman Murat] Celal Bayar Univ, Manisa, Turkey",Gebze Technical University; Bahcesehir University; Celal Bayar University,"Yanikkaya, H (通讯作者)，Gebze Inst Technol, PK 141, TR-41400 Gebze, Turkey.",halityanikkaya@gyte.edu.tr,"Kocturk, Osman Murat/HSG-2165-2023; YANIKKAYA, Halit/J-3678-2019","YANIKKAYA, Halit/0000-0003-1542-0174",,,,,39,4,4,0,16,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

According to our results, the SAPS has a positive and statistically significant impact on land rents in the EU. However, the estimated incidence is smaller than predicted theoretically. Land rents capture only 19 cents of the marginal SAPS EUR, and around 10% of the SAPS benefit nonfarming landowners through higher farmland rental prices. As the share of rented land is higher in corporate farms than individual ones, family farms benefit more from the SAPS than corporate farms do.","[Ciaian, Pavel; Kancs, d'Artis] European Commiss DG JRC, Seville 41092, Spain; [Ciaian, Pavel; Kancs, d'Artis] Catholic Univ Leuven LICOS, Seville 41092, Spain; [Ciaian, Pavel; Kancs, d'Artis] Econ & Econometr Res Inst EERI, Seville 41092, Spain; [Ciaian, Pavel] Slovak Univ Agr, Seville 41092, Spain; [Ciaian, Pavel; Kancs, d'Artis] IPTS, Seville 41092, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Ciaian, P (通讯作者)，European Commiss DG JRC, Edificio Expo,C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",pavel.ciaian@ec.europa.eu; d'artis.kancs@ec.europa.eu,"Kancs, d'Artis/K-3374-2014; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850; Kancs, d'Artis/0000-0002-8514-725X",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors thank two anonymous referees, Glenn Fox, and participants at conference in Berlin (EAAE) for very useful comments on the article.

The hypothesis that climbing to the upper rungs of the electricity ladder (nuclear power and modern renewables) has been the primary mechanism via which countries have achieved substantial reductions in per capita CO2 emissions is tested using a binomial dependent variable modelling approach for a sample of 105 countries. The findings suggest that electricity mix transitions caused by long-run growth in per capita incomes are indeed the primary determinant of carbon Kuznets curve downturns. The paper explores additional mechanisms via which carbon Kuznets curves may have been generated, but the results indicate that these are of lesser overall importance than the electricity mix effect. The evidence also suggests that countries with larger fossil fuel endowments are less likely to experience carbon Kuznets curve downturns, an additional curse of natural resources.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Burke, PJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",paul.j.burke@anu.edu.au,"Burke, Paul/G-3757-2010","Burke, Paul/0000-0003-2715-2672",,,,,27,16,18,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Modern Arabic belongs to the most difficult world languages and its study is very time consuming. When learning Arabic with classical methods, students first have to master at least some of the letters of the Arabic alphabet to start learning basic words and phrases and they start to speak only after a longer time, which can discourage them. Considering the low number of lessons and the need to obtain results in quite a short time, the teachers of the Language Training Centre of the University of Defence designed a new teaching model which presents some basic words and phrases from the very beginning of the course, using only a minimum of grammar. Considering the fact that after the first year the new method proved to be successful, the Language Institute of Mendel University established co-operation with the Language Training Centre of the University of Defence.

The subsidy SAPS and TOP-UP per 1 hectare of sugar beet have a positive impact on its economics though not sufficient enough. In practice, it means that it is highly probable that the break-even point will not be achieved and thereby it is highly probable that the fixed costs are not covered and the update of machines is significantly limited. This happens mainly in the marginal regions.

Assuming the concept holds, a decrease in income variability (BR) prompts the firm to incur greater debt levels thereby increasing FR. Reducing (BR), which continues to be the central objective of Canadian agricultural policy through programs such as Canadian Agricultural Income Stabilization Program (CAIS)/AgriStability, may lead farmers to take on more FR than they would take otherwise, which, in turn, increases the risk of equity loss. However, it is not known whether Canadian business risk management (BRM) programs offset BR as intended, and whether any potential reduction leads to increased FR (risk balancing) and possibly higher levels of overall risk for individual farm operations. This paper represents the first attempt to shed light on whether Canadian BRM programs fail to reduce farm risk as a result of farmers' risk balancing behavior using a longitudinal farm-level data set from Ontario. Results are mixed: (1) BRM payments reduce BR for beef farms but not for field crops farms (though the latter result may be due to the lack of data on Crop Insurance payments); (2) risk balancing holds particularly for the larger farms, and (3) BRM programs overall have no significant effect on the likelihood of increased debt use for either sector, on average; however, participation in CAIS/AgriStability increases the probability that farms take on more debt than they would take otherwise for both sectors. Further analysis is needed to determine whether BRM programs increase the probability of default for farms.","[Uzea, Nicoleta; Sparling, David] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada; [Poon, Kenneth; Weersink, Alfons] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Guelph,"Uzea, N (通讯作者)，Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, 1255 Western Rd, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada.",nuzea@ivey.ca; poonk@uoguelph.ca; dsparling@ivey.ca; aweersin@uoguelph.ca,"Weersink, Alfons/O-1521-2019","Weersink, Alfons/0000-0001-5081-3593",,,,,39,20,25,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Using a trader panel dataset spanning 2005-2007, we find empirical support for the model in that the duration of mobile phone coverage is associated with increased search activity. This effect evolves dynamically over time and is stronger for larger traders, who engage in arbitrage over longer distances.

We begin with stylized facts and a brief reference to the uniquely decentralized financing and delivery of public education in the United States, and the resulting issues of equity and quality that arise. As a reference point we review the basic efficiency and equity arguments for public financing and the provision of public goods in general, and education specifically, both of which suggest that current practices are unlikely to be efficient or equitable. These are issues that have motivated a number of policy avenues-the accountability movement, including No Child Left Behind, as well as recent efforts to establish higher and uniform standards for our public schools. We then turn to the sizable body of literature assessing school performance. We include an empirical example of this approach for Texas primary and secondary schools, with a focus on the many challenging issues involved with modeling and assessing educational performance. Our application demonstrates that research findings are highly sensitive to modeling choices, suggesting that a mixed methods approach is most likely to lead to effective education reforms.","[Grosskopf, Shawna] Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Hayes, Kathy J.] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Taylor, Lori L.] Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Oregon State University; Southern Methodist University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Bush School of Government & Public Service,"Grosskopf, S (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",shawna.grosskopf@orst.edu,"Taylor, Lori/AAH-2766-2019",,,,,,101,27,39,4,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

The two most common approaches to specifying this cost treat it as a fixed fraction of the recreationist's wage, and either estimate the fraction (done infrequently) or assume it takes some value (done commonly), with references to results from the commute time literature used to justify the latter. However, these approaches lack firm conceptual rationales, and the consequences of using them are not fully understood. Recognizing that information limitations often preclude more general approaches, we use a joint recreation travel-labor supply model to show that under relatively modest assumptions the opportunity cost of travel time can be expressed as a wage fraction with noise. This formulation is straightforward to implement as part of random parameters-based recreation demand models. We then evaluate the welfare consequences of using the two approaches noted above, which are special cases of the noisy wage fraction specification. Our results suggest that the more critical restriction to relax in opportunity cost of travel time specifications is the absence of noise, rather than the specific level of the wage fraction.","[Larson, Douglas M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lew, Daniel K.] NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Larson, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",dmlarson@ucdavis.edu,"Lew, Daniel K./AAL-3013-2021","Lew, Daniel/0000-0002-3394-138X",,,,,47,14,16,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Design/ methodology/ approach - This paper extends the existing studies on credit rationing in rural China by comparing the determinants of credit rationing by three different lenders, the formal lenders rural credit cooperatives ( RCCs), the informal lenders and the new microfinance institutions ( MFIs). Findings - MFIs are capable of reaching out to the even poorer households if they develop the loan products based on the income and expenditure flows of these households. Research limitations/ implications - The determinants of credit rationing by three types of institutions are estimated separately. Practical implications - RCCs in China shall change their policy of discrimination against female- headed households. RCCs shall also simplify the loan application procedures and assess the clients based on their repayment capacities rather than the age or assets alone. RCCs could learn from MFIs to use incomes from migrant workers as a criterion to assess the loan applicants. Social implications - gender equity for loan access.

This paper outlines how methodological limitations presently restrict its capacity to provide meaningful insight into the relative value of alternative land-use configurations. The model is calibrated using positive mathematical programming, which has been shown in the literature to result in models that yield arbitrary output outside of the calibrated baseline. There is a high likelihood that this is the case, as no validation appears to have been carried out. Significant model development will be required before NZFARM outputs can be used with any confidence to inform future policy development. We conclude with suggestions on how NZFARM and models of its kind can be further developed to improve their capacity for meaningful simulation.","[Doole, Graeme J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.; Marsh, Dan K.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Western Australia; University of Waikato,"Doole, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia.",gdoole@waikato.ac.nz,"Marsh, Dan/X-2009-2019","Marsh, Dan/0000-0001-6225-8531; Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491",,,,,37,10,10,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

However, the logo represents only a moral pledge by the manufacturer. No method exists for inspecting whether products are fresh milk or reconstituted milk, and the label does not represent a commitment to the same level of quality and consumer health protection as found in organic foods. The purpose of this paper is to analyze consumer perceptions of organic certified agricultural standards (CAS) and estimates consumer willingness to pay (WTP) a premium should the Fresh Milk Logo be transformed into an organic CAS certified label. Design/ methodology/ approach - Exploratory factor analysis is adopted to extract the main determinants of respondent perceptions and preferences. Additionally, the double-bounded dichotomous choice of the contingent valuation method (CVM) and survival function is used to measure consumer WTP a premium for organic fresh milk. Findings - Consumer consumption preferences for buying fresh milk extracted four main factorial dimensions: Fresh Milk Logo, price/ promotion, organic, and product/ brand. Respondents are willing to pay US$ 21.95 extra per year to buy organic CAS milk and the factors affecting WTP are Fresh Milk Logo and organic. Research limitations/ implications - The problems of the CVM include hypothetical and starting point for price bidding. The double- bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation model and pre- testing can reduce the biases. The survival function is more flexible, yields more information and permits assumptions regarding parametric distributions without additional costs. The collaboration of survival function with the double- bounded method produces a reliable result that incorporates fewer statistical errors. Practical implications - Consumers are willing to pay a premium for fresh milk with an organic CAS label that certifies its good quality and safety. Social implications - Marketing managers can use the study findings to develop effective marketing strategies and refine advertising campaigns to promote organic fresh milk to attract more consumers. Originality/ value - Organic food labels certify food safety, and are associated with the trend toward increasing awareness of environmental and health issues. Perception of organic food labels are introduced into double-bounded dichotomous choice CVM to estimate consumers' WTP, an approach which has successfully dominated traditional methods, using Likert scale-type measurement.","[Huang, Chin-Huang] Natl Taiwan Univ Phys Educ & Sport, Dept Sport Management, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Lee, Chun-Hung] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan",National Dong Hwa University,"Huang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ Phys Educ & Sport, Dept Sport Management, Chiayi, Taiwan.",hch55@ntupes.edu.tw,,"Lee, Chun-Hung/0000-0002-9978-3599; Lee, ChunHung/0000-0002-7346-985X",,,,,45,25,29,7,89,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Extended versions of a gravity model are adopted and the balanced panel data for the unilateral trade over the period of 2003 to 2008 are constructed using the Harmonized System Codes. The Heckman two-stage analysis is incorporated to detect the potential selection bias arising from many zero trades. We find that only preferential tariffs on the LDCs have significantly contributed to the trade flows. However, in contrast, gross domestic products (GDPs), free trade agreements (FTAs), the applied tariff rates, and the exchange rates turn out to be statistically significant in the trade with the OECD countries, thus highlighting the possibility of the potential trade benefits associated with the trade policy reforms. The study is unique in that it empirically estimates the determinants of agricultural trade between the LDCs and developed countries and reveals the potential effectiveness of the preferential treatment and the implementation of the trade policy reforms.","[Lee, So Yeon; Lim, Song Soo] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Lim, SS (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",songsoo@korea.ac.kr,"Lim, Song Soo/Q-1560-2015; Lim, Song Soo/AAQ-7712-2020","Lim, Song Soo/0000-0002-2894-1879",,,,,41,2,4,1,7,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Given the costs of compliance incurred by meat processors and no evidence of increased demand, our results suggest that producers and consumers have experienced a welfare loss.","[Taylor, Mykel R.; Tonsor, Glynn T.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Taylor, MR (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,,,U.S. Department of Agriculture [2009-04126],U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The views expressed here are those of the authors and may not be attributed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which the authors acknowledge for providing partial funding support for this research (2009-04126).",,44,20,25,0,15,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

The output expansion of the agricultural and fishery sectors on the other hand has limited positive impacts and the challenge lies in raising the productivity growth in these sectors and the better use of foreign aid. Lastly, the optimal policy strategy for sustainable development in the agricultural, fishery and resource sectors lies in the packaging of appropriate complementary policies (both institutional and economic) that support one another and the coherent implementation of these policies in a timely manner.","[Mahadevan, Renuka; Asafu-Adjaye, John] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Mahadevan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",r.mahadevan@uq.edu.au,"Mahadevan, Renuka/AAA-1046-2019","Mahadevan, Renuka/0000-0003-4105-2993",,,,,34,2,2,0,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Les << terres ostreicoles >> ont comme particularite d'etre des concessions du Domaine Public Maritime et sont a ce titre soumises a son regime protecteur. Neanmoins, loin d'entraver l'activite ostreicole par les contraintes qu'elle impose, la reglementation se revele etre une garante du maintien d'un niveau satisfaisant de productivite naturelle des concessions pour permettre une reproduction et une croissance des huitres dans des conditions favorables. Ainsi, les resultats de la modelisation montrent que plus de la moitie du prix d'echange des concessions est determine par les conditions reglementaires regissant leur utilisation. Ils soulignent egalement que les conditions du milieu ne sont pas identiques sur l'ensemble du Bassin d'Arcachon justifiant une reglementation adaptee aux differences de productivite naturelle. To demonstrate the importance of regulation and the natural productivity in the economic valuation of oyster production areas, we estimated a hedonic price function of oyster leases in Arcachon Bay. The oyster land have the particularity to be concessions of Maritime Public Domain and are therefore subject to its protective system. Nevertheless, far from hindering the oyster farming by the constraints it imposes, the regulation appears to be a guarantor of maintaining a level of natural productivity concessions allowing a satisfactory reproduction and growth of oysters in favorable conditions. Thus, the modeling results show that more than half the price of trade concessions is determined by the regulatory requirements governing their use. They also show that environmental conditions are not identical across the Bay of Arcachon, while justifying the regulation has to be adaptive to the natural productivity differences.","[Lesur-Irichabeau, Gabrielle] IFREMER, Ctr Brest, Dept Econ Maritime, UMR AMURE, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Lesur-Irichabeau, Gabrielle] Univ Bordeaux IV, GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, F-33608 Pessac, France",Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Ifremer; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Lesur-Irichabeau, G (通讯作者)，IFREMER, Ctr Brest, Dept Econ Maritime, UMR AMURE, BP70, F-29280 Plouzane, France.",Gabrielle.Lesur.Irichabeau@ifremer.fr,,,,,,,49,1,1,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

One widely embraced approach is contract farming. But relatively little is known about the appropriate design of financial incentives in a small farm context. We use the example of the Vietnamese dairy sector to analyze the effectiveness of existing contracts between a processor and smallholder farmers in terms of incentivizing the production of high quality milk. A framed field experiment is conducted to evaluate the impact of two incentive instruments, a price penalty for low quality and a bonus for consistent high quality milk, on farmers' investment in quality-improving inputs. Statistical analysis suggests that the penalty drives farmers into higher input use, resulting in better output quality. The bonus payment generates even higher quality milk. We also find that input choice levels depend on farmers' socio-economic characteristics such as wealth, while individual risk preferences seem to be less important. Implications for the design of contracts with smallholders are discussed.","[Saenger, Christoph] European Bank Reconstruct & Dev, Off Chief Economist, London EC2A 2JN, England; [Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Torero, Maximo; Viceisza, Angelino] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",European Bank of Reconstructon & Development; University of Gottingen; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Saenger, C (通讯作者)，European Bank Reconstruct & Dev, Off Chief Economist, 1 Exchange Sq, London EC2A 2JN, England.",saengerc@ebrd.com,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; Torero, Maximo/0000-0002-4863-3371",German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),"This research was financially supported by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

This increasing importance and the discussion about the establishment of a grain-OPEC consisting of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russia has raised the issue of pricing behaviour of Russian wheat exporters.

This study provides a quantitative analysis of the pricing behaviour of Russian wheat exporters, explicitly taking account of the export tax imposed between 2007 and 2008. We employ a pricing-to-market (PTM) model on quarterly Russian wheat-export data, covering the period from 2002 to 2010 and 25 export destinations.

Based on the collected survey data, econometric model on the determinants of domestic solid waste discharge was constructed and used for analysis. Findings - Results from the study show that the per capita daily discharge of rural domestic solid waste was close to 1 kg in 2010, slightly less than the urban level of 1.2 kg. Results from descriptive statistical analysis and econometric estimation indicate that by implementing selected policy measures, the discharge of solid waste can be significantly reduced. In addition, the discharge of domestic solid waste is also closely related with local socio-economic development. In particular, the results show an obvious inverted U-shaped curve between discharge volume and income.

The objective of this article is to explore the possible approaches to the process of market segmentation at these consumer markets. The data of the Market & Media & Lifestyle were used. Variables of food consumer behaviour and lifestyle were especially selected. Three lines of market segmentation were inferred from the basic conceptual approaches: a priori segmentation, post hoc segmentation and forward segmentation. The data were analysed in several steps using multidimensional analyses. The results indicate a different marketing potential of the investigated approaches. A priori segmentation seems to be more proper for the purpose of the sales management. A broadly based post hoc segmentation should be useful when the concept of marketing communication is to be created. The elaborated forward segmentation approach will take place when the marketing strategy is evaluated.","[Koudelka, Jan] Univ Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Koudelka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Management VSEM, Narozni 2600-9A, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",jan.koudelka@vsem.cz,,,,,,,31,1,1,1,23,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

China's food imports of vegetable oils have grown dramatically over the last decade, linking China's economic growth to the recent increases in global food prices. If China is a source of global food price inflation, exporting countries will benefit whether they sell directly to China or not. These direct and indirect linkages are explored using a short-run, partial-equilibrium model of international trade in agricultural products in which consumer prices and trade costs are derived from bilateral trade flows. China's effects on food prices and exports are estimated by reducing Chinese food expenditures in 2007 by half, roughly China's level of expenditures in 1995. Results indicate that food prices as measured by CES price indexes in developing Asia, Africa, and Latin America would have been reduced by 1.27%, 0.32%, and 0.22%, respectively. China has been an important source of growth for exporters selling directly to China. There is no evidence of export growth due to an overall increase in food prices caused by China's growth.","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Villoria, N (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",nvillori@purdue.edu,,"Villoria, Nelson/0000-0003-1929-0725",,,,,24,5,5,1,110,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

But there are still unanswered questions about whether emerging and evolving seed policy reforms and IPR regimes in developing countries will contribute to increasing crop productivity and improving food security. This paper attempts to answer some of these questions by focusing specifically on the case of India, the regional leader in implementing seed policy reforms and IPRs in agriculture. Findings indicate that maize and pearl millet yields grew significantly during the last two decades due partly to the combination of (1) public policies that encouraged private investment in Indias seed industry during the 1980s, and (2) biological IPRs conferred by hybridisation that conveniently married the private sectors need for appropriability with the nations need for productivity growth. Although past lessons are not an indication of future success, this convergence of policy solutions and technology opportunities can be replicated for other crops that are vital to Indias food security.","[Spielman, David J.; Cavalieri, Anthony] IFPRI, Washington, DC USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Kolady, DE (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Int Programs, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",dek28@cornell.edu,,"Kolady, Deepthi/0000-0002-2345-1950; Spielman, David/0000-0002-6889-7358",United States Agency for International Development; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"This paper was prepared as a part of the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia (CSISA) project, and was supported with generous funding from the United States Agency for International Development and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Attention is given to how the shifting means for various commodity prices have changed with a special emphasis on behavior since the mid 2000s. To identify structural changes in commodity prices, we estimate shifting-mean autoregressions by using: the Bai and Perron (1998) procedure for determining structural breaks; low frequency Fourier functions; and a procedure that specifies shifts to be smooth logistic functions of time. We find that the pattern in the timing of shifts is suggestive of the causal factors underlying the recent boom.","[Enders, Walter; Holt, Matthew T.] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Enders, W (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",,,,USDA-ERS [58-3000-0-0061],USDA-ERS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"Walter Enders is Bidgood Chair of Economics and Finance and Matthew T.

Day (1965) conjectured that crop yield skewness declines with an increase in nitrogen use at low levels but not at higher levels. Employing four corn yield experimental plot datasets, we investigate the conjecture by introducing (a) a flexible Bayesian extension of the Just-Pope technology to incorporate skewness and (b) a quantile-based measure of skewness shift. Bayesian estimation provides strong evidence in favor of negative skewness at commercial nitrogen rates and for Day's conjecture. There was weaker evidence in favor of positively skewed cotton yield and little evidence in favor of the conjecture. The results are confirmed by the quantile-based measure. We also find evidence that skewness becomes more negative upon moving from corn-after-corn to corn-after-soybean.","[Du, Xiaodong] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Yu, Cindy L.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Du, XD (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",xdu23@wisc.edu,,,,,,,37,19,24,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors employ a regime-switching model with parametric, semi-parametric, and nonparametric measures to discern different market conditions in the sample period, as well as detect the structural shifts over time. Three types of data - expected prices, transaction costs, and trade flow - are used for the analysis. Findings - Results of the analysis indicite better integration overtime, but deteriorating efficiency. The markets often departed from efficient arbitrage throughout the study periods, and counter-intuitively worsened after China's elimination of quota in 1999, and accession to WTO in 2001. One other interesting finding is that the state monopoly practice in soybean trading during the early periods produced seemingly competitive equilibrium price relationships. Originality/value - The paper is an original work that provides policy implications regarding the impacts and effectiveness of government policies on China's international soybean markets, the remaining bottlenecks, and the challenge to both Chinese soybean farmers and the US exporters. The method of identifying trade variation in a price model and the combination of parametric and semi-parametric analyses with comprehensive data further permits more accurate and intuitive interpretations previously unavailable.","[Han, Shengfei; He, Pei] S China Univ Technol, Dept Int Business & Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,"Han, SF (通讯作者)，S China Univ Technol, Dept Int Business & Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",hansf@scut.edu.cn,,,Chinese Ministry of Education Human and Social Sciences Foundation [09YJA790073],Chinese Ministry of Education Human and Social Sciences Foundation,Funded by the Chinese Ministry of Education Human and Social Sciences Foundation (09YJA790073).,,42,2,3,0,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

A choice experiment infant milk formula (IMF) with four attributes, including organic certification label, brand, country of origin, and price was conducted in Shandong province of China. Estimation with a mixed logit model revealed that consumers' WTP for IMF with an American or European organic certification label was higher than IMF with a Chinese label. Moreover, consumers' knowledge of organic food and food safety risk perceptions had an impact on their WTP. Results suggest scope for policy failure in that allowing independent certification in China by European and American organic certification bodies, or legal sale in the Chinese mainland market of IMF certified by American or European organic certification bodies, could increase consumer surplus beyond the status quo under the present policy regime.","[Wu, Linhai] Jiangnan Univ, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yin, Shijiu; Xu, Yingjun] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Rizhao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Suzhou Univ, Sch DongWu Business, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Qufu Normal University; Soochow University - China,"Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wlh6799@126.com; yinshijiu@163.com; xuyingjun5007@163.com; zdhj7376@man.com,,,"Study of Consumers' Trust Decision Model Based on Multi-information Sources: Exampled by Organic Food, a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203122]; Study of Co-governance for Food Safety Risk in China, one of the Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDA069]; Research on Chinese Food Safety Risk Management; Central University Basic Research Funds [JUSRP51325A, JUSRP51416B]; Study of Consumers' Dynamic Decision Model Based on Multi-information Sources in the Development of Safe Food Certification System, a project of the Research Award Fund for Outstanding Young Scientists in Shandong province of China [BS2011SF007]; Study of Food Safety Consumer Policy: the Case of Traceable Pork, a project of the Six Top Talents in Jiangsu Province [2012-JY-002]; Research on Chinese Food Safety Risk Control, a project of college Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province [2013-011]","Study of Consumers' Trust Decision Model Based on Multi-information Sources: Exampled by Organic Food, a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Study of Co-governance for Food Safety Risk in China, one of the Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China; Research on Chinese Food Safety Risk Management; Central University Basic Research Funds; Study of Consumers' Dynamic Decision Model Based on Multi-information Sources in the Development of Safe Food Certification System, a project of the Research Award Fund for Outstanding Young Scientists in Shandong province of China; Study of Food Safety Consumer Policy: the Case of Traceable Pork, a project of the Six Top Talents in Jiangsu Province; Research on Chinese Food Safety Risk Control, a project of college Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province","This paper was supported by the Study of Consumers' Trust Decision Model Based on Multi-information Sources: Exampled by Organic Food, a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Approval No. 71203122); the Study of Co-governance for Food Safety Risk in China, one of the Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China in 2014 (Project Approval No. 14ZDA069); the Research on Chinese Food Safety Risk Management, Supported by Central University Basic Research Funds (Project Approval No. JUSRP51325A; JUSRP51416B); the Study of Consumers' Dynamic Decision Model Based on Multi-information Sources in the Development of Safe Food Certification System, a project of the Research Award Fund for Outstanding Young Scientists in Shandong province of China (Project Approval No. BS2011SF007); the Study of Food Safety Consumer Policy: the Case of Traceable Pork, a project of the Six Top Talents in Jiangsu Province (Project Approval No. 2012-JY-002); and Research on Chinese Food Safety Risk Control, a project of college Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province (Project Approval No. 2013-011).",,59,65,69,6,119,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Recently, the application of iterative combinatorial auction designs has been proposed to improve outcomes of conservation auctions. In combinatorial auctions, landholders are allowed to offer projects each of which involves activities aimed at providing one or multiple services. An iterative format allows bidders the opportunity to gradually explore the type of projects they want to offer, with this process being facilitated through price feedback provided based on intermediate auction round results. Auction designs vary with the type of feedback and respond differently to market conditions. At present there is a lack of information about their performance in markets with varying degrees of competition (in terms of number of bidders and level of target). Therefore, using an agent-based simulation model, we evaluate a number of iterative auction designs. We observe that a higher degree of competition leads to a higher auction efficiency. In a high competition environment, efficiency outcomes tend to be less sensitive to auction design choices. Therefore, an auctioneer could enjoy freedom in design choice if adequate competition could be ensured. In weak competition environments, however, some auction designs perform better than others.","[Iftekhar, M.

Most previous work has found the effects of a SSB tax to be small to moderate. We address three limitations. First, we incorporate the supply side via a stochastic equilibrium displacement model. Second, we account. for uncertainty in the underlying elasticities using probability distributions associated with elasticities. Third, we address industry revenue effects. We find that assumptions about the supply side are more important than assumptions about substitution. Ignoring supply side severely overestimates quantity and calorie effects and slightly underestimates revenue effects.","[Dharmasena, Senarath] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Dharmasena, Senarath] Texas A&M Univ, Agribusiness Food & Consumer Econ Res Ctr, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Davis, George C.] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Davis, George C.] Virginia Tech, Dept Human Nutr, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Capps, Oral, Jr.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Agribusiness Food & Consumer Econ Res Ctr, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Dharmasena, S (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,Texas A&M AgriLife Research,Texas A&M AgriLife Research,"We wish to acknowledge partial funding provided by Texas A&M AgriLife Research for this project.

In this study, we report on first revealed preference valuation of CSA attributes using data on share prices and CSA characteristics for the summer 2012 growing season. Using data covering 453 CSA farms in Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, we develop a hedonic model based on firm-level prices to reveal consumer valuations of CSA attributes, including various types of organic certification. We also test for competition in the CSA market using a model of firm entry to evaluate whether firms appear perfectly competitive, which is a requirement when using firm-level prices in our hedonic analysis. Our results reveal a price premium of approximately 7% for USDA organic certification, although this value is heterogeneous across states. We find no premium associated with competing certified naturally grown programs. Finally, we find that CSA farms exhibit little market power and appear to act competitively even with few market entrants.","[Connolly, Cristina; Klaiber, H.

Recently, in response to concerns that the overuse of antibiotics in livestock could promote the development of antimicrobial drug-resistant bacteria, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration adopted a strategy to phase out the use of antibiotics for production purposes. This study uses a stochastic frontier model and data from the 2009 USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey of feeder-to-finish hog producers to estimate the potential effects on hog output and output variability resulting from a ban on antibiotics used for growth promotion. We use propensity score nearest neighbor matching to create a balanced sample of sub-therapeutic antibiotic (STA) users and nonusers. We estimate the frontier model for the pooled sample and separately for users and non-users-which allows for a flexible interaction between STA use and the production technology. Point estimates for the matched sample indicate that STA use has a small positive effect on productivity and production risk, increasing output by 1.0-1.3% and reducing the standard deviation of unexplained output by 1.4%. The results indicate that improvements in productivity resulted exclusively from technological improvement rather than from an increase in technical efficiency.","[Key, Nigel; McBride, William D.] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Key, N (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",nkey@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,38,22,30,1,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Amongst the tools available for underlining reputation, geographic location is considered to offer high potential. Today, some wines benefit from a country's reputation, some from the renown of a region and some from the local reputation of one specific vineyard, whilst conversely some providers suffer from a weak geographic reputation. There can be a split between producers within one vineyard or region based on varying geographic reputation. This kind of split appears in Champagne, with a range of well-known and less well-known brands and is particularly significant to the small growers who sell wine. This study used a representative sample of these growers to examine how their location impacts on their reputation. The results show that their selling price is influenced by the local system of grading vineyard quality, their distance from traditional regional centres and the presence in their village of growers cited in a national guide.","[Menival, David] Reims Res Ctr Place Value & Ident, NEOMA Business Sch, Reims, France; [Charters, Steve] Burgundy Business Sch, Sch Wine & Spirits Business, Dijon, France",Burgundy School of Business,"Menival, D (通讯作者)，Reims Res Ctr Place Value & Ident, NEOMA Business Sch, Reims, France.",david.menival@neoma-bs.fr,,"Charters, Steve/0000-0002-9470-9269",,,,,71,9,12,3,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Using propensity score matching, we reduce potential bias from producer self-selection and from imposing a functional form. Results suggest that hedonic pricing models may be negatively biased in estimates of premiums received by value-added calf producers. Current adopters receive a premium of $5.38/cwt from participation in a certified preconditioning program, while nonadopters would realize $5.17/cwt by adopting certification.

We note that recognizing the latter dimension is only possible when analyzing rare long-term panel data. We estimate a model for land ownership using a version of the correlated random effects estimator to uniquely identify the determinants of both dimensions amongst Kenyan smallholders. We find life cycle effects are a key determinant of both distributions, and identify important ways in which initial conditions such as inheritance and off-farm income relate to the dynamics of ownership. We find that population density is a key determinant of differences between households, but also that a given household's land ownership is not affected in the short term as population density increases around them. Controlling for population density, households own more land when they are closer to road networks where the economic value of land is higher. We find important vulnerabilities for the land security of widows, but this vulnerability is geographically heterogeneous.","[Burke, William J.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jayne, T.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to ascertain the effects that crop prices, nuisance costs, and alternate wetland regulation have on these goals. An integrated geographic information system and economic farm-level model that assesses the net present value of drainage projects in the Whitesand River Watershed is employed. If prices eventually reach historical highs observed in the early 1970s, more than 85% of the wetland area in the study area could be drained, making NAWMP goals impossible to achieve. In this scenario, nuisance costs have little effect on drainage outcomes because they are dwarfed by the magnitude of agricultural revenue. If prices remain at the current higher levels observed from 2007 to 2012, the use of a binding permit could help achieve NAWMP goals. In this case, nuisance costs play a large role in determining the drainage of marginal, comparatively larger wetlands. If prices return to the recent lower levels observed from 1999 to 2006, current Saskatchewan regulation is sufficient. In this scenario, agricultural returns are low and nuisance costs are not high enough to cause wetland drainage. Both wetland regulation and nuisance costs can play an important role in agricultural wetland drainage, but that role depends critically upon the price of agricultural products. Les reglements actuels de la Saskatchewan sur les milieux humides ne sont peut-etre pas suffisants pour permettre l'atteinte des objectifs de conservation et de restauration enonces dans le Plan nord-americain de gestion de la sauvagine (PNAGS) compte tenu de la croissance de la demande de cereales et des couts des nuisances. Le present article vise a determiner les repercussions des divers reglements sur les milieux humides, du prix des cultures et des couts des nuisances sur les objectifs du PNAGS. Nous avons utilise un modele d'integration de donnees tirees d'un systeme d'information geographique (SIG) et de donnees economiques sur les fermes afin de determiner la valeur nette actualisee (VAN) de projets de drainage dans le bassin versant de la riviere Whitesand. Si les prix venaient a atteindre les niveaux historiques du debut des annees 1970, plus de 85% des milieux humides situes dans l'aire d'etude pourraient etre draines, ce qui rendrait la realisation des objectifs du PNAGS impossible. Dans ce cas, les couts des nuisances auraient peu de repercussions sur les decisions de drainage puisqu'ils seraient derisoires comparativement a l'importance du revenu agricole. Si les prix demeuraient a des niveaux eleves comme ceux observes de 2007 a 2012, l'utilisation d'un permis contraignant pourrait favoriser la realisation des objectifs du PNAGS. Dans ce cas, les couts des nuisances joueraient un role important dans la determination du drainage de grandes superficies de milieux humides peu productifs. Si les prix revenaient aux faibles niveaux observes de 1999 a 2006, les reglements actuels de la Saskatchewan seraient suffisants. Dans ce cas, les revenus agricoles seraient faibles et les couts des nuisances ne seraient pas suffisamment eleves pour susciter le drainage des milieux humides. Les reglements sur les milieux humides et les couts des nuisances peuvent jouer un role important dans les decisions de drainage des milieux humides, mais ce role est fortement tributaire du prix des produits agricoles.","Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"De Laporte, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, JD MacLachlan Bldg Room 225,50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",adelapor@uogueph.ca,"De Laporte, Aaron/AAY-4816-2021","De Laporte, Aaron/0000-0001-7036-0747",ACAAF; Ducks Unlimited Canada project,ACAAF(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada); Ducks Unlimited Canada project,"The author wishes to acknowledge the financial support of the ACAAF and Ducks Unlimited Canada project Management of Agricultural Landscapes with Wetlands and Riparian Zones: Economic and Greenhouse Gas Implications.

Design/methodology/approach - A stochastic simulation model is developed in such a way that the oligopoly or monopoly power of grouper fish exporters plays a role for having different impacts of the ECFA. Findings - Taiwan's grouper sector benefits considerably from the implementation of the ECFA tariff reductions. Export of the Taiwanese grouper fish to mainland China and the overall gross revenue of the Taiwanese grouper fish farmers are simulated to increase up to 4.04 and 4.54 percent, respectively, due to a 5 percent tariff reduction implemented by the ECFA. The authors further find that a larger degree of grouper fish exporters' market power would result in the ECFA having a lesser impact on the Taiwanese and mainland Chinese grouper fish markets. Practical implications - The findings suggest that Taiwan and mainland China should further negotiate reduction in tariffs over other agricultural products and/or other product categories. Originality/value - This study is the first empirical analysis to examine how the grouper industries on the Early Harvest List have responded to the ECFA tariff reductions.","[Ahn, Byeong-il] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Liao, Pei-An] Shih Hsin Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Kim, Hanho] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University; Shih Hsin University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Ahn, BI (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",ahn08@korea.ac.kr,,"Ahn, Byeong-il/0000-0002-3504-2898",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2012S1A2A1A01031554],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This work was partially supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2012S1A2A1A01031554).,,29,2,2,1,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

New Zealand has demonstrated that it is possible to implement a simple cap-and-trade system to help reduce nitrogen leaching from many small farms and thereby protect water quality. This paper relates to the second challenge: are complex regulatory systems worthwhile when nitrogen delivery is complex? When nitrogen moves through groundwater to a lake, leaching from different farms reaches the lake at different times and the damage caused is temporally differentiated. Policy that regulates farmers according to the timing of their nitrogen delivery will be more complex than policy that does not. Whether the gain in efficiency justifies this additional complexity can be assessed through modelling. We use an integrated model to estimate the gains from complex nitrogen regulation that incorporates groundwater delivery times relative to simple nitrogen regulation that does not. We find that the gains from more complex regulation are small in the catchment we study and cannot justify the additional complexity required. A sensitivity analysis enables us to identify the types of catchments where complex regulation may be worthwhile.","[Anastasiadis, Simon; Kerr, Suzi] Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Nauleau, Marie-Laure] Paris Tech, ENSAE, Paris, France; [Cox, Tim] CDM Smith, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Rutherford, Kit] NIWA, Hamilton, New Zealand",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand,"Anastasiadis, S (通讯作者)，Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, Wellington, New Zealand.",suzi.kerr@motu.org.nz,"Kerr, Suzi/ABG-5783-2020","Kerr, Suzi/0000-0002-4730-8761",New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation; Bay of Plenty Regional Council; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Ministry for the Environment,New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation; Bay of Plenty Regional Council; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Ministry for the Environment,"This paper is part of a research program funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation with support from the Bay of Plenty Regional Council, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry for the Environment.

The results revealed that the intra-industry trade in cereal preparations are positively and significantly influenced by the partners' gross national income (GNI) per capita and the partners' foreign direct investment (FDI), but they are negatively influenced by the Nigeria's household final consumption expenditure. Also, the intra-industry trade in miscellaneous edible preparations is influenced positively by the partners' GNI per capita and the partners' households' final consumption expenditures, while the Nigeria's foreign direct investment and the value added by manufacturing negatively influence the intra-industry trade in the product sub-sections within the ECOWAS sub-region.

In the reference scenario (SSP2), food demand increases by 59-98% between 2005 and 2050, slightly higher than the most recent FAO projection of 54% from 2005/2007. The range of results is large, in particular for animal calories (between 61% and 144%), caused by differences in demand systems specifications, and in income and price elasticities. The results are more sensitive to socioeconomic assumptions than to climate change or bioenergy scenarios. When considering a world with higher population and lower economic growth (SSP3), consumption per capita drops on average by 9% for crops and 18% for livestock. The maximum effect of climate change on calorie availability is -6% at the global level, and the effect of biofuel production on calorie availability is even smaller.","[Valin, Hugo; Havlik, Petr] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Sands, Ronald D.] Econ Res Serv, Resource & Rural Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [van der Mensbrugghe, Dominique] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Agr Dev Econ Div ESAD, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Nelson, Gerald C.; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Nelson, Gerald C.] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61801 USA; [Ahammad, Helal; Heyhoe, Edwina] ABARES, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Blanc, Elodie; Paltsev, Sergey] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bodirsky, Benjamin; Rolinski, Susanne] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Hasegawa, Tomoko] Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, NIES, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Kyle, Page] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Tabeau, Andrzej; van Meijl, Hans] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, NL-2585 DB The Hague, Netherlands; [von Lampe, Martin] OECD, TAD, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Willenbockel, Dirk] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Wageningen University & Research; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Sussex,"Valin, H (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",valin@iiasa.ac.at,"Willenbockel, Dirk/AAC-2191-2021; Nelson, Gerald/L-5903-2019; Hasegawa, Tomoko/AAB-2616-2019; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel/M-4254-2016; Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon/ABH-9170-2020; van Meijl, Hans/G-6223-2015; Valin, Hugo/Z-1557-2019; Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Kyle, Page/AFP-3602-2022; Tabeau, Andrzej/AAE-8214-2019","Willenbockel, Dirk/0000-0002-6840-0954; Hasegawa, Tomoko/0000-0003-2456-5789; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel/0000-0003-0673-2301; Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon/0000-0002-8242-6712; van Meijl, Hans/0000-0002-2455-6869; Valin, Hugo/0000-0002-0618-773X; Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; Havlik, Petr/0000-0001-5551-5085; Blanc, Elodie/0000-0003-1997-8212; Kyle, Page/0000-0002-1257-8358; Sands, Ronald/0000-0002-2864-0339; Paltsev, Sergey/0000-0003-3287-0732","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security; United States Department of Agriculture; Integrated Assessment Research Program in the Office of Science of the United States Department of Energy; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [A-1103]; climate change research program of NIES; EU; BMBF; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25285076] Funding Source: KAKEN","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security(CGIAR); United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Integrated Assessment Research Program in the Office of Science of the United States Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); climate change research program of NIES; EU(European Union (EU)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This article is a contribution to the global economic model intercomparison activity undertaken as part of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP; http://www.agmip.org).

However, the kinds of monitoring and certification systems that should be set up to ensure practical adoption and the effectiveness of the regulation remain unclear. This study aims to analyze consumers' preferences for milk traceability, with particular interest in investigating how consumers' preferences could be affected by monitoring and certification systems of the regarding system. Survey data from a choice-based conjoint (CBC) experiment are used to achieve this objective. In the experiment, milk is defined by a set of attributes in which we assume that milk traceability can be certified by three entities: the government, an industrial association, and a third party. The CBC data are then analyzed by using the alternative-specific form of a conditional Logit (McFadden's Choice) model. We found that urban Chinese consumers have a strong desire for traceable milk, but their preference for traceable milk is significantly related to the associated certificate issuers. Currently, the highest willingness-to-pay goes to government certificated traceable milk, followed by industrial association certificated and third-party certificated milks. In the future, however, consumers are likely to give more credit to third-party certification with rising income and knowledge.","[Bai, Junfei; Jiang, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Caiping] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, CP (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",caipingzhang@gmail.com,"Zhang, Caiping/AAQ-5944-2020",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71003114, 71273009]; Agricultural Food Research Initiative of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture/USDA [2010-65400-20489]; Emerging Markets Program Agreement Commodity Credit Corporation/USDA [2010-27]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Agricultural Food Research Initiative of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture/USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Emerging Markets Program Agreement Commodity Credit Corporation/USDA,"The authors wish to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71003114; 71273009), the Agricultural Food Research Initiative of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture/USDA (#2010-65400-20489), and the Emerging Markets Program Agreement (#2010-27) Commodity Credit Corporation/USDA.",,35,82,88,4,119,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In the literature, the profile likelihood estimator is the preferred choice for estimating this model. Yet, in many settings this estimator performs poorly. In particular, if the true thresholds are such that one or more regimes contain only a small number of observations, if unknown model parameters are numerous, or if parameters differ little between regimes, the profile likelihood estimator displays large bias and variance. Such settings are likely when studying price transmission. We analyze the weaknesses of the profile likelihood approach and propose an alternative regularized Bayesian estimator, which was developed for simpler but related threshold models. Simulation results show that the regularized Bayesian estimator outperforms profile likelihood in the estimation of threshold vector error correction models. Two empirical applications demonstrate the relevance of this new estimator for spatial price transmission analysis.","[Greb, Friederike] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Krivobokova, Tatyana] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth Dev Countrie, Gottingen, Germany; [Krivobokova, Tatyana] Univ Gottingen, Inst Math Stochast, Gottingen, Germany; [Munk, Axel] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Max Planck Society,"Greb, F (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",fgreb@uni-goettingen.de,,"Krivobokova, Tatyana/0000-0002-6389-2312",German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) as part of the Institutional Strategy of the University of Gottingen,German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) as part of the Institutional Strategy of the University of Gottingen(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors would like to thank Barry Goodwin and Nicholas Piggott for sharing their dataset with us.

In response, governments in developing countries often resort to subsidizing the cost of drugs, which, while perhaps easier to administer, may not always be the most effective way of addressing healthcare cost. In this regard, we analyze the impact of different types of household level health expenses on disease incidence and agricultural production efficiency. We use data from the 2006 Uganda National Household Survey, which covered approximately 7,400 households. The results suggest that a 10% increase in consultation, medicine, and hospitalization expenses would reduce malaria incidence respectively by 35.6%, 20.5%, and 21.3 %, which translates into a 1.1%, 0.6%, and 0.6 % decrease in agricultural inefficiency, respectively. The results indicate that helping poor households meet expenses for consultation through subsidies or eliminating consultation fees has a larger impact on malaria incidence and agricultural productivity among poor rural households than subsidizing the cost of medical drugs, the most common avenue chosen by developing country governments in the fight against the disease.","[Badiane, Ousmane; Ulimwengu, John] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Ulimwengu, J (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",j.ulimwengu@cgiar.org,,,,,,,38,9,9,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Although global warming is expected to increase both the frequency and severity of heat stress on dairy cattle, there are very few economic studies focusing on this issue. This paper contributes to the literature by integrating the frontier methodology, commonly used in applied production economics, with heat stress indexes used by animal scientists but largely ignored by economists. Our econometric models are useful to quantify gross benefits expected from adaptation to climatic conditions represented by the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) and alternatively by the Equivalent Temperature Index (ETI). Stochastic production frontier analysis is used to measure technical efficiency for an unbalanced panel of 103 dairy farms located in Florida and Georgia. Five alternative model specifications are evaluated. The results reveal that both THI and ETI have a significant nonlinear negative effect on milk production. The climatic indexes when incorporated in the frontier specification absorb some of the output shortfall that otherwise would be attributable to inefficiency. The results indicate that using fans combined with sprinklers is an effective adaptation to offset output losses stemming from heat stress conditions.","[Mukherjee, Deep; Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Talca, Talca, Chile; [De Vries, Albert] Univ Florida, Dept Anim Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",University of Connecticut; Universidad de Talca; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Mukherjee, D (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA.",deep.mukherjee@uconn.edu,"Mukherjee, Deep/JXY-0554-2024","Mukherjee, Deep/0000-0001-8503-2906; De Vries, Albert/0000-0003-4511-0388",,,,,38,30,36,1,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In order to create a comprehensive study, both quantitative and qualitative research methods have been applied. In total, thirty-nine companies have been surveyed in five Serbian clusters, gaining useful answers regarding companies which joined the clusters and the expectations and aspirations of cooperation within each cluster. The research methodology was analysed in-depth and valuable conclusions have been drawn. Often, Serbian companies did not start cooperating through an awareness of the benefits that clusters can offer, but rather out of the need to overcome certain common legal and business problems. The majority of the companies within the dusters are micro and small companies, without research and development (R&D).

This aim of this paper is to conduct a factor and sequential typology analysis to identify groups of countries categorized according to five measures of food security. Design/methodology/approach - The recent high food price and volatility, as well as economic recession, have reversed the last decade's progress in reducing hunger and poverty. This paper conducts a factor and sequential typology analysis to identify groups of countries categorized according to five measures of food security consumption, production, imports, distribution, and agricultural potential by using indicators from 175 countries. The analysis first identifies five distinct food security groups, measured by the levels of nutrient intake, and then further splits these groups based on indicators of food production, trade security, and agricultural potential. Findings - The results suggest that the terms of developing country or low income country can be inaccurate in the discussion of food security because they are too general and can actually mask the extreme heterogeneity in different aspects of food security. The results also indicate that different responses are needed by different types of food-insecure countries to address their unique food and economic challenges. Originality/value - The typology of food security and linkage between agricultural potential and food security contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of different policy interventions under a country's unique conditions.","[Yu, Bingxin] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [You, Lingzhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Yu, BX (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",b.yu@cgiar.org,"WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023","You, Liangzhi/0000-0001-7930-8814",,,,,25,9,12,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Willingness to participate is typically examined via stated preference surveys using the standard hurdle model for whether and how much to participate. Among respondents who decline to participate, such analyses cannot distinguish between respondents who declined due to the payment level and those who were not interested at all. This paper applies a double hurdle model to incorporate a prior condition for whether a respondent is even willing to consider participating in the PES market. The model uses a unique stated preference survey permitting separation of the consideration and enrolment decisions of 1,700 farmers in Michigan, USA. The first hurdle probit model suggests that farmers willingness to consider PES chiefly depends on farm and farmer characteristics, while the second hurdle tobit model shows that decisions on whether and how much to enrol depend more on the payment offer and marginal benefitcost criteria. This study provides fresh insights on facilitating farmer participation in PES programmes using tiered strategies that differ in costs of programme payment and administration.","[Ma, Shan] Stanford Univ, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Swinton, Scott M.; Lupi, Frank] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Jolejole-Foreman, Christina] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL USA",Stanford University; Michigan State University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Ma, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mashan@stanford.edu,"Lupi, Frank/N-3939-2019","Lupi, Frank/0000-0003-2287-2259",National Science Foundation under Human and Social Dynamics; Long-term Ecological Research programmes; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1027253] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation under Human and Social Dynamics; Long-term Ecological Research programmes; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Shan Ma is a post-doctoral scholar, Natural Capital Project, Stanford University.

State/territory governments mainly apply ad valorem royalties to oil and gas, coal and iron ore projects; these royalty payments will be creditable under the Australian Governments resource rent taxes. This paper argues that a hybrid system allows governments to collect a minimum return to the non-renewable resource through the ad valorem royalty and a share of the rent from higher-profit projects through the rent-based tax. This paper also provides updated and expanded estimates of the potential shortfall in resource taxation revenue over the period 19921993 to 20092010 by comparing actual revenue with revenue under a range of hypothetical Brown taxes.","Australian Govt Dept Agr Fisheries & Forestry, Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci ABARES, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,"Hogan, L (通讯作者)，Australian Govt Dept Agr Fisheries & Forestry, Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci ABARES, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",lindsay.hogan@abares.gov.au,,,,,,,21,9,10,3,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

This paper considers this question in the context of human altruism towards animals in which peoples concerns for the well-being of animals create an externality. After uncovering some conceptual challenges involved in carrying out costbenefit analysis on animal welfare policies, we report the results of a novel experiment used to measure the public-good value of farm animal welfare, and show that although the average value in our sample is quite large, the result is due to the preferences of only a small subset of the subjects.","[Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Lusk, JL (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 411 Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jayson.lusk@okstate.edu,,,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),This project was supported by National Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.,,35,27,29,0,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

In this article we use an equilibrium displacement model to estimate and compare the economic welfare effects from a range of hypothetical farm commodity and retail food policies as alternative mechanisms for encouraging consumption of healthy food or discouraging consumption of unhealthy food, or both. We find that, compared with retail taxes on fat, sugar, or all food, or subsidies on fruits and vegetables at the farm or retail levels, a tax on calories would be the most efficient obesity policy. A tax on calories would have the lowest deadweight loss per pound of fat reduction in average adult weight, and would yield a net social gain once the impact on public health care expenditures is considered.","[Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Robert Mondavi Inst, Ctr Wine Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,,,,,"National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, USDA [2006-55215-16720]; University of California Agricultural Issues Center; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics","National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); University of California Agricultural Issues Center; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics","This project was supported by the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, USDA, Grant # 2006-55215-16720.

However, while income growth is an economic benefit, the high incomes associated with the mining sector may also lead to greater inequality. This paper describes an empirical analysis of mining activity and income inequality in regional Australia. The Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality) for personal income is found to be significantly associated with levels of mining employment. However, this relationship is not linear. Rather, income inequality initially increases with mining activity, before decreasing at medium to high levels of mining employment, following a Kuznets curve pattern. Segregating data for men and women reveals very different patterns. Among men, inequality initially increases as mining employment in a region increases, but then sharply decreases; at high levels of mining activity, income inequality among men is lower than is typically observed in non-mining areas. Among women, income inequality increases with mining activity throughout its range. This suggests that income inequality is most likely to be a problem in locales with intermediate levels of mining activity and that it affects men and women quite differently.","[Reeson, Andrew F.; Measham, Thomas G.] CSIRO Minerals Flagship, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Reeson, Andrew F.; Measham, Thomas G.; Hosking, Karin] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Social & Econ Sci Program, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Reeson, AF (通讯作者)，CSIRO Minerals Flagship, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",andrew.reeson@csiro.au,"Measham, Thomas/A-5210-2010; Reeson, Andrew/A-1207-2011; Hosking, Karin F/G-5587-2010","Measham, Thomas/0000-0003-4549-5361; Reeson, Andrew/0000-0002-1603-2731;",,,,,28,50,53,2,51,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In mutual cooperation, with seven partners from the Great Britain, France, Spain, Greek and Finland, the University has been involved in the extensive research concerning the impact of the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) on the future European labour market. The RES COMPASS project meets the objectives expressed by the New Skills for New Jobs Initiative of the EU and stressed also other initiatives, namely the Green Jobs Initiative, the UNEP initiative as well as the requirements of the International Trade Union Confederation and the International Organization of Employers in 2008. The RES COMPASS programme strategy was based on the implementation steps in three mutually supportive components: The first component Comparative analysis of the methods of identification of skill needs on the future labour market based on the renewable energy sources was concerned in the young generation of the today's students. The second component Career Orientation test was developed as a tool for the potential young people thinking about a future career in the emerging area of renewable energy.

The paper informs about findings of the third component New businesses for SMEs in the RES. Realistic possibilities of the development of SMEs appear to exist in the provision of more complex services reacting to (1) needs of more rapid renovation of the morally depreciated devices, (2) interest of inhabitants and producers in the installations of at least two different autonomous alternative energy sources, (3) creation of informal groups of users who will share various energy sources, (4) need to support the installation of energy devices with other measures - energy audits and projects.","[Havlicek, Jaroslav; Pelikan, Martin; Subrt, Tomas] Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Havlícek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",havlicekj@pef.czu.cz,"Havlicek, Jaroslav/C-8392-2017; Subrt, Tomas/H-8542-2018; Pelikan, Martin/C-7311-2016","Havlicek, Jaroslav/0000-0003-3404-3968; Subrt, Tomas/0000-0002-4437-1431; Pelikan, Martin/0000-0002-7223-6982",,,,,13,0,0,1,36,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The focus is on whether aggregate consumer prices and different consumer price components or sub-price indexes are related in different ways to oil price in the long run and in the short run. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis adopts the Phillips curve framework augmented to include the oil price. In modeling, a proper consideration is given to the integration and cointegration properties of the variables under consideration. Moreover, the asymmetric effects of oil price changes are also examined. Findings - The paper finds evidence for a long run relation or cointegration of the oil price with only the aggregate consumer price and food price indexes. Moreover, in the short run, the oil price changes have significant bearings on the consumer price inflation, the food price inflation, the rent, fuel and power price inflation and the transportation and communication price inflation. In addition, the short-run asymmetry in the oil price food price inflation is also evident. Finally, the authors observe the neutrality of the medical care and health price index to the oil price changes. Practical implications - The result that the inflationary consequence of oil price hikes is likely to work mainly through the food prices has important implications on the effects of oil price changes on the poor and policy directions to contain inflation. Originality/value - The paper contributes to existing literature that has a predominant focus on the inflationary effect of oil prices at the aggregate level by looking at the relations between oil price and disaggregated good prices in the long run, short run, or both.","[Ibrahim, Mansor H.; Said, Rusmawati] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Serdang, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Ibrahim, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Serdang, Malaysia.",mansorhi@econ.upm.edu.my,"Ibrahim, Mansor/AAU-6887-2020","Ibrahim, Mansor/0000-0003-0413-0075",,,,,33,15,15,0,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The aim of this paper is to argue that open trade doesn't necessarily increase world pollution if clean development mechanism (CDM) is generously undertaken and if the CDM devotes considerable real resources in transfers of the associate abatement technology. Design/methodology/approach - The impacts of trade on environment can be decomposed into scale, technique and composition effects. This paper incorporates abatement assets into Copeland and Taylor's model to argue that the technique effect stems from an increasing in pollution taxes and in international diffusion of abatement technology; however, the former is fully offset but the latter is facilitated by the CDM. Findings - While world pollution is jointly determined by the composition and technique effects, in contrast to literature, open trade doesn't necessarily increase world pollution if CDM is generously undertaken with considerable real resources in abatement technology transfers. Originality/value - Currently, there are more than about one half of the CDM projects that allocate no real resources in technology transfers. This study addresses how voluntary investment of the CDM from the North (e.g. the USA) to the South (e.g. China) might reduce pollution on a global level only if having generously technology transfer.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Lo, CP (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",cplo@ntu.edu.tw,,,National Taiwan University,National Taiwan University(National Taiwan University),The financial support provided by the National Taiwan University is gratefully acknowledged.,,22,1,1,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Efforts to reduce crop raiding in developing countries generally involve prescriptive low-cost protection methods at the level of the individual farm, under the assumption that monetary capital and knowledge are the principal limiting factors in farmers adoption of protection methods. This article highlights the importance of considering labor costs in addition to monetary costs when assessing the adoptability of protection strategies. Benefit-cost analysis is used to inform a theoretical model of the likelihood of farmer adoption of methods to protect crops against elephants in Gabon. Supported by empirical findings from a binomial logit model of farmers protection decisions, this analysis elucidates the low rate of adoption for known protection methods in Gabon. While the empirical data are specific to Gabon, this analysis frames a reflection process regarding labor optimization and alternative strategies that applies broadly.","Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Walker, KL (通讯作者)，Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Panama City, Panama.",klwalker@umich.edu,"Walker, Kendra/GXZ-5530-2022",,U.S. Department of State; International Institute and Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan,U.S. Department of State; International Institute and Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan,"I thank Bobbi Low, Carl Simon, Michael Moore, and two anonymous reviewers for comments that have substantially improved this manuscript, and Brady West for statistical advice.

Also, the degree of price transmission under imperfect competition relative to that under perfect competition is evaluated. Design/methodology/approach - Conjectural variations are used to parameterize both seller and buyer market power conduct of the industry and then the equilibrium displacement approach is applied to solve a system of six structural equations which describe the demand for and supply of industry retail output and farm and marketing inputs. Findings - First, it is found that given empirical values of retail output demand elasticity, of farm and marketing inputs supply elasticities, of market power conducts, and of the returns to scale measure, the degree of price transmission under imperfect competition is greater than that under perfect competition. Second, it is found that the relative degree of price transmission under imperfect competition could be greater or smaller under the assumption of a varying market power conduct than one under the alternative assumption of a constant market power conduct, depending on whether market conduct is falling or rising, respectively.

The primary objectives of the study are to determine: (1) if market signals sent through the grid pricing system indicate an improvement in the grid incentive mechanism over time, (2) how changes in the grid premium and discount structure associated with carcass quality affect the market risk premium, and (3) if changes in price risk (variance) affect producer marketing decisions. An Exponential-Autoregressive-Conditional-Heteroskedasticity-in-Mean (EARCH-in-Mean) modeling procedure was adopted. Empirical results suggest that the grid premium and discount structure is slowly adjusting carcass quality market signals to encourage marketing on a grid and discourage marketing by the pen.

Prior studies of farm-level water use in developing areas have typically been limited to using number of irrigations as a proxy for water use. We develop a volumetric measure in Sri Lanka's Kirindi Oya Irrigation System through recent farmer recall and use it in production function estimation and welfare analysis. Findings indicate substantial differences in water use by farms across seasons and across subareas of the irrigation district. Alternative plans for allocating additional water among seasons and subareas to elevate net rice revenues are examined.

Wheat in particular, one of the main nonoil commodities, has registered a roller coaster in price levels which seems to be inconsistent with supply and demand fundamentals. To acutely investigate the drivers of wheat prices and quantify their impact, a vector error correction model (VECM) has been used. The exogenous variables have been distinguished into four groups: market-specific factors, broad macroeconomic determinants, speculative components, and weather variables. The quadriangulation of the determinants will enable us to better understand the movements in wheat price and identify the specific role of each component. The results show that a mix of factors are contributing to wheat price movements, including speculation, global demand, and real effective exchange rate.","[Algieri, Bernardina] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy; [Algieri, Bernardina] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Calabria; University of Bonn,"Algieri, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy.",b.algieri@unical.it,,,"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, BMZ","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, BMZ","I am grateful to the comments and suggestions offered by the Editor-in-Chief of this Journal Gerald Shively and two anonymous referees.

Additional reservations about the reliability of the results regarding the risk attitude measurement arise from the fact that most studies are based on convenience groups, such as students or businessmen in developing countries. With this in mind, we systematically compare different measuring methods to answer the question how the choice of method affects the results. Moreover, we compare the risk preferences of German farmers with those of students and Kazakhstani farmers to investigate whether farmers' risk preferences can be approximated through those of convenience groups. The methods applied comprise an incentive-compatible Holt-and-Laury-lottery as well as two psychometric methods. Results show that students respond consistently across all three elicitation methods whereas German and Kazakhstani farmers are more inconsistent. Significant differences exist in the responses of German students and German farmers. The comparison of risk preferences between German and Kazakhstani farmers, however, reveals significant similarities with respect to the psychometric methods.","[Maart-Noelck, Syster C.; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Maart-Noelck, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",syster.maart@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),We thank Joern Ewald for his assistance on earlier drafts of this paper.

Within the last decade, China has gone from obscurity to an important participant in global wine trade. The continual growth of Chinese wine imports suggests that a one-time structural shift approach may not fully capture how consumption patterns or demand preferences have changed over time. Thus, a rolling or moving regression procedure is used to account for continual adjustments in import demand patterns and to evaluate overall parameter instability. Our results confirm that Chinese consumers hold French wine in high regard and that French wine demand has consistently increased over the last decade, more than any other exporting source. Consumers in China have gone from allocating about 1/3 to over 1/2 of every dollar to French wine and the expenditure elasticity for French wine mostly increased while the market was expanding. Although Australian wine has a very solid standing in the Chinese market, results suggest that its market share will likely remain unchanged. Marginal budget share and expenditure elasticity estimates indicate that Australia will continue to account for about 20 per cent of the foreign wine market in China.","[Muhammad, Andrew; McPhail, Lihong] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Leister, Amanda M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Chen, Wei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Shanghai, Peoples R China",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Colorado State University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Muhammad, A (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",amuhammad@ers.usda.gov,,"MUHAMMAD, ANDREW/0000-0002-4825-9324",,,,,28,20,25,2,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

It is divided into three sections, which cover different stages of the development of these relationships over time and escalate in terms of two-way approaches to a new quality of cooperation (including the three stated research questions).

We estimated the monetary value of each of the relevant agricultural practices. Our results make a strong case for differentiating incentives to encourage environmentally friendly practices and identify the diversity of values attached to the main components of rice cropping technology in the area.

To advance our understanding of the sources of the differences, 10 global economic models that produce long-term scenarios were asked to compare a reference scenario with alternate socioeconomic, climate change, and bioenergy scenarios using a common set of key drivers. Several key conclusions emerge from this exercise: First, for a comparison of scenario results to be meaningful, a careful analysis of the interpretation of the relevant model variables is essential. For instance, the use of real world commodity prices differs widely across models, and comparing the prices without accounting for their different meanings can lead to misleading results. Second, results suggest that, once some key assumptions are harmonized, the variability in general trends across models declines but remains important. For example, given the common assumptions of the reference scenario, models show average annual rates of changes of real global producer prices for agricultural products on average ranging between -0.4% and +0.7% between the 2005 base year and 2050. This compares to an average decline of real agricultural prices of 4% p.a. between the 1960s and the 2000s. Several other common trends are shown, for example, relating to key global growth areas for agricultural production and consumption. Third, differences in basic model parameters such as income and price elasticities, sometimes hidden in the way market behavior is modeled, result in significant differences in the details. Fourth, the analysis shows that agro-economic modelers aiming to inform the agricultural and development policy debate require better data and analysis on both economic behavior and biophysical drivers. More interdisciplinary modeling efforts are required to cross-fertilize analyses at different scales.","[von Lampe, Martin] OECD, TAD, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Willenbockel, Dirk] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Ahammad, Helal; Heyhoe, Edwina] Australian Govt Dept Agr, Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Blanc, Elodie; Cai, Yongxia] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Calvin, Katherine; Kyle, Page] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Hasegawa, Tomoko] Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, NIES, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Havlik, Petr; Valin, Hugo] IIASA, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Lotze-Campen, Hermann; Schmitz, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [d'Croz, Daniel Mason; Nelson, Gerald C.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Nelson, Gerald C.] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61801 USA; [Sands, Ronald D.] ERS, Resource & Rural Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Tabeau, Andrzej; van Meijl, Hans] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, NL-2585 DB The Hague, Netherlands; [van der Mensbrugghe, Dominique] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Agr Dev Econ Div ESAD, I-00153 Rome, Italy",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Sussex; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Wageningen University & Research; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"von Lampe, M (通讯作者)，OECD, TAD, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",Martin.vonLampe@oecd.org,"Mason-D'Croz, Daniel/M-4254-2016; Willenbockel, Dirk/AAC-2191-2021; Valin, Hugo/Z-1557-2019; Kyle, Page/AFP-3602-2022; van Meijl, Hans/G-6223-2015; Nelson, Gerald/L-5903-2019; Tabeau, Andrzej/AAE-8214-2019; Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Hasegawa, Tomoko/AAB-2616-2019; Lotze-Campen, Hermann/AAA-5093-2020","Mason-D'Croz, Daniel/0000-0003-0673-2301; Willenbockel, Dirk/0000-0002-6840-0954; Valin, Hugo/0000-0002-0618-773X; van Meijl, Hans/0000-0002-2455-6869; Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; Hasegawa, Tomoko/0000-0003-2456-5789; Lotze-Campen, Hermann/0000-0002-0003-5508; Havlik, Petr/0000-0001-5551-5085; Blanc, Elodie/0000-0003-1997-8212; Kyle, Page/0000-0002-1257-8358; Sands, Ronald/0000-0002-2864-0339; Calvin, Katherine/0000-0003-2191-4189; Cai, Yongxia/0000-0002-1954-269X","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); British government; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [A-1103]; climate change research program of NIES; Integrated Assessment Research Program in the Office of Science of the United States Department of Energy; EU; BMBF","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); British government; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); climate change research program of NIES; Integrated Assessment Research Program in the Office of Science of the United States Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); EU(European Union (EU)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This article is a contribution to the global economic model intercomparison activity undertaken as part of the AgMIP Project (www.agmip.org).

Specifically, the authors identify risks inherent in two primary types of farmer cooperatives in China ( traditional and modern ones) when the external environment changes, the cooperative size expands and heterogeneity in membership widens. Design/methodology/approach - The authors assume that the uncertainty of the external environment and the deviation of organisational adaptation constitute the two dynamic factors that generated risks for farmer cooperatives. A survey of 158 farmer cooperatives is obtained in Zhejiang province in 2010, and factor analysis is employed to identify the risks and their critical degrees of traditional and modern cooperatives. Findings - The results indicate that two types of cooperatives in China face drastically different sets of risks. Traditional cooperatives face larger competitive and human resources risks, whereas modern cooperatives face larger decision-making and behavioural risks. Product market risk, macroeconomic policy risk and financial risk are common critical risks faced by both types of cooperatives. Originality/value - In this paper, risks in China's farmer cooperatives were empirically studied and systematically discussed. The paper offers a typology to identify risks inherent in two primary types of farmer cooperatives in China ( traditional and modern ones) according to property rights arrangements and governance structure.","[Zhang, Ying] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Int Cooperat, Wenzhou, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zu Hui] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Wenzhou University; Zhejiang University,"Huang, ZH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhhuang@zju.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [70903052, 71020107028]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Support from the projects No.70903052 and No. 71020107028 funded by the National Science Foundation of China is gratefully acknowledged.,,25,10,12,7,67,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We use a model of optimal pesticide use that explicitly incorporates the symmetric and asymmetric effect of pesticides' environmental spillovers on crop production. The application focuses on panel data from Dutch cash crop producers.

We show that the inefficiencies arise from differences in the account taken of relevant costs by different authorities.

More detailed information on nanotechnology has a negative impact when voluntary access to relevant information is assured.","[Roosen, Jutta] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Mkt & Consumer Res, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Marette, Stephan] INRA, Grignon, France; [Blanchemanche, Sandrine] INRA, Paris, France; [Vandermoere, Frederic] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium",Technical University of Munich; INRAE; INRAE; University of Antwerp,"Roosen, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Dept Mkt & Consumer Res, Alte Akad 16, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",jroosen@tum.de,"Roosen, Jutta/AAN-2079-2021","Roosen, Jutta/0000-0002-3032-399X",German Research Foundation (DFG); French National Research Agency (ANR),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),This article is based on research supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the French National Research Agency (ANR) and expresses only the views of the authors.

Due to apartheid laws, South Africa found itself with high levels of unskilled labour force. This study seeks to find the impacts of literacy rate and human development indices on agricultural production using Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bounds Test approach to co-integration. A long run relationship among the variables, agricultural production (agriculture GDP), literacy rate and human development indices were found. Literacy rate has a positively significant effect on agricultural production in the long run while Human Development Index has a positive and significant impact in the short run. This indicates that the apartheid regime fell short in recognizing the positive effect of education in the agricultural sector by denying a descent education to the majority of non-whites which were farm labourers or small scale farmers.

It reviews and compares forecasts for grain security in 2020 and 2030 with the aim of making some judgments, from the perspective of grain supply and demand, about the future grain security situation in China. Design/methodology/approach - In this article, the paper will introduce the methods and results of the forecast and also focus on the predictions for grain security in 2020 and 2030 in order to give a clear review of previous researches in this regard. Findings - The results indicate that the traditional threats to food supply and demand in China still exist, while demand for biomass energy continues to rise. With regard to grain aggregate, the grain supply-demand balance will still be relatively tight for both 2020 and 2030. In terms of structure, grain for feed will experience increase - mainly driven by the supply of corn - adding to the unabated structural issues confronting regional grain supply and demand. In the future, therefore, China should try to preserve favorable factors that increase grain production, optimize grain structure and production, maintain the proper scale and make-up of grain imports and exports, and work for a sound global trading environment for grain. Originality/value - This article contributes to existing literature by analyzing the factors affecting grain security in China and reviewing prediction techniques and forecasts for grain security in China in 2020 and 2030. The findings suggest that China needs to take appropriate measures to ensure future grain security.","Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Development, CAAS","Lv, XY (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",lvxinye@126.com,,,,,,,68,12,13,8,68,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This subsidy mutated and grew over time, encouraged by rent seeking. The subsidy had huge cost to the Brazilian Treasury, $9.8 billion in constant 1982 US dollars, or about 13% of coffee export revenues. As exports were usually quota-constrained, the subsidy increased Brazil's international coffee price, particularly during 19801986, absolutely and relative to its competitors prices. The unexpected variation in Brazil's price also caused the New York Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange to terminate trading in Brazilian coffee futures, making it more costly to hedge Brazilian coffee until today. The econometric evidence is mixed, but it seems likely the subsidy reduced Brazil's net economic welfare and redistributed income from the Treasury to foreign roasters, domestic exporters, and government bureaucrats.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Jarvis, LS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",lsjarvis@ucdavis.edu,,,World Bank,World Bank(The World Bank India),"Early research leading to this article was carried out jointly with Mary Bohman.

Despite important genetic advances in dairy production, the absence of genetic records in farm management databases has precluded empirical production models from explicitly accounting for differences in genetics across herds. The influence of genetics on milk composition is analyzed by splitting milk production into protein, fat, and other components. The article explores some modeling issues associated with the specification of the effect of genetics in this multi-output technology framework. In particular, genetic indexes are considered as allocable inputs and the remaining inputs as nonallocable. Our results show that genetics have a significant impact on milk composition. In particular, we find that farmers income increases by 6.6% when genetic indexes are augmented by one sample standard deviation.","[Roibas, David; Alvarez, Antonio] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Roibas, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",droibas@uniovi.es,"Roibas, David/F-7969-2017; Alvarez, Antonio M/B-4937-2013","Roibas, David/0000-0001-9904-0085;",,,,,24,6,7,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

It uses a comprehensive survey carried out during the agricultural year 2005/2006 to explore agricultural households perceptions of production, market conditions and general security 6 years after the end of the military conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Several locational, household and farm characteristics empirically approximate the significance of different factors for the amount of land left idle. Two different econometric models are used to address the characteristics of the dependent variable distribution by accounting for endogeneity. The main determinants of the share of land left fallow are found to be related to the economic and institutional structure, and to the general feeling of insecurity.","[Latruffe, Laure] INRA, UMR SMART 1302, F-35011 Rennes, France; [Davidova, Sophia] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Sauer, Johannes] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",INRAE; Universite de Rennes; University of Kent; University of Manchester,"Latruffe, L (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR SMART, 4 Allee Bobierre,CS 61103, F-35011 Rennes, France.",laure.latruffe@rennes.inra.fr,,"Davidova, Sophia/0000-0001-8653-8191; Sauer, Johannes (Jo)/0000-0003-2674-0229",European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR),European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR),The survey benefited from the technical assistance of the project 'Agricultural Statistics and Policy Analysis Unit for Kosovo' (ASPAUK) funded by the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR).,,37,12,15,3,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

Food security increasingly depends on non-agricultural factors like energy, trade and finance. The negative economic and social impacts of food, energy and the global economic and financial crises showed the vulnerability to poverty. High and rising food prices further undermined the food security and threatened the livelihoods of the most vulnerable by decreasing their already limited purchasing power.

This paper pays particular attention to the magnitude and direction of productivity growth over different stages of their market reforms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a nonparametric Malmquist index approach using an output distance function to measure productivity growth and decompose it into its associated components. The empirical analysis is performed using the most recent FAO data set of 35 transition countries in Asia and Europe over the period of 1979-2004. Findings - The paper shows that decomposition analysis of productivity growth differs considerably at different stages of the transition period. This study presents supporting evidence that serious improvements in performance and efficiency, as well as continued technology transfer and adoption are required for transition economies to meet the demand for food and anticipated increases in world population. Originality/value - A comprehensive picture about the agricultural performance of the transition countries has somehow been missing in the literature. This study fills this gap by analyzing the productivity in these transition countries.","[Rungsuriyawiboon, Supawat] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Wang, Xiaobing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China","Thammasat University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Rungsuriyawiboon, S (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",supawat@econ.tu.ac.th,,,"Thailand Research Fund (TRF); Commission on Higher Education (CHE), Ministry of Education, Thailand","Thailand Research Fund (TRF)(Thailand Research Fund (TRF)); Commission on Higher Education (CHE), Ministry of Education, Thailand(Office of Higher Education Commission (OHEC))","The first author gratefully acknowledges financial supports from the Thailand Research Fund (TRF) and the Commission on Higher Education (CHE), Ministry of Education, Thailand (TRF-CHE Research Grant for Mid-Career University Faculty, 2011).

ENSO events have a tendency to amplify weather conditions such as droughts or excess precipitation in the affected regions, resulting in production shortage or excess supply, subsequently impacting agricultural commodity prices. In this research we assess effects of ENSO events on world coffee price dynamics using the monthly data between March 1989 and December 2010. We employ smooth transition autoregression framework to examine nonlinear dynamics of ENSO and coffee prices, and illustrate the results of this research using generalized impulse-response functions. We find that ENSO events indeed have short-term impacts on coffee prices.

To address this problem, the present study constructs a phased model of one mother equation, from which a series of equations of financial mathematics are derived as a response to several needs of credit beneficiaries. The proposed model consists of one scenario, based on a mother equation. The scenario corresponds to credits with reduced or increasing payment instalments, postponable payment periods. Of the mother equation, 8 explicative variables were solved for a total of 9 phasing formulas for credits with three levels of payment. Our model, in contrast to the traditional one, incorporates postponable payment periods and jumps in payment instalments in any period of the lifetime of the credit due to a temporary loss in the customer's income and changes in the credit user's income.","[Valencia-DeLara, Pilar] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Social Sci, Cuenca 16002, Spain; [Ramirez-Ceballos, Alberto] ID Int Decis Ltd, Financial Econ Dept, London, England",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Valencia-DeLara, P (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Social Sci, Edificio Gil de Albornoz,Ave Alfarez 44, Cuenca 16002, Spain.",pilar.valencia@uclm.es; gerencia@antai-group.com,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,7,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The rate of unemployment in the Czech Republic has increased again after a continuous period of decline until the year 2008. However, the development is uneven in individual regions due to the influence of different factors whose impact is reflected in different regions in various extents. The main factors influencing the development of unemployment include the demographic development that determines the level of economic activity of the population, as well the corporate restructuring of the businesses, qualification(s) of the work force in relation to the job vacancies in the labour market and also the business structure that provides job opportunities in the particular region. In comparison with the other member states of the European Union, the Czech Republic belongs to the countries with a lower rate of unemployment than the EU average despite the unfavourable trend since the year 2009.","[Zivelova, Iva] Mendelovy Univ Brne, Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Tr Gen Piky 7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Zivelová, I (通讯作者)，Mendelovy Univ Brne, Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Tr Gen Piky 7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",zivelova@mendelu.cz,"Zivelova, Iva/E-2279-2018",,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-652-9,,,,2012,,,,,,,318,323,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics,BG8OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392530500045,0

Furthermore, because the Yuan is undervalued only against the dollar, U.S. competitors have an advantage in exporting to China and China has an advantage over its competitors in exporting to the United States. This study develops a theoretical model to analyze the effect of the Yuan undervaluation on prices, supply, demand, and trade in the United States, China, and their competitors. This study applies a cointegration/error-correction model to empirically quantify the short-run and long-run effects of the devaluation of the Yuan on important agricultural commodities traded between the United States, China, and their competitors. These commodities include Chinese imports of milk, soybeans, and cotton from the United States and U.S. imports of beans, fruit juice, and fruit from China. The results show that Yuan devaluation causes Chinese imports of U.S. milk, soybeans, and cotton to decline and U.S. imports of beans, fruit juice, and fruit from China to increase in the short run and in the long run.","[Devadoss, Stephen; Hilland, Amy; Foltz, John] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Mittelhammer, Ron] Washington State Univ, Coll Agr Human & Nat Resource Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; Washington State University,"Devadoss, S (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",devadoss@uidaho.edu,,,Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station; USDA-NIFA,Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station; USDA-NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The authors appreciate the positive feedback from two anonymous reviewers.

The sample comprises 590 dairy processors from the following five countries: Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The AR models indicate that cooperatives which account for around 20% of all firms in the dairy processing sector are not primarily profit oriented. In addition, the results point toward a high level of competition as profit persistence is rather low even if cooperatives are excluded. The panel model reveals that short- as well as long-run profit persistence is influenced by firm and industry characteristics.","[Hirsch, Stefan; Hartmann, Monika] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Hirsch, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussalle 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",stefan.hirsch@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Hirsch, Stefan/H-3552-2018; Hartmann, Monika/J-8224-2017","Hirsch, Stefan/0000-0003-2668-6824; Hartmann, Monika/0000-0002-3631-164X",,,,,63,41,41,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Using a new International Agricultural Prospects (iAP) Model, to project global agricultural consumption and production, we find in favour of a future where aggregate agricultural consumption (in tonnes) increases more modestly, by around 69 per cent (1.3 per cent per year) from 2010 to 2050. The principal driver of this result is a deceleration in population growth in the decades ahead. Per capita income growth and changing demographics (generally ageing population) have significant but secondary roles in spurring growth in agricultural consumption, as does our projected growth in the use of agricultural feedstocks to meet the growth we envisage in biofuel demand. Worldwide (but not equally everywhere), crop yield growth has generally slowed over the past decade or so. Notwithstanding a projected continuance of this slowdown, the prospective improvements in crop productivity are still sufficient to reduce per capita cropland use, such that land devoted to crops would need to increase by less than 10 per cent. Even in our upper-bound (high-consumption) scenario, we estimate that there remains sufficient productive agricultural land to more than meet the demand without ploughing-in additional forest-dominated lands.","[Pardey, Philip G.; Beddow, Jason M.; Hurley, Terrance M.; Eidman, Vernon R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Pardey, Philip G.; Beddow, Jason M.; Hurley, Terrance M.] Univ Minnesota, Int Sci & Technol Practice & Policy InSTePP Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Pardey, Philip G.; Beddow, Jason M.; Hurley, Terrance M.] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Pardey, Philip G.; Beddow, Jason M.] Int Livestock Res Inst Biosci Eastern & Cent Afr, Nairobi, Kenya; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Adelaide; University of Pretoria; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Pardey, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",ppardey@umn.edu,,"Pardey, Philip/0000-0002-8012-1341; Hurley, Terrance/0000-0003-2135-7570",University of Minnesota; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"The authors thank Connie Chan-Kang, Michelle Hallaway and Bess Rubin for their excellent research assistance, and Brian Fisher and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Using data from over 300 people recruited from two cities in the United States and France, we study how choices between a relatively healthy item (apples) and a relatively unhealthy item (cookies) are influenced by ones role as either the paternalist or the paternalee. We find that after being provided information on nutritional content, but not before, paternalists make healthier choices for the paternalees than for themselves. Surprisingly, prior to being provided information, paternalees desire healthier choices than they expect the paternalists to give, a phenomenon that seems to arise from a type of egotism where individuals believe they make healthier choices than everyone else. Results in both locations reveal that more than 75 of paternalees prefer their own choices compared to the ones made for them by the paternalists, and are willing to pay non-trivial amounts to have their own choices. Any intrinsic value people place on the freedom of choice must be weighed against whatever benefits might arise from paternalistic policies, and consequently the scope for paternalism may be narrower than is often purported.","[Lusk, Jayson L.; Norwood, F.

First there is shown the relevance of using the fuzzy CPM in agriculture and the related branches and present the basics of the methods used. Then, there are described the imperfections of the work which is discussed and the impacts of the previously-published approach when applied in project management practice are emphasised. In the original paper, the author uses only the discrete fuzzy numbers for activity time durations which could be considered inappropriate for the time scheduling in project management. Consecutively, the direct application of the extension principle on the comparison of continuous durations could lead to the situation when both numbers can be greater than the second one with possibility equal to one. Moreover, the simple transformation of durations to the costs by linear equations with a positive slope does not respect the current project management theory and practice. Finally, the missing comparison of project fuzzy costs among individual variants of the project is calculated.","[Krejci, Igor; Houska, Milan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Krejcí, I (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",krejcii@pef.czu.cz; houska@pef.czu.cz,"Houska, Milan/ABH-7911-2020; Houska, Milan/M-1223-2015; Krejci, Igor/R-9263-2016","Houska, Milan/0000-0001-7530-2052; Krejci, Igor/0000-0003-2723-7289",Internal Grant Agency of the CULS Prague Measuring the efficiency of knowledge transfer in the agricultural waste processing sector [20131001],Internal Grant Agency of the CULS Prague Measuring the efficiency of knowledge transfer in the agricultural waste processing sector,"The paper is partially supported by the grant project of the Internal Grant Agency of the CULS Prague Measuring the efficiency of knowledge transfer in the agricultural waste processing sector, No. 20131001.

Design/methodology/approach - The primary data collected by authors from 180 dairy farmers were sampled and modeled in a stochastic metafrontier framework due to its ability to estimate and compare the efficiency of firms among various groups with possibly different group-specific technologies and heterogeneous production environments. Findings - The empirical results show that farms from intensive system were closer to their production frontier than extensive and traditional system. Regarding productivity differences among systems, the MTR is by far highest for intensive, indicating the technological advantage of this system over others two systems. The estimation of farm-specific inefficiency model revealed that farmers' access to extension and credit services are assumed to be significant determinants in reducing inefficiency. Practical implications - This study concludes that the ability of the farmers to increase productivity vary depending on the production systems due to variation in resource endowments and access to various inputs and support services. Thus, improving productivity depends on effective policy design on harmonizing access to resources and delivery of extension and credit services. Originality/value - The empirical analysis of data representing different production endowments by stochastic metafrontier make it possible to identify the efficiency level as well as technology gap, thus, ways to identify the possible policy options reducing those gaps and improving productivity.","[Uddin, Mohammad Mohi] Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Anim Nutr, Mymensingh, Bangladesh; [Uddin, Mohammad Mohi; Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Peters, Kurt Johanes] Humboldt Univ, Dept Crop & Anim Sci, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU); University of Gottingen; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Uddin, MM (通讯作者)，Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Anim Nutr, Mymensingh, Bangladesh.",muddin_bau@yahoo.com,"Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009","Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346","International Foundation for Science (IFS), Sweden [S-4874-1]","International Foundation for Science (IFS), Sweden(International Foundation for Science)","The authors like to acknowledge the grants provided by the International Foundation for Science (IFS), Sweden for conducting the field study in Bangladesh to generate the primary data which were used in this study (Grant reference: S-4874-1).",,28,6,6,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This issue is examined using Statistics Canada federal direct payment and net farm income data from 1981 to 2010. An estimate of the reduced protection against farm income loss that can be attributed to payment delays is obtained using a simple partial adjustment model, first with and then without the assumption of a constant rate of adjustment over time. The results point to a highly significant reduction in program effectiveness that can be attributed to delays in direct payments.

These are particularly important to marketers in the Northern Great Plains in the United States, as well as for Canadian marketers as they confront deregulation in wheat marketing and will be exposed to these risks. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the dynamic relationships and interdependencies among terminal market basis values for milling. Specifically, we seek to identify factors impacting basis values for 13%, 14%, and 15% protein HRS wheat in addition to the intermarket wheat spread between Minneapolis and Kansas City wheat futures. We specify a vector autoregression (VAR) model to explore these relationships. Exogenous structural variables are specified in addition to dynamic interrelationships including seasonal and intertemporal variability and dynamic interdependencies among these markets and relationships. Results of interest are that: (1) basis values for these markets have been trending up and have become more volatile; (2) factors impacting this variability are the protein level in HRS, production of hard red winter (HRW), and Canadian wheat (on high protein basis); (3) HRW protein supplies are not significant in the basis equations, but, do impact the intermarket wheat futures spread; (4) quality factors have a significant impact on basis values, notably vomitoxin, falling numbers, and absorption. Dynamic interrelations are also important in that all prices converge quickly toward a long-term equilibrium. In addition, there are seasonal impacts, dynamic basis interactions, trends, and lagged impacts of protein levels.","[Wilson, William W.; Miljkovic, Dragan] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58108 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Miljkovic, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, 7610,POB 6050, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",william.wilson@ndsu.edu; dragan.miljkovic@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,38,5,5,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Using these measures, we identify influencing factors of risk aversion via regression analysis, whereby unlike previous studies, we include several proxies of social capital such as social networks and norms. Data were collected from household heads and spouses separately in a random sample of 300 households. Although correlations between most of the various risk preference measures are all statistically highly significant, most are weak. On average, respondents have a high degree of risk aversion and specific characteristicsgender, age, idiosyncratic shocks, education, social norms, network-reliance with extended family, and connections to local authoritiesare significant determinants of risk preferences across most elicitation methods, whereas othersthe household's dependency ratio, wealth, and covariate shocksare significant in a few methods only. The explanatory power of the models is limited, indicating that other factors are likely to be of greater importance in determining risk preferences. The results can help target safety nets, encourage investments, and lead to the development of more applicable methods for assessing risk preferences of smallholders in developing countries.","[Nielsen, Thea; Keil, Alwin; Zeller, Manfred] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop 490A, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Nielsen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop 490A, Wollgrasweg 43, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",thea.nielsen@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Ritter, Thea/0000-0003-0503-2952",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the collaborative research center [SFB 564],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the collaborative research center(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for funding this research through the collaborative research center SFB 564 The Uplands Program.

Inefficiencies in the Malian cotton system at the ginnery and producers' cooperative levels (e.g., late payment to farmers and poorly functioning credit schemes) have recently led to an important decline in supply, threatening the sustainability of the sector. Using regional data from 1998/1999 to 2008/2009, this study aims to quantitatively assess the contribution of key determinants, such as cotton prices and timely payment, toward the downward trend in cotton area. A dynamic supply model, based on adaptive expectations and partial adjustment, is employed to estimate the effects of prices and institutional factors, such as credit recovery rates and date of payment to farmers, on the Malian cotton supply. Results show that supply responds significantly to cotton prices relative to cereal and fertilizer prices. Date of payment varies across agricultural cycles and late payment negatively influences land devoted to cotton. Low credit repayment rates create disincentives to grow cotton. Therefore, the revitalization of the Malian cotton sector depends upon getting both prices and institutions right.","[Theriault, Veronique] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Serra, Renata] Univ Florida, Ctr African Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Sterns, James A.] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Michigan State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Theriault, V (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr,Room 213-B, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",theria13@msu.edu,,,,,,,67,13,13,0,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

J,"Chang, HH",,,,"Chang, Hung-Hao",,,Impact of the economic crisis on income inequality among farm households,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Employment; Labor use and migration; Household analysis,,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the impacts of the 2008 economic crisis on the change in income inequality among farm households using the micro-level data. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Using a national household survey data in Taiwan in 2007 and 2009, the paper applies the Gini decomposition method for income inequality. Findings - Results of a decomposition method indicate that the Gini coefficients decrease for farm households, and that the effects are more pronounced among the full-time farms. The reduction in the overall income inequality is due to the decreased farm income and off-farm wage salaries, as well as the increased government payments. Research limitations/implications - Although these findings are interesting and useful, some caveats still remain. First, the analysis can only reveal the short-term effect of the economic crisis. The long-term effect could be different In addition, the paper does not further address whether the impacts may differ for households with different socio-demographic characteristics of the household members and household characteristics.

One of the major changes was the transformation of the national agri-food trade. The aim of the paper is to analyse the effects of the EU accession on the NMS agri-food trade, especially considering the revealed comparative advantages. The results suggest that the intensity of the NMS agri-food trade has increased significantly after the accession, though there was a serious deterioration in the NMS agri-food trade balance in most cases. It has also become evident that the NMS agri-food trade was highly concentrated by country and by product, though the concentration has not changed significantly after the EU accession. Moreover, our analyses highlight one of the most important characteristics of the NMS agri-food trade structure - the focus on the agri-food raw materials in export together with the agri-food processed products in import. As to the NMSagri-food trade specialisation, the diversity among member states becomes apparent. Almost all countries experienced a decrease in their comparative advantage after the accession, though it still remained at an acceptable level in most cases. As for the stability of the comparative advantage, the results suggest a weakening trend, underpinned by the convergence of the pattern of revealed comparative advantage. By estimating the survival function to the sample, it can be observed that the accession has radically changed the survival time of agri-food trade, meaning that the revealed comparative advantage has not turned out to be persistent in the period analysed. From the policy perspective, there is a clear need for structural changes in the NMS agriculture and agri-food sector in order to tackle the negative tendencies of the national agri-food trade. The most important long-term goal should be the production and export of higher value-added processed products based on domestic raw materials.","[Toeroek, Aron; Jambor, Attila] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Török, A (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",aron.torok@uni-corvinus.hu; attila.jambor@uni-corvinus.hu,"Torok, Aron/AAO-7820-2020","Torok, Aron/0000-0001-6769-7103; Jambor, Attila/0000-0001-8089-7222",Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [83119],Hungarian Scientific Research Fund(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),Supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (Grant No. 83119).,,13,31,31,1,12,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

J,"Xing, L; Goldsmith, P",,,,"Xing, Lei; Goldsmith, Peter",,,Improving Chinese soybean meal demand estimation by addressing the non-commercial Commercial feed gap,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Agribusiness; Agricultural technology; Agricultural investment; Agricultural markets; Land use,FOOD-CONSUMPTION; TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; QUALITY,"Purpose - Two effects simultaneously shape the future soybean meal (SBM) demand in China: the income effect on meat consumption and the transition effect due to commercial feed usage in animal production. The income effect has been studied intensively in previous research and results in rapidly growing animal product consumption. The commercial feed transition effect, however, is not well understood. The accurate forecast of SBM demand requires an integration of both effects. This study aims to contribute to the commodity forecast literature: by estimating the non-commercial to commercial feed effect and then comparing to the income effect. Design/methodology/approach - This research addresses the gap in the literature by considering the diffusion path of commercial feeding technology when forecasting China's future SBM demand. The paper addresses the following five objectives to accomplish this goal. Objective 1: estimate income elasticity of demand for meat; Objective 2: estimate the current commercial feeding gap; Objective 3: analyze the reasons for low SBM feeding ratios; Objective 4: estimate future SBM feeding ratios; Objective 5: forecast future soybean demand in China. Findings - China needs 33 years from 2009 to achieve the SBM feeding ratio of 98 percent. The difference in future derived demand for SBM mainly comes from the transition effect of animal production industry in China. The income effect only contributes on average 2.1 percent of the theoretical SBM consumption quantity over the next 20 years. The feeding technology diffusion effect, however, causes an additional 3.6 percent annual compound growth rate on the demand increase for SBM over the same time periods. The livestock industry's transition effect is roughly equivalent to 1.5 times the income effect. Practical implications - Policy makers, industry managers, and analysts will now have not only a more accurate estimate of future SBM demand, but also a better understanding of the structural components of that estimation. In particular, the role of commercial feed adoption is explicitly estimated. Originality/value - This research is the first to estimate the effect of the shift from non-commercial to commercial feeding systems on overall SBM demand. The results show that not accounting for the diffusion of new commercial feeding technology creates under the estimates of future SBM demand.","[Xing, Lei] Noble Corp, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Goldsmith, Peter] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Goldsmith, Peter] Univ Illinois, Food & Agribusiness Program, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Goldsmith, P (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",pgoldsmi@illinois.edu,"LI, XIAO/JCE-6169-2023",,National Soybean Research Laboratory; USDA,National Soybean Research Laboratory; USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The authors would like to thank The National Soybean Research Laboratory and the USDA for partial funding of this research, and anonymous reviewers for excellent suggestions to improve this manuscript.",,51,1,2,0,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Using detailed agricultural trade and production data during 1994-2009, the authors estimate the labor contents of agricultural trade flows and use these estimates to compute the farm employment effects. Findings - The authors find that China's agricultural trade has indeed generally developed along its widely believed comparative advantages and disadvantages; however, the farm employment creation effect due to labor-intensive exports has actually been dominated by the employment substitution effect due to increased land-intensive imports, thereby mostly resulting in negative net farm employment in the post-WTO accession era. Originality/value - Findings from this first systematic attempt to estimate the trade-induced farm employment effects do not lend support to the popular notion that increased agricultural trade would help increase farm employment and have important implications for evaluating current and future trade policy in China and elsewhere.","[Zhu, Jing; Zhang, Shu] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shu] Minist Agr, Agr Trade Promot Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Wusheng] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",Nanjing Agricultural University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; University of Copenhagen,"Zhu, J (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",crystalzhu@njau.edu.cn,"Yu, Wusheng/E-4626-2015","Yu, Wusheng/0000-0002-2311-3759",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173111],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71173111) and Qing Lan Project of the Jiangsu Province is acknowledged by the first two authors of the article.

As a result, selection bias in adoption parameters may occur. We focus on tissue culture (TC) banana technology that was introduced in Kenya more than 10 years ago. Up till now, adoption rates have remained relatively low. We employ the average treatment effects approach to account for selection bias and extend it by explicitly differentiating between awareness exposure (having heard of a technology) and knowledge exposure (understanding the attributes of a technology). Using a sample of Kenyan banana farmers, we find that estimated adoption parameters differ little when comparing the classical adoption model with one that corrects for heterogeneous awareness exposure. However, parameters differ considerably when accounting for heterogeneous knowledge exposure. This is plausible: while many farmers have heard about TC technology, its successful use requires notable changes in cultivation practices, and proper understanding is not yet very widespread. These results are also important for other technologies that are knowledge-intensive and require considerable adjustments in traditional practices.","[Kabunga, Nassul Ssentamu] IFPRI, Kampala, Uganda; [Dubois, Thomas] IITA, Kampala, Uganda; [Qaim, Matin] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Gottingen,"Kabunga, NS (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Plot 15,E Naguru Rd,POB 28565, Kampala, Uganda.",n.kabunga@cgiar.org,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; Kabunga, Nassul/0000-0002-7563-0299",German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),Financial support for this research came from the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

In contrast, the current environmental bond policy applied in most jurisdictions across Australia and New Zealand provides funds in the case of insolvency, but often does not provide optimal incentives for rehabilitation. This study analyses these alternative policy approaches through a theoretical model and an empirical case study. From the case study for a mineral sands firm, the policy recommendation is that, based on economic efficiency alone, a modified Pigovian tax (termed here a damaged land tax) is optimal for most combinations of parameters. However, both risk-sharing and efficiency objectives can be simultaneously addressed by a mixed policy that includes a damaged land tax and an environmental bond.","[White, Ben; Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.; Florec, Veronique] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.; Florec, Veronique] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; University of Waikato,"White, B (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA, Australia.",benedict.white@uwa.edu.au,"Florec, Veronique/F-6144-2013; Pannell, David/B-4476-2008; White, Benedict/D-1434-2011","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; White, Benedict/0000-0001-7256-2449; Florec, Veronique/0000-0003-3452-2707; Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491",ARC [DP0988368]; Australian Research Council [DP0988368] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,ARC(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The authors acknowledge funding from ARC Discovery Project DP0988368.,,50,14,15,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

At the same time, it identifies the size of the portion of the increased tax burden which agricultural producers and sellers of food carry, after the increase in the reduced rate of VAT in the Czech Republic. The possible future changes in this field are considered on the basis of determining the values of the distribution of the increased tax burden. It also includes the determination of the indicator of change in the selling prices of agricultural products and food in the increase of the reduced rate of VAT in the Czech Republic. In 2008, the buyers of agricultural products carried a considerable part of the increased tax burden and food buyers were burdened by significantly more than just b an increased tax burden of the reduced rate of the value added tax. The growth in prices of agricultural products in the given period corresponded to the growth of the tax burden. Food prices doubled compared to the increase in the tax burden. These results should be considered when planning future changes in the field of the rates of VAT in the Czech Republic.","Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"David, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",david@mendelu.cz,"David, Petr/Q-5673-2016","David, Petr/0000-0002-5055-0989","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6215648904]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6215648904).",,26,4,4,0,23,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

A joint review of existing empirical studies reveals scant and inconsistent evidence of GC from index activity to prices. Some findings of reverse GC from prices to index activity are reported. The literature offers three different interpretations of GC test results: (i) as prima facie causal evidence; (ii) as a test for informational efficiency of the markets; or (iii) as a test for the ability of one variable to improve the forecast of another variable. A critical examination of these interpretations against an extended theoretical background reveals that none allows direct inferences about the existence or absence of an influence from index trading activity on the price mechanism in the market.

This region has experienced pronounced climate variability and volatile commodity prices since the late 1990s. Relationships between productivity and profitability are explored using panel data from 47 farms in the study region. The data are analysed using nonparametric methods. By applying the Fare-Primont index method, components of farm productivity and profitability are measured over the period 1998-2008. Growth in productivity is found to be the main contributor of profitability. Gains in efficiency and technical change are identified as jointly and similarly important in their contribution to total factor productivity for the farm sample in the region from 1998 to 2008. However, across environments, efficiency gains play an increasingly important role in influencing productivity as growing season rainfall increases. We conclude that R,D&E that delivers further improvement in technical efficiency and technical change is needed to support the profitability of farms across the study region.","[Islam, Nazrul; Kingwell, Ross] Australian Export Grains Innovat Ctr, S Perth, WA, Australia; [Islam, Nazrul] Curtin Univ, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Xayavong, Vilaphonh] Dept Agr & Food, S Perth, WA, Australia",Curtin University; Government of Western Australia; Department of Agriculture & Food - Western Australia,"Islam, N (通讯作者)，Australian Export Grains Innovat Ctr, S Perth, WA, Australia.",nazrul.islam@outlook.com.au,"Kingwell, Ross/AAU-9315-2020; Islam, Nazrul/AAO-9069-2020; kingwell, ross/AAK-2952-2021","Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488; Islam, Nazrul/0000-0002-9276-8388;",,,,,38,19,20,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

One of their biggest challenges is that they face high operating costs because of their disaggregated distribution system and need to purchase a distribution and storage facility and two vehicles.

However, a great majority of empirical studies focus on the existence of asymmetry and, by and large, do not investigate the reason for its presence or absence. This is in sharp contrast to the theoretical literature that provides a number of explanations of why we should expect (a)symmetry. In response, this paper investigates the reasons for asymmetric price transmission in the agro-food chain, using meta-analysis of existing studies. Our focus is on the organizational and institutional characteristics of the agro-food supply chain. Our findings suggest that asymmetric price transmission in farm-retail relationships is more likely to occur in sectors/countries with more fragmented farm structure, higher governmental support and more restrictive regulations on price controls in the retail sector. On the other hand, more restrictive regulations on entry barriers in the retail sector and the relative importance of the sector tend to promote symmetric farm-retail price transmission. The latter is also more likely in the presence of a strong processing industry.","[Bakucs, Zoltan; Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Bakucs, Zoltan; Ferto, Imre] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary; [Falkowski, Jan] Univ Warsaw, CEAPS, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Corvinus University Budapest; University of Warsaw,"Ferto, I (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",imre.ferto@krtk.mta.hu,"Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Fałkowski, Jan/ABE-9726-2020","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Fałkowski, Jan/0000-0001-6921-6342",European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme COMPETE [312029]; Hungarian Academy of Sciences - Polish Academy of Sciences Researcher Exchange Visit Programme,European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme COMPETE; Hungarian Academy of Sciences - Polish Academy of Sciences Researcher Exchange Visit Programme,"Zoltan Bakucs and Imre Ferto are with the Institute of Economics, Research Centre for Economic and Regional Studies, Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Corvinus University of Budapest, Hungary.

The economic database of the Research Institute for Animal Production Nitra was used as the basis. The profit in milk production with including the direct subsidies was assumed as the main parameter of the dairy farm competitiveness. The influence of the individual cost items and milk yield on the competitiveness was quantified using the multivariable linear regression model. Our results indicate that the farms were competitive in milk production only in 2007 and 2008. The highest profit (0.026 (sic) per 1 kg of milk) was reached in 2007. It was mainly determined by the level of the milk price (+9%) and unit costs (-10%) in the evaluated period. The negative regression to the competitiveness was observed for the feed costs, labour costs, repairs and services, depreciations, other direct costs and overheads. On the other hand, the statistically positive impact of the milk yield was found. Generally, the effective utilization of the production potential of animals should be recommended as the main factor of the unit costs reduction as well as for the improvement of the dairy cattle farms profit.","[Michalickova, Monika; Polak, Peter; Hetenyi, Ladislav] RIAP Nitra, Natl Agr & Food Ctr, Inst Anim Husb Syst Breeding & Prod Qual, Luzianky, Slovakia; [Krupova, Zuzana; Krupa, Emil] Inst Anim Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Research Institute of Animal Science,"Michalicková, M (通讯作者)，RIAP Nitra, Natl Agr & Food Ctr, Inst Anim Husb Syst Breeding & Prod Qual, Luzianky, Slovakia.",michalickova@vuzv.sk,,"Krupova, Zuzana/0000-0002-9366-7802; Krupa, Emil/0000-0001-7848-5122",project CEGEZ of the European Regional Development Fund [26220120042]; project MLIEKO of the European Regional Development Fund [26220220098]; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic [RPVV 1]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [MZEO0714],"project CEGEZ of the European Regional Development Fund; project MLIEKO of the European Regional Development Fund; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic)","This paper is in memory of Dr. Jozef Dano our colleague, friend and teacher.

Then, they apply an endogenous switching regression model to compare the consumption responses to household production inputs for credit constrained and non-constrained households. The estimation results reveal that the credit constraint could result in the crowding out effect of the aggregate household consumption from its production inputs.

This paper analyses the role of prices, total land holdings and climate on land use in Australia. The analysis relates to a unique comprehensive coverage of commodity types at a regional level. An explicit treatment of missing data and the novel use of cluster analysis is employed within a partial adjustment framework for modelling land allocation. The majority of commodity types across regions exhibit significant degrees of slow partial adjustment for land allocation, the frequency of slow adjustment is greatest with crops and livestock and weakest for vegetables. In general, relative own and cross prices, total land holdings and rainfall only have a minor impact on short-term land allocations, however numerous individual commodity/regional combinations have identified significant short-run impacts.","[Oczkowski, Eddie; Bandara, Yapa] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Oczkowski, E (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia.",eoczkowski@csu.edu.au,"Oczkowski, Eddie/AAY-3706-2020","Oczkowski, Eddie/0000-0003-2071-7116; Bandara, Yapa/0000-0002-2440-8209",,,,,20,7,8,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Emphasis in efficiency analysis studies in agricultural production has historically focused on technical inefficiency as a single concept until methodological advances enabled it to be decomposed into pure technical inefficiency and scale inefficiency. But, this advance was insufficient to identify what we consider to be the major source of inefficiency in agricultural production, namely mix inefficiency. We consider that farm enterprises may be particularly susceptible to input mix inefficiency because of restrictions on movement around the frontier isoquant; delays in the adoption of improved technologies embodied in new vintages of production processes; risk as a source of friction in input allocation decisions; and the potential for inconsistency in simultaneously attempting to reach points of allocative efficiency and mix efficiency in input use. We use non-parametric methods to calculate a HicksMoorsteen productivity index using panel data for a sample of specialised pig producers in England and Wales. This index is then decomposed into measures of technology, technical efficiency, scale efficiency and mix efficiency for an input orientation. Results of the analysis show that the estimated mean mix inefficiency (0.736) was substantially larger than mean technical inefficiency (0.975) and mean scale inefficiency (0.957) over the study period.","[Hadley, David; Fleming, Euan; Villano, Renato] Univ New England, UNE Sch Business, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",University of New England,"Fleming, E (通讯作者)，Univ New England, UNE Sch Business, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",efleming@une.edu.au,"Villano, Renato Andrin/I-3680-2017; Hadley, David/C-5924-2008","Villano, Renato Andrin/0000-0003-2581-6623; Hadley, David/0000-0001-8634-2586",,,,,22,9,9,1,37,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

We present evidence that in India diversification toward high-value crops exhibits a pro-smallholder (rather than anti-smallholder) bias. The smallholders however play a proportionally larger role in vegetables than in fruits cultivation. These patterns are consistent with simple comparative advantage-based production choices. Even with small landholdings if labor endowments are high, such farmers diversify toward F & V. Though fruits cultivation is also labor intensive relative to cereals, it is less so relative to vegetables. Greater capital intensity implies a comparatively important role of credit in fruits. The results are robust to several tests on specification including those related to self-selection. Chez les petits exploitants agricoles, la diversification en faveur de cultures a valeur elevee (fruits et legumes) permettant d'accroitre considerablement le revenu agricole a toujours ete remise en question pour diverses raisons, notamment les deseconomies d'echelle et le manque d'acces aux intrants comme le capital et l'information. Dans le present article, nous montrons qu'en Inde, la diversification en faveur de cultures a valeur elevee semble plutot favorable que defavorable aux petits exploitants agricoles. Toutefois, les petits exploitants sont proportionnellement plus presents dans la culture maraichere que dans la culture fruitiere. Ces observations concordent avec les choix d'une production fondee sur les avantages comparatifs. Meme dans le cas des petites exploitations, lorsque les besoins de main-d'OEuvre sont eleves, elles se tournent vers les cultures fruitiere et maraichere. Bien que la culture fruitiere soit une activitea forte intensite de main-d'OEuvre comparativement a la culture cerealiere, elle l'est moins que la culture maraichere. L'intensite de capital elevee de la culture fruitiere signifie que le credit joue aussi un role important. Les resultats de plusieurs tests de specification sont robustes, y compris ceux lies a l'auto-selection.","[Birthal, Pratap Singh] Natl Ctr Agr Econ & Policy Res NCAP, New Delhi 110012, India; [Joshi, Pramod Kumar] Int Food Policy Res Inst, New Delhi 110012, India; [Roy, Devesh] IFPRI, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Thorat, Amit] NCAER, New Delhi 110002, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute of Agricultural Economics & Policy Research; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Roy, D (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",psbirthal@ncap.res.in; p.joshi@cgiar.org; d.roy@cgiar.org; amitthorat@gmail.com,"Birthal, Pratap/Q-7459-2019",,,,,,37,32,33,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

For this reason, this paper combines discrete and continuous mixing distributions to concurrently identify the size of the niche market and the heterogeneity among consumers within the market niche. Failing to account for the niche market nature of value-added services is shown to have implications for predictions of WTP, demand and total revenue.","[Campbell, Danny] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Doherty, Edel] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland",Queens University Belfast; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Campbell, D (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Gibson Inst Land Food & Environm, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",d.campbell@qub.ac.uk,"; Campbell, Danny/E-1873-2011","Doherty, Edel/0000-0001-8756-8974; Campbell, Danny/0000-0001-7467-2318","Department for Employment and Learning (Northern Ireland) under the ASsured, SafE and Traceable (ASSET) food research project","Department for Employment and Learning (Northern Ireland) under the ASsured, SafE and Traceable (ASSET) food research project","This work was supported by funding from the Department for Employment and Learning (Northern Ireland) under the ASsured, SafE and Traceable (ASSET) food research project.",,52,20,20,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Market power is analysed in the context of a dynamic imperfect competition model of the supply chain, in which retailers are allowed to exert market power both downstream and upstream. We jointly estimate market-power parameters together with supply and demand elasticities, by means of a structural system of demand, supply and price-transmission equations, estimated using the generalised method of moments. We find evidence of downstream market power by retailers (toward final consumers) for PR and GP, but no evidence of upstream market power (toward processors/ripeners).
