These two facts have given rise to the prominence that renewable energy, particularly solar photovoltaic technology, has enjoyed in recent years, supported by a favorable regulatory framework. Currently, the Spanish Government is providing new ways in energy policy to enhance and accelerate the development of low-power photovoltaic generation facilities for self-consumption by introducing energy policies for feed-in payments of surplus electricity. Such facilities are an example of distributed electrical generation with important benefits for the environment and the rest of the electrical system because, when properly managed, they can help improve the system's stability and reduce overall losses. By analyzing household demand and solar photovoltaic energy resources, the profitability of such facilities is considered in this article, taking into account the technical and economic impact of storage systems and proposing models for feed-in payments of surplus electricity, in an attempt to assess whether this method of electricity generation versus the method of conventionally supplied power from a grid at a regulated tariff can rival each other economically, in terms of parity.

This work analyzes the public administration's role in energy and climate policies by assessing carbon-lowering measures for properties and services managed directly by local governments in central Italy. Both short- and long-term schemes were considered in the analysis of local authority energy strategies. The MARKAL-TIMES energy model was applied to long-term energy planning to assess the effect of low-carbon initiatives on public-sector energy consumption up to 2030. Two energy scenarios were built, i.e. a Business As Usual (BAU) scenario based on current or soon-to-be-adopted national policies, and an Exemplary Public Scenario (EPS) including some further virtuous local policies suggested by local authorities. Our results show that a 20% primary energy reduction can be achieved with respect to the baseline year by means of short-term energy policies (5-year time span), while a primary energy saving of about 30% can be reached with longer-term energy policies (25-year time span), even after taking the increase in energy demand into account. This work goes to show the part that local governments can play in energy policy and their contribution to the achievement of climate goals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, energy autonomy is first ensured on the basis of an appropriate sizing methodology, while accordingly, by developing a calculation algorithm for the estimation of the LC energy content of such energy autonomous systems, minimum LC embodied energy configurations are eventually obtained. On top of that, three representative areas are examined so as to investigate the influence of the local wind and solar potential. According to the results, the sustainable character of both RES-based solutions is designated, especially when comparison with the conventional diesel-engine solution is carried out.

The general trends of CO2 emissions from four passenger transport modes are estimated by both the distance-based and fuel-based methods. The results suggest that CO2 emissions from road transport represented the leading source of passenger transport CO2 emissions in China. Moreover, they have continued to grow rapidly. Air transport was the second largest contributor since 1998. Emissions from rail and water transport have remained relatively stable with lower emission intensity. At the provincial level, great regional disparity was noticeable, especially in road transport. Moreover, the decomposition analysis shows that income growth was the principal factor leading to the growth of passenger transport CO2 emissions in China for both the 1949-1979 and 1980-2009 periods. The second most important factor was increased transport intensity and modal shifts for the former and the latter period, respectively. The main factor contributed to emission reduction was the lower emission intensity supported by policies, although the effect was weak. In the future, more policies to encourage modal shifts toward sustainable transport modes and travel reduction should be encouraged. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Loo, Becky P.

The locations represent a comprehensive set of the two essential parameters for the economic viability of PV-solar irradiation and local electricity tariffs. Levelized electricity costs (LEC) for PV generation and net present values (NPV) for a specific PV system are presented. The analysis comprises three different interest rate scenarios reflecting different conditions for capital acquisition to finance the generators; subsidized, mature market and country-specific risk-adjusted interest. In the NPV analysis, revenue flow is modeled by the sale of PV electricity at current residential tariffs assuming net metering. Using subsidized interest rates, the analysis shows that solar PV electricity is already competitive in Brazil, while in the country-specific risk-adjusted rate, the declining, but still high capital costs of PV make it economically unfeasible. At a mature market interest rate, PV competitiveness is largely dependent on the residential tariff. Economic competitiveness in this scenario is given for locations with high residential tariffs. We demonstrate the high potential of distributed generation with photovoltaic installations in Brazil, and show that under certain conditions, grid-connected PV can be economically competitive in a developing country.

The results show that the per capita effective heat is 323.3, 282.8, 250.0 and 123.6 kgce in the provincial capital, medium-sized cities, county towns and rural areas, respectively. The energy ladder feature is obvious. Using 719 sample data, the multiple regression analysis was conducted between per capita effective heat and two independent variables including per capita income and the attributes of energy used, the parameter estimation of the cross-quadratic model produced more significant effects. The three-dimensional graph clearly shows the differences in living standards and survival status between urban and rural households. High-income residents in urban areas consume more high-quality energy, they enjoy an affluent lifestyle. While low-income households in rural areas obtain less effective heat, and use poor quality fuels, they are still at the level of basic survival. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Weighting factors are chosen to represent incentives and penalties by assigning value to the impacts. With no other incentives, switchgrass market prices of at least $51 and $58/dton would be needed in order to make a profitable switch from corn/Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands and cotton, respectively. At a mid-range offering of $50/dton, feasible carbon credit prices of $3/ $8/ $23 per metric tonne CO(2)e would incentivize conversion from corn, CRP, or cotton, respectively.

In this paper we assess a chosen set of biomass-based chains in terms of energy and GHG emissions using the innovative concept of the standardization transport model (STM).

To insure the security of the coal supply, China has begun to build regional strategic coal reserves at some locations, but transportation is still the fundamental way to guaranty supply security. Here, we study China's coal transportation quantitatively with a linear programming method that analyses the direction and volume of China's coal flows with the prerequisite that each province's supply and demand balance is guaranteed. First, we analyse the optimal coal transportation for the status quo coal supply and demand given the bottleneck effects that the Daqin Railway has on China's coal flow; second, we analyse the influence of future shifts in the coal supply zone in the future, finding that China's coal flows will also change, which will pressure China to construct railways and ports; and finally, we analyse the possibility of exploiting Yangtze River capacity for coal transportation.

We use an assessment framework to identify the characteristics of policies that affect their likelihood of introduction and alteration during the policy development process. We conclude that this mix of flagship and flotilla policies is at least in part an inevitable consequence of incumbent stakeholder pressure that results in flagship policies being blocked or weakened by those opposing action, and if weakened sufficiently, possibly blocked by those seeking stronger action. In contrast, smaller flotilla policies can be designed to have less impact on large incumbents and/or be of benefit to a different group of stakeholders who then provide political support. As a result, flotilla policies are likely to remain as key elements of the climate policy mix, to reduce emissions beyond those achieved by flagship policies, and to reduce emissions where no flagship policies exist. These findings have two consequences for policy design: the need to ensure that flagship policies do not reduce the effectiveness of flotilla policies, and that flagship policies are capable of being enhanced over time.

Choi's Lagrange multiplier (LM) test has excellent robustness properties but is not generally as powerful as the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test. As an analytical framework for fat tails, we suggest local-to-finite variance asymptotics, based on a representation of the process as a weighted sum of a finite variance process and an infinite variance process, where the weights depend on the sample size and a constant. The sensitivity of the asymptotic distribution of a test to the weighting constant is a good indicator of its robustness to fat tails.

The results confirm the importance of payback time and investment costs as the main determining factors in deciding whether to invest in energy efficiency. Such investment recommendations are frequently not implemented even though they apparently entail major advantages and give rise to considerable energy savings. The data show results which are compatible with a series of elementary valuation processes (limited to availability of information), far removed from other, more academically ambitious methods such as Net Present Value (NPV) and the Real Options (RO) method. The paper analyses the impact of the primary resource streams (Electricity, Natural Gas, Other Energy, Waste and Others), physical situation of firms in line with their geographical locations in different US states, and changes over time from 1984 to 2009. EE investment decisions are analysed here using Probit models whose parameters are calibrated on the basis of the information held in the Industrial Assessment Centres (IAC) database. The results suggest various ideas to improve policies for promoting investment in EE, specially the IAC programme. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The upgrade and development of the system necessitate the adoption of a comprehensive energy policy that introduces solutions to a diversity of problems addressing the technical, financial, administrative and governance aspects of the system. In this paper, an energy policy for Lebanon is proposed and evaluated based on integration between energy modeling and financial modeling. The paper utilizes the Load Modification Technique (LMT) as a probabilistic tool to assess the impact of policy implementation on energy production, overall cost, technical/commercial losses and reliability. Scenarios reflecting implementation of policy projects are assessed and their impacts are compared with business-as-usual scenarios which assume no new investment is to take place in the sector. Conclusions are drawn on the usefulness of the proposed evaluation methodology and the effectiveness of the adopted energy policy for Lebanon and other developing countries suffering from similar power system problems.

The quantile regression results indicate that the rebound effect varies with the distribution of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), ranging between 0.11 and 0.19. Road network density and population density also play an important role in determining travel demand. Regression results indicate that travelers living in areas with higher road network density travel more miles although this positive impact consistently declines along the VMT distribution. Travelers living in areas with population density of at most 3000 persons per square miles travel more miles than those living in higher density areas. The quantile regression results also indicate that the impact of income is positive but declines consistently along the VMT distribution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Market-based incentives, including state-level REC markets and international carbon markets have been proposed as solutions to increase renewable energy investment. In this paper we introduce and formulate a carbon revenue bond, a financing tool to complement environmental credit markets to encourage renewable energy investment. To illustrate its use, we value the bond by predicting future revenue using stochastic processes after analyzing historical price data. Three illustrative examples are presented for renewable energy development in three different markets: Europe, Australia and New Jersey.

We compare light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and fluorescents that are powered by either a central DC power supply or traditional AC grid electricity, with and without solar photovoltaics (PV) and battery back-up. Using DOE performance targets for LEDs and solar PV, we find that by 2012 LEDs have the lowest levelized annualized cost (LAC). If a DC voltage standard were developed, so that each LED fixture's driver could be eliminated, LACs could decrease, on average, by 5% compared to AC LEDs with a driver in each fixture. DC circuits in grid-connected PV-powered LED lighting systems can lower the total unsubsidized capital costs by 4-21% and LACs by 2-21% compared to AC grid-connected PV LEDs. Grid-connected PV LEDs may match the LAC of grid-powered fluorescents by 2013. This outcome depends more on manufacturers' ability to produce LEDs that follow DOE's lamp production cost and efficacy targets, than on reducing power electronics costs for DC building circuits and voltage standardization. Further work is needed to better understand potential safety risks with DC distribution and to remove design, installation, permitting, and regulatory barriers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, reserve data for coal and other energy resources should be directly comparable so that decision-makers can easily understand the relationship among available resources. Long-term policy and investment choices regarding energy security, the environment, and resource allocation depend on accurate information, but existing and easily available data on the magnitude of geologically, environmentally, economically, socially, and legally accessible coal reserves are of insufficient quality to guide such decisions. Even still, these data are often presented for use in policy and energy analysis. Currently, coal reserves are overstated relative to competitor energy resource reserves, in part because coal reporting standards have historically been more liberal and vague than standards for resources like natural gas. Overstating the marketable coal resource could lead to inefficient allocation of limited capital investment that can be difficult to reverse. US government bodies like the Energy Information Administration, United States Geological Survey, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Bureau of Land Management can help correct deficiencies by clarifying standards and collecting data that are relevant for decision-makers, such as energy-based reserve information.

We calculate that the embodied GHG content of the current UK food supply is 7.4 kg CO(2)e person(-1) day(-1), or 2.7 t CO(2)e person(-1) y(-1). This gives total food-related GHG emissions of 167 Mt CO(2)e (1 Mt=10(6) metric tonnes; CO(2)e being the mass of CO2 that would have the same global warming potential, when measured over 100 years, as a given mixture of greenhouse gases) for the entire UK population in 2009. This is 27% of total direct GHG emissions in the UK, or 19% of total GHG emissions from the UK, including those embodied in goods produced abroad. We calculate that potential GHG savings of 22% and 26% can be made by changing from the current UK-average diet to a vegetarian or vegan diet, respectively. Taking the average GHG saving from six vegetarian or vegan dietary scenarios compared with the current UK-average diet gives a potential national GHG saving of 40 Mt CO(2)e y(-1). This is equivalent to a 50% reduction in current exhaust pipe emissions from the entire UK passenger car fleet. Hence realistic choices about diet can make substantial differences to embodied GHG emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Berners-Lee, M.; Hoolohan, C.; Cammack, H.; Hewitt, C.

This paper aims at providing an insight into the business case of this technology in a case study for Germany. The estimated Return on Investment (ROI) of a public fast charging station constitutes the main contribution. Potential users and organization structures are investigated as well as different tariff types. According to the estimations, the current market outlook seems too uncertain for triggering a large-scale roll-out of fast charging infrastructure. Approximations suggest that investment is hardly profitable at low EV adoption rates, unless investment cost can be severely lowered. Besides competition with alternative charging solutions, the general EV adoption rate is detected as being a main risk factor for investment in public charging infrastructure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Third-party PV companies can reduce or eliminate up-front adoption costs, reduce technology risk and complexity by monitoring system performance, and can repackage the PV value proposition by showing cost savings in the first month of ownership rather than payback times on the order of a decade. We find that the entrance of third-party business models in southern California residential PV markets has enticed a new demographic to adopt PV systems that is more highly correlated to younger, less affluent, and less educated populations than the demographics correlated to purchasing PV systems. By enticing new demographics to adopt PV, we find that third-party PV products are likely increasing total PV demand rather than gaining market share entirely at the expense of existing customer owned PV demand. We also find that mean population demographics are good predictors of third-party and customer owned PV adoption, and mean voting trends on California carbon policy (Proposition 23) are poor predictors of PV adoption.

This paper presents a framework that attempts to meet this objective by combining the International Energy Agency's definition of energy security with structured systems analysis techniques to create three energy security indicators and a process-flow energy systems model. The framework is applicable to those energy systems which can be described in terms of processes converting or transporting flows of energy to meet the energy-demand flows from downstream processes. Each process affects the environment and is subject to jurisdictional policies. The framework can be employed to capture the evolution of energy security in an energy system by analyzing the results of indicator-specific metrics applied to the energy, demand, and environment flows associated with the system's constituent processes.

Because fuel costs are the main part of fuel-consumed power generation costs and fossil resource costs are highly subsidized in Iran, renewable energies such as wind power have yet to be fully developed. This analysis sets out to evaluate the total generating costs of wind power and conventional power plants in Iran. A levelized cost approach was conducted that included investment costs, O&M costs, fuel costs and external costs of emissions for each type of technology. Comparison of cost assessments of power generation show that by taking into account global fuel prices and incorporating air pollutant externalities, wind power can be as competitive as conventional power plants. This paper suggests that a subsidies targeting law would significantly affect the development of the Iranian wind power industry in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

There have been several reviews of potential technological, economic, social, or public barriers and solutions to renewable energy investment. Although important, there is also need for multi-dimensional analyses of these barriers and identification of the most significant underlying barriers if viable solutions are to be developed. In this paper we apply a theoretical framework to examine stakeholder's perceptions and understanding of the barriers to wind energy development in Saskatchewan, Canada. We identify and examine the most significant underlying barriers to investment in renewable energy and the interactions between those barriers. Results show a number of perceived barriers to wind energy investment, however, these barriers can be explained in large part by knowledge barriers, if not disagreement over whether the current level of investment in wind energy is sufficient. We show that barriers to renewable energy cannot be explained solely by technological, social, political, or economic factors in isolation, and that a multidimensional approach, identifying and explaining the underlying sources of these barriers, is necessary to develop viable solutions.

They help forecast increases in fuel consumption as countries get richer, they help develop appropriate tax policies to curtail consumption, help determine how the transport fuel mix might evolve, and show the price response to a fuel disruption. Given their usefulness, it is understandable why hundreds of studies have focused on measuring such elasticities for gasoline and diesel fuel consumption. In this paper, I focus my attention on price and income elasticities in the existing studies to see what can be learned from them. I summarize the elasticities from these historical studies. I use statistical analysis to investigate whether income and price elasticities seem to be constant across countries with different incomes and prices. Although income and price elasticities for gasoline and diesel fuel are not found to be the same at high and low incomes and at high and low prices, patterns emerge that allow me to develop suggested price and income elasticities for gasoline and diesel demand for over one hundred countries. I adjust these elasticities for recent fuel mix policies, and suggest an agenda of future research topics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Failure of phase-I of National Biodiesel Mission and likely failure of phase-II requires critical analysis of policy frameworks related to its long term sustainability. Indian biofuel promotion policies like Biodiesel Purchase Policy and National Biofuel Policy have failed to yield any visible results. No tangible ground work is visible as of now to ensure success of various government plans and policies related to adoption of jatropha biodiesel. It is clearly evident that some serious bottlenecks are delaying the adoption of jatropha biodiesel. Present work identifies important policy bottlenecks like availability of land, non-remunerative pricing policy and state fear relating to loss of revenue in the case of zero duty regimes.

In this setup, we show that the quasi-option value may cause some conceptual difficulties. In case of asymmetric information, decentralized investment decisions fail to induce first-best allocations. Therefore a regulator may not be able to exercise the option to delay the decision to develop. We also show that information-induced inefficiency may arise in a game situation and that under certain assumptions inefficiency can be eliminated by sending asymmetric information to the players, even when the regulator faces informational constraints. Our model is potentially applicable to various global environmental problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies suggest that generation of electricity from concentrated solar power in North African countries and its transmission to Europe could provide European and North African partners with low-carbon electricity. The private capital will be likely required to achieve the scale of new investment and yet the North African region experience difficulties with sustaining high levels of foreign direct investment from the private sector. The literature identifies a number of risks as barriers to investment, and we examine these in the particular context of renewable energy development. We conducted three stages of interviews with stakeholders to learn their perceptions of the risks most likely to affect renewable energy projects. Three class of risks regulatory, political, and force majeure (which includes terrorism) stand out as being of high concern. Of these, regulatory risks are perceived as being the most consequential, and the most likely to occur. This suggests that attention to building the capacities of North African countries to develop, implement, and enforce sound regulations in a transparent manner could be an important step in promoting renewable energy cooperation with Europe.

We propose an omnibus test based on the kernel method that performs against a sequence of directional nonparametric alternatives as if there was only one regressor whatever the number of regressors. This test can be viewed as a smooth version of the integrated conditional moment test of Bierens. Qualitative information can be easily incorporated into the procedure to enhance power. In an extensive comparative simulation study, we find that our test is not very sensitive to the smoothing parameter and performs well in multidimensional settings.

From today's perspective, its contribution to the sustainment of small and medium-sized farms in the days before mass mechanization is beyond any doubt. However, after a long process of decline beginning in the 1950's, the fruit and the seed of the carob tree regained importance as a raw material for the production of quality food additives, such as locust bean gum or E-410. The Balearic Islands, which historically have been one of the main carob producers in the world, have established themselves in the 1930's as the leading region in the development of industrial techniques for the processing. of carobs. Moreover, Majorcan companies pioneered the concentration of agricultural production. This increased research and favoured innovations, as well as it helped the cartelization of this sector. Nowadays, carob still remains highly relevant in Majorca and on international markets.","Univ Illes Balears, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"de Dios, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Palma De Mallorca, Spain.",,"de Dios, Ramon Molina/AAA-1926-2019",,,,,,73,1,1,0,12,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Local - if possible: how the spatial networking of economic relations amongst farm enterprises aids small town survival in rural Australia, Regional Studies. Over recent decades, the tendency in developed countries has been the consolidation of farms into fewer and larger units, and a shifting of economic functions from smaller to larger population settlements. This paper uses data from face-to-face interviews with 115 Australian farmers in agriculture-dependent regions to investigate how the spatial pattern of farm expenditure affects these processes. It is concluded that in these spatial contexts, stability, attachment, and reliance on 'the local' remain vital components in farm-town economic links, notwithstanding substantial adaptation by farmers to restructured economic and community circumstances. Such expenditures help sustain small towns, thus tempering judgements on rural decline.","[Pritchard, Bill; Mcmanus, Phil] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia; [Argent, Neil; Sorensen, Anthony; Walmsley, Jim] Univ New England, Sch Behav Cognit & Social Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Baum, Scott] Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Bourke, Lisa] Univ Melbourne, Rural Hlth Acad Ctr, Shepparton, Vic 3632, Australia; [Martin, John] La Trobe Univ, Ctr Sustainable Reg Commun, Bendigo, Vic 3552, Australia",University of Sydney; University of New England; Griffith University; University of Melbourne; La Trobe University,"Pritchard, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Madsen Bldg, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.",bill.pritchard@sydney.edu.au; nargent@une.edu.au; s.baum@griffith.edu.au; bourke@unimelb.edu.au; john.martin@latrobe.edu.au; phil.mcmanus@sydney.edu.au; tony.sorensen@une.edu.au; dwalmsle@une.edu.au,,"Baum, Scott/0000-0003-1711-2087; McManus, Phil/0000-0002-3655-3841; Bourke, Lisa/0000-0003-0411-6193; Sorensen, Anthony/0000-0003-2457-3770; Pritchard, Bill/0000-0001-7506-2095; Argent, Neil/0000-0002-4005-5837",,,,,61,26,30,2,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The tradeoff between risk and return in the renewable energy sector is, however, precarious. Renewable energy companies are often among the riskiest types of companies to invest in and for this reason it is necessary to have a good understanding of the risk factors. This paper uses a variable beta model to investigate the determinants of renewable energy company risk. The empirical results show that company sales growth has a negative impact on company risk while oil price increases have a positive impact on company risk. When oil price returns are positive and moderate, increases in sales growth can offset the impact of oil price returns and this leads to lower systematic risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The autoregressive distributed lag bounds testing approach to cointegration and Granger causality tests is employed for the analysis. The result confirms the existence of long-run relationship among energy consumption, economic growth, financial development, industrialization and urbanization in Tunisia. Long-run bidirectional causalities are found between financial development and energy consumption, financial development and industrialization, and industrialization and energy consumption. Hence, sound and developed financial system that can attract investors, boost the stock market and improve the efficiency of economic activities should be encouraged in the country. Nevertheless, promoting industrialization and urbanization can never be left out from the process of development.

For buildings in Hong Kong, however, GHG reporting remains entirely voluntary even though the government has issued a set of guidelines to facilitate building owners and managers to quantify GHG emissions from buildings. Aimed at understanding stakeholders' opinions on whether, and to what extent, the GHG reporting should be made mandatory, a study involving a questionnaire survey was carried out. Analysis of the opinions revealed that the majority supported making the reporting mandatory for office, hotel/hostel, and industrial buildings. Generally more support was received from those who were highly experienced, employees of non-government public organisations, academics/researchers, or qualified carbon/energy auditors. Their agreement on requiring reporting of activities under scopes I and 2 of the GHG Protocol was stronger than that for the scope 3 activities. Reporting of paper waste disposal attracted the weakest support. The reasons for not supporting the mandatory policy, including resource constraint and financial and knowledge barriers that confront the stakeholders, were identified. The findings of this study serve as reference for energy policy makers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A panel study of the Stockholm congestion tax,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ethanol cars; Congestion tax; Natural experiment,PROPENSITY SCORE; ACCEPTABILITY; DETERMINANTS; ATTITUDES; VEHICLES; DEMAND; IMPACT,"Policymakers have made several attempts to introduce local and national policies to reduce CO2 emissions and stimulate the consumer adoption of alternative fuel vehicles (ethanol/E85 cars). The purpose of this paper is to analyze how a local policy measure impacts the composition of the car fleet over time. More specifically, we take advantage of the natural experiment setting caused by the introduction of the Stockholm congestion tax (2006) to analyze how the tax affected purchases of ethanol cars that were exempted from the tax. To estimate effects, we employ a Difference-in-differences methodology. By using a comprehensive database of the car fleet and car owners, sociodemographic and geographic factors are analyzed, which is unique in the existing literature. Our results suggest that the congestion tax had a significant impact on ethanol car purchases although the effect fades away over time. Furthermore, there is a positive relationship between the level of education and ethanol car purchases. Previous adoption of an ethanol car is found to be the strongest predictor of ethanol car purchases. Finally, data indicate that Stockholmers substantially increased purchases of ethanol cars half a year before the introduction of the congestion tax, which we refer to as an anticipation effect.

We also examine the effect of private information on lobbying activity and social welfare under these two instruments. It is found that private information might improve social welfare under taxes when the government has little concern for social welfare, whereas private information does not improve social welfare under quotas. Quotas are generally socially preferred when the slope of marginal abatement costs is steeper than that of marginal damage or when the government does not concern itself with social welfare. However, private information reduces the comparative disadvantage of taxes compared to quotas when the government has little concern for social welfare. Finally, the results of numerical examples suggest that quotas are employed rather than taxes if the difference in natural emission levels between high- and low-cost industries is large.

Through a comprehensive and detailed overview of China's carbon mitigation strategies, this paper presents China's carbon mitigation achievements and strategies, including adjustment to the industrial structure, saving energy, optimizing energy structure, increasing forest carbon sinks, building foundational capacity, innovating technologies and practicing mitigation efforts in localities and sectors. Having been in place for some years already, the results of many of these measures and policies are now plateauing. China is facing challenges including inevitable emissions growth, shrinking of mitigation potential from technological progress, difficulty in further adjusting the industrial structure and economic development mode, continued dominance of coal in the energy mix, local governments' reluctance to adopt measures to reduce carbon emissions, etc. Through policy diagnosis it is found that the root causes of these problems and challenges are the facts that policy-making is done primarily on the production side and there is an absence of co-benefits in the decision-making process. Therefore, it is recommended that translating mitigation targets to the consumption level and mainstreaming mitigations' co-benefits into decision-making processes are needed to quickly enhance the results of mitigation work in China.

However there is an Achilles heel to today's energy and technology relationship; namely a precarious intimacy between energy and the fiscal, social, and technical systems it supports. Recently, widespread and persistent disruptions in energy systems have highlighted the extent of this dependence and the vulnerability of increasingly optimized systems to changing conditions. Resilience is an emerging concept that offers to reconcile considerations of performance under dynamic environments and across multiple time frames by supplementing traditionally static system performance measures to consider behaviors under changing conditions and complex interactions among physical, information and human domains. This paper identifies metrics useful to implement guidance for energy-related planning, design, investment, and operation. Recommendations are presented using a matrix format to provide a structured and comprehensive framework of metrics relevant to a system's energy resilience. The study synthesizes previously proposed metrics and emergent resilience literature to provide a multidimensional model intended for use by leaders and practitioners as they transform our energy posture from one of stasis and reaction to one that is proactive and which fosters sustainable growth.

(J Ind Econ 40:147-156, 1992) to a multi-regional framework. It is assumed that some consumers are loyal to their respective regional firms, while others prefer the nationwide firm's product. A third type of consumers is sensitive to price. With simultaneous price-setting, it is profitable to undercut or to set the consumers' reservation price depending on the relative group sizes. With each type of leader-follower game, all firms set the reservation price. In this case, the most profitable scenario for the nationwide firm is to act as a price follower. The model is illustrated by the Austrian newspaper industry, represented by a nationwide firm that enjoys a national market share of over 50 per cent but nevertheless faces strong competition from regional producers in most regional markets. Actual price-setting behaviour is documented and interpreted for the observation period 1979-2003. It is shown that (i) the regional firms' prices were identical to the nationwide firm's most of the time, (ii) the nationwide firm almost always acted as a price follower, and (iii) a particular market entrant's aggressive undercutting was an inept strategy.","WU Vienna, Inst Econ Geog & GISci, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",,"Sardadvar, S (通讯作者)，WU Vienna, Inst Econ Geog & GISci, Welthandelspl 1-D4-3-268, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",sascha.sardadvar@wu.ac.at,,"Sardadvar, Sascha/0000-0001-6402-4405",,,,,20,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, recent study showed that SNG will not accomplish the task of simultaneous energy conservation and CO2 reduction. In this paper, life cycle costing is made for SNG use in three main applications in residential sector: heating, household use, and public transport. Comparisons are conducted between SNG and coal, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), diesel, and methanol. The results show that SNG is a competitive option only for household use. The use of SNG for heating boilers or city buses is not as cost-effective as expected. The biggest shortcoming of SNG is the large amount of pollutants generated in the production stage. At the moment, the use of SNG is promoted by the government. However, as shown in this paper, one can expect a transfer of pollution from the urban areas to the regions where SNG is produced. Therefore, it is suggested that well-balanced set of environmental damage-compensating policies should be introduced to compensate the environmental losses in the SNG-producing regions.

It contributes to the literature on shrinkage estimation and factor models by extending the conventional bridge estimator from a single equation to a large panel context. The proposed estimator can consistently estimate the factor loadings of relevant factors and shrink the loadings of irrelevant factors to zero with a probability approaching one. Hence, it provides a consistent estimate for the number of factors. We also propose an algorithm for the new estimator; Monte Carlo experiments show that our algorithm converges reasonably fast and that our estimator has very good performance in small samples.

We examine the impact of the JNNSM DCR on the utilization of domestic and domestic crystalline silicon modules. Using a plant-level database of approximately 250 plants, we show that the first, and weaker, version of the policy accomplished its intention of promoting domestic crystalline silicon modules. However, the second, and stricter, version of the policy has not been as effective: it appears to have promoted the use of foreign thin film modules instead. This analysis shows that the tightening Of the DCR was associated with leakage to foreign thin film modules. This suggests that OCR policies need to be comprehensive in scope to ensure that they achieve a goal of using only domestic content; however, policymakers should appropriately assess the welfare impacts of such restrictions.

After controlling for individual characteristics and industrial structure, some regional differences persist. These are largely for men and are quantitatively small.

It is shown that the marginal value-fecundity relationship of the spawning population, comprising young and old fish, is crucial for the optimal fishing composition. If the value-fecundity ratio is higher for the old spawning population, this age-class should be harvested more aggressively than the young spawning population, and vice versa. It is also shown that changes in prices and interest rate have similar as well as different effects than in the standard fishing biomass model. Small changes in the relative price for the harvestable age classes could either increase or reduce the optimal harvest intensity, or have no effect. While a higher interest rate tends to increase fishing, there also exist intervals of the interest rate in which the optimal harvest program is not affected by changes in the interest rate.

In order to analyze the reactions of different industries to oil price shocks, we focused on four fundamental industries: grains, metals, petrochemicals and oil fats. We separated the oil price shocks into two parts, positive and negative parts, to investigate how commodity markets react when oil prices go up and down. We further studied the extreme price movements, called jumps, existing in the oil markets and how jump behavior has affected China's commodity markets. Our results suggest that asymmetric effects of oil price shocks did exist in the four markets and the negative oil price shocks had stronger influences on the four markets in China. The petrochemicals market suffered most from the oil price shocks, and the grains market was least sensitive to the shocks. When jumps occurred in the crude oil market, the four commodity markets would be affected differently. The oil fats market and petrochemicals market tended to overreact to jumps.

CO2 emission from urban central heating, which has an average annual growth rate of 10.3%, is responsible for 4.4% of China's total CO2 emission. The current policy for improving urban central heating focuses on replacing coal with natural gas. This paper analyzes the existing situation and problems pertaining to urban heating, and evaluates the potential for reducing energy consumption and CO2 emission by heat pump heating. The results show that the current policy of replacing coal with natural gas for urban central heating decreases energy consumption and CO2 emission by 16.6% and 63.5%, respectively. On the other hand, replacing coal-based urban central heating with heat pump heating is capable of decreasing energy consumption and CO2 emission by 57.6% and 81.4%, respectively. Replacing both urban central and decentralized heating with heat pump heating can lead to 67.7% and 85.8% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emission, respectively. The decreases in CO2 emission will account for 24.5% of China's target to reduce total CO2 emission by 2020. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The results presented in this study address the demand for environmental support of the economy of Xilinguole League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as well as the value of its natural and human-made capital. The results show that the reliance of the economy of Xilinguole League on local and imported non-renewable resources (coal and minerals) decreases both the environmental and economic sustainability of the area. Emergy-based performance indicators of the Xilinguole League economy show a low sustainability index (ESI=0.79), though it is higher than for the Chinese economy as a whole (ESI=0.47), as well as a low percentage of renewable resources being used (%REN=0.16, though this is higher than for all of China, 0.09). In contrast, the grassland-based livestock sector shows a higher renewability index (%REN=0.67) and sustainability (ESI=9.61). The emergy exchange ratios (exported emergy/imported emergy) are calculated to be 4.38 for the livestock system and 4.28 for the Xilinguole economy, which is much higher than the value of 1.74 for the overall Chinese economy, indicating uncompensated overexploitation of local systems (meat and coal, respectively). Intensified coal exploitation and intensive cattle grazing are discussed to support the decision-making process for setting local energy policy and ecological compensation. It is proposed that conservation of coal resources (avoiding misuse and moderating excess extraction and trade) and protection of natural grassland capital are more advantageous in emergy terms than the blind pursuit of accelerated, economic growth.

The panel co-integration tests reveal that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship among GDP, capital formation, labor force, renewable/nuclear, and fossil fuel energy consumption. The panel causality results indicate that (1) there is a positive unidirectional short-run causality from fossil fuel energy consumption to economic growth with a bidirectional long-run causality; (2) there is a unidirectional long-run causality from renewable energy consumption to economic growth with positive bidirectional short-run causality, and a long-run causality from renewable to fossil fuel energy consumption with negative short-run feedback effects; and (3) there is a bidirectional long-run causality between nuclear energy consumption and economic growth and a long-run causality from fossil fuel energy consumption to nuclear energy consumption with positive short-run feedback effects. These suggest that MIST countries should be energy-dependent economies and that energy conservation policies may depress their economic development. However, developing renewable and nuclear energy is a viable solution for addressing energy security and climate change issues, and creating clean and fossil fuel energy partnerships could enhance a sustainable energy economy.

Four scenarios were designed assuming different shares of energy sources in a 2030 timeframe. Applying a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, scenarios were assessed in terms of cumulative non-renewable energy (NRE) consumption, global warming potential (GWP), terrestrial acidification potential (TAP), and particulate matter formation (PMF). Additionally electricity generation costs were evaluated. Results demonstrate that the current dependence on fossil fuel is unfeasible in the long run, as it results in 14% higher NRE consumption, an increase of 32% on GHG emissions, 29% on TAP and 34% on PMF, and 9% higher cost than the baseline scenario under pre-Fukushima conditions. On the other hand, a share of up to 27% of renewable energies is technically possible and would result in a 34% reduction of NRE consumption, 29% decrease of GHG emissions, and contribute to the mitigation of 24% of TAP and PMF impacts, at minor increase of levelized costs. Increasing the share of renewables and phasing-out thermal power would therefore increase the resilience of the Japanese economy toward external oil markets, cope with environmental protection priorities, while promoting economic development.

We assess the economic and environmental impacts of changing the share of electricity generated by nuclear power and varying the mid-term GHG targets. The quantitative approach we use is based on the global macro-econometric E3MG model. Our analysis reveals that the cost of denuclearisation to Japanese GDP is close to zero, and for employment the impact is slightly positive. Our results also show a double-dividend effect if (revenue-neutral) carbon taxes are levied in order to meet the GHG reduction targets, and this double-dividend effect is largest in the scenarios without nuclear power. However, our analysis suggests that a very high carbon tax rate would have to be imposed in order to achieve a 25% reduction in GHG emissions in 2020 (compared to 1990 levels) while simultaneously phasing out nuclear power.

A deficient expansion of the transmission grid prevents the realization of the benefits in terms of efficiency associated with market mechanisms. Consequently, it is essential to provide clear investment policies and economic signals to attract timely and efficient. transmission investments in order to develop the system at minimum cost meeting the requirements of generators and consumers, while keeping adequate levels of service quality and reliability. This paper proposes a modern tool of economic evaluation based on real options analysis that provides the regulator the ability to assess various incentives that would lead transmission investors to make efficient decisions in highly uncertain environments. Real options properly values partially irreversible investment decisions, such as to defer, modify or abandon an investment project in response to the arrival of new information or as uncertainties are resolved. Decisions are evaluated from the point of view of a transmission investor trying to maximize its own profits in the time period set to recover the capital invested. The results allow the study of the behavior of transmission investors regarding their decision making when they have the possibility to manage the option to defer, under different regulatory schemes that encourage the expansion of the transmission system.

Within this context, the paper focuses on the energy savings that may occur when using electrochromic (EC) windows, an interesting emerging technology alternative to shading devices to control solar gain in buildings located in Mediterranean climates. The EC windows technology is briefly presented and the optical properties adjustments of the glasses are discussed according to the operated range. The EC window dynamic behavior and the different control strategies are modeled and implemented in the ESP-r building simulation program. The EC window impact in the energy needs for heating and cooling is studied, considering different ambient parameters (exterior dry bulb temperature, interior dry bulb temperature and incident radiation) and set points for the EC control. A comparison of several windows solutions (single, double-glazing and EC windows), the type of building, internal gains from occupancy, lighting and equipment and the orientation of windows are considered for discussion through the analysis of the energy needs for heating and cooling. It is concluded that for this climate the best positive results are obtained when the EC are used in the west facade. For the south facade the results show no significant advantages in using EC windows. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Tavares, P.

We introduce a property, invariance to variate order, that assures estimation is not impacted by a simple reordering of the variates in the system. Simulation results using realized covariances show smaller mean absolute errors (MAE) and root mean square errors (RMSE) for every element of the covariance matrix relative to a comparably specified BEKK model with own information instruments. We also find a smaller mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) for the entire covariance matrix.

New finance for America's cities, Regional Studies. In the past, investment in cities' built environment was primarily carried out by government, with public good as the primary motivation. But governments are increasingly struggling to find the available capital required for public financing of cities' investment needs. This paper suggests that there are new sources of finance available for investment in America's cities. Retirement savings are being used to invest in these cities' future growth. While such investment generates positive ancillary benefits for the cities, it is not the primary purpose of this capital. The motivation for large institutional investors including pension funds and sovereign-wealth funds is the risk-adjusted rate of return. This private profit-driven motivation leads to different investment decision-making than was found in the past when public good was the primary driver.","[Hebb, Tessa] Carleton Univ, Carleton Ctr Community Innovat, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Sharma, Rajiv] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",Carleton University; University of Oxford,"Hebb, T (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Carleton Ctr Community Innovat, DT 2125,1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",thebb@attglobal.net; rajiv.sharma@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,61,18,20,1,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

They disagreed over how to protect a space for future second-generation biofuels, which were expected to overcome harm from first-generation biofuels. The UK government defended rising targets for available biofuels as a necessary stimulus for 'industry to help fulfil the UK's EU obligations and eventually develop second-generation biofuels. By contrast, Parliamentary Select Committees opposed biofuel targets on grounds that these would instead lock-in first-generation biofuels, thus delaying or pre-empting second-generation biofuels. Those disagreements can be explained by different institutional responsibilities and reputational stakes towards 'promise-requirement cycles', whereby techno-optimistic promises generate future requirements for the actors involved. The UK government's stance illustrates a 'policy-promise lock-in', a dilemma whereby promised support is a requirement for credibility towards technology innovators and thus technoscientific development but may delay the redirection of support from incumbent to preferable emerging technologies. Thus the sociology of expectations - previously applied to technological expectations from technology innovators - can be extended to analyse public authorities.

This study proposes a coherent two-step analytical procedure for modelling the efficiency performance of regional innovation systems and its determinants. The first step of the procedure involves measuring efficiency associated with a sophisticated network data envelopment analysis model, which accounts for the linkages between the two disaggregated sub-processes, namely an upstream technological creation process (TCrP) and a downstream technological commercialisation process (TCoP), during a technological innovation process (TIP). The procedure simultaneously deals with overall TIP efficiency as well as the two component TCrP and TCoP efficiencies in a united framework. In the second step of the procedure, the paper examines the effects of policy-oriented environmental factors on the respective efficiency scores of the three processes (TIP, TCrP, and TCoP) associated with a flexible partial least squares regression. We apply the two-step hybrid analytical procedure to China's province-level regional innovation systems. Our empirical study shows that China's regional innovation systems perform poorly in both technological creation efficiency and technological commercialisation efficiency at the provincial average level. This awkward situation is attributed to unfavourable environmental factors. Our findings indicate that the embedded and contextualised policy-oriented environment does not effectively suit the TIP within China's regional innovation systems.","[Chen Kaihua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Kou Mingting] Shanxi Datong Univ, Coll Business, Datong 037009, Peoples R China; [Kou Mingting] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development; Shanxi Datong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Kou, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Management, 80 ZhongGuanCunDong Rd, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",chenkaihua@casipm.ac.cn; koumingting@ucas.ac.cn,,,,,,,67,43,44,3,94,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Nevertheless, budgetary constraints and growing concerns about the environmental integrity of first-generation biofuels have imposed a phasing out of the fiscal instruments to promote them. Focusing on France, this paper combines an exogenous increase in oil prices and tax policies on fossil fuels. The objective is to determine the efficiency of an alternative incentive scheme for biodiesel consumption based on a higher price of the fossil fuel substitute. Policy simulations are implemented through a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated on 2009 French data. The results show that the 10% biodiesel mandate set by the RED would not be achieved even if the fixed taxes on diesel reach the same level as those on gasoline. Although integrating the rise in oil prices into the fiscal framework improves the biodiesel penetration rate, it remains below the target. Moreover, we find that the effects of biofuel consumption are limited to the biofuel chain sectors. In other agricultural sectors, the substitution effect of biodiesel with diesel is partially offset by the pricing effect induced by higher energy ptoduction costs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

While existing studies derive the competition effect indirectly, this paper deploys a direct measure, called market mobility, to approximate the induced competition effect. The empirical results are consistent with the idea that both effects are important in explaining the long-term economic impact of start-ups. First, the most successful start-ups grow to become high-growth firms, and second, the entry of new firms stimulates incumbent firms to perform better.","[Koster, Sierdjan] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [van Stel, Andre] Panteia EIM, NL-2715 CA Zoetermeer, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Koster, S (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",sierdjan.koster@rug.nl; a.van.stel@panteia.nl,,"Van Stel, Andre/0000-0003-4512-654X; koster, sierdjan/0000-0001-6047-920X",,,,,36,21,21,1,42,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

This phenomenon has always been recognized in regional and urban studies because the path of development almost naturally follows a history-dependent spatial diffusion influenced by both physical geography and the quality of institutions. In this paper, I consider the case of firm and employment concentration in Italy and its impact on local development. A large and growing literature has argued in favour of persisting effects of past institutions on current outcomes. Hence, in order to identify the impact of firm and employment density on income, I use instruments from the history of a set of Italian cities: namely the presence of a university and status as a free-city state in the Early Middle Ages. I first show that those two variables had an important effect on the process of urban development between 1300 and 1861, together with favourable geographic conditions. Then, when I use these instruments to predict firm and employment density, I find that the elasticity of income to firm and employment density is in the interval 0.08-0.13. This result is interpreted as providing evidence of the historical roots of agglomeration economies in Italy.","[Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, Deparment Policy Anal & Publ Management, I-20121 Milan, MI, Italy; [Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, CERTeT, I-20121 Milan, MI, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Percoco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Deparment Policy Anal & Publ Management, Piazza Sraffa 11, I-20121 Milan, MI, Italy.",marco.percoco@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,28,2,2,1,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

This paper examines the determinants of skill-selective regional migration in a context where modelling the migration decision as a wage-maximizing process may be insufficient due to persistent employment disparities. Based on a Borjas-type framework it is shown that high-skilled workers are disproportionately attracted to regions with higher mean wages and employment chances as well as higher regional wage and employment inequalities. Estimates from a labour flow fixed-effects model and a general methods of moments (GMM) estimator show that these predictions hold, but only employment disparities induce a robust and significant skill sorting. The paper thus establishes a missing link about why employment disparities may actually be self-reinforcing.","[Arntz, Melanie; Gregory, Terry] ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany; [Arntz, Melanie] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Lehmer, Florian] IAB Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Arntz, M (通讯作者)，ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany.",gregory@zew.de,"Gregory, Terry/ABD-9926-2021","Gregory, Terry/0000-0001-5334-1667",,,,,44,20,21,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

To this end, we studied various selective differential agents based on the main physiological characteristics of these species, such as their high resistances to high concentrations of sugar, sulfur dioxide, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid or malo ethanolic fermentation. This selective medium is based on the genus resistance to the antibiotic actidione and its high resistance to inhibitory agents such as benzoic acid. Malic acid was used as a differential factor due to the ability of this genus to metabolise it to ethanol, which allows detecting of the degradation of this compound.

Production, distribution and the use of energy resources in the region are the challenges for central and local government, business and social service, customers and other stakeholders. Development of regional energy economy should be optimized according to the available energy flow in the region using a network system analysis method, which provides solutions for developing sustainable energy economy models. The network system analysis method enables to optimize the use of local and renewable resources at the regional level and reveals available local energy resources. An efficient use of available regional resources and the use of renewable energy sources (RES) should be the main goals for the development of regional energy system.

These models assume that a volume of a bilateral trade is positively proportional to 'sizes' of trading economies and negatively proportional to their distance. The aim of the paper is to evaluate exports from Germany (the 3rd world's exporter) and the Czech Republic (small and open post-transition economy used for a comparison) to their international partners via frictionless aggregate gravity equation with the use of the latest (2012) export data. Results of linear regression with corrected heteroscedasticity (for both countries separately) indicate that the model predicts exports successfully with adjusted determinacy coefficients around 0.75 (GER) and 0.98 (CZE) respectively. Also, coefficients associated with the gross domestic product (0.60 and 0.65) and distance between countries (1.24 and 0.78) were found close to values of other similar empirical studies.

But the eruption of controversy over offsets from Chinese wind power in 2009 exposed cracks at the core of how carbon credits are verified in the developing economies. The Chinese wind controversy therefore has direct implications for the design and negotiation of any successor to the Kyoto Protocol or future market-based carbon regimes. In order for carbon markets to avoid controversy and function effectively, the lessons from the Chinese wind controversy should be used to implement key reforms in current and future carbon policy design. The paper examines the application of additionality in the Chinese wind power market and draws implications for the design of effective global carbon offset policy. It demonstrates the causes of the wind power controversy, highlights underlying structural flaws, in how additionality is applied in China, the Offsetters' Paradox, and charts a reform path that can strengthen the credibility of global carbon markets.

The expected energy savings of efficiency standards and labels can be fully realized only with strong enforcement to ensure compliance for all products sold. This paper provides comprehensive retrospective evaluation of the methodologies, results, progress and remaining challenges in pilot enforcement projects initiated in the absence of consistent national check-testing focused on energy efficiency. Scope: This paper's scope is focused on 2006-2009 pilot local check-tests conducted to verify appliance and equipment compliance with China's mandatory energy label and efficiency standards. Conclusions: This paper finds both improvement and some backsliding in compliance rates over time. Compared to earlier efforts, 2009 check-tests covered a wider regional and product scope but demonstrated greater variation in compliance rates. Labeling display and energy efficiency compliance was generally high across regions and most products, but lower compliance rates were observed in less economically developed regions and for lighting and industrial products. Based on these findings, areas for improvement in local awareness, product sampling methodology, check-testing tools and procedures are identified.

Despite the large governmental spending in the building of household biogas digesters, only 12.16% of the households suitable to produce and use biogas, have built a digester (Li, 2009). This article asks which factors on the household level may be important for the decision whether or not to build a biogas digester. Based on a survey with 1227 households from Guangxi, Hubei, Shandong and Gansu provinces, results of a binary Probit Model show that the governmental promotion of biogas has a significant effect on households' decision. The question arises which households may, if governmental programs were to be running out, be most likely to construct a household biogas digester? The household head's age, the number of household members staying at home, the total household income and the subjective discount rate of the respondents are significant factors in a farm household's decision to build a biogas digester.

Thousands of low-head dams do not provide power and thus present few benefits with significant costs, including safety liability, fragmentation of river ecosystems, and persistent economic burden induced on state agencies due to regular inspection requirements. We conducted a feasibility study in the Piedmont region of North Carolina cataloguing over 1000 non-Federal dams with hydraulic head ranging from 4.6 m to 10.7 m (15 ft to 35 ft) and power capacity <300 kW (micro hydropower). Generation potential, greenhouse gas reductions, and financial viability were refined for 49 low-head dams over a 30-year life cycle using industry standard software (RETScreen4). Results suggest that most of these dams are not financially viable for energy production under cost structures evaluated at the time of this study. However, our results indicate that some low-head dams may be viable for energy production if provided funding opportunities comparable to the concurrent wind and solar markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The present case study, which was conducted among 10 Canadian companies considered as large final emitters and three auditing firms, focuses on the factors which could affect the perceived credibility of GHG inventories and the strategic implications of these. The qualitative, inductive study allows identifying three main factors which affect trust in business inventories: technical issues and complexity of GHG measurements, lack of transparency on the part of the companies and unreliability of verification mechanisms. The study also makes it possible to evaluate the implications of uncertainties concerning GHG inventories which are of strategic importance for companies and policy makers. While the reliability of GHG measurement is taken for granted at the political level, uncertainties in this area can in fact have a huge impact on the establishment of the cap and trade system. The study also contributes to the literature on carbon accounting by shedding light on underexplored ethical issues, including the lack of independence of auditors and its implications.

This means that theories of spatial development, formulated during the manufacturing-industrial era, might not be wholly applicable today. One of the basic assumptions of spatial theory is formulated in Waldo Tobler's first law of geography: everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things. This article discusses the validity of this law in today's knowledge economy. While several factors have made distance less important, a crucial factor for innovation and growth-tacit knowledge-is still highly dependent on face-to-face contacts. This suggests that Waldo Tobler's first law of geography plays an important role also in the knowledge economy.","[Westlund, Hans] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Urban & Reg Studies, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Westlund, Hans] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Westlund, Hans] IRSA Inst Dev & Strateg Anal, Ljubljana, Slovenia",Royal Institute of Technology; Jonkoping University,"Westlund, H (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Urban & Reg Studies, Drottning Kristinas Vag 30, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",hans.westlund@abe.kth.se,,,,,,,29,15,19,0,61,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Two primary energy sources are available: a cheap exhaustible fossil fuel (coal) and an expensive clean energy alternative (solar). To avoid catastrophic climate events, the global carbon concentration has to remain below some critical mandated ceiling. We show that there exists an upper bound on the coal endowment that can be consumed, which distinguishes two main cases: coal is initially abundant or scarce. If the energy sector has to provide a constant aggregate energy flow to the final users, cost-effectiveness requires that the global ceiling should be attained only when solar energy is introduced. Then the economy stays forever at the ceiling and coal use is progressively replaced by solar energy use. In the abundant coal case, this energy sources substitution process lasts for an infinite duration while in the scarce coal case, coal exploitation ends in finite time. Under a welfare maximization criterion, if coal is abundant, we show that the economy may follow a sequence of phases at the ceiling and below the ceiling before the final transition towards clean energy.

Using results from the Halifax Space Time Activity Research (STAR) project, we estimate GHG emissions for 1920 randomly selected respondents in Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada. The unique data set allows us to report direct GHG emissions with an unprecedented level of specificity at the sub-regional scale using household energy-use survey data and GPS-verified travel data. We report results and investigate statistical differences between communities and urban rural zones (inner city, suburban, and inner and outer commuter belts). Results reveal considerable spatial variability in direct GHG emissions across the study area. Our findings indicate that individuals living in the suburbs generate similar amounts of GHG emissions (20.5 kg CO(2)e person(-1) day(-1)) to those living in the inner city (20.2 kg CO(2)e person(-1) day(-1)), challenging a widely held assumption that living in the urban centre is better for sustainability. However, individuals in more rural areas have significantly higher transport-related GHG emissions than those living in the inner city and suburbs. Our results underscore the importance of understanding the spatial distribution of GHG emissions at the sub-regional scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We find negative income elasticity for coal consumption but positive income elasticity for oil and gas consumption suggesting the importance of economic growth in encouraging the usage of cleaner energy from coal to oil and gas. By introducing time dummies into the regressions, we show that climatic mitigation policies are able to promote the usage of cleaner energies. Through the dynamic linkages between energy consumption and energy R&D, we find that fossil fuel consumption promotes fossil fuel R&D and fossil fuel R&D in turn drives its own consumption. Renewable energy R&D which is more responsive to economic growth reduces fossil fuel consumption and hence fossil fuel R&D. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Nearly 70% of the coal based SNG projects are being conducted in Xinjiang, with the goal to take advantage of the lower coal price in Xinjiang to promote the development of the coal based SNG industry. However, the coal based SNG industry is subject to the constraints of pollution, immature technology, poor economic returns, water resources and many other factors.

This study uses identical energy label data, supplemented with additional data sources in order to reveal how different parameters influence theoretical and actual consumptions gas and electricity. Analysis is conducted through descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Regression analysis explained far less of the variation in the actual consumption than in the theoretical and has shown that variables such as floor area, ownership type, salary and the value of the house, which predicted a high degree of change in actual gas consumption, were insignificant (ownership, salary, value) or had a minor impact on theoretical consumption (floor area). Since some possibly fundamental variables were unavailable for regression analysis, we also conducted a sensitivity study of theoretical gas consumption. It showed that average indoor temperature, ventilation rate and accuracy of U-value have a large influence on the theoretical gas consumption; whereas the number of occupants and internal heat load have a rather limited impact.

However, the fees for these services tend to be higher than those charged at mainstream financial institutions. One rationale why consumers continue to patronize them is that AFSPs serve the financial needs of patrons by filling a void created by the absence of traditional financial institutions-known as the spatial void hypothesis. Two studies have tested the spatial void hypothesis and reached opposing conclusions. While the most recent inquiry used alternative statistical methods to find support for the spatial void hypothesis in the counties investigated, questions arise as to its applicability to other geographical areas. This study applies the alternative methodology to examine the spatial void hypothesis in selected counties in the states of New Jersey and Delaware.

Without tax credits, only the hybrids without plug-in incur lifetime total costs equivalent to a conventional vehicle whereas the consumer affordability for all other vehicles is less encouraging and depends on changes in gasoline prices. With the provision of federal tax incentives, the lifetime total cost for all electric vehicle types that are driven for 120,000 miles over 12 years was found to be generally affordable with no more than 5% higher in lifetime total cost than a conventional vehicle, except the hybrid electric plug-in equipped with a 35-mile electric driving range. Results of sensitivity analysis reveal that a greater lifetime driven mileage would promote further overall cost savings even at a greenhouse gas abatement cost as low as $42 per ton. Our study has demonstrated the importance of an energy policy that includes tax credits to address the inadequacy of cost differentials and consumer affordability. The environmental benefits provided by the electric and hybrid electric vehicles should satisfy consumers' interest in protecting the environment, reducing the dependence on imported fossil fuels, and switching from traditional to alternative fuel vehicles.

D. When are cities engines of growth in China? Spread and backwash effects across the urban hierarchy, Regional Studies. China's remarkable growth has an urban bias, but it is unclear whether it has greatly disadvantaged particular regions. To assess this question, a Central Place Theory framework is employed to assess spread and backwash effects. It is found that New Economic Geography representations do not capture the heterogeneity across urban tiers. Market potential in China's mega-cities is inversely related to growth for smaller cities and rural communities, while medium-sized cities have positive spread effects. It is concluded that China's urban-centric process should be re-evaluated because it may not maximize aggregate growth, and growth in the mega-cities may reduce growth elsewhere.","[Chen, Anping] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, AED Econ, Swank Chair Rural Urban Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Jinan University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Chen, AP (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",anping.chen@hotmail.com; partridge.27@osu.edu,,,,,,,73,86,105,9,109,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Official data show that the average thermal efficiency was enhanced from 31.3% in 2000 to 33.2% in 2005 and 36.9% in 2010. This paper aims to assess the validity of China's claimed improvement, examine major responsible factors, and identify future improvement opportunities. Recognizable factors can account for about 80% of the reported progress in the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2005) and about 85% in the 11th (2006-2010) to largely verify the reported progress. Engineering approaches-especially replacing inefficient power units with more efficient ones-are-the largest contributing factors, while optimization approaches-particularly electricity dispatch-remains inefficient in China. In 2010, the explainable efficiency improvement might have avoided around 500 million tons of CO2 emissions. In comparison, although the United States was fairly static with most of its coal-fired power plants seriously outdated, it has more efficient electricity dispatch. In China's ongoing 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), better dispatch patterns could be more important as opportunities for improvement through engineering approaches have been largely exhausted.

This paper shows, in a quantitative way, the limitations of relying exclusively on flexibility in generation as the future shares of intermittent supply increase. Literature and data on intermittent supply and existing scenarios are reviewed. Costs related to increasing shares of intermittent supply are assessed. Quantifiable indicators relevant for electricity systems with a high share of intermittent supply are developed, namely (a) flexible supply (generation units that can quickly change output); (b) balancing need (which measures the needed flexibility of the power system as the difference between peak and off-peak residual demand (net of intermittent supply)). There is an externality of increasing the share of intermittent supply by increasing the power system balancing costs. If the cost of integrating intermittent generation was to be limited to about 25 billion EUR per year, which is an addition of 24% per unit intermittent generation cost, the intermittent supply share cannot reach more than 40% in the European power market. The final choice of an acceptable cost increase will be a political choice. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It compares these energy/carbon exchanges with national levels of energy use and carbon emissions for Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Globally primary energy consumption (related carbon emissions) is currently equivalent to similar to 0.06% of the incident solar energy, and 43% of the energy (carbon) captured by photosynthesis. The nations fall into three categories. Those with primary energy consumption that is: 1-10% (Japan, Korea and Singapore); similar to 0.1% (China, UK and the US) and; 0.1-0.01% (Australia, Brazil, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Sweden) of incident solar radiation. The percentage of energy captured in biomass follows this pattern, but generally lower by similar to 3 orders of magnitude. The energy content of traded wheat, corn and rice represents conversion efficiencies of solar radiation of 0.08-0.17% and for sugar close to 1%, ignoring energy use in production and conversion of biomass to fuels. The study implies that bio-fuels or bio-sequestration can only be a small part of an inclusive portfolio of actions towards a low carbon future and minimised net emissions of carbon to the atmosphere.

This paper explores the ability of three transport strategies to contribute to the development of a sustainable transport in China. With this purpose in mind, a Chinese transport model has been created and three current transport strategies which are high speed railway (HSR), urban rail transit (URT) and electric vehicle (EV) were evaluated together with a reference transport system in 2020. As conservative results, 13% of the energy saving and 12% of the CO2 emission reduction can be attained by accomplishing three strategies compared with the reference transport system. However, the energy demand of transport in 2020 with the implementation of three strategies will be about 1.7 times as much as today. The three strategies show the potential of drawing the transport demand to the more energy efficient vehicles; however, more initiatives are needed if the sustainable transport is the long term objective, such as the solutions to stabilise the private vehicle demands, to continuously improve the vehicle efficiency and to boost the alternative fuels produced from the renewable energy sources.

LUC poses risks such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and food prices. The magnitude of the risk is uncertain, but could be significant. Given these uncertainties and risks, we suggest that policymakers pursue a mix of the following three strategies: (1) promote feedstocks that rely less on land; (2) reduce LUC risk for land-using feedstocks; and (3) stimulate investments that increase land productivity and environmental protection. To realize these three strategies, we recommend that policymakers distinguish among feedstocks based on LUC risk; explore certifying production that avoids land competition; and adopt policy mechanisms that encourage investments in LUC-prone areas. We favor including feedstock-specific LUC emissions estimates in policies despite relatively large scientific uncertainty. While misleadingly precise, point estimates can be selected from science-based ranges to directly link LUC policy to emissions and provide strong transparent signals to biofuel investors. LUC emissions estimates can be updated regularly (similar to 3-5 years) to reflect improvements in scientific understanding, and global changes in policy and economic environments. With or without LUC emissions point estimates, additional policies, some outside the biofuel sector, will be needed to pursue the three strategies above. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Much research has been conducted on curriculum design and evaluation methods for energy education. However, a comprehensive view of the educational objectives for improving energy literacy is still lacking in these efforts. In this study, we propose a framework for energy education that clearly captures the concept of energy saving and carbon reduction by reviewing related literature and consulting an ad hoc panel of experts on energy and education. We then apply the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine the indicators of the framework and their priority or weights. The results show that the dimensions of civic responsibility for a sustainable society and low-carbon lifestyle are considered most important as an energy educational goal.

Using a computable general equilibrium model that explicitly represents the biofuel industry, this study carries out several simulations on two sets of issues: (i) international markets for biofuel and feedstock, such as an increase in prices of soybean, soybean oil, and biodiesel, and (ii) domestic policies related to biofuels, such as an introduction of biofuel mandates. Both sets of issues can have important consequences to the Argentinean economy. The simulations indicate that increases in international prices of biofuels and feedstocks would increase Argentina's gross domestic product and social welfare. Increases in international prices of ethanol and corn also can benefit Argentina, but to a lesser extent. The domestic mandates for biofuels, however, would cause small losses in economic output and social welfare because they divert part of biodiesel and feedstock from exports to lower-return domestic consumption. An increase in the export tax on either feedstock or biodiesel also would lead to a reduction in gross domestic product and social welfare, although government revenue would rise.

Territorial politics and the statewide party, Regional Studies. The literature on political parties has been affected by a national bias. However, the multilevel nature of party organizations deserves one's attention because parties have responded as well as contributed to the rise in regional authority across most Western democracies. This paper considers statewide parties from a double perspective: as organizations subject to a range of pressures in a multilevel environment, and as actors influencing multilevel political systems. It concludes with a call for stronger links between traditional areas of party and policy research and multilevel party research and for more comparative data collection on multilevel parties and policy positions.","[Fabre, Elodie] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Relat & Philosophy, Belfast BT7 1PB, Antrim, North Ireland; [Swenden, Wilfried] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland",Queens University Belfast; University of Edinburgh,"Fabre, E (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Relat & Philosophy, 25 Univ Sq, Belfast BT7 1PB, Antrim, North Ireland.",e.fabre@ed.ac.uk; w.swenden@ed.ac.uk,"Fabre, Elodie/K-8842-2019","Fabre, Elodie/0000-0002-0662-2623",,,,,86,16,17,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The results show that in former West Germany rightwing governments promoted economic freedom, whereas leftwing governments confined it. In the former East Germany, however, rightwing governments were not associated with propagating economic freedom. This finding appears to conflict with the common notion of policy convergence at the federal level. In fact, the observed variation in political preferences across states may indicate that politicians gratify the local electorate and, in return, offer moderate policies at the federal level.","Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Potrafke, N (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 138, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",niklas.potrafke@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,73,29,31,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A few studies have assessed the effectiveness of RES-E policies, but most ignore policy design features and market characteristics (e.g. electricity price and production cost) that influence policy strength. We employ 1992-2008 panel data to conduct the first econometric analysis of the effectiveness of FIT policies in promoting solar photovoltaic (PV) and onshore wind power development in 26 European Union countries. We develop a new indicator for FIT strength that captures variability in tariff size, contract duration, digression rate, and electricity price and production cost to estimate the resulting return on investment. We regress this indicator on added RES-E capacity using a fixed effects specification and find that FIT policies have driven solar PV development in the EU. However, this effect is overstated without controlling for country characteristics and is concealed without accounting for policy design. We do not find robust evidence that FIT policies have driven wind power development. Overall, we show that the interaction of policy design, electricity price, and electricity production cost is a more important determinant of RES-E development than policy enactment alone.

Domestic energy use accounts for around 30% of total emissions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing models and modelling techniques and indicates how they might be improved by considering individual buying behaviour. Macro (top-down) and micro (bottom-up) models have been reviewed and analysed. It is found that bottom-up models can project technology diffusion due to their higher resolution. The weakness of existing bottom-up models at capturing individual green technology buying behaviour has been identified. Consequently, Markov chains, neural networks and agent-based modelling are proposed as possible methods to incorporate buying behaviour within a domestic energy forecast model. Among the three methods, agent-based models are found to be the most promising, although a successful agent approach requires large amounts of input data. A prototype agent-based model has been developed and tested, which demonstrates the feasibility of an agent approach. This model shows that an agent-based approach is promising as a means to predict the effectiveness of various policy measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Differences in assumptions make comparisons between proposed algal production systems difficult. Existing economic analyses have ignored potential capital cost growth and under performance of early generation algal production plants, which impact the preliminary unit cost of algal biofuels, which could affect investment decisions. Therefore the goal of this work was to compare the capital cost growth (ratio of actual to estimated cost), plant performance (ratio of actual performance to design), and unit cost growth factor (the ratio of cost growth to plant performance), of potential algal production pathways. Three production technologies were investigated: (1) open raceway ponds (ORP), (2) tubular photobioreactors (PBR), and (3) systems coupling photobioreactors to open raceway ponds. The greatest cost growth (1.5-1.8) was estimated for PBR systems, while the lowest cost growth (1.2-1.4) was estimated for the ORP systems and coupled systems. Plant performance was estimated to range from 13% to 40% of nameplate capacity. These results imply that unit cost growth for algal biofuels could range from 3 to 14 times current predictions, and illustrates large hurdles facing algal biofuels technologies that have yet to be implemented at scale.

This paper focuses monitoring aspects, used two methods to calculate CO2 emission, the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and a method developed by the Japanese Iron and Steel Federation, to investigate the effect of the accounting method on the assessment of energy saving by four model steel mills with different levels of energy efficiency. Depending on the calculation method used, the calculated energy savings and calculated CO2 emissions for a given mill were found to differ from 5% to 15% and 4% to 14% respectively, simply by using different calculation methods. Methodologies that evaluate only CO2 emission and track emissions by process may not fully account for energy saving efforts such as using waste heat, generating power using byproduct gases, and energy management efforts applied over the whole mill rather than on a single process. Points of concern in the iron and steel industry are identified in the areas of calculating energy saving, determining CO2 emissions, and setting benchmarks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that income and price elasticities of passenger transport demand in the United Kingdom were very large (3.1 and -1.5, respectively) in the mid-nineteenth century, and declined since then. In 2010, long run income and price elasticity of aggregate land transport demand were estimated to be 0.8 and -0.6. These trends suggest that future elasticities related to transport demand in developed economies may decline very gradually and, in developing economies, where elasticities are often larger, they will probably decline more rapidly as the economies develop. Because of the declining trends in elasticities, future energy and technological transitions are not likely to generate the growth rates in energy consumption that occurred following transitions in the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, energy and technological transitions, such as the car and the airplane, appear to have delayed and probably will delay declining trends in income and price elasticity of aggregate transport demand.

In addition, the Swiss Federal Council has decided to phase out nuclear power over the longer term by not replacing existing nuclear power plants after retirement. We have analysed possible electricity supply options for responding to these two developments under different conditions using the Swiss TIMES electricity sector model-a least-cost optimization framework. Short-term demand can be cost-effectively met with new investment in gas-fired generation capacity. However, meeting the government's CO2 emission and renewable electricity targets requires an accelerated investment in renewable generation and/or increased reliance on imported electricity. In the medium and longer term, nuclear represents the most cost-effective option. The alternatives to nuclear lead to increased dependence on imported natural gas, seasonal renewables and imported electricity. All non-nuclear supply options increase the cost of electricity supply by between 50 and 150%, and create a range of tradeoffs between supply security and climate change mitigation goal. However, it is expected that an accelerated uptake of end-use efficiency measures and demand side management would reduce future electricity demand, thus reducing the need for some expensive supply options.

Energy-related CO2 emissions have increased significantly. At the same time, important investments in combined cycle gas turbines have taken place. This paper analyses whether, from a cost minimization viewpoint, renewable support has been the best policy for reducing emissions, when compared to the promotion of energy efficiency in sectors such as transportation or buildings. We use a model of the Spanish energy sector to examine its evolution in the time period considered under different policies. It is a bottom-up, static, partial equilibrium, linear programming model of the complete Spanish energy system. We conclude that demand side management (DSM) clearly dominates renewable energy (RE) support if the reduction of emissions at minimum cost is the only concern. We also quantify the savings that could have been achieved: a total of sic5 billion per year, mainly in RE subsidies and in smaller costs of meeting the reduced demand (net of DSM implementation cost).

The new framework is designed to overcome some limitations of existing models, particularly (1) limited consideration of population-employment interactions and (2) dominance of top-down approach to vertical integration of regional and subregional variables. It captures local and lower level conditions and their effects on macroeconomic variables by using a modified disequilibrium adjustment model that incorporates subregional dynamics into a regional econometric input-output model in a reciprocal, interactive manner, as opposed to a top-down allocation process. The framework also considers both region-wide and subregional level population-employment interactions more systematically. It is demonstrated that the present model can support socioeconomic forecasting and a broad range of analyses, including the examinations of the macroeconomic impacts of local actions.","[Kim, Jae Hong] Kansas State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture Reg & Community Plann, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Hewings, Geoffrey J.

In the wake of a rapidly changing German energy system. CCS can play an important role. By means of an online survey among 130 university students in Dresden, this paper investigates the level and influencing factors of social acceptance of CCS. Furthermore, the individual willingness to pay for CCS and renewable power delivery is measured and compared through a choice model. The survey results reveal that the attitude towards CCS is neutral. Moreover, it is shown that acceptance of CCS is an important factor for the willingness to pay. The level of willingness to pay for CCS technology is much lower than for renewable energy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Several copula models with different conditional dependence structures and time-varying dependence parameters were considered. Empirical results for weekly data from January 1998 to April 2011 showed weak oil-food dependence and no extreme market dependence between oil and food prices. These results support the neutrality of agricultural commodity markets to the effects of changes in oil prices and non-contagion between the crude oil and agricultural markets. However, dependence increased significantly in the last three years of the sampling period, even though upper tail dependence remained insignificant, indicating that food price spikes are not caused by positive extreme oil price changes. These results have implications for policy design, risk management and hedging strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that the centers of gravity for raw coal consumption, crude oil production and consumption, and electricity production and consumption moved southwest during the study period, whereas those of raw coal and natural gas production moved northwest and that of natural gas consumption moved southeast. The distances moved were largest for natural gas, followed by crude oil, but the distances were small for raw coal and electricity, indicating that their supply and demand pattern changed little during the study period. The gaps between supply and demand for raw coal, crude oil, and natural gas were large, and tended to increase. The production centers were northwest of the consumption centers, indicating that China's energy production is concentrated in the northwest, whereas consumption was concentrated in the southeast. This pattern resulted from the distribution of China's energy resource reserves and its energy development strategies. Recommendations are provided to reduce the gap between supply and demand.

It also analyzes the impact of all major cost and demand shifters that contribute to regional gasoline price formation. To address these research issues, a reduced form price equation using monthly time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data from January 2004 through December 2008 is estimated. Strong and consistent evidence of full shifting of regional tax changes to regional gasoline prices is found. Gasoline spot price changes are more than proportionally passed through to retail prices. In addition, the empirical evidence shows, on the one hand, that regional gasoline price differences before taxes continue to be quite narrow and, on the other hand, that there is still a margin for larger gasoline price differences among regions. This suggest that traditional practices from the monopoly era (i.e. relatively uniform regional gasoline prices) persist after the market has been liberalized, which may have been facilitated by the strong and uniform presence of the major Spanish-based refining companies in the retail sector over the whole country.

During the last decade, research that investigated NIMBY has provided support to disprove the two prime hypotheses (proximity and decreasing property-value). The current mainstream trend in academic circles is clearly towards abandoning NIMBY explanations. However, in practice among developers and policymakers NIMBY thinking still prevails. Unfortunately there is also some academic writing that persists in recycling the 'backyard theory'-despite ample research to the contrary-thus feeding this faulty interpretation of implementation problems. A recent review of the state of the art of wind power implementation is taken as an example; it presents NIMBY as a common-sense, self-evident truth, while to support this explanation it cites publications that actually refute this view and instead support the mainstream move towards abandoning NIMBY thinking. This shift is important, because further academic support for this concept would serve to hinder rapid deployment of wind power and also other renewables. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The estimation model is based upon the stochastic frontier (labour) production function approach, in which we examine what type of local agglomeration contributes to improve productive efficiency.

The differential pricing policy, intended to reduce energy intensity in manufacturing, is being implemented in eight electricity-intensive industries. The study finds that, during 2004-2009, the policy accounted for a drop of roughly 115 TWh in electricity use, which amounted to a reduction of 82 million tons of CO2 emissions. The policy has been most effective in reducing electricity use in the nonferrous metal smelting and rolling industry, and least effective in the ferrous metal smelting and rolling industry. Because the differential pricing policy has had significantly different effects across industries, improving the policy's design and implementation going forward will require a more detailed understanding and analysis of how it can be better tailored to individual industries.

We investigate the role of various factors that could explain this, including economies of scale, cumulative experience, induced innovation in response to rising input prices, an autonomous technological change, and trade induced competition from imported ethanol. Using data on dry-mill ethanol processing costs over the 1983-2005 period, we find evidence to show that US corn ethanol production exhibited decreasing returns to scale, that learning by doing played an important role in reducing these processing costs with a learning rate of 0.25, and that sugarcane ethanol imports contributed to making the corn ethanol industry more competitive. Other factors such as the rising prices of energy and labor did induce lower processing costs, but the effect is not statistically significant. The inclusion of these competing explanations for the reduction in processing costs of US corn ethanol lead to a significantly higher learning rate than otherwise, and this learning rate is found to be robust across specifications.

To add some insight into the value of reduced exposure to gasoline and diesel price spikes as a result of climate policies like AB 32, we define the benefit of upside hedge value: the extra avoided expenditures on gasoline and diesel fuel that accrue when their prices spike. We develop two historically-grounded price spike scenarios: a moderate spike of 25% and a large spike of 50%. After accounting for short-term price elasticity of demand effects, we estimate the upside hedge value to be between $2.4 billion and $5.2 billion (all 2007 dollars) for the moderate and large hypothetical shock scenarios, respectively.

To understand the coping mechanisms used by such organizations, we survey rural business strategies in Israel, where fuel prices are high and urban development is concentrated in the country's geographic center. The businesses surveyed are operated by kibbutzim, historically collective communities that are now in various stages of privatization. Analysis of the 'transport strategies' employed by nearly 100 organizations in three regions of varying remoteness and isolation shows that firms rely on distinct strategies such as localization and high value density. Localization was found to be prevalent in all regions, as it requires little capital investment. Strategies exploiting high value density, including information-based services, were prevalent in remote and isolated regions where sensitivity to transport costs is acute. Non-remote firms were less inclined toward strategic adaptation, preferring non-disruptive changes such as cheaper shipping modes. The development implications of these transport strategies are consistent with rural economic trends observed throughout the developed world. If transport costs continue to rise, rural firms may shrink the radius of their sales and labor pools, or search for more lucrative products to reduce their relative transport costs.

The policies evaluated include (1) vehicle fuel-consumption improvements, (2) dieselization, (3) vehicle electrification, and (4) fuel diversification, with plausible policy scenarios. Under the business-as-usual scenario, road transport in China would create 410-520 million metric tons (MMT) of oil-equivalent of TTW oil demand (three to four times the current level), 28-36 billion GJ of WTW energy demand, and 1900-2300 MMT of CO2-equivalent of WTW GHG emissions by 2050. The policies (in the same order as above) are projected to reduce the TTW oil demand by 35%, 10%, 29%, and 44%, and reduce WTW GHG emissions by 34%, 5%, 12%, and 13%, respectively, by 2050. This evaluation reveals that the fuel-consumption improvement policy could achieve greater benefit in reducing oil use, fossil-energy use, and GHG emissions.

However, there is a growing concern that the pattern of biofuel development is not always consistent with the principles of sustainable development. This paper assesses the potential of the impacts of biofuel development on food security in Botswana. Drawing on informal and semi-structured interviews, the paper concludes that there is potential for the development of biofuels in Botswana without adverse effects on food security due mainly to availability of idle land which accounted for 72% of agricultural land in the eastern part of the country in 2008. It is suggested that farmers could be incentivized to produce energy crops and more food from such land. Although it is hypothesized that the implementation of biofuel development programmes in other countries had an impact on local commodity prices during the period 2005-2008 in Botswana, it is argued that local biofuel production may not necessarily lead to a substantial increase in commodity food prices because land availability is not a major issue. The paper makes policy recommendations for sustainable biofuel development in Botswana. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Communicating with the public in rural communities is challenging when it involves a complicated environmental issue that could have widespread economic impacts. The local media reflect public understanding, so getting a sense of how these media frame issues can be a crucial first step to developing an effective community engagement strategy. A media content analysis of one local newspaper was completed in relation to a major federal nuclear facility. The content analysis is compared to the results of a telephone survey in the region served by the paper and the results suggest that there is a relationship between how the facility is portrayed in local media and public concern. This study has important implications for other nuclear facilities because of the role of local citizens in decision-making. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, the Renewable Energy Directive requires that support mechanisms be implemented with the aim of increasing the proportion of energy from renewable sources. The Quota System with Tradable Green Certificates (TGC) was established in Sweden as a support mechanism in 2003 and is, from 2012, planned to be extended to become a Swedish-Norwegian system. This article discusses the effects of Electricity Disclosure and the TGC system when working as two separate entities, and the potential interaction between the systems when working in tandem. It appears that Electricity Disclosure may create a customer-driven demand for renewable electricity, which can supplement the TGC system. In the long-term, GOs may thus influence the decisions made by investors in renewable energy. However, currently Electricity Disclosure has very low, or no, impact on the total production of electricity from renewable sources when compared with a stand-alone TGC system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The coefficients of the three forms of the model (linear, exponential, and quadratic) are optimized by PSO-GA using factors, such as GDP, population, economic structure, urbanization rate, and energy consumption structure, that affect demand. Based on 20-year historical data between 1990 and 2009, the simulation results of the proposed model have greater accuracy and reliability than other single optimization methods. Moreover, it can be used with optimal coefficients for the energy demand projections of China. The departure coefficient method is applied to get the weights of the three forms of the model to obtain a combinational prediction. The energy demand of China is going to be 4.79, 4.04, and 4.48 billion tce in 2015, and 6.91, 5.03, and 6.11 billion tce (standard tons coal equivalent) in 2020 under three different scenarios.

The research is developed in two steps. The first step is the measurement of concentration levels for the IMA; the Ellison-Glaeser localization index (EGI) is applied to the 22 manufacturing sector (2-digit level) at three different geographical levels. The second step is to determine the structural pattern of agglomeration. By regressing the Ellison-Glaeser localization index values on proxies for urbanization and localization economies, the determinants of agglomeration are demonstrated. The determinants of agglomeration are estimated by 12 different two-stage OLS regressions. While three of these regressions represent the agglomeration factors at each geographical level, the other nine equations represent the agglomeration factors at the industry-specific level. The results suggest that urbanization economies have a strong effect on agglomeration both at the geographical level and industry-specific level. It is noticed that density, market area potential, and labor market potential are the most effective proxies for urbanization economies on agglomeration. The effects of localization economies are consistent with Marshall for labor pooling and manufactured input. However, the results do not provide any evidence that knowledge spillovers have an influence on agglomeration in this case.","[Alkay, Elif] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, TR-34437 Istanbul, Turkey; [Hewings, Geoffrey J.

Rich Taiwanese thus live downtown, not in the suburbs. In addition, the expected negative relationship between accessibility and the spaciousness of housing is weak or non-existent in Taiwan's metropolitan areas. Taiwan should therefore be highly suited to rail transportation investments. In 2007, a new high-speed railroad was inaugurated, connecting seven metropolitan areas. Hedonic estimates show that high-speed rail accessibility has a substantial impact on house prices in at least four of the regions. Interregional downtown-to-downtown commuting time seems to be the most important determinant of success in generating a station-centered price-distance gradient. Neighborhoods around HSR stations in suburban locations are not likely to spawn residential communities for commuters, since most Taiwanese prefer downtown residential locations.","[Andersson, David Emanuel] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Publ Affairs Management, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Shyr, Oliver F.; Lee, Angel] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Urban Planning, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; National Cheng Kung University,"Andersson, DE (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Publ Affairs Management, 70 Lianhai Rd, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",david@faculty.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Angel/P-9297-2019; Andersson, David Emanuel/G-8471-2013; Andersson, David Emanuel/E-1221-2013","Lee, Angel/0000-0003-2064-8472; Andersson, David Emanuel/0000-0002-1640-1314; Andersson, David Emanuel/0000-0003-3572-8846",,,,,16,26,28,0,60,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

We construct field-specific cost functions from average cost data and an estimated inverse production function, which incorporates engineering aspects of oil production into our economic modeling. Producers appear to have approximated dynamic optimality. Consistent with prior research, we find that changing the tax rate alone does not change the economically optimal oil production path, except for marginal fields that may cease production. Contrary to prior research, we find that the structure of tax policy can be designed to affect the economically optimal production path, but at a cost in net social benefit. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Case studies of Botswana, Uganda, and Bangladesh illustrate situations that are more and less suited for decentralized electrification. Specific maps for centralized and decentralized generation are presented to show how the least-cost option varies with the relative costs of centralized and decentralized generation and transmission cost.

This debate is centered on the issue of the financial sustainability of these highways for the public sector and is derived from the fact that their financing through public-private partnerships and shadow tolls involves regular payments from the public budget to the private firms operating them. In this context, the introduction of tolls has been suggested as a mechanism to alleviate possible budgetary pressures. Our first main conclusion is that investments in SCUTS have positive economic effects in all regions of the country. Furthermore, we find that regional spillovers account for about three-quarters of the total effects of these investments. A paradigmatic case is Lisbon, a region that captures the greatest share of these effects without any investments having actually occurred in the region itself. Our second main conclusion is that investments in SCUTS do not seem to generate problems of financial sustainability for the public budget. We estimate that for all SCUTS, the equilibrium tax rate, i.e., the rate that would balance the tax revenues induced by these highways and the shadow tolls the government has to pay, is lower than the effective tax rate for the economy. As a corollary and from a policy standpoint, our results suggest that the introduction of tolls is questionable from a conceptual perspective due to the magnitude of spillovers and seems to be unnecessary from a financial perspective.","[Pereira, Alfredo M.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Pereira, Alfredo M.; Andraz, Jorge M.] Univ Algarve, Ctr Adv Studies Econ & Econometr, CASEE, P-8000 Faro, Portugal; [Andraz, Jorge M.] Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, P-8000 Faro, Portugal",William & Mary; Universidade do Algarve; Universidade do Algarve,"Pereira, AM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",ampere@wm.edu; jandraz@ualg.pt,"Andraz, Jorge/B-5858-2009","Andraz, Jorge/0000-0001-9209-3344; Pereira, Alfredo Marvao/0000-0003-1381-0937",,,,,17,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

To mitigate CO2 emissions for the power sector is a tough task, which requires implementation of targeted carbon mitigation policies. There might be multiple forms for carbon mitigation policies and it is still unclear which one is the best for China. Applying a superstructure optimisation model for optimal planning of China's power sector built by the authors previously, which was based on real-life plants composition data of China's power sector in 2009, and could incorporate all possible actions of the power sector, including plants construction, decommission, and application of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) on coal-fuelled plants, the implementation effects of three carbon mitigation policies were studied quantitatively, achieving a conclusion that the so-called Surplus-Punishment & Deficit-Award carbon tax policy is the best from the viewpoint of increasing CO2 reduction effect and also reducing the accumulated total cost. Based on this conclusion, the corresponding relationships between CO2 reduction objectives (including the accumulated total emissions reduction by the objective year and the annual emissions reduction in the objective year) were presented in detail. This work provides both directional and quantitative suggestions for China to make carbon mitigation policies in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of inward foreign direct investment in instigating a clustering process. In particular, the study examines the situation in which foreign direct investment is initially attracted to a region as a result of public policy initiatives rather than the existence of sophisticated local capabilities. Under these circumstances, the presence of large foreign-owned multinational corporations is shown to result in local knowledge transfers and regional reputation effects. These effects give rise to a clustering process, which contrary to other perspectives, shows that external economies can be captured locally from foreign direct investment.","NUI, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, CISC, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Giblin, M (通讯作者)，NUI, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, CISC, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",Majella.giblin@nuigalway.ie; Paul.a.ryan@nuigalway.ie,"mchugh, fearghal/D-1070-2012","Ryan, Paul/0000-0001-7467-5391; Giblin, Majella/0000-0002-1931-9025",,,,,54,31,33,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Even though, total energy shortage(2) and peaking shortage(3) were recorded as 11.2% and 11.85%, respectively, in 2008-09 reflecting non-availability of sufficient supply of electricity. Performance improvement of very small amount can lead to large contribution in financial terms, which can be utilized for capacity addition to reduce demand supply gap. Coal fired thermal power plants are main sources of electricity in India. In this paper, relative technical efficiency of 60 coal fired power plants has been evaluated and compared using CCR and BCC models of data envelopment analysis. Target benchmark of input variables has also been evaluated. Performance comparison includes small versus medium versus large power plants and also state owned versus central owned versus private owned. Result indicates poor performance of few power plants due to over use of input resources. Finding reveals that efficiency of small power plants is lower in comparison to medium and large category and also performance of state owned power plants is comparatively lower than central and privately owned. Study also suggests different measures to improve technical efficiency of the plants. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We use monthly data (2000-2010) on retail gasoline prices in 60 Canadian cities to investigate (i) whether the retail gasoline market in Canada has experienced a relative price convergence to the mean, which is expected, given the increased economic integration across Canadian provinces; and (ii) whether the introduction of price regulation mechanisms in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in July 2006 had any impact on the price convergence in these provinces. We use a nonlinear panel unit root test and find solid evidence that Canadian retail gasoline markets are well integrated across locales; however, the share of converging cities reveals a significant decline since July of 2006. The impact of price regulation on price convergence is mixed; our results indicate that since the enactment of the regulation in all New Brunswick cities (9) included in the dataset, gasoline prices converge to the national mean. Volatility of price is also significantly reduced. In contrast, in the wake of price regulation in Nova Scotia, all 6 cities of the province are non-convergent to the mean with increased volatility and overall price level. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Shelter costs have a large weight in the CPI, so their movements receive much attention. The CPI incorporates two shelter indexes: Rent, covering renters, and Owners' Equivalent Rent (OER), covering owners. Between 1999 and 2006, Rent and OER inflation twice diverged markedly; this occurred again recently. Because these indexes share a common data source-a large sample of market rents-such divergence often prompts questions about CPI methods, particularly the OER utilities adjustment. (This adjustment is necessary to produce an unbiased OER index, because many market rents include utilities, but OER is a rent-of-shelter concept.) The utilities adjustment procedure is no smoking gun. It was not the major cause of these divergences, and it generates no long-run inflation measurement bias. Nonetheless, it increases OER inflation volatility and can drive OER inflation far from its measurement goal in the short run. This article develops a theory of utilities adjustment and outlines a straightforward improvement of Bureau of Labor Statistics procedures that eliminates their undesirable properties. The short-run impact on inflation measurement can be very sizable.","US Bur Labor Stat, Div Price & Index Number Res, Washington, DC 20212 USA",United States Department of Labor,"Verbrugge, RJ (通讯作者)，US Bur Labor Stat, Div Price & Index Number Res, 2 Massachusetts Ave NE, Washington, DC 20212 USA.",verbrugge.randal@bls.gov,,,,,,,9,2,3,0,16,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

However, skeptics suggest that precisely because efficiency enhances electrical output, it may reduce power plants' emission rates but increase their emission levels. Using the EPA's new Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) data, this paper conducts the first analysis of the effect of thermal efficiency on the rate and level at which individual power plants emit carbon dioxide. Consistent with the arguments of skeptics, we find that while efficiency lowers CO2 emission rates, it actually increases CO2 emission levels.

The key determinant of changes in unemployment was the skills of the population, with highly skilled cities experiencing smaller increases. Cities with employment in financial services or manufacturing sectors experienced larger increases in unemployment. Whether a city has a specialized or a diverse economy appears less important than the industries in which the city is specialized. The results highlight a problem as the largest unemployment increases were in cities seen as having least potential for future growth.","[Lee, Neil] Work Fdn, London SW1H 0AD, England; [Lee, Neil] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",Lancaster University,"Lee, N (通讯作者)，Work Fdn, 21 Palmer St, London SW1H 0AD, England.",n.lee1@lancs.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,42,42,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

One of these new energy sources is shale gas and one of the countries seeking to decrease its energy dependence and increase its energy security is Poland which is largely dependent on gas and oil imports from Russia. This article presents the results of a thematic content analysis of articles reporting on shale gas/fracking published in Gazeta Wyborcza and Rzeczpospolita, two leading Polish newspapers, from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012. Findings suggest that in media reporting the geopolitical dimension of fracking overrides the technological/scientific dimension and that representations are overwhelmingly positive. Positive representations are bolstered through particular linguistic framings. It is argued that the Polish press has polarized the debate on fracking in a particular (positive) direction, which has silenced an open and constructive debate concerning energy policy in Poland and constructed criticism of fracking as counter-normative and un-Polish. The potential socio-political and policy implications of these media representations are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We define an urban energy experiment as a purposive intervention for energy transition from an energy system based on nuclear and fossil fuels to one based on renewable energy and energy demand management. We suggest three findings. First, we find that the themes of our theoretical framework policy backgrounds, governance and policy contents have played important roles for Seoul's energy experiments aimed at urban energy autonomy. In particular, political leadership based on the mayor's previous experiences contributed significantly to the formation and implementation of this policy. Second, the OLNPP policy adds a social or moral dimension to urban energy policies. The norm change from an environmental and economic focus to a focus on the combination of social, environmental, and economic considerations is a unique contribution of the OLNPP policy to urban experiments in energy transition. Third, we find that experiments through purposive interventions serve as a means for facilitating urban energy governance where the actors involved can communicate and enhance their new ideas and practices.

Energy markets are driven by innovation, path-dependent technology choices and diffusion. However, conventional optimisation models lack detail on these aspects and have limited ability to address the effectiveness of policy interventions because they do not represent decision-making. As a result, known effects of technology lock-ins are liable to be underestimated. In contrast, our approach places investor decision-making at the core of the analysis and investigates how it drives the diffusion of low-carbon technology in a highly disaggregated, hybrid, global macroeconometric model, FIT:Power-E3MG. Ten scenarios to 2050 of the electricity sector in 21 regions exploring combinations of electricity policy instruments are analysed, including their climate impacts. We show that in a diffusion and path-dependent perspective, the impact of combinations of policies does not correspond to the sum of impacts of individual instruments: synergies exist between policy tools. We argue that the carbon price required to break the current fossil technology lock-in can be much lower when combined with other policies, and that a 90% decarbonisation of the electricity sector by 2050 is affordable without early scrapping.

In the world's largest emerging economy, energy efficiency is expected to play a critical role in the ever-rising demand for energy. Based on factual overviews and numerical analysis, this article carries out an in-depth investigation into the effectiveness of policies announced or implemented in recent decades targeted at energy conservation in the energy intensive manufacturing and transportation sectors. It highlights nine energy intensive sectors that achieved major improvements in their energy technology efficiency efforts. Under the umbrella of the 11th Five-Year Plan, these sectors' performances reflect the effectiveness of China's energy conservation governance. Numerous actions have been taken in China to reduce the road transport sector's demand for energy and its GHG emissions by implementing fuel economy standards, promoting advanced energy efficient vehicles, and alternative fuels. Coal-based energy saving technologies, especially industrial furnace technologies, are critical for China's near and medium-term energy saving. In the long run, renewable energy development and expanding the railway transport system are the most effective ways to reduce energy use and GHG emissions in China. Fuel economy standards could reduce oil consumption and GHGs by 34-35 per cent. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We present an overview of the POMDP framework and its applications to resource monitoring.

Western Australia and Queensland differ to other states in their response to common shocks and evidence suggests this may be due to differences in their economic geographies.

A step towards developing specialized energy policy for mountainous areas,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mountainous areas; Degree-days; Energy poverty,CONSUMPTION; EFFICIENCY; POVERTY; INDEX,"Specific strategies for the energy sector should be a central part of a sustainable mountain policy. However, there is a lack of research on the energy issues of mountainous areas and specialized energy policy measures cannot be effectively supported. The determination of the energy demand in mountainous areas, which is an essential step in the direction of developing mountain energy policy, is analyzed in this paper. Greece has been selected as a case study. The results show that altitude is the decisive factor affecting degree-days and energy needs, within the geographical range of Greece. It is proved that the thermal, as well as the total energy demand are significantly increased in mountain settlements. The annual energy expenditure of a typical residence lying at an altitude of 1000 m proved to be 85% higher than the corresponding cost at sea level. This makes mountainous populations vulnerable to energy poverty. It is also proved that the subsidy policy for heating oil, in Greece, cannot alleviate energy poverty. The results of the present study can be utilized in the direction of re-designing the present policy and this is a completely necessary step for creating a sustainable policy for mountainous areas, in general.

It is hence important to estimate and assess the potential uses of the resource rent tax (RRT). This paper illustrates how the reinvestment of the RRT and other government revenue from mining can reduce the depreciation of the mine. This illustration is made with reference to a coal deposit in the Tavan-Tolgoi region of Mongolia. The paper also illustrates impact of mining on the macroeconomic performance of Mongolia. Standard macroeconomic frameworks that ignore the depreciation of mineral assets overstate economic performance. The paper also reviews the political issues and constraints that surround the implementation of the RRT. One option canvassed here is the granting of qualified custodial rights of the RRT to the mining firm. Such qualified rights are pertinent given that the RRT is legally the income owed to the State and investments in ventures such as human capital development can yield returns as high as 10% per annum. This study illustrates that even an investment option yielding an annual 3% return can make a significant difference. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposition of an agglomeration bonus, where landowners receive a homogeneous payment and a bonus on top if the spatial allocation of conserved land benefits biodiversity, has been widely discussed. Here, we compare for various ecological and economic parameters the cost-effectiveness and budget efficiency of an agglomeration bonus with a spatially homogeneous payment (where landowners receive the same payment regardless of the spatial allocation of conserved land) and an agglomeration payment (where landowners receive money only if conserved land parcels are spatially connected). Key results include that whether side payments between participants take place plays an important role in the relative performance of the payment options, and that the performance of the agglomeration bonus is either clearly dominated by one of the two other options, but never by both, or very close to the better performing option.

The complex relationships between solar policies at multiple levels of government and solar deployment are questions of importance to policy makers and scholars. Extant literature on solar policies pays less attention to the role of local governments and policies than to their federal and state counterparts. Local governments and policies play indispensable roles in the deployment of solar PVs. This paper studies the multilevel governance of solar development in the U.S. by evaluating the relative effectiveness of state and local policy tools in stimulating solar PV installations, with an emphasis on local solar policies. With a regression analysis on a national sample of 186 U.S. cities, we find that cities with local financial incentives deploy 69% more solar PV capacities than cities without such policies. We also find that cities subject to RPS requirements have 295% more solar PV capacity, compared with cities not regulated by state RPS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of determinants of water use efficiency shows that at farm level, water price and disclosure are important factors. Compared to the base case of unreformed, management reform has a positive impact with water user association having the largest effect, followed by joint-stock co-operative and private company.

We find that for the panel, as well as about four-fifths of individual countries, that hydroelectricity consumption is stationary. This result implies that shocks to hydroelectricity consumption in most countries will only result in temporary deviations from the long-run growth path. An important consequence of this finding is that initiatives designed to have permanent positive effects on hydroelectricity consumption, such as large-scale dam construction, are unlikely to be effective in increasing the share of hydroelectricity, relative to consumption of fossil fuels.

However, externalities including the appropriability of knowledge and pollution abatement result in societal/economic benefits that are not incorporated in electric vehicle prices. In order to address resulting market failures, governments have employed a number of policies. We seek to determine the relationship of one such policy instrument (consumer financial incentives) to electric vehicle adoption. Based on existing literature, we identified several additional socio-economic factors that are expected to be influential in determining electric vehicle adoption rates. Using multiple linear regression analysis, we examined the relationship between those variables and 30 national electric vehicle market shares for the year 2012. The model found financial incentives, charging infrastructure, and local presence of production facilities to be significant and positively correlated to a country's electric vehicle market share. Results suggest that of those factors, charging infrastructure was most strongly related to electric vehicle adoption. However, descriptive analysis suggests that neither financial incentives nor charging infrastructure ensure high electric vehicle adoption rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, it is important to understand the determinants of public acceptance of nuclear power. This study examines the effects of knowledge, trust, risk, and benefit related factors on public acceptance of nuclear power across 19 countries. We consider three levels of public acceptance - strongly accept, reluctantly accept, and oppose - and classify countries into four groups according to the ratio of those three levels of public acceptance. Our results indicate that knowledge of nuclear inspection is more effective than trust in inspection authorities in creating stronger public acceptance among people in the countries with a high level of reluctant acceptance and a low level of strong acceptance, while trust in inspection authorities is more important than knowledge of nuclear inspection for the selection between opposition and reluctant acceptance in countries with a low level of reluctant acceptance and a high level of strong acceptance.

To this respect, the adoption of an initiative within the Madrid Air Quality Plan (AQP) 2011-2015 regarding the substitution of diesel taxis with hybrid, natural gas and LPG alternatives was studied. Four different scenarios were elaborated, a business-as-usual scenario (BAU), the scenario of the AQP, and two extreme-situation scenarios: all-diesel (ADI) and all-ecologic (AEC). Impacts were characterized according to the ILCD methodology, focusing especially on climate change (CC) and photochemical ozone formation (PO). SimaPro 73 was used as analysis and inventory-construction tool. The results indicate that the shift to ecologic alternatives reduced impacts, especially those related to CC and PO. For the complete life cycle, reductions of 13% (CC) and 25% (PO) were observed for AQP against BAU (CC:1365 Gg(co2), P0:13336 Mg-NMVOC). Deeper reductions were observed for AEC (CC:34%, P0:59%), while ADI produced slight increases in impacts if against BAU. The analysis of the use-phase revealed that the central and highest speed zones of the city benefit from the adoption of AQP. This is especially evident in zone 7, with reductions of 16% in CC and 31% in PO respectively against BAU (CCzone1 :3443 kg(CO2)/veh . km, POzone7:11.1 kg(NMVOC)/veh. km). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A normalization method developed by International Energy Agency (IEA) is adopted with India as a benchmark for comparison. It is observed that the energy consumption level corresponding to minimum energy performance standard (MEPS) is very high in India. India also lags behind other countries on the consumption level corresponding to highest efficiency rating. Also, the range of consumption levels corresponding to a label is wide which dilutes the efficacy of label. India has aggressively proposed to tighten the ratings for FF refrigerators in 2014 by 36% across all the bands. This measure will make its highest efficiency rating comparable to other countries. However, due to the wide gap in the consumption levels across the ratings, the revised MEPS will still lag behind other countries. One possible outcome of high MEPS is that as the ratings are tightened, the market may move to lower star rated models significantly undermining the tightening effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A policy scepticism' has emerged that challenges the results of conventional regional higher education institution (HEI) impact analyses. This paper provides a systematic critique of such scepticism. While rejecting its extreme form, the limiting effect of the binding public-sector expenditure constraints under devolution is noted and it is shown how conventional impact analyses can be augmented to accommodate these constraints. While the results suggest that conventional impact studies overestimate the expenditure impacts of HEIs, they also demonstrate that the policy scepticism that treats these expenditure effects as irrelevant neglects some key aspects of HEIs, in particular their export intensity.","[Hermannsson, Kristinn; Mcgregor, Peter G.; Swales, J.

Despite operating in many countries for several decades details of the impact of audits are mixed. The aim of research presented here is to explore the role of audits on investment in energy efficiency measures by private owner-occupied householders in the Netherlands. Results showed that the main influence of the energy audit was to confirm information held by householders. A significant portion of audit recommendations was ignored, the main reason being that householders considered their dwellings to be adequately energy efficient. A comparison of audit recipients to non-recipients showed that audit recipients did not adopt, plan to adopt or invest in more energy efficiency measures than non-recipients. In fact non-recipients adopted more and invested more in measures. It is concluded that energy based renovation is driven by householder perception of comfort and acceptable outlay on energy bills and not necessarily to expert technical tailored information on the potential to reduce CO2 emissions and environmental impact. Results support arguments for minimum energy efficiency standards and performance based incentives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An Empirical Analysis of the OECD, 1980-2005",REGIONAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Federalism; Growth; Decentralization; Inequality,CONVERGENCE PROCESS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; DECENTRALIZATION; DISPARITIES,"Regional Studies. This paper explores the relationship between fiscal federalism, understood as institutionalized regional economic self-rule, and convergence in regional per capita incomes. The principal economic argument against fiscal federalism is that, unless paired with generous equalization grants, it will enhance regional inequalities by reducing inter-regional redistribution. Does the evidence support this claim? Multilevel spatial regressions on primary sub-national jurisdictions in twenty-five Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries show that lower-income regions tend to catch up with higher-income regions only when they enjoy substantial economic powers. Indeed, there is more convergence across member states of the European Union than across regions within almost any of the European Union member states. Fiscal federalism may pose less serious tradeoffs than commonly assumed.","SUNY Buffalo, Dept Polit Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Sorens, J (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Polit Sci, 520 Pk Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",jsorens@buffalo.edu,,"Sorens, Jason/0000-0002-2031-8150",,,,,42,24,26,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The efficiency of this method is however rather poor. It was shown that the efficiency can be improved by averaging of chosen observations, which lie in some sense around the original estimate. For this purpose we employ the median absolute deviation. The next step to improve the efficiency, which is introduced in the paper, is to employ weights for observations according to their distance from the original estimate and then to compute the weighted mean. This approach is similar to the one of M estimates. Further we deal with a generalization of boxplot for multidimensional case. We suggest procedure based on the mentioned methods. This leads us to looking for quantiles, where we use a similar approach which was established by Koenker and Bassett. Since there is a direct connection between robust statistic and appearance of extreme events in a sense of economic pro fit we deal with analogy between the value at risk and the observations which were classified as outliers by our method.

The conventional monetary model is modified to include the difference in the relative price of nontradables since this is a potentially important factor for exchange rate determination in emerging market economies. Using quarterly data spanning from 2001q1 until 2012q4 we detect cross-sectional dependence in our panel. Thus, in order to avoid erroneous inferences about cointegration and causality, we apply the methodology for non-stationary panels, which allows for cross-sectional dependence. We find evidence of cointegration implied by the extended monetary model. Though estimated coefficients deviate slightly from those implied by the theory, their signs are correct. Granger causality tests reveal that: (i) in the long-term the exchange rates revert to the equilibrium relation identified; (ii) in the short-term exchange rate Granger-causes the differential in relative price of non-tradables and is Granger-caused by the relative money supply. The results are driven neither by episodes of high inflation nor by the global financial crisis.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Macroecon, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Papiez, Monika; Smiech, Slawomir] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Management, Dept Stat, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Macroecon, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl; papiezm@uek.krakow.pl; smiechs@uek.krakow.pl,"Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018; Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018; Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,PALACKY UNIV OLOMOUC,OLOMOUC,"KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,145,150,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900026,0

This paper uses an intertemporal computable general equilibrium model of the world economy called G-Cubed to compare a power-sector-only climate policy with two alternative economy-wide measures that either: (1) place the same price on carbon or (2) achieve the same cumulative emissions reduction as the program limited to the power sector. We find that the power-sector-only approach requires a carbon price to electric utilities that is almost twice the economy-wide carbon price that would achieve the same cumulative emissions. In addition, we find that the power-sector-only policy does not produce offsetting increases in emissions in other sectors or other countries. Rather, we find that domestic carbon emissions outside the power sector fall slightly relative to baseline as higher electricity prices slow overall economic activity. Global emissions leakage is negligible as the price of oil in other currencies changes little. All three policies reduce investment in the capital-intensive energy sector, which lowers imports of durable goods and strengthens the U.S. terms of trade. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate a positive effect of economic openness on GDP growth while the impact of trade and financial linkages on output comovements between emerging markets and European Union depends on the state of economy. The impact of financial linkages on output synchronization during crises is changing compared to normal economic situations. During normal times, increased financial linkages generate higher output divergence since capital is directed to the regions where it is most productive. In contrast, during the crisis period, regions which know a high degree of integration, especially through the banking system experienced a significant increase in their economic growth comovement.

In order to safeguard the benefits of financial integration while reducing the negative effects stemming from financial crisis is of the utmost importance to implement better prudential oversight and policy coordination.","[Murarasu, Bogdan] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Finance Insurance Banking & Stock Exchange, Bucharest, Romania; [Bobasu, Alina] Doctoral Sch Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Murarasu, B (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Finance Insurance Banking & Stock Exchange, Bucharest, Romania.",bogdan.murarasu@fin.ase.ro; alina.bobasu@fin.ase.ro,"Murarasu, Bogdan/I-3436-2016","Murarasu, Bogdan/0000-0001-6278-2771",,,,,22,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,1197,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100126,0

There are several technologies available to achieve this target. These techniques are either based on distilling or membrane processes. Osmotic distillation, one of the possibilities, is a quite modern membrane process that can be used. During that process, wine is pumped in counter flow to water along a micro porous, hydrophobic membrane. The volatile components of the wine can permeate that membrane and are dissolved in water. The driving force of that process is the vapor pressure difference between the volatiles on the wine and water side of the membrane. The aim of this work was to determine if the alcohol reduction by osmotic distillation can change the isotopic relation in a wine. Can this enological practice change the composition of a wine in a way that an illegal water addition is simulated? Different wines were reduced by 2% alcohol v/v with varying process parameters. The isotopic analysis of the O 16/18 ratio in the wine were performed according to the OIV methods (353/2009) These analyses showed that the isotopic ratio is modified by an alcohol reduction of 2% v/v in a way that corresponds to an addition of 4-5% of external water.","[Schmitt, Matthias] Hsch Geisenheim Univ, Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany; [Murgo, Marcelo; Prieto, Sebastian] Inst Nacl Vitivinicultura, Dpto Estudios Enol & Sensoriales, Mendoza, Argentina",,"Schmitt, M (通讯作者)，Hsch Geisenheim Univ, Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany.",Matthias.Schmitt@hs-gm.de; marcelo_murgo@inv.gov.ar,,,,,,,19,3,4,0,11,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2014,3.0,,1.0,,,,,,,10.1051/bioconf/20140302006,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BB8BQ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346256100021,0

Household level generation of biogas from animal waste for both cooking and lighting, while producing high quality organic fertiliser, is increasingly proposed as a viable part of the solution for farming households. Since the early 1990s international development organisations - often in cooperation with the national government - have attempted to introduce biogas technologies in many least developed countries, but most initiatives failed. In this landscape of failed biogas development programmes the National Biodigester Programme (NBP) Cambodia started in 2006, with the aim to establish a permanent market oriented and self-financed biogas sector. The results show the development of a sustainable domestic biodigester sector, a rapid diffusion of biodigesters among poor rural households, but still ambivalences on financial independency from external funding and carbon finance. The conclusion is that a pure market model for biogas development in the rural area of the least developed countries will not easily work. Governmental regulation and coordination will remain needed, and carbon finance will not easily fully replace ODA and governmental financial support. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Debate spans published maritime oil flows globally, diverse drivers of future flows including economic growth, shipping market changes and haul lengths. A classic Delphi study to explore the perceptions of likely trends and flows to 2050 recruited a panel of early career and established maritime specialists, many with long term career commitments to this industry. Underpinned by market volatility and legislative uncertainty, the perceptions of both groups coincided and were conservative. Local sourcing, new Arctic seaways and fossil fuel intolerance will tend to reduce oil freight work but perceptions of ship re-routing to avoid for example Emission Control Areas and piracy would tend to lengthen hauls. In advanced industrial nations, reducing energy intensities and diminishing social tolerance of fossil fuels imply gradually reducing maritime oil shipments. However, to achieve radical national commitments to carbon emissions reductions will necessitate specialist education for naturally conservative maritime professionals and vigorous oil import reduction policies to curtail domestic demand for oil shipments.

Three burden-sharing schemes, Emission per capita (pCAP), Emission per GDP (pGDP), and Cumulative emission per capita (pCUM), are taken into account. Future GDP in the 230 countries/regions is projected under two future scenarios, the advanced society scenario (ADV) and conventional society scenario (CNV). Differences in reduction targets between GHG total and GHG excluding LU, different target years, and the required speed of improvement of GHG/GDP are also investigated. The global GDP growth rate for 2010-2050 is 3.39% under the ADV scenario and 2.23% under the CNV scenario. Under the ADV scenario, the ratio of GDP per capita of Annex I countries to that of non-Annex I countries converges to 3.4 in 2050 from 13.0 in 2005.

The present study, as befits policy research, engages with many disciplines (for example, in particular, law and politics) and hence the contributions move beyond that of nuclear energy policy literature and in particular to that on nuclear new build and other assessments of large infrastructure projects. Several examples at the Federal level are identified that demonstrate that the nuclear industry has evolved to a stage where it requires a focus on the power of actions at a more localised (state) level in order to re-ignite the industry. The research concludes that there remains a misunderstanding of the issue of project management for complex construction projects, and it is highly arguable whether many of its issues have been resolved. Further, the research asserts that the economics of nuclear energy are not the most influential reason for no nuclear new build in the US. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, as a side effect, the introduction of these policies redistributes wealth between consumers and producers, and within these groups. While redistribution is seldom the focus of the academic literature in energy economics, it plays a central role in public debates and policy decisions. This paper compares the distributional effects of two major electricity policies: support schemes for renewable energy sources, and CO2 pricing. We find that the redistribution effects of both policies are large, and they work in opposed directions. While renewables support transfers wealth from producers to consumers, carbon pricing does the opposite. More specifically, we show that moderate amounts of wind subsidies can increase consumer surplus, even if consumers bear the subsidy costs. CO2 pricing, in contrast, increases aggregated producer surplus, even without free allocation of emission allowances; however, not all types of producers benefit. These findings are derived from an analytical model of electricity markets, and a calibrated numerical model of Northwestern Europe. Our findings imply that if policy makers want to avoid large redistribution they might prefer a mix of policies, even if CO2 pricing alone is the first-best climate policy in terms of allocative efficiency.

According to the EKC-theory, the process of economic growth is expected eventually to limit the environmental degradation created in the early stages of development. The EKC concept leads many researchers from the early 1990s to assume that each economy should focus on its growth, and any environmental problems will be eventually eliminated by the process of economic growth. Several studies attempt to test empirically the EKC-hypothesis using data on many countries and examining various types of environmental degradation, while other studies examine the underlying factors that may drive such a relationship. This article reviews the evolution of the EKC-concept and the possible causes of an EKC-pattern, like the distribution of income, the international trade (pollution haven hypothesis), structural changes, technical progress and improvements in energy efficiency, institutions and governance and consumer preferences. As CO2 emissions are a pollutant with global effects, several studies deal with the possible EKC-pattern for CO2 emissions and these studies are discussed separately. The various critiques on the EKC-concept are reviewed in the second article of this work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This calls for Demand Side Management solutions propelling change in behaviors of end consumers, with the aim to reduce overall consumption as well as shift it to periods in which demand is lower and where the cost of generating energy is lower. Demand Side Management solutions require detailed knowledge about the patterns of energy consumption. The profile of electricity demand in the residential sector is highly correlated with the time of active occupancy of the dwellings; therefore in this study the occupancy patterns in Spanish properties was determined using the 2009-2010 Time Use Survey (TUS), conducted by the National Statistical Institute of Spain. The survey identifies three peaks in active occupancy, which coincide with morning, noon and evening. This information has been used to input into a stochastic model which generates active occupancy profiles of dwellings, with the aim to simulate domestic electricity consumption. TUS data were also used to identify which appliance-related activities could be considered for Demand Side Management solutions during the three peaks of occupancy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the evidence remains controversial because the previous studies do not provide clear causality evidence. This might be attributed to the omitted variables bias because most previous studies only focus on the relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth in a bi-variate model. This paper attempts to re-investigate the relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth in Portugal using a multivariate model. Based on the bounds testing approach to cointegration and the Granger causality test within the vector error-correction model (VECM), our empirical results confirm the presence of cointegration among the variables. Moreover, there is evidence of bi-directional causality between electricity consumption and economic growth in the short- and long-run. This suggests that energy is an important source of economic growth in Portugal. Therefore, energy conservation policies should not be implemented because it would deteriorate the process of economic growth and development of the Portuguese economy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonlinearities are characterized by augmenting a standard linear model with polynomial functions of the exchange rate and with interactive dummy variables.

In this paper we take the view of a new entrant in this market acting as a third party provider of demand response. New entrants are a key player in emerging technological domains but simulation and policy analysis from this perspective have not been forthcoming. We present a novel approach for evaluating business models within a regulatory context and avoid committing to specific technical solutions but instead embark on a parameter exploration through simple yet insightful agent-based models. Our simulations analyse the impact of system performance by three key variables; participant population size, household flexibility in terms of the maximum number of DR events allowed and size of load shifting/shedding available. The simulations indicate that benefits of avoided capital investment leads to valuing a participating household at approximately 1800 over a 20 year period. These results show how mandated infrastructure influenced by policy can affect the value proposition of a demand response service and provide a useful reference for system level parameter requirements. With weak business models, policy decisions can be crucial in providing the impetus needed to spur growth in this market. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Shifting or reducing demand at critical moments can reduce the need for generation capacity, help with the integration of renewables, support more efficient system operation and thereby potentially lead to cost and carbon reductions for the entire energy system. In this paper we review the nature of the response resource of consumers from different non-domestic sectors in the UK, based on extensive half hourly demand profiles and observed demand responses. We further explore the potential to increase the demand response capacity through changes in the regulatory and market environment. The analysis suggests that present demand response measures tend to stimulate stand-by generation capacity in preference to load shifting and we propose that extended response times may favour load based demand response, especially in sectors with significant thermal loads.

We perform an assessment of the CO2 embodiment in the trade during the period between 2002 and 2010. We find that the scale effect has been a dominant effect contributing to an increase of CO2 emissions embodied in the bilateral trade through the years; while the composition effect seems to be a major driver for reducing CO2 embodiment in the exports of Australia to China. Based on an analysis of the difference between the amounts of actual CO2 embodiment and those in a hypothetical 'no-trade' scenario, we estimate that the 'net' CO2 emissions due to the bilateral trade declined from around 10 Mt of CO2 emissions in 2002 to -10 Mt in 2010; that is, the bilateral trade contributed to a reduction of the global carbon emissions in the recent years. This finding suggests that the rapid growth of exports of carbon-intensive goods from Australia to China has helped in reducing carbon emissions globally because carbon intensity factors of those goods are much lower in Australia than those in China.

This paper extends the link between the utilitarian criterion and the maximin for the cases with finite elasticity of marginal utility.

The concept is to convert organic waste into several products, such as electricity, biodiesel and organic fertilizer. It is labeled as the ACAD biorefinery. The simulation model of the ACAD biorefinery proved itself to be a powerful tool for understanding the symbioses and dynamics of the system, and therefore also a good tool for reaching political decisions. The model shows that the ACAD biorefinery could be totally independent of external energy supplies. Energy calculations indicate that more energy can be produced by combining the algae cultivation and anaerobic digestion processes. For every unit of energy entering the system in feedstock, 0.6 units of energy are exported as either biodiesel or electricity. The exported electricity accounts for approximately 30% of the total exported energy, while the remaining 70% is exported as biodiesel. By producing its own energy, the biorefinery improves its renewability and level of carbon neutrality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Long-term scenarios for the western United States,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity planning; Water-energy nexus; Western United States,POLICY,"Water is required for energy supply, and energy is required for water supply, creating problems as demand for both resources grows. We analyze this water-energy nexus as it affects long-run electricity planning in the western United States. We develop four scenarios assuming: no new constraints; limits on carbon emissions; limits on water use; and combined carbon and water limits. We evaluate these scenarios through 2100 under a range of carbon and water prices. The carbon-reducing scenarios become cost-effective at carbon prices of about $50-$70 per ton of CO2, moderately high but plausible within the century. In contrast, the water-conserving scenarios are not cost-effective until water prices reach thousands of dollars per acre-foot, well beyond foreseeable levels. This is due in part to the modest available water savings: our most and least water-intensive scenarios differ by less than 1% of the region's water consumption. Under our assumptions, Western electricity generation could be reshaped by the cost of carbon emissions, but not by the cost of water, over the course of this century. Both climate change and water scarcity are of critical importance, but only in the former is electricity generation central to the problem and its solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, recent Dutch disease perspective studies suggest that remittance inflows have the potential to impede manufacturing growth of the recipient economies. This paper contributes to the literature by investigating the effect of remittance inflows on manufacturing growth directly. The main claim of the paper is that the Dutch disease perspective identifies only one of the several channels through which remittance inflows impacts on manufacturing growth and hence unlikely to reflect the ultimate impact of remittances on manufacturing growth. This study uses the 3-digit level manufacturing data on a sample of 40 remittance-dependent economies over the period from 1991 to 2004. The empirical results indicate positive and robust effect of remittance inflows on manufacturing growth. This finding implies that one of the mechanisms through which remittance inflows could lift standards of living in poor countries is via the impact on manufacturing growth.","Jonkoping Int Business Sch, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Dzansi, J (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, POB 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",James.Dzansi@jibs.hj.se,,,,,,,58,14,15,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Its intent was to greatly accelerate emissions reductions from port activities. The CAAP was unprecedented in several ways: it was a voluntary agreement between two competing ports; it was achieved with the cooperation of local, state and federal agencies; it promised large particulate emissions reductions along with continued port growth, and it had a price tag of $2.1 billion. What explains the Ports' decision to implement the CAAP? We conduct a case study to explore alternative explanations for the CAAP. Using data from interviews, media, and the history of events leading up to the CAAP, we find that the CAAP was a strategic response to social and political pressures that had built up over the previous decade.

To add to the policy debate this paper estimates two models that account for the dynamic nature of emissions of carbon dioxide emissions at the state-level from 1980-2010 while taking account of scale, technique, and composition effects. When stochastic trends are taken account of, an environmental Kuznets curve relationship with a feasible turning point is found for carbon dioxide emissions.

A social capital analytical framework was developed to analyse the data. The analysis found that two communities inhabited the area for which the windfarm development was proposed. The public participation process failed to address the concerns of both communities and led to the emergence of a social network of resistance. The network had high stocks of bridging social capital, which enabled an effective protest that led to the abandonment of the development. Their effectiveness was inadvertently aided by the windfarm supporters who were unable to act collectively to defend their interests because socio-economic changes in the community among other factors had led to a depletion of their social capital. In this context, different democratic participatory processes were needed to address the concerns of the two communities.

These effects may drive increases in electricity prices, as such prices reflect the cost of running existing power stations as well as building new ones. This study uses Canterbury and Central Otago as case studies because both regions face similar issues in building new hydro-dams and ever-increasing electricity prices that will eventually prompt households to buy power at higher prices. One way for households to respond to these price changes is to generate their own electricity through microgeneration technologies (MGT). The objective of this study is to investigate public perception and preferences regarding MGT and to analyze the factors that influence people's decision to adopt such new technologies in New Zealand. The study uses a multivariate probit approach to examine households' willingness to adopt any one MGT system or a combination of the MGT systems. Our findings provide valuable information for policy makers and marketers who wish to promote effective microgeneration technologies. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study analyses how local differences between municipalities, such as local wind prerequisites and socioeconomic conditions, might explain the establishment of wind power. The analysis is carried out for a cross section of Swedish municipalities. The time periods before and after 2006 are analyzed separately; and results reveal that the factors affecting wind power establishments are different between the two periods. In the later time period we found a statistically significant positive relationship between good wind resources and the presence of wind power as well as with the amount of wind energy installed. This result is consistent with the idea that the first wind power investments in Sweden were highly affected by individual wind energy enthusiasts, while in the more recent large-scale investments market-based judgments about future profitability may have become increasingly important. In addition, previous experience seems to be a factor that in itself facilitates additional future wind power establishments, thereby pointing to the role of accumulated institutional capacity.

These multiple energy sources make prediction of PHEV energy consumption challenging and also complicate evaluation of their environmental impacts. This paper introduces a novel PHEV energy consumption modeling approach and compares it to a second approach from the literature, each using actual trip patterns from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The first approach applies distance-dependent fuel efficiency and on-road electricity consumption rates based on naturalistic or real world, driving information to determine gasoline and electricity consumption. The second uses consumption rates derived in accordance with government certification testing. Both approaches are applied in the context of a location-specific case study that focuses on the state of Michigan. The two PHEV models show agreement in electricity demand due to vehicle charging, gasoline consumption, and life cycle environmental impacts for this case study. The naturalistic drive cycle approach is explored as a means of extending location-specific driving data to supplement existing PHEV impact assessments methods. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The Conservation Supply Curve (CSC) used in this study is an analytical tool that captures both the engineering and the economic perspectives of energy conservation. Using bottom-up CSC models, the cumulative cost-effective and technical electricity and fuel savings, as well as the CO2 emission reduction potentials for the Chinese cement industry for 2010-2030 are estimated. By comparison, the total final energy saving achieved by the implementation of these 23 efficiency measures in the Chinese cement industry over 20 years (2010-2030) is equal to 30% of the total primary energy supply of Latin America or Middle East or around 71% of primary energy supply of Brazil in 2007.

The strategic interaction between the UK government, a producer and a shipper has been analyzed in a game theoretical model. A complex interaction between players is expected given (1) dwindling resources and large decommissioning liabilities and (2) the fact that much of the hydrocarbons produced in the North Sea are exported through an infrastructure with shared ownership. The 2011 UK tax adjustment will most likely result in value destruction for the government, producers and shippers. Our analysis suggests that governments are unlikely to ultimately benefit from reducing their decommission liabilities at the expense of International Oil Companies. In countries with unstable tax regimes, such as the UK, International Oil Companies will adopt their strategies in anticipation of future tax changes. Their adopted strategy is a function of decommissioning liabilities and remaining reserves as well as whether they are producers, shippers or producers and shippers. The ultimate payoff of a government is a function of the remaining reserves and total decommissioning liabilities, but also depends on the distribution of these value metrics between producers and shippers.

The entire blending requirement has to come from molasses (by-product of sugarcane). Ethanol produced from molasses will not be able to meet the blending targets due to cyclical nature of sugar cane production resulting in shortage of molasses and its competing uses (potable and pharmaceutical use). This has promoted research efforts to augment energy sources that are sustainable and economically viable. One such source that can be commercially exploited for ethanol production is sweet sorghum. The sugars in the stalks of sweet sorghum can be crushed to produce juice, which can be processed into ethanol for blending. An attempt is made in this paper to assess viability of ethanol production from sweet sorghum. Net Present Value (NPV), the indicator of economic viability assessment, is negative and would thus be difficult for the industry to take off under the current scenario of ethanol price, feedstock price and ethanol recovery rate. Hence, an enabling environment and policy support for bio-ethanol production from sweet sorghum is crucial to meet future blending requirements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We found high levels of acceptance for wind energy in general and for local wind farms in all three counties despite the differences in actual development. Multiple statistical methods were employed to identify factors leading to support of wind turbines within the community, but support was so high that no individual factors were identified as statistically significant. The survey and interviews showed that reasons for support of wind energy include economic benefits to the local community, environmental benefits and the protection of the agricultural lifestyle and landscape. Reasons for opposition include concerns about setback distances, impacts on rural lifestyles, and. impacts on other types of development.

This paper communicates key insights and conclusions from a larger study that conducted review work, policy analysis, and interviews with actors in the global CCS community (Varnas et al., 2012). No judgment is made of the desirability of choosing CCS as a low carbon technology option, but if this technology is indeed pursued, four challenges are found to be 10 times greater than often recognized. These are; (i) a tenfold up-scaling in size (MW) from pilot plants to that of commercial demonstration, (ii) a tenfold increase in number of large scale demonstration plants actually being constructed, (iii) a tenfold increase in available annual funding over the coming 40 years and, (iv) a tenfold increase in the price put on carbon dioxide emissions. It is clear that the current development path will not fulfil expectations of CCS being commercially available at the end of this decade, nor will CCS be widely applied in time for significant contributions to needed CO2 emission reductions. CCS will only be developed if policymakers continue to favour coal based power generation while simultaneously developing stringent climate policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Rural development strategies often claim to stimulate new firm foundations, for example, by supporting locally active volunteer organizations for economic development. Based on survey data from 254 rural Swiss municipalities, this paper analyses the influence of different types of volunteer organizations on new firm foundations by applying a zero-inflated Poisson regression approach. The results suggest that, generally, a higher number of volunteer organizations positively influence the foundation of local firms. Too many bonding' associations for economic development, however, lead to decreasing foundations. Exclusive support of organizations for economic development is thus not effective for stimulating new firm foundations in rural areas.","[Schulz, Tobias; Baumgartner, Daniel] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Schulz, T (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zuercherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",tobias.schulz@wsl.ch; daniel.baumgartner@wsl.ch,"Schulz, Tobias/E-8129-2014","Schulz, Tobias/0000-0003-1307-778X",,,,,72,9,9,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The analysis reveals an intricate pattern of spatial clustering, fragmentation, persistence and mobility. Whilst average insolvency rates have increased, levels of spatial inequality have fallen, implying a degree of convergence. However, there is considerable mobility of areas within the distribution. A widespread and growing spatial cluster of high insolvency rate areas is located across South West England and a shrinking cluster with low rates is centred in London.","Univ Plymouth, Dept Econ, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Bishop, P (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Dept Econ, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",paul.bishop@plymouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,5,6,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, the exogenous weights matrix is usually developed in a strictly spatial context, even when data are collected over time. This paper develops a spatio-temporal weights matrix and uses the new definition to evaluate spatial dependence using Moran's I index applied to real estate data for Quebec City from 1986 to 1996. The results are compared with the original Moran's I index using a strictly spatial weights matrix specification based on Euclidian distance or contiguity. The findings suggest that ignoring the temporal dimension could lead to misinterpretation of the real' measure of spatial dependence over time. However, the time dimension cannot explain the total spatial autocorrelation since the Moran's I index is still significant even when adjusting for time consideration. The differences between the estimated indices and statistics depend on the structure of the spatial and the temporal weights matrices that are used to construct the complete spatio-temporal weights matrix.","[Dube, Jean] Univ Quebec, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Legros, Diego] Lab Econ & Gest, F-21006 Dijon, France",University of Quebec; Universite de Bourgogne,"Dubé, J (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",jean_dube@uqar.qc.ca; diego.legros@u-bourgogne.fr,"Dubé, Jean/L-1751-2019; Dubé, John/P-2731-2015","Dubé, Jean/0000-0003-3445-3449;",,,,,63,41,46,7,81,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Recent scholarly work has addressed whether decentralization affects economic growth and regional disparities, by typically resorting to fiscal decentralization, while disregarding political decentralization indices. This article covers this gap by investigating the association between different political decentralization indices with two measures of economic performance: changes in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and in territorial inequalities. The results suggest a lack of statistical relationship between political decentralization and economic growth, regardless of how political decentralization is measured. In the case of regional disparities, the results depend on the index used and range from the absence of a link to a positive association between both factors.","[Ezcurra, Roberto] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, E-31006 Pamplona, Spain; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",Universidad Publica de Navarra; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia S-N, E-31006 Pamplona, Spain.",roberto.ezcurra@unavarra.es; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",,,,,64,64,70,2,86,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The Austrian energy plan aims at increasing the currently installed wind power capacity from approximately 1 GW to 3 GW until 2020 including an additional capacity of 700 MW until 2015. The aim of this analysis is to assess economically viable wind turbine sites under current feed-in tariffs considering constraints imposed by infrastructure, the natural environment and ecological preservation zones in Austria. We analyze whether the policy target of installing an additional wind power capacity of 700 MW until 2015 is attainable under current legislation and developed a GIS based decision system for wind turbine site selection. Results show that the current feed-in tariff of 9.7 ct kW h(-1) may trigger an additional installation of 3544 MW. The current feed-in tariff can therefore be considered too high as wind power deployment would exceed the target by far. Our results indicate that the targets may be attained more cost-effectively by applying a lower feed-in tariff of 9.1 ct kW h(-1). Thus, windfall profits at favorable sites and deadweight losses of policy intervention can be minimized while still guaranteeing the deployment of additional wind power capacities.

We find that the quality of institutions as measured by the experience of free city-state and the presence of a university has a positive effect on urban development, whereas we could not find a robust impact of the quality of regional government. However, we also find that cities located in mountain areas grew less than cities located in lowlands, possibly with access to the sea.

Despite the Clean Development Mechanism and other efforts to diffuse low carbon technologies to developing countries, China has over the last decades continued to construct hundreds of new thermal coal power plants leading not only to skyrocketing emissions in the present but also to long-term carbon lock-in. In light of this, China is likely to continue to put strong upward pressure on global emissions for many decades to come. Ignoring the seriousness of this situation, many rich countries have persisted to seek marginal improvements to intermittent low-energy sources such as wind power rather than taking the lead in developing breakthrough baseload technologies such as nuclear fusion. This paper argues that only such high-energy technologies, if made significantly cheaper than any fossil alternatives, will be capable of breaking the current carbon lock-in process in China and other developing countries.

From the perspective of study of typological region, taking the typical traditional industrial region-Liaoning Province of China as a case, this study establishes a system dynamics model named EECP and dynamically simulates CO2 emission trends under different conditions. Simulation results indicate, compared to the condition without CO2 emission reduction policies, CO2 emission intensity under the condition of implementing CO2 emission reduction policies of Twelfth Five-Year Plan is decreased by 11% from 2009 to 2030, but the economic cost is high, making the policies implementation faces resistance. Then some improved policies are offered and proved by EECP model that they can reduce CO2 emission intensity after 2021 and decrease the negative influence to GDP, realizing the improvement objects of reducing CO2 emission and simultaneously keeping a higher economy growth speed. The improved policies can provide reference for making and improving CO2 emission reduction policies in other traditional industrial regions with large CO2 emission. Simultaneously. EECP model can provide decision-makers with reference and help for similar study of energy policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end we first put forward two possible household consumption expenditure patterns up to 2050 using the Working-Leser model, taking into account total expenditure increase and urbanization. For comparison, both expenditure patterns are then incorporated in a hybrid recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model. The results reveal that as income level increases in the coming decades, the direct and indirect household energy requirements and CO2 emissions would rise drastically. When household expenditure shifts from material products and transport to service-oriented goods, around 21,000 mtce(1) of primary energy and 45 billion tons of CO2 emissions would be saved over the 45-year period from 2005 to 2050. Moreover, carbon prices in the dematerialized mitigation scenario would fall by 13% in 2050, thus reducing the economic cost. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper provides a link between two major streams of the literature: the functions of innovation systems and the literature on renewable electricity support schemes. We show that, when a functional perspective is adopted, feed-in tariffs are likely to be superior to other policy instruments (quotas with tradable green certificates and tendering), although they still need to be complemented with other instruments, most importantly, direct R&D support. Furthermore, those innovation effects are affected by the specific design elements of the instruments chosen. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

I used the linear approximation almost ideal demand system (LAAIDS) with normalized prices to compute expenditure elasticity and a multinomial logit model (MLM) to examine household fuel use. The LAAIDS model result showed that expenditure was elastic for modern fuels, but inelastic for traditional fuels. Regression results from the MLM indicated that fuel choice behaviour of rural households could be more accurately described as 'fuel stacking' behaviour as opposed to the 'energy ladder' hypothesis. In rural areas household fuel choice may be constrained by limited access to commercial fuels and efficient cook stoves, supply dependency and affordability, consumer preferences and a web of other intricate factors. Rural households had less incentive for fuel switching due to underlying factors and the availability of fuel wood without direct financial cost. With continued deforestation and receding forests, households are expected to develop inter fuel substitution and switching behaviour conditional on access to modern energy technologies.

The main objective of this work is to build energy scenarios for the future - with a focus on the electricity production system - and explore how these scenarios are reflected in economic, environmental terms and in terms of energy efficiency. The main tool which is used in the scenario analysis is LEAP (Long range Energy Alternatives Planning System). The scenarios are essentially the result of developing storylines driven by the uncertainties which cannot be controlled by the analysts or decision makers, and technical and non-technical options the analyst or decision maker may choose from. A set of uncertainties is considered as a possible future or storyline, and one or more options can be selected as a possible strategy. The combination of a storyline and a specific strategy gives a scenario. The main uncertainties for the Greek energy system are identified and various technical options are explored. Rather than using a model which leads to optimum strategies from a set of alternatives, the model in use will apply different strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By extending Brechling and Smith's (1994) and Hassett and Metcalfs (1995) models, it is shown that the application of the Energy Act 2011, which contains provisions on the Green Deal, the new Energy Company Obligation (ECO) and the private rented sector, needs to follow a tailored strategy to reach the low adoption households identified by my model. Moreover, for the current adopters of the analysed measures, average monetary and environmental adoption benefits are estimated based on Parti and Parti's (1980) demand model. These estimates are smaller than their expected values showing an important energy efficiency gap in the sector. Particularly low cost measures can bring important savings that can help to meet the pay as you save rule (i.e., the Golden rule) of the new regulation. My model also shows that a poor state of dwelling repair can reduce the adoption benefits increasing the need of subsidies that will be financed through consumer's energy bills. However, this can increase the number of households in fuel poverty. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Large scale integration of RES requires a suitable mixture of compatible generation units, in order to deal with the intermittency of wind velocity and solar irradiation. The scope of this paper is to examine the impact of large scale integration of intermittent energy sources, required to meet the 2020 RES target, on the generation expansion plan, the fuel mix and the spinning reserve requirements of the Greek electricity system. We perform hourly simulation of the intermittent RES generation to estimate residual load curves on a monthly basis, which are then inputted in a WASP-IV model of the Greek power system. We find that the decarbonisation effort, with the rapid entry of RES and the abolishment of the grandfathering of CO2 allowances, will radically transform the Greek electricity sector over the next 10 years, which has wide-reaching policy implications.

Historically, energy provision and management has not usually been a strategic priority for UK local authorities. Yet energy considerations are implicit in key local authority responsibilities such as transport, waste management, planning, and the provision of housing services. In addition, recent UK central government policies support the move to localism and provide incentives for low-carbon energy generation. A study was undertaken to assess the potential (including both the perceived benefits and actual capacity to deliver) for Leeds City Council to develop a strategic body to execute delivery of city-level energy decision-making. We examine the perceived benefits to a range of main stakeholders, using data drawn from interviews with managers responsible for low-carbon and renewable energy projects across the city. Through participant observation we explore the capacity of a local authority to deliver a strategic energy body, and we briefly examine the possible forms of delivery. We conclude with recommendations for national policy that would enable the development of strategic energy bodies across local governments in the UK. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The available analyses of sustainability, however, have poorly assessed the role of the financial system in scenarios of future global change. Here we contrast current global flows in the financial system with the future economic costs of a worldwide transition to renewable energies under the baseline and 450 ppm scenarios for emissions of greenhouse gases proposed by the IPCC. We show that annual global financial flows are three orders of magnitude greater than the annual economic costs of policies for global sustainability. A small global tax on financial transactions of 0.05% could thus provide the required funds for the deployment of renewable energies. To assess the roles of the financial sector in future policies for sustainability, we identified 14 key international actors and enumerated 16 key policies for sustainability that should be implemented to achieve effective global ecological and financial sustainability. We conclude that the proposed structural reforms to the financial system are essential steps urgently required for financing a global transition to a sustainable economy. Consequently, we suggest that the international scientific community should urgently pursue an academic consensus on policy recommendations for the financial sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the EPC is to inform building buyers about the energy performance and energy costs of buildings. The EPCs represent a specific energy policy tool to orient the building sector and real-estate markets toward higher energy efficiency buildings. The effectiveness of the EPC depends on two factors: center dot The accuracy of energy performance evaluation made by independent experts. center dot The capability of the energy classification and of the scale of energy performance to control the energy index fluctuations. In this paper, the results of a case study located in Italy are shown. In this example, 162 independent technicians on energy performance of building evaluation have studied the same building. The results reveal which part of confidence intervals is dependent on software misunderstanding and that the energy classification ranges are able to tolerate the fluctuation of energy indices. The example was chosen in accordance with the legislation of the Emilia-Romagna Region on Energy Efficiency of Buildings. Following these results, some thermo-economic evaluation related to building and energy labelling are illustrated, as the EPC, which is an energy policy tool for the real-estate market and building sector to find a way to build or retrofit an energy efficiency building.

The results suggest that the negative effect of the use of renewables supplants the positive effect of creating income by exploiting a natural resource locally, and thus growth does not appear to improve with the change towards renewables. The high costs of promoting renewables are probably being placed excessively upon the economy, namely by increasing the costs of electricity tariffs, thus inducing a deceleration in economic activity. Fossil fuels lead to dissimilar effects on growth while natural gas does not appear to be relevant in explaining growth. Coal hampers the capacity for growth, whereas the use of oil stimulates that growth. This is in line with productive structures that are deeply grounded in fossil fuels, particularly oil.

This methodology takes eight related indicators to the social, environmental and economic dimensions in order to calculate a general sustainability indicator for the energy sector. In this methodology, the weight of each dimension is different: namely, the social and environmental issues have less relevance than the economic issues. The authors use this methodology because government institutions as the Department of Energy and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources have used some indicators from such a methodology to propose plans, programs, projects and bills. Authors know of the existence of other methodologies about sustainability. Nonetheless, opting for the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean's methodology is convenient because this organization is a respectable authority for civil servants from the Mexican institutions.

The government has responded to the crisis with a new feed-in-tariff to promote increased utilization of renewable energy, and proposed to reduce the dependence on nuclear power. In this viewpoint, we liken the transition implied by recently updated goals for the diffusion of renewables in Japan to the transition in Germany in the last decade. We argue that some of the lessons learned in Germany might prove valuable for the steps Japan considers taking. In particular, we focus on the new Japanese feed-in tariff for solar photovoltaics. In view of the recent developments in Germany, we emphasize the importance of the scheme's political legitimacy, which needs to be maintained through adequate design of both policy instrument and political process.

In order to fill this gap in the literature, this paper empirically analyzes whether there is a relationship between the share of aged population and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from road transportation by applying a quadratic function. Using international panel data, it also addresses the level of the turning point in the relationships between the share of aged population and CO2 emissions. The analysis in this paper uses a first-order differential equation to estimate an inverted U-shaped relationship between them in order to alleviate the unit roots issue. The results from 25 OECD countries, consisting mainly of European countries and Japan, indicate that there is a quadratic relationship between CO2 emissions per capita and the share of aged population, and that the turning point is around 16 percent. The results also imply that a relative increase in the number of elderly people is associated with a decrease in CO2 emissions per capita from the road sector when the share of aged population reaches more than 16 percent.

One type involves differing racial compositions between spatial locations. The other is concerned with varying residential spatial distributions between ethnic groups. This paper presents a spatial analytical approach to identify and measure the two types of variance through a decomposition of an entropy index regarding racial diversity. A region's racial diversity entropy is found to comprise three factors: (a) the overall spatial distribution of regional population; (b) the ratio between the number of ethnic groups and that of spatial areal units within the region, and (c) the differential between two types of variance aforementioned. For demonstrative purpose census data from Los Angeles County are studied using this approach. The results suggest the second type of variance to be the primary contributor to the increasing racial diversity in Los Angeles.

The diesel route comprises of a shift from heavy fuel oil to marine gas oil and then a gradual shift to biodiesel, whereas the gas route comprises of a shift to liquefied natural gas and then a gradual shift to liquefied biogas. The two routes are assessed in a case study for the ferry traffic between the Swedish mainland and the island Gotland. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental performance with the functional unit chosen to be one year of ro-pax ferry service, including both passenger and goods transportation. The gas route is indicated to have better overall environmental performance than the diesel route. Furthermore, use of biofuels is illustrated as one possible measure to decrease the global warming impact from shipping, but to the expense of greater environmental impact for some other impact categories. As an example, the global warming potential (GWP(100)) was shown to decrease with the use of biofuels in this study, while the eutrophication potential and the primary energy use increased.

In response, American energy multinationals have built power plants just south of the border that export most of their electricity to the U.S. This development has stirred considerable controversy because these plants effectively skirt U.S. air pollution regulations in a severely degraded international airshed. Yet to our knowledge, this concern has not been subjected to rigorous scrutiny. This paper uses a suite of air dispersion, health impacts, and valuation models to assess the human health damages in the U.S. and Mexico caused by air emissions from two power-exporting plants in Mexicali, Baja California. We find that these emissions have limited but nontrivial health impacts, mostly by exacerbating particulate pollution in the U.S., and we value these damages at more than half a million dollars per year. These findings demonstrate that power-exporting plants can have cross-border health effects and bolster the case for systematically evaluating their environmental impacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The CA, as endorsed by COP16 in Cancun, aims to combat global warming with differentiated reduction targets of greenhouse gas emissions and by mobilizing resources supporting adaptation and carbon-free technology in developing countries (DCs). Using a special version of MERGE, we study the global implications of the CA postulating extensions of the Accord in the direction of Technology Transfer Protocols (TTPs). We assess scenarios needed to reach sustainable climate targets under such Protocols. It is shown that without binding commitments for DCs, the warming target of 2 degrees C will be exceeded with a probability above 50%, even if Annex B countries eliminate their emissions. However, moderate commitments of DCs (when they reach sufficient economic development), make the 2 degrees C scenario feasible. TTPs combined with binding emission reduction targets thus provide a mechanism to reduce climate change damages, and may generate significant secondary benefits. For example, the reduced tax-subsidy scenario (RTS20) has 77% to 40% chances to remain below 2 degrees C of warming and an undiscounted cumulative gross domestic product (GDP) cost of 0.75% relative to baseline (not accounting for the benefits of avoided damages).

As an important component of our work on the Fuel Economy and Environmental Impacts (FEEI) model, we collected VKT survey data in China from available sources and conducted additional surveys during 2004 and 2010, from which we derived Via values and VKT-age functions by vehicle type for China. We also projected the future VKT for China by examining the relationship of vehicle use to per-capita GDP in 20 other countries worldwide. The purpose of this work is to achieve a better understanding of vehicle-use intensity in China and to generate reliable VKT input (current and future Via levels) for the FEEI model.

The proposed approach assumes that government estimates are efficient with a finite lag. It takes no stand on whether earlier revisions are the result of news or of reductions in noise. We present asymptotic performance results in the scalar case and illustrate the technique using several simple models of economic activity. In each case, it outperforms both conventional VAR analysis and the original Howrey method. It produces GDP forecasts that are competitive with those of professional forecasters.

Using a novel methodology, we estimate the year-round energy savings to be obtained from advancing Indian Standard Time (IST), from the introduction of DST, and from dividing the country into two time zones. We find that the option of advancing IST consistently saves more energy than the corresponding DST option, which in turn saves more energy than the corresponding time zones option. This is because the energy benefits of advancing IST accrue for the entire year throughout the country, whereas the benefits of DST are confined to summer months and the benefits of two time zones are largely in the lower energy consuming eastern region. We recommend advancing IST by half-hour to being six hours ahead of UTC. This confers the advantages of DST and time zones without their disadvantages and is forecast to save more than 2 billion kWh of electricity every year during evening peaks that are difficult to supply. While these results are India-specific, similar exercises would be useful to many other countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ahuja, Dilip R.; SenGupta, D.

In the present study, exergy analysis has been used to examine the energy consumption of an existing Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) process and then to test for possible savings in primary energy consumption and environmental protection. In the first step, energy and exergy balances of a steam methane reforming process were established to identify the thermodynamic imperfections of the process. Recommendations from this study have contributed to the building of a new and more efficient process. Consequently, a heat exchanger, corresponding to 44.9% of the total required area for the SMR heat exchange, has been incorporated in the SMR for waste heat recovery. The thermal and exergetic efficiencies of the original process are 70% and 65.5%, respectively. For the new process, the thermal and exergetic efficiencies are 74% and 69.1%, respectively. The unused exergy is reduced by 9.3% from 125.9 to 114.2 kJ per mole of H-2 produced. One mole of methane produces 2.48 mol of H-2 compared to 2.35 mol of H-2 produced in the original process. Furthermore, the new SMR process produces the lower greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a knowledge gap exists on the extent to which Irish farmers would actually choose to grow these crops. An extension of the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFIT) scheme to include the co-firing of biomass with peat in electricity generation would enable the power stations to enter into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). These offer a fixed price to farmers for biomass feedstock. The decision to adopt biomass is represented as a constrained problem under certainty with the objective of profit maximisation. The results showed that the price offered under a PPA has a large effect on the economic returns from biomass crops. The price that the power stations previously estimated they would be able to pay, at epsilon 46 and epsilon 48 per tonne for willow and miscanthus, respectively, was used as a starting point. At this price the number of farmers who would choose to adopt biomass production is insufficient to achieve the national co-firing target. The target could be achieved at epsilon 70 and epsilon 65 per tonne for willow and miscanthus, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For price contributions, Roland-Holst and Sancho (1995) used the SAM structure to analyse the price and cost linkages through a representation of the interdependence between activities, households and factors. This paper is a further analysis of the cost transmission mechanisms, in which we add the capital account to the endogenous components of the Roland-Holst and Sancho approach. By doing this we reflect the responses of prices to the exogenous shocks in saving and investment. We also present an additive decomposition of the global price effects into categories of interdependence that isolates the impact on price levels of shocks in the capital account.

Regional policy and university knowledge transfer: perspectives from devolved regions in the UK, Regional Studies. This paper constitutes a policy analysis of university knowledge transfer-related initiatives in the devolved regions of Scotland and Wales. Both regions are seeking to develop science-based innovation strategies in which universities play a central role. Scotland appears fairly well advanced in this regard, whilst in Wales the establishment of regional networks linking actors has been more problematic. It is concluded that whilst devolution has facilitated significant supply-side intervention, future intervention will require a stimulus in the demand for university knowledge.

The empirical analysis highlights the importance of both pecuniary and non-pecuniary motives behind multiple job-holding, and reveals significant variations in its incidence across regions, with areas that have a large primary sector having higher multiple job-holding rates.

The analysis reveals regional differences in deadweight spending in proportional and, particularly, in monetary terms.

Drawing on a survey of pharmaceutical plants and interviews with transnational pharmaceutical plants, it is shown that vigorous growth is occurring in the incidence of process R&D. The paper supports the utility of a multilevel systems perspective on subsidiary evolution. The external environment, internal environment and subsidiary drivers are seen to drive upgrading in a systemic way.

Hjort and Claeskens (2003) also have presented model averaging as an alternative to model selection, and suggested a local misspecification framework for studying the limiting distributions and asymptotic risk properties of post-model selection and model average estimators in parametric models. Despite the burgeoning literature on Tobit models, little work has been done on model selection explicitly in the Tobit context. In this article we propose FICs for variable selection allowing for such measures as mean absolute deviation, mean squared error, and expected expected linear exponential errors in a type I Tobit model with an unknown threshold. We also develop a model average Tobit estimator using values of a smoothed version of the FIC as weights.. We study the finite-sample performance of model selection and model average estimators resulting from various FICs via a Monte Carlo experiment, and demonstrate the possibility of using a model screening procedure before combining the models. Finally, we present an example from a well-known study on married women's working hours to illustrate the estimation methods discussed.

In light of the legally binding targets to reduce carbon emissions, new housing is subject to a tightening of regulations governing energy demand and efficiency resulting in a gradual improvement in carbon emissions. The question is how to achieve the deep carbon emission reductions from existing domestic properties, of which 75% will still be in use in 2050. Government has sought to provide incentives to homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their households, and mandate improvements in socially rented housing using a range of fiscal measures, most recently the 'Green Deal'. There has however been little consideration of the 18% of UK households who privately rent their home, a tenure that is growing fast. The aim of this research is to investigate the factors that influence private sector landlords when considering energy efficiency improvements to their tenanted homes. The results indicate that government policy has consistently failed to engage private sector landlords in the issue of energy efficiency and thus measures must be taken to understand the motivations of landlords in order to design effective incentives and interventions.

Integrating CCS in a power plant adds significant costs which can be offset by a sufficient CO2 price. However, most markets have failed: currently, the weak carbon price threatens CCS deployment in the European Union (EU). In China, a carbon regulation is appearing and CCS encounters a rising interest. This study investigates two questions: how much is the extra-cost of a CCS plant in the EU in comparison with China? Second, what is the CO2 price beyond which CCS plants become more profitable than reference plants in the EU and in China? To address these issues, I conducted a literature review on public studies about CCS costs. To objectively assess the profitability of CCS plants, I constructed a net present value model to calculate the Levelised Cost of Electricity and the breakeven CO2 price. CCS plants become the most profitable plant type beyond 115 /tCO(2) in the Eli vs. 45 (sic)/tCO(2) in China (offshore transport and storage costs). I advise on the optimal plant type choice depending on the CO2 price in both countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A survey conducted in the provinces of Shanxi, Zhejiang, and Guizhou shows that 37 percent of rural households use bioenergy for heating and cooking and that bioenergy accounts for 18 percent of their total energy consumption. Most of the biomass used for energy is burned in traditional stoves, contributing to indoor air pollution in rural homes. Crop residues also are commonly burned in the fields, contributing to the high level of outdoor air pollution in China. Our econometric analysis of the key determinants of bioenergy use shows that bioenergy consumption falls modestly with income growth, increased time required for biomass collection, and less farmland. Hence, open burning of some biomass is an optimal choice and is likely to become more of a problem without policy intervention. These findings suggest that a more sustainable use of biomass requires policies that promote cleaner, more efficient bioenergy combustion technologies and increase the economic value of biomass such that local households can benefit from biomass collection.

The types and functions of institutions and their overall structure are examined in light of global energy market trends. In South East Asia, the shift attempted by ASEAN towards more competitive markets is hampered by the remaining statist variants of the trade institution and bilateral energy diplomacy, which, as regards transaction cost functions, are sub-optimal. As for institutions with order-creating functions, the unresolved status of sovereignty within ASEAN hampers regulatory harmonisation; the great power management institution has since ASEAN's establishment reduced conflicts without providing decisive leadership conducive to integration. North East Asia's dependence on global energy markets overshadows the regional integration potential of the diverse liberalisation efforts and interconnection projects. Bilateral energy diplomacies, new trilateral institutions combined with 'Track Two' institutions and remaining great power competition coexist. In both regions the institutional structure allows for step-wise, technical infrastructure integration. The environmental stewardship institution co-exists with statist energy security and development objectives while it supports cooperation on green energy. The overall structure of informal institutions constrains deeper energy market integration in several ways. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate how nudges - a slight change in the information set that an individual faces when taking a decision - can help individuals align behaviour with intention. We present evidence from an original survey experiment on which nudges affect the choice whether to contract renewable energy or conventional energy. We find that only a default nudge has a significant effect, while all other nudges prove ineffective.

First, there is a perceived need to diversify the sources of crude oil in order to avoid too much reliance on the Middle East. Following the inauguration of the Sakhalin oil projects and completion of the ESPO pipeline, Russian crude oil is nearing a 10% share in the Japanese market. It is suggested that Russian crude oil supplies have been chosen due to their proximity, safety and flexibility, and their positive effect on Japan's bargaining power in relation to crude suppliers in the Middle East. Second, Japan's shift from nuclear to LNG in power generation after the Fukushima accident in March 2011 increased LNG imports by 25% in just two years. While Qatar expanded its market share the most, Russia also gained, even though it only had one operational LNG project in Sakhalin-2. Russian companies are now working on several LNG projects in Northeast Asia and the Arctic region. However, the resumption of nuclear power in Japan might have a negative impact on new Russian LNG projects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Since network structures drive the innovative and economic performance of actors in regional contexts, it is crucial to explain how networks form and evolve over time and how they facilitate inter-organizational learning and knowledge transfer. The analysis of relational dependent variables, however, requires specific statistical procedures. In this paper, we discuss four different models that have been used in economic geography to explain the spatial context of network structures and their dynamics. First, we review gravity models and their recent extensions and modifications to deal with the specific characteristics of networked (individual level) relations. Second, we discuss the quadratic assignment procedure that has been developed in mathematical sociology for diminishing the bias induced by network dependencies. Third, we present exponential random graph models that not only allow dependence between observations, but also model such network dependencies explicitly. Finally, we deal with dynamic networks, by introducing stochastic actor-oriented models. Strengths and weaknesses of the different approach are discussed together with domains of applicability the geography of innovation studies.","[Broekel, Tom] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Balland, Pierre-Alexandre; van Oort, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Burger, Martijn] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Leibniz University Hannover; Utrecht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Broekel, T (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",broekel@wigeo.uni-hannover.de; p.balland@uu.nl; mburger@ese.eur.nl; f.g.vanoort@uu.nl,"Broekel, Tom/K-7048-2014; Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020; CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022","Broekel, Tom/0000-0003-4516-4626; Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X; Balland, Pierre-Alexandre/0000-0003-2787-4376",,,,,126,86,98,8,100,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Although the initiative has reduced the load curve during peak times due to the reduced use of electric showerheads, measurement and verification (M&V) are needed to validate the savings. M&V procedures should take into account the social and economic variability of low-income housing developments. To improve M&V in low-income housing projects, this paper presents a methodology for identifying homogeneous subgroups based on their energy-saving potential. This research strategy involved a cluster analysis designed to improve the understanding of what energy savers and other influencing factors exist. A case study in Londrina Brazil was undertaken with 200 low-income families. Five clusters, created based on savings potential, were defined. The results showed that only two clusters demonstrated good electricity savings, representing 47% of families. However, two clusters, or 37%, did not provide satisfactory savings, and the other 16% did not provide any consumption history due to previous use of illegal city electricity connection practices. Therefore, studies confirm the need for a detailed measurement of the representative subgroups to assess the influence of human behaviour on potential SWHS-induced savings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we compare cross-country implications of alternative climate policies, including unilateral and multilateral climate policies. Our main findings are as follows. Firstly, there are large differences in cross-country effects of alternative unilateral climate policies, when the same given carbon emission reductions are achieved in each abating country respectively. Meanwhile, cross-border externalities undermine efficiency of unilateral climate policies. Secondly, there are significant differences in cross-country implications of alternative multilateral climate policies, when the same global emission reductions are allocated in several different ways among abating countries. Thirdly, it is difficult to reach a stable global climate treaty, since any abating country has the incentive to argue for small carbon emission reductions. Finally, multilateral climate policies can reduce the negative impacts of cross-border externalities, but cannot cure all cross-border externalities. Looking ahead, it will be a great policy challenge for the world to reduce carbon emissions in a cost-effective way. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper constructs cost models to calculate costs per unit energy saving of SWHs in 27 Chinese provincial capital cities. The cost effectiveness of SWHs is examined at the national level. At a micro level, we analyze the financial attractiveness of consumers' investment in SWHs. A panel data model is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of a subsidy program in rural China. The results show that SWH costs, ranging from 0305 to 0.744 CNY/kW h, are much lower than those of other major renewable energies across China. This finding indicates that the diffusion of SWHs is a cost-effective way to reach China's renewable energy target. For consumers, incentive programs for SWHs are needed to improve the financial attractiveness of the devices in China. Existing subsidy policies for rural China have failed to significantly enhance the deployment of SWHs. The causes of the failure are examined and a new incentive program is suggested for rural areas of the country. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Car use, car choice decisions and preferences for car characteristics may therefore differ substantially between these two markets. In this paper, we present results of a study on the preferences of company car drivers for alternative fuel vehicles and their characteristics, based on data from an online stated choice experiment in the Netherlands. Results show that, assuming current car characteristics, preferences for alternative fuel vehicles, and for electric and fuel cell cars in particular, are substantially lower than those for the conventional technology. Limited driving ranges, long recharge/refuelling times and limited availability of refuelling opportunities, are to a large extent responsible for this. Preferences for alternative fuel vehicles increase considerably with improvements on these aspects, especially for the hybrid and flexifuel car. Under the current company car tax system in the Netherlands, which favours cleaner technologies, these two car types are even preferred to the conventional technology, assuming equal catalogue prices and personal monthly cost contributions. Comparing results with those from a similar choice experiment among private car owners shows that willingness to pay patterns for AFV improvements regarding driving range, recharge and refuelling times, fuel availability and diversity in AFV supply, are considerably different for company car drivers than for private car owners. Company and private car drivers may therefore react (very) differently to future improvements in AFV technology and fuel availability. We finally show that preferences of company car drivers for fuel cell and electric cars depend to a large extent on annual mileage. Market share simulations show that potential early adopters of electric and fuel cell cars can be found among people with a relatively low annual mileage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Establishing territorial embeddedness within retail transnational corporation (TNC) expansion: the contribution of store development departments, Regional Studies. Establishing territorial embeddedness within host regions in international retail expansion is well known to be important, although the processes underpinning its realization are less explicit. This research analyses some emerging practices' of international expansion planning by drawing on interviews across a sample of store development departments. The role of analysts within host regions in evaluating economic, institutional, cultural and social contexts, and appraising the viability of market-entry methods and store formats is explored. The competitive and regulatory dynamism of regions means that behaviour which encourages greater embeddedness following market entry can be particularly helpful in strengthening the marketing and development strategies of international subsidiaries.

This paper estimates the determinants of investments in port infrastructure in the Spanish regions made by the central administration. It is found that the use of the infrastructure in relation to capacity has some influence on the amount of investment received by a region. Furthermore, specialization in containers is also relevant for receiving more resources. However, it is found that when greater political decentralization does not go hand in hand with greater financial decentralization, the importance of tactical political aspects increases. Overall, efficiency plays a more relevant role in the regional allocation of investments in ports than in other transport infrastructures.","[Castillo-Manzano, Jose I.] Univ Seville, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, E-14018 Seville, Spain; [Fageda, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Policy, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Barcelona,"Castillo-Manzano, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Av Ramon & Cajal 1, E-14018 Seville, Spain.",jignacio@us.es; xfageda@ub.edu,"Fageda, Xavier/F-6635-2018; Castillo-Manzano, Jose I./F-8859-2015","Fageda, Xavier/0000-0001-8526-8169; Castillo-Manzano, Jose I./0000-0003-4154-1500",,,,,35,6,6,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The additional covariate is allowed to exhibit any degree of persistence as captured by its long-memory parameter d(x); in particular, we allow for both stationary and nonstationary covariates. We show that the QMLE's of the parameters entering the volatility equation are consistent and mixed-normally distributed in large samples. The convergence rates and limiting distributions of the QMLE's depend on whether the regressor is stationary or not. However, standard inferential tools for the parameters are robust to the level of persistence of the regressor with t-statistics following standard Normal distributions in large sample irrespective of whether the regressor is stationary or not.

A unique database, including not only total start-ups but also data on start-ups divided into six sectors, is used to study the impact of ESC on start-ups per capita. The results support the hypothesis that social capital, measured both as (1) firm perception of local public attitudes to entrepreneurship and (2) the share of small businesses influences start-up propensity in Swedish municipalities.

The inclusion of state policies and characteristics in a multilevel modeling approach distinguishes this study from past research utilizing logit models of technology adoption which focus only on the characteristics of the farm operation. Results suggest the propensity to adopt is higher for livestock operations, larger farms, operators with internet access, organic operations, and newer farmers. The results find state characteristics such as solar resources, per capita income levels, and predominantly democratic voting increasing the odds of farm adoption. This research suggests the relevance of state policy variables in explaining farm level outcomes is limited, although in combination best practice net metering and interconnection policies policies designed to encourage the development of small scale distributed applications are shown to increase the likelihood of farm solar and wind adoption. The prevalence of electric cooperatives which are often not subject to state renewable energy policies and often service farms is negatively related with the propensity to adopt and suggests that policy design may be a factor.

However, virtually no attention has been paid to the analysis of the combination of different deployment instruments for the same renewable energy technology. This neglect is all the more striking given the existence in current policy practice of combinations of deployment instruments either across technologies or for the same technology, both in the EU and elsewhere. What renewable electricity support policies to use and, therefore, how to combine them in order to promote the deployment of renewable energy technologies cost-effectively is a main concern of governments. The aim of this paper is to provide insight on the cost-effectiveness of combinations of deployment instruments for the same technology. A financial model is developed for this purpose, whereby feed-in tariffs (FITs) are combined with investment subsidies and soft loans. The results show that the policy costs of combinations are the same as for the FITs-only option. Therefore, combining deployment instruments is not a cost-containment strategy. However, combinations may lead to different inter-temporal distributions of the same amount of policy costs and, thus, differently affect the social acceptability and political feasibility of renewable energy support.

Using a large firm-level dataset of 44434 newly created small firms in 234 regions of South Korea in 2000-2004, the econometric estimations indicate that both intra- and inter-regional foreign direct investment spillovers influence entrepreneurs' decisions to situate new firms in a specific region, with inverted U'-shaped curvilinear effects. The findings also suggest that the effect of regional foreign direct investment spillover on new firm creation is largely a localized phenomenon.","[Lee, In Hyeock] Western Kentucky Univ, Gordon Ford Coll Business, Dept Management, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA; [Hong, Eunsuk; Sun, Laixiang] Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Financial & Management Studies DeFiMS, London WC1H 0XG, England",Western Kentucky University; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Lee, IH (通讯作者)，Western Kentucky Univ, Gordon Ford Coll Business, Dept Management, 1906 Coll Hts Blvd, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.",ian.lee@wku.edu; e.hong@soas.ac.uk; LS28@soas.ac.uk,"Hong, Eunsuk/IQR-7671-2023; SUN, LAIXIANG/ABB-2622-2021; Lee, In Hyeock/Q-6260-2017","Hong, Eunsuk/0000-0003-2514-0715; SUN, LAIXIANG/0000-0002-7784-7942; Lee, In Hyeock/0000-0002-1698-4521",,,,,52,19,21,3,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper proposes a renewable energy model based on national targets 'decomposed' into regional targets that incorporate technological processes and environmental conditions at the individual project level. At the project level, resource potential is allocated into individual projects based on the current technological level. The available resources and renewable energy generation of each project changes as the technology evolves and the environmental conditions change over time. The model can be adjusted according to actual needs of each region; thus policymakers can establish the respective targets for power, heating, oil and gas as well as renewable energy based on the regional context. Overall, the total national target can be decomposed into regional targets and technological targets. This paper proposes long-term regional development targets for renewable energy based on the total supply curve for renewable energy in different periods. Fujian province will be applied as an example to validate the target decomposition model of renewable energy targets of various regions and technologies in China. The model projected that the economic capacity of renewable energy generation in Fujian province for dam hydropower, offshore wind power, onshore wind power, photovoltaic power and waste incineration power is expected to reach 4748 MW, 4036 MW, 3581 MW, 2663 MW and 766 MW, respectively by 2025. The research result could have wider implications such as achieving GHG emissions reductions targets, addressing environmental concerns, providing high tech jobs within the region and contributing to energy security at the local and national level.

The results suggest a hump-shape response of unemployment duration over the one-year pre-unemployment wage distribution; individuals at the bottom and top of the wage distribution reacted less than those in the interquartile range.

This study analyses whether the most effective national climate and energy policies are sufficient to stay on track for meeting the emission reduction proposals (pledges) that countries made for 2020. The analysis shows that domestic policies of India, China and Russia are projected to lead to lower emission levels than the pledged levels. Australia's and the EU's nationally legally binding policy framework is likely to deliver their unconditional pledges, but not the conditional ones. The situation is rather unclear for Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Indonesia. We project that policies of Canada and the USA will reduce 2020 emission levels, but additional policies are probably needed to deliver their pledges in full. The analysis also shows that countries are implementing policies or targets in various areas to a varying degree: all major countries have set renewable energy targets; many have recently implemented efficiency standards for cars, and new emission trading systems are emerging.

The focus of this effort to generate renewable energy has centered around wind energy. Wind turbines have been constructed at numerous locations across the state. The lower peninsulas' eastern counties near Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay were designated by the Wind Energy Resource Zone board as one such area of strong sustained wind in the state. Turbines have been constructed in 'pockets' across this 'thumb' region, yet half a decade after the first turbines were constructed, negative perceptions are still attributed to wind turbines. This paper examines residents of wind farm locations as a whole and independently as groups (those in opposition and in support of development) to identify what, if any similarities and differences, exist between the residents' perceptions. Qualitative analysis on stated negative perceptions unveiled common issues with residents: increased price of electricity with wind energy, noise from the turbine rotation and uncertainty surrounding the long term effects of wind turbines. These areas of concern seem to persist years after construction was completed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper uses multiple criteria (the phase of electrification; role of the electricity system in economic development; structures of ownership, market and regulation; dominant technologies; and the relative stability of arrangements) to characterize distinct regime configurations and periods of instability which separate relatively stable system orientations.

The level of investment is assessed as a percentage of GDP (R&D expenditure (% of GDP)). In its Europe 2020 Strategy, the EU obliged its member states to achieve a level of at least 3 %, divided as follows: 2 % of expenditure on R&D is to originate from the business sector, 1 % from the state sector. This paper focuses on a comparison of the development of expenditure on R&D in the business sector in the V4 countries with the EU27 average. The author has monitored the expenditure of SMEs, the number of SMEs and the level of expenditure in the business sector per capita. The author of the paper has employed an analysis and synthesis method, statistical methods analysis of time periods. Conversion to per capita figures has been used for the purpose of comparison of individual values. The input data was secondary data obtained and verified from statistical authorities and governmental information sources in the individual states. The results published in this paper indicate that, although the number of SMEs in the countries of the V4 does not differ significantly from the EU27 average, only the Czech Republic is able to compete in the area of expenditure in the business sector. Even the Czech Republic, however, will have to modify its support for investment in R&D in the future in order to fulfil the criteria set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy. This paper may be a starting point for further research in the area of support for R&D in the business sector.","[Bockova, Nina] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Econ, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,bockova@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,11,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,1363,1371,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100142,0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the killer activity (KA) of autochthonous yeasts from Northwest region of Argentine (S. cerevisiae Cf8 and Wickerhamomyces anomalus Cf20) on spoilage yeasts and in LAB of the wine. The KA was evaluated using cell-free supernatants obtained from pure and mixed cultures of strains Cf8-Cf20. S. cerevisiae Cf8 showed a growth reduction between 7 and 48% on D. anomala BDa15, P. membranifaciens BPm481 and Z. bailii Bzb317 while W. anomalus Cf20 exhibited KA of 20, 61, 91 and 92% against B. bruxellensis Ld1, D. anomala BDa15, P. membranifaciens BPm481 and P. guilliermondii Cd6, respectively. Killer mixed supernatants showed growth inhibition similar to strain Cf20. Screening against LAB showed that both killer toxins were able to inhibit the growth of L. hilgardii 5w as well as to reduce a 16-31% histamine production by this LAB strain. These results confirm the potential of autochthonous killer yeasts as biocontrol agents in winemaking process. The mixed culture S. cerevisiae Cf8-W. anomalus Cf20 presented a wide range of KA on spoilage yeasts as well as on L. hilgardii.

At last, a simple analysis is made on relations between experiences and existing way of basic principles of musical aesthetics. Musical aesthetics is an auditory-experience-based discipline of philosophy of art, which utilizes conceptual analysis, philosophical recognition and other methods to reveal universal laws for aesthetic establishment and practice of human music. Similar to common humanistic disciplines, chief issue of musical aesthetics is the object of research, which concerns both domain of discourse and research objective of musical aesthetics, and decides its disciplinary nature and development orientation. Musical aesthetics dates from the second half of the 19th century. Through researches and explorations by numerous people, fascinating achievements are made in both theoretical and practical fields, promoting long-term development of musical aesthetics.

Until recently, cheap and seemingly limitless fossil energy has allowed most of society to ignore the importance of contributions to the economic process from the biophysical world as well as the potential limits to growth. This paper centers on assessing the energy costs of modern day society and its relation to GDP. Our most important focus is the characteristics of our major energy sources including each fuel's energy return on investment (EROI). The EROI of our most important fuels is declining and most renewable and non-conventional energy alternatives have substantially lower EROI values than traditional conventional fossil fuels. At the societal level, declining EROI means that an increasing proportion of energy output and economic activity must be diverted to attaining the energy needed to run an economy, leaving less discretionary funds available for non-essential purchases which often drive growth. The declining EROI of traditional fossil fuel energy sources and the effect of that on the world economy are likely to result in a myriad of consequences, most of which will not be perceived as good.

Since our present renewable technology is not advanced enough to replace fossil fuel power plants, nuclear power becomes the only available means that can buy us more time to explore better energy sources for coping with the dilemma of global warming and energy security. Therefore, this paper proposes an elaborated fear appeal framework that may shed light on the intervention points for mitigating fear. By examining the influence of fear appeal on the nuclear issue, three strategies for demarketing the nuclear fear of the public are recommended. The paper concludes that only when energy policy makers and the nuclear industry recognize the significance of minimizing fear and begin to work on removing the sources of fear, can we then expect to bring the nuclear issue back to rational discourse.

First, the corresponding data reported in usual accounting reports are extracted to yield records of delayed payment structures. Data processing procedure issues estimations of transitions probabilities of absorption Markov chain with several transition states and two absorption ones representing paid and unpaid claims, respectively. The transition probability matrix of such absorption MC, which has a special pattern in its canonical form, enables symbolic processing of the fundamental matrix. General form of this matrix is presented in detail. Further, it is used for several numerical case studies, which are focused on sensitivity analysis of distribution of paid/unpaid claims on after payment due processes.

It is motivated essentially by large scale foreign deals of land in Africa, Latin America, Central Asia and Southeast Asia that have been reported in recent years. One of the driving forces has been attributed to the presumed availability of land in these regions. This study employs data sourced from World Development Indicators and World Governance Indicators on key variables such as arable land per person, agricultural land as percentage of land area, net food import, regulatory quality, among others (1995-2010) on selected African countries where instances of foreign land deals have been reported. The study formulates empirical models that draw from institutional development theory, which is estimated using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The study found LSFLDs to impact negatively on agricultural export in selected countries, the indexes of institutional framework used were found to be significant; likewise, agricultural land becomes highly significant with relative larger magnitude when interacted with institutional indexes. This therefore implies that as more agricultural land is acquired, agricultural export tends to dwindle and incidences of food insecurity are heightened. The preliminary investigation suggests the need for controlling the issue of massive foreign land deals through viable institutional framework, which can be engendered by building sound legal and procedural measures that will protect local rights and take into account the aspirations of local fanners and the welfare of citizenry.","[Ogundipe, Adeyemi A.; Akinyemi, Opeyemi; Ogundipe, Oluwatomisin] Covenant Univ, Dept Econ, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,,yemi_keke2001@yahoo.com; opeyemi.akinyemi@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; Oluwatomisin.ogundipe@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"; Ogundipe, Adeyemi/M-8498-2013","Ogundipe, Oluwatomisin/0000-0002-6218-2650; Ogundipe, Adeyemi/0000-0003-0707-294X",,,,,30,0,0,0,10,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,2734,2757,,,,,,24,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308101048,0

Moreover, we examine if cooperatives with deep roots in their local economy specialize in specific regional denomination rules (i.e. DOC, IGT). Compared to private wineries, cooperatives face additional challenges in order to raise wine quality, among them appropriate incentives that induce individual growers to supply high quality grapes (e.g. vineyard management and grape pricing schemes to lower yields). The quality reputation of a winery with consumers depends crucially on its winemaking skills. Wine regions differ with respect to climatic conditions and quality denomination rules. Assuming similar climatic conditions within wine regions as well as winemaking skills between firms, incentive schemes to induce individual growers to supply high quality grapes and quality denomination rules remain crucial determinants of wine quality and winery reputation when comparing different regions and firm organizational forms. The data set analyzed allows differentiating local cooperatives vs. private wineries and denotes retail prices, wine quality evaluations, indicators for winery reputation, and distinct denomination rules. We employ a hedonic pricing model in order to test the following hypothesis: First, wines produced by cooperatives suffer a significant reputation and/or wine quality discount relative to wines from private producers. Second, cooperatives and/or private wineries specialize in specific wine denominations for which they receive a price premium relative the competing organizational form. Our results are mixed. However, we reject the hypothesis that cooperatives suffer a reputation/wine quality discount relative to private producers for the Alto Adige wine region. Moreover, we find that regional cooperatives and private wineries specialize in specific wine denomination for which they receive a relative price premium (e.g. Alto Adige cooperatives specialize in DOC relative to private wineries in the region; private wineries in Trentino specialize in IGT denominated wines emphasizing their own brands). Our results indicate regional differences in terms of how cooperatives compete with private wineries with respect to wine quality and reputation. If cooperatives are able to implement incentive schemes to induce individual growers to raise grape quality, they may also gain a wine quality and reputation premium in the market. Specialization in local denomination rules allows private wineries and cooperatives to capture premium prices in different market segments.","Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Schamel, GH (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy.",,"Schamel, Guenter/J-1735-2012","Schamel, Guenter/0000-0003-0481-432X",,,,,21,6,6,0,11,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2014,3.0,,1.0,,,,,,,10.1051/bioconf/20140303008,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BB8BQ,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346256100037,0

In addition, a loan demand model was specified and estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) econometric technique.The study used cross-sectional data collected from selected respondents in selected areas of both the Lagos and Ogun States of Nigeria respectively. The study confirmed that most of the Microfinance banks in Nigeria are tailored after the Grameen Bank which focuses on the poor and people with basic, little or no education and that loan facilities are interest rate insensitive to loan demand.

It is also possible to order the alternatives based on the centres of gravity of the overall evaluations.

First, we unravel the mechanism behind directed technical change, explaining why markets may underprovide innovations in expensive renewable technologies in comparison to innovations in energy-efficient fossil-fuel generators. Subsequently, we characterize technical change in electricity generation technologies, stressing the heterogeneity of knowledge spillovers both within and between clean electricity generation technologies. We argue that there exists a rationale for a portfolio approach to innovation in the electricity sector, i.e., optimal innovation policies are neither fully generic nor fully specific; and they need to be adapted, in response to new information learned by the government. The existing innovation literature does not, however, provide a clear-cut answer for designing such a policy. We compare policy instruments and argue that public R&D support to clean technologies, either in the form of subsidies or prizes, seems to be the prime candidate for implementing non-generic innovation policy.

This article argues that institutional factors have played an important role in their diffusion. It describes the state and evolution of agricultural biogas in Italy, and then investigates the extent to which institutional pressures have been influential in shaping organizational models of biogas production. It finds that the dominance of one particular organizational model is the result of an isomorphic process in which a monopolistic market, legal structures, and subsidies play a role. The prevalence of this organizational model, however, does not lead to the effective use of biogas production, and furthermore it results in low environmental efficiency. For a more sustainable development of bioenergy, Italian policy-makers should reform the existing institutional framework by reorganizing subsidies, liberalizing the management of gas grids, and involving farmers in local projects.

Reflections on the Brazilian sustainable development are presented and discussed based on the evaluations published since 1979. The variation of the emergy per capita for Brazil from 1979 to 2007 indicates that the country's growth is tied to the exploitation of non renewable natural resources which do not directly reflect in the welfare of the population. The total emergy exported per unit of gross domestic product increased in the period, suggesting that the country exports more emergy than that contained in the money received for the exportation. With the help of the emergy indices, the future development of Brazil is explored and discussed. The comparison among the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries and United States indicates that what may be appropriate and usable within one country may not be within another and that to achieve the global sustainability two concomitant actions may occur: (i) the reduction of the total emergy use in developed economies, and (ii) the reduction of indigenous resources exportation in developing economies.

Such marginal costs can be used to simulate the long term average price formation of energy commodities. Drawing on previous work where a global database of energy resource economic potentials was constructed, this work uses cost distributions of non-renewable resources in order to evaluate global flows of energy commodities. A mathematical framework is given to calculate endogenous flows of energy resources given an exogenous commodity price path. This framework can be used in reverse in order to calculate an endogenous marginal cost of production of energy carriers given an exogenous carrier demand. Using rigid price inelastic assumptions independent of the economy, these two approaches generate limiting scenarios that depict extreme use of natural resources. This is useful to characterise the current state and possible uses of remaining non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels and natural uranium. The theory is however designed for use within economic or technology models that allow technology substitutions. In this work, it is implemented in the global power sector model FTT:Power.

Directive 2010/31/EU outlines measures specifically focused on the energy performance of buildings. Incentives are created for building operators to optimize their energy sub-systems in a more robust, energy-efficient, and cost-effective manner. The challenge is to choose efficient energy-supply portfolios accounting for technological and market deregulation and risks. Decision support tools for energy management in public buildings using future scenarios of market and technological developments would be beneficial.

We also quantify a new mechanism by which climate change will affect energy use-the temperature of tap water. As climate warms, the temperature of tap water that supplies hot water tanks rises, which reduces the amount of energy consumed to provide hot water. Finally, we use the statistical models to generate a spatial (1 km x 1 km) and temporal (hourly) downscaling of carbon emissions that will be used to simulate a model for atmospheric transport and validate our understanding of the sources and sinks of carbon for the urban atmosphere.

At this juncture, natural gas, being the cleanest fossil fuel with high efficiency and cost effectiveness, is expected to play an important role. India, with only 0.6% of proven world reserves, is not endowed with adequate natural gas domestically. Nevertheless, there are gas reserves in neighbouring regions which gives rise to the prospects of three cross border gas pipeline projects, namely, Iran-Pakistan-India, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India, and Myanmar-Bangladesh-India. This study is a political analysis of these pipeline projects. First, it provides justification on use of natural gas and promotion of cross border energy trade. Then it examines these three pipeline projects and analyses the security concerns, role of different actors, their positions, shifting goals, and strategies. The study develops scenarios on the basis of changing circumstances and discusses some of the pertinent issues like technology options for underground/underwater pipelines and role of private players. It also explores impact of India's broader foreign relations and role of SAARC on the future of pipelines and proposes energy induced mutually assured protection (MAP) as a concept for regional security.

In this article, focus is on the process of building new single-family houses and how energy efficiency and energy-efficient technology are incorporated into the building process. The conclusions emphasize energy as only one factor in housing purchase decisions. It is a big challenge to make low-energy building important to consumers. Consumer preferences for new products are unlikely to fully develop unless individuals have the opportunity to interact with them. It is difficult for consumers to know what to ask for if they lack experience of energy-efficient technologies. In the studied cases, the building codes and established standards became extremely decisive for how energy issues were included in the process. There is a need to change the design of incentives so as to make the least energy-efficient choice the most expensive. The most energy-efficient solution should be standard, and if the buyer wants to depart from that standard and build using less energy-efficient construction, then that should cost more.

There is also evidence that the effects of renewable electricity policies are more pronounced before 1996 as well as in developed and emerging market countries, and the negative policy interaction effect fades with the stage of economic development. Lastly, policy effectiveness varies by the type of renewable electricity policy and energy source.

Building on institutional and social movement theory, we develop a theoretical framework that sheds light on environmental groups as change-actors. We theorize that by approaching embedded key constituents with various strategic actions, environmental groups affect taken-for-granted beliefs, build legitimacy for renewable energy technologies, and convince skeptical constituents to support the new technology. We verify our theoretical framework with a case study of wind power development in Colorado. We find that environmentalists educate constituents on the benefits of the new technology, engage in activities leading to regulatory and legislative decisions for wind, while also providing direct assistance to the utility. As a result, utilities are both pressured and encouraged to adopt and diffuse wind power on a large-scale. This research directs attention to the role of environmental groups as change-actors and the legitimating effects of their actions. It highlights their part in creating a more favorable institutional environment for new technologies while directly influencing the incumbent's technology choice.

In this approach, strategic players are modeled in a multi-agent environment. These agents which are virtual representative of actual players forecast the prices and participate in the markets, exactly the same as real world situation. In addition, the role of ISO is encountered by using security constraint unit commitment (SCUC) and security constraint economic dispatch (SCED) solutions. Moreover, the interaction between market players is modeled using a heuristic dynamic game theory algorithm based on the supply function equilibria (SFE). In addition to the collusive behavior, using the proposed model, the short-term strategic behavior of players, which their effects will appear in long-term, can be simulated. The proposed model enables the market regulators to make decision before implementing new market rules with the confidence of their results. To represent the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study including wind power plants is considered and the impact of various market rules on players' behavior is simulated and discussed. Numerical studies indicate that simulating the strategic and collusive behavior prior to any change in the market rules is necessary. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

When launching this program in 2004 the government stated that it wanted to avoid the same kind of geographical concentration, single crop focus, dominance of agribusiness, and exclusion of family farmers that have occurred with bioethanol production through the ProAlcool policy since 1975. This paper compares the life histories of the bioethanol and the biodiesel policies of Brazil by analyzing their substantive policy content; the power and politics of actors that struggle for the design and implementation of the policies; and the polity in terms the organization and institutionalization of the policies. The paper concludes that both policies have become submerged by and dependent on the polity and politics of primarily the energy and agricultural sectors that operate as the two semi-autonomous governance fields. This submerging has shaped the substantive contents of biofuels policies, and explains why the 2004 biodiesel policy PNPB, in spite of its objectives for social inclusion and rural development, faces similar problems in implementation as its predecessor, the 1975 bioethanol policy ProAlcool.

Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, however, the government decided to immediately shut down almost half of Germany's reactors and phase out the rest by 2022. The outcome of Germany's energy transition (Energiewende) from high-carbon and nuclear sources of power to renewable energies has implications for Germany's prosperity and may serve as either a positive or negative model for other countries. Achieving the Energiewende will require the commitment of Germany's renewable energy companies, whose opinions on the transition have not yet been reported. This article seeks to help fill this gap by relating the views of over 80 percent of Germany's wind industry, per market share. The firms in our study are mostly optimistic about the government's ambitious targets, but express concern over the prospects for offshore wind, lagging network expansion, and the efficacy of extant legislation to support the transition. From the government's side, cost concerns have already led to discussions of slowing the transition, leading to a push-pullback policy approach. For the transition to proceed smoothly, fundamental issues, such as market design, must be resolved. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

If a widespread adoption should be realized, their effects from a system's point of view are crucial to understand the contributions of this technology. Based on a methodology that uses long-term capacity planning expansion, this paper explores some of the implications for an electric power system of having a large number of micro-CHPs. Results show that fuel cells-based micro-CHPs have the best and most consistent performance for different residential demands from the customer and system's perspectives. As the penetration increases at important levels, gas-based technologies particularly combined cycle units-are displaced in capacity and production, which impacts the operation of the electric system during summer peak hours. Other results suggest that the tariff design impacts the economic efficiency of the system and the operation of micro-CHPs under a price-based strategy. Finally, policies aimed at micro-CHPs should consider the suitability of the technology (in size and heat-to-power ratio) to meet individual demands, the operational complexities of a large penetration, and the adequacy of the economic signals to incentivize an efficient and sustainable operation.

Market clearing electricity prices and production levels are compared for the years 2009-2011, and a model for the relationship between the electricity price and price sensitive electricity production is developed and applied to predict electricity prices in Germany from July 2010 to July 2011 with and without solar electricity generation (SEG). The results show that the SEG has caused a 7% reduction in average electricity prices for this period. The average daily maximum price and daily price variation are also found to decrease, by 13% and 23%, respectively. When taking the MOE into account the net consumer's cost of the solar feed-in tariff (FIT) system is found to be 23% less than the charge listed in the electricity bill. The German FIT policy for solar power has been subject to considerable public debate, and a common argument brought up in disfavor of the system is the high cost for the consumers. In this study we demonstrate the importance of including the MOE when evaluating the total costs and benefits of the FIT policy mechanism. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular decreased heat loss through better insulation is suggested as one of the most cost-effective means to achieve the ambitious national and international goals of climate gas reduction. However, the literature shows that a profitable technological solution is not sufficient to reach the energy goals. Aspects such as a lack of information, unobserved costs, and heterogeneity among users can compromise the success of technical innovation. Still, there are successful concepts that drive the technological development in the construction sector. The Passive House is an example for such innovations that manage to bridge the energy efficiency gap. This paper addresses the Passive House concept and standard as a success story of technological innovation. With Bruno Latour's Science in Action (1987) as a starting point, we describe the conditions under which the standard was created, the role of the network built around the Passive House Institute, and the consequences of exporting the standard. We identify success factors that have supported the diffusion of the Passive House standard and concept and discuss its possible development in the current situation which is characterized by its wide-spread adoption.

Public policies directed at invasive species typically lag their detection. One possible explanation is the coupling of uncertainty with political and economic commitments creates an incentive to delay a policy response in order to gain more information on how damaging the invasion will be - a wait and see approach. We investigate whether this rationale is justified by identifying invasion characteristics that require the wait and see approach often adopted by lawmakers and government agencies. The model shows that the source of uncertainty and degree of policy irreversibility matter and allows the classification of invasive species with a low rate of spread and low levels of uncertainty as those where policies can be optimally timed in the future.

At the same time, there have been very few analyses of consumer preferences in this regard: Which type of pricing program are consumers most likely to choose and why? This paper sheds some light on these. issues based on two empirical studies from Germany: (1) A questionnaire study including a conjoint analysis-design and (2) A field experiment with test-residents of a smart home laboratory. The results show that consumers are open to dynamic pricing, but prefer simple programs to complex and highly dynamic ones; smart home technologies including demand automation are seen as a prerequisite for DSM. The study provides some indications that consumers might be more willing to accept more dynamic pricing programs if they have the chance to experience in practice how these can be managed in everyday life. At the same time, the individual and societal advantages of such programs are not obvious to consumers. For this reason, any market roll-out will need to be accompanied by convincing communication and information campaigns to ensure that these advantages are perceived. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Today, however, fuel accounts for more than 50% of the total costs. In combination with an introduction of stricter energy efficiency requirements for new vessels, this might make design improvement a necessity for all new bulk vessels. This is in contradiction to traditional bulk vessel designs, where the focus has been on maximizing the cargo-carrying capacity at the lowest possible building cost and not on minimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, the Panama Canal has historically been an important design criterion, while the new canal locks from 2014 will significantly increase the maximum size of vessels that can pass. The present paper provides an assessment of cost and emissions as a function of alternative bulk vessel designs with focus on a vessel's beam, length and hull slenderness, expressed by the length displacement ratio for three fuel price scenarios. The result shows that with slenderer hull forms the emissions drop. With today's fuel price of 600 USD per ton of fuel, emissions can thus be reduced by up to 15-25% at a negative abatement cost.

Price developments are parameterized based on EEX data from 2008 to 2011. The probability distributions derived are used to determine the value-at-risk (VaR) of the individual strategies, which are in a final step combined in a mean-variance portfolio analysis for determining the most efficient hedging strategy. We find that the strategy adopted can have a marked influence on the remaining price risk. Quarter futures are found to be particularly well suited for reducing market price risk. In contrast, spot trading of CO2 certificates is found to be preferable compared to forward market trading. Finally, portfolio optimization shows that a mix of various hedging strategies can further improve the profitability of a heat-based cogeneration plant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is an empirical regularity, coherent with classical market microstructure theories of price determination, that the second moment of market microstructure noise is time-varying. We study the optimal, from a finite-sample forecast mean squared error (MSE) standpoint, frequency selection for realized variance in linear variance forecasting models with time-varying market microstructure noise. We show that the resulting sampling frequencies are generally considerably lower than those that would be optimally chosen when time-variation in the second moment of the noise is unaccounted for. These optimal, lower frequencies have the potential to translate into considerable out-of-sample MSE gains. When forecasting using high-frequency variance estimates, we recommend treating the relevant frequency as a parameter and evaluating it jointly with the parameters of the forecasting-model. The proposed joint solution is robust to the features of the true price formation mechanism and generally applicable to a variety of forecasting models and high-frequency variance estimators, including those for which the typical choice variable is a smoothing parameter, rather than a frequency.","[Bandi, Federico M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Bandi, Federico M.] Edhec Risk, F-06202 Nice, France; [Russell, Jeffrey R.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Yang, Chen] Moodys, New York, NY 10007 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School; University of Chicago,"Bandi, FM (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",fbandi1@jhu.edu; jeffrey.russell@chicagobooth.edu; michelle.chen.yang@gmail.com,,,"William S.

Economic change and rising income inequality in the Oslo region: the importance of knowledge-intensive business services, Regional Studies. The growth of market income inequality in the Oslo region of Norway between 1993 and 2004 is investigated. Using two measures, it is shown that most of the change occurred within knowledge-intensive business services, and further within demographic subgroups. Changes in mean income (between-group inequality') and shifts in the balance between segments of the economy are of minor importance. The results support a combined focus on productive paths and institutions. Labour relations, in particular, appear as an important explanation. However, labour relations can hardly explain why men rather than women, and Western immigrants rather than non-Western immigrants, converge towards employment in high-profit businesses. This particular pattern requires research beyond the economic and institutional landscape.","Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Wessel, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, POB 1046, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",terje.wessel@sosgeo.uio.no,"CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022",,,,,,47,13,13,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Understanding the future emissions and emissions mitigation opportunities depends on proper characterization of the present-day industrial energy use, as well as industrial demand drivers and technological opportunities in the future. Traditionally, however, integrated assessment research has handled the industrial sector of China in a highly aggregate form. In this study, we develop a technologically detailed, service-oriented representation of 11 industrial subsectors in China, and analyze a suite of scenarios of future industrial demand growth. We find that, due to anticipated saturation of China's per-capita demands of basic industrial goods, industrial energy demand and CO2 emissions approach a plateau between 2030 and 2040, then decrease gradually. Still, without emissions mitigation policies, the industrial sector remains heavily reliant on coal, and therefore emissions-intensive. With carbon prices, we observe some degree of industrial sector electrification, deployment of CCS at large industrial point sources of CO2 emissions at low carbon prices, an increase in the share of CHP systems at industrial facilities. These technological responses amount to reductions of industrial emissions (including indirect emission from electricity) are of 24% in 2050 and 66% in 2095. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In the model, regional wage differentials do not only influence migration decisions of mobile workers, but also affect the bargaining process on local labor markets, leading to differences in vacancies and unemployment as well. In a setting with two regions, both higher or lower unemployment rates in the core region are possible equilibrium outcomes, depending on transport costs and the elasticity of substitution. Stylized facts suggest that both patterns are of empirical relevance.","Inst Employment Res, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",,"vom Berge, P (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",Philipp.Berge@iab.de,,"vom Berge, Philipp/0000-0003-2013-0761",,,,,35,6,6,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

While traditional risk indices may tell us why a country is considered a difficult operating environment, they tell us very little about why some multinationals are neverthelessly able to operate successfully in such countries over long periods of time. In fact, risk indices by their very nature make success almost impossible to capture due to their sole focus on country behavior. In reality, when a multinational energy company enters into a given country, the firm establishes relationships with a series of stakeholders, not a single host country entity; further, the behaviors of those stakeholders (good or bad) do not exist in a vacuum, but rather are largely influenced by the multinational's own behavior. In other words, the risk is in the relationship between the firm and the country's stakeholders. This article argues that success is therefore a function of the firm's ability to manage relationships among a variety of stakeholders within a given country. A case study of Cameco, a Canadian-based uranium mining multinational which has been operating in the politically risky country of Kazakhstan for two decades, bears this out. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We have conducted the study in three European Union countries: Denmark, Finland and Portugal. We have modelled the main uncertainties that affect this kind of project, such as the cost and production of electric power, investment costs and consumer price index. For each of these countries, we have analysed the mechanisms of public support for wind energy. We have identified the real options included in the regulatory frameworks of these three countries and assessed how they affect the expanded net present value of the project. To this end, we have used two different methods of option valuation: the Monte Carlo method and the binomial method. We have proved that the obtained results using both methods are quite similar. Finally, we have evaluated the public incentives for wind energy offered in each of these three countries and concluded that, in economic terms, Finland is the country with the strongest support for this kind of energy, followed by Denmark and, in the last place, Portugal.

This paper estimates the impact on productive activities of increasing the production capacity of the installed solar thermal plants in Andalusia. Using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach, estimates of the changes in the economic sectors' activity under two different scenarios are obtained: i) based on two types of solar thermal electricity plants currently in operation and ii) based on an increase from 11 MW in 2007 to 800 MW installed capacity by 2013 to comply with the 'Plan Andaluz de Sostenibilidad Energ,tica (PASENER)-Sustainable Energy Plan for Andalusia'. For the case of a parabolic trough solar collector power plant, results show that compliance with the PASENER goal would increase the level of the productive activities by around 30%. For the alternative technology-a solar tower power plant-results show that activities would increase by around 5% for 30 years, the estimated lifetime of this type of plant. Thus, the impact of the solar thermal electricity plants on the productive activities of the PASENER compliant production goal would be remarkable.","[Cansino, J. M.; Gonzalez, J.

First, significant low-cost energy reductions can be made in the residential and commercial sectors, but these savings have not been achievable to date. Second, billions of dollars are being spent to install smart meters, yet the energy saving and financial benefits of this infrastructure - without careful consideration of the human element - will not reach its full potential. We believe that we can address these problems by strategically marrying them, using disaggregation. Disaggregation refers to a set of statistical approaches for extracting end-use and/or appliance level data from an aggregate, or whole-building, energy signal. In this paper, we explain how appliance level data affords numerous benefits, and why using the algorithms in conjunction with smart meters is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for getting this data. We review disaggregation algorithms and their requirements, and evaluate the extent to which smart meters can meet those requirements.

By surveying entrepreneurs selling Solar Home Systems (SHSs) on a commercial basis in emerging and developing countries, this study is one of the first attempts to quantify the key elements of four potential Product Service Systems (PSSs): Cash, Credit, Leasing and Fee-for-Service. Whereas the Fee-for-Service approach was found to be suitable only under certain conditions, all PSSs share two key elements for successful market deployment: one or more years of maintenance, and customer support in financing these customers' new asset. Moreover, it appears that private sector companies are in principle able to deliver SHSs to households with incomes greater than USD 1000 per year. The implications for policy makers and development aid agencies are, first, to include maintenance services into public programmes or public-private partnerships and, second, to explicitly consider financial risks for entrepreneurs (e.g., customer commitment and repayment conditions).

In the case of Spain, but especially in the less developed regions such as Andalusia, the entrepreneur has been identified as responsible for economic backwardness. This paper is an approach to the long-term study of Andalusian entrepreneurship. We have applied the methodology of social network analysis to the documentation of incorporation contained in official records between the years 1886 and 1959. This has verified the presence of major business creation networks acting in all productive sectors of the region, constituting an endogenous entrepreneurial drive regardless of the actions of entrepreneurs and foreign companies. The study of the personal characteristics of network members and their comparison with those of employers who did not participate in them suggests that the networks included the most dynamic entrepreneurs. Among network members was an important presence of owners and college graduation, specially law graduates and engineers. It has also identified the importance of family ties in the configuration of business networks.","[Garrues Irurzun, Josean; Rubio Mondejar, Juan Antonio; Hernandez Armenteros, Salvador] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Irurzun, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",,"Garrués-Irurzun, Josean/W-3635-2018; Mondéjar, Juan A.

In sharp contrast to extant finite-sample tests, our framework allows for unknown forms of nonnormalities, heteroscedasticity, and time-varying covariances. The power of the proposed test procedure increases as the time series lengthens and/or the cross section becomes larger. So the criticism sometimes heard that nonparametric tests lack power does not apply here, since the number of test assets is chosen by the user. This also stands in contrast to the usual tests that lose power or may not even be computable if the number of test assets is too large.

Until the last decade, the industry was monopolized by the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), a state-owned, vertically integrated company. The 2001 reform divided KEPCO's power generation division into six power generation companies (GENCOs), with the aim of improving efficiency and introducing competition in the electricity industry. In this study, we used capital total factor productivity (KTFP) to analyze profit changes from fixed input capital, and an index number profit decomposition (INPD) to examine the sources of the profit changes. We investigate the industry thoroughly from three points of view: the overall industry over time; the power generation sector by company: and the transmission and distribution sectors of the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO). Next, we measured how the profits from productivity growth were distributed to consumers, fuel suppliers, employees, and company owners. The results suggest that a more reasonable price system for both wholesale and consumer prices needs to be implemented prior to the privatization and deregulation of the Korean electricity industry.

Over 70% of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa, mostly in the rural areas, depend on wood fuel, as firewood or charcoal, to meet their primary domestic energy requirements. This dependence is projected to increase with population growth in the intermediate future, regardless of the implementation of rural electrification programmes.. Fuelwood shortages occur at the localised village level and are a chronic landscape syndrome, becoming more severe over time, with increasing population pressures and competing land-uses. In the South African context, the provision of electricity to rural households at subsidised rates would be expected to provide a viable alternative to fuelwood under conditions of scarcity. This paper compares the fuelwood consumption strategies of households in a fuelwood-scarce environment against those in fuelwood-abundant environment in order to illustrate the inelastic nature of the demand for fuelwood in rural communities, even in the face of severely depleted wood stocks. We seek to understand the mechanisms that households implement to ensure household fuelwood/energy security and how these responses aggregate at the landscape level to shape landscape dynamics. This will aid better planning of intervention policies in the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Matsika, R.; Erasmus, B. F.

Fuel poverty is an important public health problem in New Zealand, and is likely to be a particular problem for those using prepayment metering. This paper details a nationwide postal survey of consumers undertaken with the support of three major electricity retailers, which investigated the advantages and disadvantages of using prepayment metering from a consumer perspective. The study surveyed a total pool of 359 randomly selected consumers across the three companies, a response rate of 48%. The study found that while almost all respondents felt the benefits of using prepayment outweighed the risks of running out of credit or 'self-disconnection', 53% of respondents experienced self-disconnection in the past year. Of concern, over a third of respondents experiencing self-disconnection were without electricity for more than 12 h. The frequency of self-disconnection was also high, with 17% of those disconnecting reporting six or more events in the past year. Government intervention could reduce the risks and disadvantages involved with using prepayment metering, which could then support initiatives aimed at reducing fuel poverty. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In Europe that need has given rise to a debate about the most effective and efficient support strategy. Whilst the different interests debate whether full European harmonisation or strengthening of national support policies for electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) is the best way forward, individual national support schemes are rapidly evolving. This study investigates how the EU member states have applied support policy types over the last decade. By identifying predominant developments in the application of feed-in tariffs, premiums, tradeable green certificates, tax incentives, investment grants, and financing support for specific technologies (wind, biomass, PV), this study shows that Europe is currently experiencing certain tendencies towards a 'bottom-up' convergence of how national policy-makers design RES-E policy supports. While some outliers remain, the policy supports of most countries become more similar in the policy types applied (dominance of feed-in tariffs) and in their scope of implementation (differentiation for installation sizes and 'stacking' of multiple instruments). These trends in national decision-making, which show tendencies of convergence, could make an EU-driven 'top-down' harmonisation of support either dispensable or at least (depending on the agreement) less controversial.

This work presents Ecotax, an economic policy instrument that supports the simultaneous achievement of both objectives, in the building sector. The proposed instrument is a tax/subsidy scheme attached to the difference between the actual emissions and a specified target. It uses market pricing to value emissions trading price, and is directly integrated into the energy efficiency certification scheme. Thus, minimizing the administrative costs of its establishment. During the project phase, the tax/subsidy falls on the construction companies which facilitates the funding of innovation in technology. In the operation phase, it falls on proprietors or end-users, stimulating sustainable consuming habits. In both cases, the administration acts as an intermediary, channeling funds from low to high energy efficiency agents, inside and outside the sector itself.

To manage this, the Dutch government implemented redispatching, a method which is argued in the literature to potentially impose large congestion costs upon the TSO. A quantitative model of the Dutch electricity system was developed in order to evaluate this method. The outcomes were compared to the performance of three alternative congestion management methods. Regardless of the method, congestion costs were found to be substantially lower than in previous studies. Because combined-cycle gas turbines are the marginal generation technology in almost all cases, the costs of up and down regulation do not differ much. Consequently, the redispatching costs for the ISO are expected to be relatively low, and the opportunities for abuse of market power appear to be limited. While all the evaluated methods are effective and economically efficient, they have significantly different welfare effects. Market splitting creates significantly larger welfare effects than the different varieties of redispatching. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

For China, a large agricultural country with abundant biomass resources, the utilization of biomass gasification power generation technology is of special importance, because it can contribute to the electricity structure diversification under the present coal-dominant electricity structure, ameliorate the environmental impact, provide energy to electricity-scarce regions and solve the problems facing agriculture. Up to now, China has developed biomass gasification power generation plants of different types and scales, including simple gas engine-based power generation systems with capacity from several kW to 3 MW and integrated gasification combined cycle systems with capacity of more than 5 MW. In recent years, due to the rising cost of biomass material, transportation, manpower, etc., the final cost of biomass power generation has increased greatly, resulting in a serious challenge in the Chinese electricity market even under present preferential policy for biomass power price. However, biomass gasification power generation technology is generally in accord with the characteristics of biomass resources in China, has relatively good adaptability and viability, and so has good prospect in China in the future.

The paper shows that meeting Scotland's carbon targets does not require additional decarbonisation effort if the UK meets its own targets at least cost: and that Scotland's renewable energy ambitions do imply additional costs above the least cost path to the meeting the UK's obligations under the EU renewable energy directive. Meeting Scottish renewable electricity targets diverts investment and deployment in renewables from rest of the UK to Scotland. In addition to increased energy system cost, Scottish renewable electricity targets may also require early investment in new electricity transmission capacity between Scotland and rest of the UK.

Economic impact computations over the life of each energy development scenario were made on a county basis for output of goods and services, the number of jobs created, and local earnings. Externality costs were assigned monetary values for coal mining and subtracted from earnings. Premature mortality within the general population due to additional coal mining accounted for 96% of these external cost computations. The results showed that economic output over the life of each scenario was twice as high for MTM mining as wind energy plus underground coal mining. Over the short term, employment and earnings were higher for MTM mining, but towards the end of the scenario, cumulative employment and earnings became higher under scenario (2). When local externality costs were subtracted from local earnings, MTM coal production had an overall negative net social impact on the citizens of Raleigh County. The external costs of MTM coal production provide an explanation of the existence of a resource curse and the conflicting results of output versus income provide insights into why coal-producing counties are underdeveloped.

The results of the research presented in the paper illustrate how the media in developing countries legitimate energy policy and the activities of politicians and other decision makers in the energy sector. The topic of environmental impact or renewable resources is hardly presented in the analysed media coverage, and information about national energy pricing is spread widely. At the same time, the nationwide mass media do not refer to the domestic sector presenting energy problems at an abstract macro social level. Instead of shaping social knowledge, and conscious of such issues as energy supply and efficiency potential in households, the media construct self-referential communication in each of the fields (politics, technology, the economy). Based on Habermas's distinction between the system and lifeworld, and the assumption that the media both construct and reproduce knowledge about the world, we have attempted to reconstruct the media discourse in the chosen area. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of Polish press allowed us to reconstruct the narrative on the subject of the energy crisis. The results could be the basis for critical revision of communication strategies in the energy sector, especially questioning the problem of its efficiency and mutual understanding between different actors.

This theory is now almost universally represented as a primitive version of the familiar Input-Output or Keynesian demand-driven approach, where regional output is linked to regional exports through a rather mechanistic multiplier process (Romanoff in J Reg Sci 14:121-129, 1974). Further, in a standard IO inter-regional framework, the expansion of output in one region always generates positive impacts on other regions. That is to say, there is always a positive spread, and no negative backwash, effect. However, these models typically embody no supply-side constraints. What is more, the stimulus to the export sector is often thought to come through supply-side improvements (North in J Polit Econ 63:243-258, 1955; McCombie in Appl Econ 24:493-512, 1992). Whilst accepting that the development of a healthy export base is generally central to promoting the growth of the regional economy, the relationship is likely to be much more complex than is usually thought. Also whilst an increase in regional exports typically increases economic activity in the target region, the effect on other regions is less straightforward (Myrdal in Economic theory and underdeveloped regions Duckworth, London, 1957). In this paper, we begin by using a single-region IO analysis of the operation of a stylised export-base model. The impact of a conventional increase in export demand is compared to a situation in which increased competitiveness underpins the improved export performance. This analysis is then extended through the use of an inter-regional (Scotland-Rest of the UK) Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. In simulation, different exogenous demand and supply side disturbances are calibrated so as to generate the same long-run expansion in Scottish manufacturing exports. The subsequent specific evolutions of regional GDP and employment in both Scotland and the rest of the UK (RUK) are then tracked.","[Ha, Soo Jung; Swales, J.

J,"Herrerias, MJ",,,,"Herrerias, M. J.",,,World energy intensity convergence revisited: A weighted distribution dynamics approach,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy intensity; Convergence; Markov transition matrix,INCOME,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the process of convergence as regards energy intensity in the case of large group countries over the period 1971-2008. In doing so, we focus on the distribution dynamics approach. The first novel aspect of this study consists in the fact that it analyses whether the convergence patterns differ when the population is taken into account, while the second one consists in investigating the convergence process in the case of total energy intensity, fossil fuel and alternative and nuclear intensity for the overall sample of countries as well as differentiating between develop and developing countries. On the one hand, our results indicate that the convergence patterns do differ once we weight the transition matrix by population, since we find more evidence against divergence. Moreover, a significant persistence is also found in the intra-distribution dynamics, which in turn influences the speed at which the steady state is achieved. On the other hand, the Kernel density estimates and the stationary distribution show that the distribution becomes at least bimodal in the former and clearly multimodal in the latter, thereby implying that convergence occurs within a group of countries. This phenomenon is present in all sources of energy examined, but in the case of alternative and nuclear intensity there are more symptoms of convergence. Developing countries converge at higher energy intensity ratios, while in the case of developed countries there are at least two convergence clubs, one in the lowest levels of energy intensity and another with higher levels of energy intensity. These results show the need to promote further energy-saving measures in the sample of countries examined. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Acknowledging this gap, this paper explores the mainstream academic and policy literatures to provide a taxonomy of interactions and identify synergies and trade-offs between them. The most important trade-off identified is the potential increase in energy poverty levels as a result of strong climate change action if the internalisation of the external costs of carbon emissions is not offset by efficiency gains. The most significant synergy was found in deep energy efficiency in buildings. The paper argues that neither of the two problems - deep reductions in GHG emissions by mid-century, and energy poverty eradication - is likely to be solved fully on their own merit, while joining the two policy goals may provide a very solid case for deep efficiency improvements. Thus, the paper calls for a strong integration of these two policy goals (plus other key related benefits like energy security or employment), in order to provide sufficient policy motivation to mobilise a wide-scale implementation of deep energy efficiency standards.

Despite the great deal of attention paid to questions of natural gas security in an increasingly import-dependent European Union, the contingency plans of most of its member states have not been widely published or scrutinized. By reviewing TSO network codes and national legal and regulatory acts, this paper teases out the key similarities and differences between member states' emergency planning frameworks, tools and methods. A gas emergency operational template is subsequently proposed that conforms to EU legislation. This is followed by a discussion of emergency planning in the context of regional cooperation and the liberalizing European gas market. The paper concludes by advocating gas emergency measures which are proportionate to the crisis level, sensitive to the gas demand profile, aware of the regional context, inconsequential to normal market operation, transparent and non-discriminatory during implementation and verifiable during emergencies as well as under normal conditions.

Some people see wind power as a sustainable source of energy, others see it as destroying nature and landscapes. The opposition to wind power is often asserted to be from local forces and NIMBYism, and support to be based on the national and global benefits of increased supply of renewable energy. In this paper. I challenge this view by analyzing how local communities with established or planned wind power parks went through the process of developing wind power, what arguments they used and how they think about the wind power technology and its expected local effects. I found that most of the arguments in favor of wind power development addressed local concerns regarding the economy, modernization, and employment opportunities and not a need for sustainable energy. The opposition to wind power development was not based on NIMBYism. Rather, many different arguments were used, and the features of the controversies were distinct to each community.

To levy CBTA could reduce China's emissions. Meanwhile, China's emissions reduction could also be achieved by China's climate policies (termed as CBTA-emissions-equivalent policies). This paper contributes to the discussion on CBTA by comparing the potential regional effects of CBTA and CB-FA-emissions-equivalent policies. The main findings are as follows: (1) CBTA and CBTA-emissions-equivalent policies would result in relocations of outputs across regions and countries, affect the structure of economy and contribute to world's emissions reduction. (2) There would be significant differences in the regional effects between CBTA and CBTA-emissions-equivalent policies. (3) Compared to carbon tax, CBTA would be a costly and inefficient policy instrument to reduce emissions, but could function as an effective coercion strategy. (4) These policies would result in competitiveness issue and rebound effects, wherein different countries would be affected differently. China is a large economy and energy consumer with high openness to international trade. Looking ahead, the Chinese government should consider the potential interactions between China and other economies when designing tax reforms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the policy design of an emission trading program has a decisive impact on its performance. Allowance allocation is one of the most important policy design issues in emission trading, not only for equity but also for policy performance. In this research, an artificial market for sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission trading was constructed by applying an agent-based model. The performance of the Jiangsu SO2 emission trading market was examined under different allowance allocation methods and transaction costs. The results showed that the market efficiency of emission trading would be affected by the allocation methods when the transaction costs are positive. The auction allowance allocation method was more efficient and had the lowest total emission control costs than the other three allocation methods examined. However, the use of this method will require that power plants pay for all of their allowance, and doing so will increase the production costs of power plants. On the other hand, output-based allowance allocation is the second best method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In fact, the imbalance of economic development leads to diversity in GHG emissions profiles in different areas of China. This paper employs a common methodology, consistent with the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) approved by the Covenant of Mayors (CoM), to estimate CO2 emissions of four Chinese cities in highly urbanized areas from 2004 to 2010. The results show that the CO2 emissions of all four cities are still rising and that secondary industries emit the most CO2 in these cities. By comparing these data with the inventory results of two European cities, this paper further reveals that Chinese cities in highly urbanized areas contribute much higher per-capita emissions than their European competitors. Furthermore, the per-capita CO2 emissions of the residential sector and private transport in these Chinese cities are growing rapidly, some of them approaching the levels of European cities. According to these findings, several policy suggestions considering regional disparities are provided that aim to reduce the CO2 emissions of highly urbanized areas in China. (C) 201 2 Elsevier Ltd.

The advantage of our approach is that one can automatically choose between general additive models, partially linear additive models, and linear models in a single estimation step. The most important contribution is that this is achieved without the need for specifying which covariates enter the linear part, solving one serious practical issue for models with partially linear additive structure.

However, surprisingly few studies have so far focused on Russia, the world's second largest oil exporter. The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the impact of oil prices on the levels of inflation, real effective exchange rate and real GDP for Russia using the VAR model. The time span covered by the series is from 1995:Q1 to 2009:Q3, giving 59 observations. The analysis leads to the finding that a 1% increase (decrease) in oil prices contributes to the growth (decline) in real GDP by 0.44% in the long run. Likewise, we find that in the short run (4 quarters) rising oil prices not only stimulate inflation and economic growth negatively and positively, respectively, but also induce real effective exchange rate appreciation.","Fukuoka Univ, Kamimine, Saga 8490123, Japan",Fukuoka University,"Ito, K (通讯作者)，Fukuoka Univ, 1892-1 Boujo, Kamimine, Saga 8490123, Japan.",katsuya_and_angela@ybb.ne.jp,,,,,,,24,12,13,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, easily accessible, reliable information on the energy performance of products and policies is often scarce within a particular market, and rarer still if the policy maker is seeking comparisons on an international level. This article presents a method (Mapping & Benchmarking) to compare energy efficiency of products across countries, and the results for 3 products: refrigerators-freezers, washing machines and laundry driers. The results show an improvement of the efficiency over time for these products. However, part of this improvement is due to increased capacity of the products and not to lower energy consumption. Therefore policy makers should consider the development of policies based on product energy consumption and not (only) on product efficiency in order to capture the full potential of technology improvements for energy savings.

The study took place in a Swedish village where exploratory drilling, that could eventually lead to a uranium mine, was being conducted at the same time as a wind farm was approved. Results from the survey, which included the total population, were interpreted in the light of cognitive stress theory. Most residents thought that the wind farm would have a positive impact on the village but that the uranium drilling would have a negative impact; these opinions were closely related to attitudes towards wind and nuclear power. Perceiving the wind farm as positive was further predicted by young age, high education, being an ordinary rather than a committed recycler and having attended a meeting about the wind farm. A negative view of uranium drilling was predicted by the individual valuing closeness to nature, being a recycler, and having attended the uranium meeting. Psychological factors such as concerns for the environment (manifested as pro-environmental behaviour), valuing closeness to nature, and involvement impinge on the appraisal process and should be considered when new developments are presented.

Results show that co-product treatment greatly influenced the performance of E85 route. The calculated values of energy efficiency in co-product burning for electricity scenario (the base scenario) and that in co-product for selling scenario (the alternative scenario) are 4.41 and 3.61, respectively. CO2 emission of the stover-based route is 99.7% more than that of the gasoline route in the base scenario and 55.3% less than that of the gasoline in the alternative scenario. The costs of E85 in these two scenarios are 9.78 and 7.76 yuan/L, respectively. Based on the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, the article suggests the following: (1) stover-based E85 is currently not competitive in terms of cost; (2) on the current stage, to make E85 competitive, policymakers should be concerned about stimulating processing innovation, providing subsidies on ethanol, feedstock and co-product, as well as raising gasoline price, rather than increasing carbon tax rate/promoting Cleaner Development Mechanism (CDM) projects or influencing consumers' Willingness to Pay (WTP) for E85.

The aim of this article is to consider this development in the context of ongoing interactions between the controversy and regulatory and engineering activities. It is found that the discursive space of the controversy has increasingly narrowed around environmental issues, particularly greenhouse gas emissions. The implications for biofuel development are considered in the context of changing regulatory and engineering visions in response to indirect land-use change. Opposition to the third generation biofuels may be softened, but it may be more difficult to justify the cost of holistic regulation of land-use change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As a developing country in the transition stage, abundant policy implications are included in the electricity price in China, thus, whether to adjust the resident electricity price is a dilemma for the government. However, the current single tariff system cannot cope with the complex social and environmental problems. A new price mechanism is indeed needed. This paper tries to design an increasing block tariffs system with the consideration of residential income and electricity consumption. The result indicates that the increasing block tariffs system with four-tier structure is more reasonable for China. Although the increasing block tariffs will result in the increase of electricity price, it is still acceptable and affordable. The increasing block tariffs will greatly improve the equity and efficiency, and promote the electricity saving and emissions reduction. Moreover, the power companies will increase tariffs revenue, which would use to the transmission networks investment in poor area. In order to the offset the limitations of the increasing block tariffs, the government should adopt some complementary measures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is designed to consider the tradeoffs between the expected costs of investments in capacity, operating and maintenance costs, average fuel costs, and the variability of fuel costs. In addition, the model is designed to take the load curve into account at a high degree of resolution, while keeping the computational burden at a practical level. The model is illustrated with a case study for Indiana's power generation system. The model reveals that an effective means of reducing the volatility of the system-level fuel costs is through the reduction of dependence on coal-fired generation with an attendant shift towards nuclear generation. Model results indicate that about a 25% reduction in the standard deviation of the generation costs can be achieved with about a 20-25% increase in average fuel costs. Scenarios that incorporate costs for carbon dioxide emissions or a moratorium on nuclear capacity additions are also presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicated that the crude oil market is informationally efficient over the scrutinized period except for two periods that correspond to the early 1990s and late 2000s US recessions. Overall, the results showed that deregulation has improved the operation of the market in the sense of making returns less predictable. On the other hand, there is some evidence that the probability of having a severe US economic recession increases as the informational efficiency decreases, which indicates that returns from crude oil markets are less uncertain during economic downturns.

In this study, we hypothesize that growth rates do depend on population size, but that the direction of the relationship depends on location, i.e., in unfavorable loci, growth rates are positively related to size, while the relationship is reversed in favorable loci, i.e., places with several location advantages. The present study examines that possibility, using 1990-2000 population growth data for two levels of geographic resolution-4,667 local administrative units (i.e., municipalities) and 2,189 contiguous urban areas in 40 European countries. According to our findings, when individual localities are considered, 'proportionate' growth (expected under Gibrat's law) emerges at the aggregate (system-wide) level, but 'dissipates' when the settlement system is disaggregated into two urban sub-systems, formed by well-positioned localities and poorly positioned ones. Concurrently, for urban areas, a strong positive association between population size and growth emerges both before and after controlling for location attributes. However, this association between population size and growth is not especially strong, if favorably and unfavorably located urban areas are looked at separately.","[Portnov, Boris A.] Univ Haifa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Reiser, Ben] Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Schwartz, Moshe] Askelon Acad Coll, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-78211 Askelon, Israel",University of Haifa; University of Haifa,"Portnov, BA (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",portnov@nrem.haifa.ac.il; reiser@stat.haifa.ac.il; moshesc@gmail.com,"/AHB-5989-2022; Reiser, Benjamin/G-6591-2012","Reiser, Benjamin/0000-0002-9797-9029",,,,,56,6,6,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Geographic location, low income status, and age are found to affect willingness-to-pay for compact fluorescent lighting, while higher income status and other demographic variables appear to have minimal or no significant impacts. Energy efficiency knowledge is associated with increased willingness-to-pay for energy-efficient bulbs and with increased use of compact fluorescent lighting. Contrary to theoretical expectations, past purchase of compact fluorescent bulbs is found to have no impact on self-reported willingness to pay. We hypothesize that this null result is due to the recent emergence of low-cost, low-quality compact fluorescent bulbs in the Saint Lucian lighting market, which may be negatively influencing consumers' preferences and expectations regarding energy-efficient lighting. Findings support the argument that government-sponsored education and subsidy programs will likely result in increased use of energy-saving technologies in Saint Lucia. But such behavioral changes may not be sustained in the long run unless low quality bulbs - the lemons of the compact fluorescent lighting market - can be clearly identified by consumers.

As in many other countries, the establishment of new wind farms has aroused local opposition. This paper contributes to the literature using a qualitative methodology to analyse attitudes towards wind power. In 2007, we carried out in-depth interviews with 40 stakeholders concerned with two planned near-shore farms in Sweden; despite their location, the wind farms' visual impact provoked strong negative attitudes. However, we found no evidence of the NIMBY-syndrome; rather, those opposing the wind farms question wind power more generally, especially vis-a-vis nuclear power. The analysis of attitudes is based on three components: cognition, feeling and action tendency. The results show high consistency between the feeling and cognitive components of attitudes: a negative feeling regarding landscape impact, for example, is accompanied by a belief that wind power is inefficient and unprofitable. However, in many cases the action tendency component is in dissonance with the other two: opponents remain passive despite being against the establishment of new wind farms. These passive opponents represent elements of uncertainty as they may suddenly, at a late stage, turn into active opponents exerting an effect on the decision process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although consumers are often unaware of these risks, they present a large financial burden on the economy. This study applies the portfolio optimization concepts from the field of finance to demonstrate the scope of greater utilization of renewable energies (RE) while reducing the embedded investment risk in the conventional electricity sector and its related financial burden. This study demonstrates that RE investment can compensate for the risks associated with the total input costs; such costs being external volatilities of fossil fuel prices, capital costs, operating and maintenance costs and the carbon costs. By means of example, this case study shows that Japan could in theory obtain up to 9% of its electricity supply from green sources, as compared to the present 1.37%, based on the utilization of a portfolio risk-analysis evaluation. Explicit comparison of the monetary values of the investment risks of conventional and renewable energy sources shows that renewable energies have high market competitiveness. The study concludes with a recommendation that, as a business objective, investors would benefit by focusing on electricity supply portfolio risk minimization instead of cost. This could also inherently increase the supply of renewable energy in the market. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A case is made for each and how they function and interrelate is developed. What are the universal and particular forces shaping suburbanization processes in different urban-regions? It is also argued that governance itself needs to be used in critical sense by extending its meaning towards issues of suburbanism, not just the process merely of suburbanization.","[Ekers, Michael] Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Ekers, Michael] Program Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Hamel, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Dept Sociol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Keil, Roger] York Univ CITY, City Inst, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",Universite de Montreal; York University - Canada,"Ekers, M (通讯作者)，Dept Geog, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St,Room 5047, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",michael.ekers@utoronto.ca; pierre.hamel@umontreal.ca; rkeil@yorku.ca,"Keil, Roger/AFM-0051-2022; Hamel, Pierre/Q-1826-2016","Keil, Roger/0000-0002-1904-4623;",,,,,140,94,100,1,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This viewpoint contributes to the re-examination of the meaning of energy security that has accompanied this expansion. Our starting point is that energy security is an instance of security in general and thus any concept of it should address three questions: Security for whom?, Security for which values? and Security from what threats? We examine an influential approach - the 'four As of energy security' (availability, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability) and related literature of energy security - to show it does not address these questions. We subsequently summarize recent insights which propose a different concept of energy security as 'low vulnerability of vital energy systems'. This approach opens the road for detailed exploration of vulnerabilities as a combination of exposure to risks and resilience and of the links between vital energy systems and critical social functions. The examination of energy security framed by this concept involves several scientific disciplines and provides a useful platform for scholarly analysis and policy learning. (C) 2014 The Authors.

As a consequence prices for carbon emission allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System collapsed. However, this price collapse may be amplified by the interaction of a carbon emission cap with supplementary policy targets such as minimum shares for renewables in the power sector. The static interaction between climate and renewable policies has been discussed extensively. This paper extends this debate by analysing the efficiency and effectiveness of a policy portfolio containing a cap and trade scheme and a target for a minimum renewable share in different states of aggregate electricity demand. Making use of a simple partial equilibrium model of the power sector we identify an asymmetric interaction of emissions trading and renewable quotas with respect to different states of aggregate electricity demand. The results imply that unintended consequences of the policy interaction may be particularly severe and costly when aggregate electricity demand is low and that carbon prices are more sensitive to changes in economic activity if they are applied in combination with renewable energy targets. Our analysis of the policy interaction focuses on the EU, yet the conclusions may also be of relevance for fast growing emerging economies like China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examined the contribution of biomass resources to rural household energy use and energy substitution. The analysis applied the ordinary least square in the final stage estimation of fuelwood and overall biomass energy consumption by using predicted shadow prices. The paper used Tobit model to estimate charcoal and agricultural fuel consumption due to the presence of censoring. An increase in fuelwood shadow price was associated with reduced household fuelwood consumption with price elasticity of -0.38. The cross price elasticity between fuelwood and agricultural fuels revealed no evidence of energy substitution, which conforms to the findings of previous studies. Household access to electricity was associated with lower household biomass energy utilization but kerosene was not fiielwood substitute. Household energy use conformed to the 'fuel stacking' or 'multiple fuel use' concept, but households preferred modern energy options as welfare increased in areas where modern energy is available. This suggests that there is a promising prospect for fuel-transition, but access to modern energy and economic growth have key roles. The findings suggest that a concerted policy effort is required that would help diversify rural livelihoods, improve living standards and encourage economic growth, encourage inter-fuel substitution through improved modern energy access and afforestation to increase biomass supply.

This rapid growth has been the result of a domestic manufacturing base and favorable national policies. Further evolution will be greatly aided with a detailed wind resource assessment that incorporates spatial and temporal variability across China. We utilized 200 representative locations for which 10 years of hourly wind speed data exist to develop provincial capacity factors from 2001 to 2010, and to build analytic wind speed profiles. From these data and analysis we find that China's annual wind generation could reach 2000 TWh to 3500 TWh. Nationally this would correspond to an average capacity factor of 0.18. The diurnal and seasonal variation shows spring and winter has better wind resources than in the summer and fall. A highly interconnected and coordinated power system is needed to effectively exploit this large but variable resource. A full economic assessment of exploitable wind resources demands a larger, systems-level analysis of China's energy options, for which this work is a core requirement.

Solar energy for electricity is also expanding in the US. Indiana is one of the states expanding solar energy with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Therefore, we conduct benefit cost analysis with several uncertain input variables to determine the economics of adopting solar PV systems in Indiana based on policy instruments that could increase adoption of solar PV systems. The specific objectives are analyses of the cost distribution of solar PV systems compared with grid electricity in homes and estimating the probability that solar can be cheaper than electricity from grids under different policy combinations. We first do the analysis under current policy and then the analysis under potential policy options for a variety of scenarios. Also, the results inform government policy makers on how effective the alternative policies for encouraging solar PV systems are. The results show that current policies are important in reducing the cost of solar PV systems. However, with current policies, there is only 50-50 chance of solar being cheaper than electricity from grids. If potential policies are implemented, solar PV systems can be more economical than grid electricity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite its federal system of joint decision-making, most studies of German climate policy focus primarily upon activities at the national level while disregarding the heterogeneous economic interests and veto options of the Lander. Using the cases on renewable energy policy and emission trading, we analyze the subnational interests and institutional mechanisms that shape the intergovernmental negotiations and policy outcomes within the federated system. The cases confirm assumptions made by general research on German federalism, according to which strategies for the externalization and compensation of costs are of particular importance for redistributive policies, and the EU plays a major role in dissalving potential barriers to the process of federal policy formation. Contrary to the reservations often expressed, we demonstrate that climate policies have led to an increased economic and political competition between the Lander and have supported effective solutions. However, recent shortfalls in the effectiveness of emission trading and in the cost-efficiency of renewable energy policies indicate that redistributive conflicts in the allocation of greenhouse gas emissions have to be addressed more systematically within the German (and the European) system(s) of joint decision-making.

Since 2012 the Coalition Government has created key economic drivers to encourage shale exploration, whilst growing activism in affected site communities has stirred significant media and academic commentary. This study examines the growing national debate as a matter of discourse, adopting an argumentative discourse analytic approach to assess data collected from stakeholder interviews (n=21) and key policy actor statements quoted in broadsheet newspapers. We explore three dominant storylines emerging in relation to shale gas policy: (1) cleanliness and dirt concerns the relative framing of the environmental benefits and harms of shale gas; (2) energy transitions - pathways and diversions concerns geographic metaphors of transitions to carbon intensive and low-carbon energy systems; and (3) geographies of environmental justice concerns divisions of economic benefit distribution, environmental impact and procedural fairness. We find that central government policy rhetoric emphasises economic development, regulatory oversight and distribution of benefits to site communities, whilst minimising discussion of the implications of shale gas for anthropogenic climate change. The role of these discourses in influencing shale gas policy is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The rents come from industry safety barriers, low resource taxes, and privilege policies for coalmining enterprises. The rent-seeking mechanism was analyzed using a model comprising dynamic games with incomplete information. The equilibrium results indicate that the probability of national supervision is influenced by penalties and bribery: there is negative correlation with penalties and positive correlation with bribery. The rent-seeking probability of a governmental safety supervision department is influenced by several factors, and positively correlates with the cost of national supervision. The probability of bribery of coalmining enterprises is influenced by several factors, and positively correlates with wages of governmental departments and a reasonable rent-seeking range. Reversed rent-seeking reduces the probability of bribery, but it's not worth recommending. Some recommendations are proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These data may be required to satisfy linear constraints, for example, bounds on individual variables and inequalities for ratios or sums of variables. Often these constraints are designed to identify faulty values, which then are blanked and imputed. The data also may exhibit complex distributional features, including nonlinear relationships and highly nonnormal distributions. We present a fully Bayesian, joint model for modeling or imputing data with missing/blanked values under linear constraints that (i) automatically incorporates the constraints in inferences and imputations, and (ii) uses a flexible Dirichlet process mixture of multivariate normal distributions to reflect complex distributional features. Our strategy for estimation is to augment the observed data with draws from a hypothetical population in which the constraints are not present, thereby taking advantage of computationally expedient methods for fitting mixture models. Missing/blanked items are sampled from their posterior distribution using the Hit-and-Run sampler, which guarantees that all imputations satisfy the constraints. We illustrate the approach using manufacturing data from Colombia, examining the potential to preserve joint distributions and a regression from the plant productivity literature.

Natural gas consumption is specified as a function of its own price; substitute prices; urban wages; and other supply, climate, and housing characteristics. Using a feasible generalised least squares (FGLS) technique, which controls for panel heteroskedasticity and panel correlation, we find that natural gas consumption is price elastic and income inelastic when other covariates (e.g., the supply of natural gas pipeline and heating degree days) are controlled. In addition, there are large variations in demand behaviours across China's regions. There is a substantial income effect on demand for natural gas in southern China, whereas the northern regions are found to have a higher price effect. In addition, the substitution effect between coal and natural gas is significant in North China but is not significant in South China. These findings have several important policy implications for natural gas pricing and supply cost analysis in the context of China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Decomposition analysis shows that the efficiency effect played an important role in reducing energy intensity; improvement of the energy efficiency of both Japanese and Chinese manufacturing industry showed a trend of exponential decay. Structural effect significantly reduced the energy intensity of the Japanese manufacturing industry while having a relatively small influence on the energy intensity of the Chinese manufacturing industry. Our analysis also shows a strong association of industrial energy efficiency improvement with energy policies, highlighting that energy efficiency policies can play an important role in the reduction of industrial energy intensity.

Then, it estimates the elasticity of motor fuel demand in Turkey using an econometric analysis. The findings indicate that motor fuel demand in Turkey is quite inelastic and, therefore, not responsive to price increases caused by an increase in either pre-tax prices or taxes. Therefore, fuel market in Turkey is open to opportunistic behavior by firms (through excessive profits) and the government (through excessive taxes). Besides, the paper focuses on the impact of high motor fuel prices on road transport associated activities, including the pattern of passenger transportation, motorization rate, fuel use, total kilometers traveled and CO2 emissions from road transportation. The impact of motor fuel prices on income distribution in Turkey and Turkish public opinion about high motor fuel prices are also among the subjects investigated in the course of the study.

It identifies clusters of different lobbying activities and styles through in depth interviews with 20 stakeholders from policy-making and business. The research used Repertory Grid Technique in combination with HOMALS multivariate analysis. Its main findings are: First, although the big four electric utilities operating on the German energy market still possess wide influence, companies of renewable energy have developed from a niche into important players of the energy regime. Second, lobbies by the renewable energy sector are mainly aimed at the legislative framework, particularly on the Renewable Energy Sources Act and the feed-in-system. Third, interviewees identified 36 different lobby activities; the most effective ones are: 'Regular and personal maintenance of contact to politicians', 'Lobbying within an association', 'Knowledge development with correct information' and 'Top-down contacting of most powerful politicians'. Fourth, the statistical analysis reveals clear distinctions between companies with regards to their lobby strategies which are evaluated differently by stakeholders. Finally, the article concludes that companies have a strong influence on political-decision making and together with governmental actors form a 'policy network' that strongly shapes the German energy transition.

By combining household-level utility, public, and proprietary data, we examine predictors of household energy consumption in a Texas urban area. Using quantile regression, this analysis assesses the relationship between energy consumption and predictors at the middle and both ends of the distribution (10th and 90th percentiles). Results indicate potential opportunities to lower consumption among the highest energy-consuming households including those with pools, with non-central cooling, with people working from home, those built on pier/post foundation, and those that are renter-occupied. These findings suggest significant opportunities to reduce consumption and demand as in the study area, almost 10% of housing units are renter-occupied, 18% percent are without central cooling, and 7% have pools. Capturing a significant portion of these homes for retrofit conservation efforts through marketing has potential to produce substantial results. Producing a better understanding of determinants of household energy consumption using the methods presented has potential to assist development and implementation of strategies to reduce consumption and increase efficiency.

The logarithmic-mean Divisia index method (LMDI) is applied to multiplicatively decompose, at the country level, the variation in aggregate energy consumption in the EU-27 member states for the 2001-2008 period. We also analyse the sensitivity of the results when several aggregation levels are considered, with energy intensity used as the criterion to aggregate countries. This allows us to check robustness of results, also enabling an improved understanding of both inter and intra-unit effects. Results indicate that improvements in energy efficiency in the EU-27 were not enough to overcome the pressure of European economic activity on aggregate energy consumption. Mediterranean countries, and especially former communist states, increased their energy consumptions, most of them favoured by structural change. The analysis also reveals that the impact of intra-group movements on aggregate energy consumption is partially offset when moving from higher to lower aggregation levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We decompose the variation in emission and emission intensity into three different types of effects: a composition effect, a technique effect and a scale effect. The composition effect measures the change in emissions and emissions intensity due to a shift in production towards products that cause less emissions. The technique effect measures the change per each type of product, thereby accounting for technology improvements in the production of each type of good produced. The scale effect singles out the reduction in total emission due to an overall reduction in output. We show that the first phase of the application of EU-ETS has led to a reduction in both emissions and emission intensity due to the composition effect. The technological change has had a limited negative impact on emissions in the first phase, while in the second phase there has been limited technology improvement in the industry. However, the figures of the scale effect show that the larger reduction in emission is due to the overall decrease in output. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, in the short-run if the reduction in the CO2 emissions from a one-to-one substitution between biofuels and fossil fuels is less than 26 percent, or less than 57 percent if long run effect is taken into account, then US biofuels production is likely to have resulted in a strong green paradox. These results indicate that subsidies for first generation biofuels, which yield a low level of per unit CO2 emission reduction compared to fossil fuels, might have contributed to additional net CO2 emissions over the study period.

The market power measures also suggest that the coefficient is consistently positive and highly significant for both periods. Moreover, the market power and marginal costs have mixed effects according to the models proposed for both periods. In addition, our results point to the effectiveness of the different effects of mitigating the market power in the Spanish electricity market.

The steel production accounts for 22% of Germany's final industrial energy consumption. We assessed the potential of 32 identified energy conservation measures by deriving fuel, electricity and CO2 conservation cost curves. We developed a methodology which respects the current efficiency of individual plants and two different system boundaries: a process boundary for benchmarking measures and a facility boundary for calculating the total energy conservation potential. With moderate electricity and carbon price developments for the investigation period 2013-2035, the cost-effective conservation potentials are estimated to be 11.7% for fuel, 2.2% for electricity and 12.2% for fuel and process-related CO2 emissions compared to the industry's final energy use and CO2 emissions in 2012. For the sensitivity analysis, we varied electricity and carbon prices and our results showed that adopting cost-effective energy conservation measures can compensate for rising energy prices but the extent differs between the production routes. While the EAF route could compensate up to 50% higher electricity prices, the options for the BF/BOF route to reduce the fossil fuel consumption are limited. Thus, the energy-related production costs of the BF/BOF route increased in average by 6-13% between 2013 and 2035. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Coal-mining production is important in maintaining GDP growth in Inner Mongolia. However, overxploitation has created serious problems, such as pollution of the environment and significant decreases in grassland ecosystem services, in addition to impacting the well-being of herdsmen and other humans. Based on questionnaires survey performed among 864 herdsmen addressing the relationship between coal exploitation in grasslands and human well-being in Xilinguole League in Inner Mongolia, we found that (1) coal resource exploitation in these grasslands does not benefit the herdsmen by increasing their income; (2) the rapid development of this resource has not obviously materially improved the life of the herdsmen; and (3) these activities have increased the risks that herdsman will have to endure in the future. Overall, coal resource exploitation in grasslands has more negative than positive effects on the well-being of herdsmen. We propose the conservation of coal resources and improvement of ecological compensation should be carried out without blindly pursuing economic growth, instead of focusing on economic development and structural adjustments.

The short- and long-run elasticities of electricity demand with respect to price and income are empirically estimated using a co-integration and error-correction model. The short- and long-run price elasticities are estimated to be -0.421 and -1.002, respectively. The short- and long-run income elasticities are computed to be 0.855 and 1.090, respectively. Electricity demand in the service sector is inelastic to changes in both price and income in the short-run, but elastic in the long-run. Therefore, it appears that a pricing policy is more effective than the direct regulation of reducing electricity demand in the long-run in order to stabilize the electricity demand in the service sector. Moreover, it is necessary to encourage a more efficient use of electricity to cope with increasing demand for electricity following economic growth because the electricity demand in the service sector is income-elastic in the long-run.

As such, it seems pertinent to analyse their impact on economic growth considering both phenomena together. By estimating a dynamic panel specification at country level, this paper analyses how agglomeration and inequality (both their levels and their evolution) influence long-run economic growth. In line with previous findings, our results suggest that while high-inequality levels are a limiting factor for long-run growth, agglomeration processes can be associated with economic growth, at least in countries at early stages of development. Moreover, we find that the growth-enhancing benefits from agglomeration processes depend not only on the country's level of development, but also on its initial income distribution (something, to the best of our knowledge, not considered before). In fact, probably suggesting a social dimension to congestion diseconomies, increasing agglomeration is associated with lower growth when income distribution is particularly unequal.","[Castells-Quintana, David; Royuela, Vicente] Univ Barcelona, AQR, IREA, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Castells-Quintana, D (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, AQR, IREA, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",dcastells@ub.edu; vroyuela@ub.edu,"Castells-Quintana, David/Z-2511-2019; Royuela, Vicente/A-4162-2009","Castells-Quintana, David/0000-0002-0250-7214; Royuela, Vicente/0000-0002-7647-0063",,,,,63,57,60,4,53,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

One power generation unit (PGU) is operated at base load while the other is operated following the electric load. The waste heat from both PGUs is used for heating and for cooling via an absorption chiller. The D-CCHP configuration is studied for a restaurant benchmark building, and its performance is quantified in terms of operational cost, primary energy consumption (PEC), and carbon dioxide emissions (CDE). Cost spark spread, PEC spark spread, and CDE spark spread are examined as performance indicators for the D-CCHP system. D-CCHP system performance correlates well with spark spreads, with higher spark spreads signifying greater savings through implementation of a D-CCHP system. A new parameter, thermal difference, is introduced to investigate the relative performance of a D-CCHP system compared to a dual PGU combined heat and power system (D-CHP). Thermal difference, together with spark spread, can explain the variation in savings of a D-CCHP system over a D-CHP system for each location. The effect of carbon credits on operational cost savings with respect to the reference case is shown for selected locations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Wind farms are often located in uplands because most are of low agricultural value, are distant from residential areas, and are windy. Many UK uplands are peatlands, with layers of accumulated peat that represent a large stock of soil carbon. When peatlands are drained for construction there is a higher risk of net carbon loss than for mineral soils. Previous work suggests that wind farms sited on peatlands can reduce net carbon emissions if strictly managed for maximum retention of carbon. Here we show that, whereas in 2010, most sites had potential to provide net carbon savings, by 2040 most sites will not reduce carbon emissions even with careful management. This is due to projected changes in the proportion of fossil fuels used to generate electricity. The results suggest future policy should avoid constructing wind farms on undegraded peatlands unless drainage of peat is minimal and the volume excavated in foundations can be significantly reduced compared to energy output.

The paper demonstrates the usefulness of a latent variable approach and, in relation to policy, the findings suggest the need for an explicit regional policy to tackle unemployment in Australia.","[Dixon, Robert; Freebairn, John] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Lim, G.

At the same time, biofuel represents the possibility of substitution between energy and food. For developing countries like India, which imports over 75% of its crude oil, fossil fuels pose two risks-global warming pollution and long-term risk that oil prices will undermine real living standards. This paper examines India's options for managing energy price risk in three ways: biofuel development, energy efficiency promotion, and food productivity improvements. Our salient results suggest that biodiesel shows promise as a transport fuel substitute that can be produced in ways that fully utilize marginal agricultural resources and hence promote rural livelihoods. First-generation bioethanol, by contrast, appears to have a limited ability to offset the impacts of oil price hikes. Combining the biodiesel expansion policy with energy efficiency improvements and food productivity increases proved to be a more effective strategy to enhance both energy and food security, help mitigate climate change, and cushion the economy against oil price shocks.

Contemporary crisis across Europe and the crisis of regional development theories, Regional Studies. This paper explores the prima facie puzzling issue of why so much contemporary theory in economic geography and regional planning - specifically New Economic Geography (NEG) and New Regionalism (NR) - has so little to say about the causes of the current post-2007 crisis and its geography globally and in Europe. It is argued here that this reflects its obsession with the regional success stories' of the 1970s and 1980s, its failure to appreciate the onset of crisis and the reasons for it in these regions in the 1990s, and its failure to appreciate the nature of capitalism as a crisis prone social system of combined and uneven development. Thus, the current economic crisis pushed dominant regional development theories into a homologous deep theoretical crisis. It is concluded that the time is ripe for a paradigm shift in theory and that this should involve a reconsideration of earlier theoretical approaches that fell out of fashion for a variety of intellectual and political reasons and of current radical social movements.","[Hadjimichalis, Costis] Harokopio Univ, Dept Geog, GR-17679 Athens, Greece; [Hudson, Ray] Univ Durham, Palatine Ctr, Durham DH1 3LE, England",Harokopio University Athens; Durham University,"Hadjimichalis, C (通讯作者)，Harokopio Univ, Dept Geog, 70 El Venizelou Ave, GR-17679 Athens, Greece.",hadjimichalis@hua.gr; ray.hudson@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,75,131,138,0,71,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Numerous programs and incentives were provided for the development of entrepreneurial graduates with the aim of reducing unemployment and dependency on the job market. Universities are working hand in hand with other government agencies and private sectors in developing entrepreneurial graduates. Despite numerous efforts taken, the number of graduates involve in starting a businessare not very encouraging, and not up to the government aspiration to have more entrepreneurial graduates especially from the public universities. Majority of graduates choose to be employed rather than set up their own business due to the uncertainty and risks of identifying and managing a promising business venture. This paper explores and identifies factors that have influence graduates to start a business, focusing on formal education and non formal education. The data was collected through survey questionnaire because it allowed the identification of important and emerging issues that required further explanation. The useable response rate was 244 and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. The results indicate non formal education (business mentoring, experiential learning and programs attended) to be the most contributing factor as compared to formal education (educator involvement) in influencing graduates to start their businesses. This finding offers an important aspect on the impact of formal and non-formal entrepreneurship education in public institutions of higher learning in encouraging graduates to start their own business.","[Abdullah, Azizan] Univ Telmol MARA, Malaysian Acad SMEs & Entrepreneurship Dev MASMED, Ctr Strateg Planning & Informat, Fac Business Management, Selangor, Malaysia; [Abidin, Zanariah Zainal] Univ Telmol MARA, Malaysian Acad SMEs & Entrepreneurship Dev MASMED, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Abdullah, A (通讯作者)，Univ Telmol MARA, Malaysian Acad SMEs & Entrepreneurship Dev MASMED, Ctr Strateg Planning & Informat, Fac Business Management, Selangor, Malaysia.",azizan629@salam.uitm.edu.my; zanar863@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Abdullah, Azizan/E-2824-2018","Abdullah, Azizan/0000-0003-1136-5083",,,,,36,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,1501,+,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100157,0

By performing UHPLC/QTOF mass spectrometry analysis in both positive and negative ionization mode, in a grape extract averaging 320-450 putative compounds are identified. Most of these compounds are important grape metabolites, including flavonols, anthocyanins, and stilbene derivatives. In the present study, this approach was focalized on the characterization of flavonols of 18 important Italian red and white grape varieties and the method provided the identification of 15 flavonols. By performing statistical analysis (Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis), the effect of the variety on the flavonol composition of the grapes was studied. Both the red and white samples fell into three different groups, respectively, on the basis of their flavonol profiles. Because the samples were cultivated in the same vineyard, their profile potentially was not affected by cultural or environmental factors. Anyway, these preliminary results will have to be confirmed by the study of grape samples collected in different years and from different vineyards.","[Bavaresco, Luigi; De Rosso, Mirko; Dalla Vedova, Antonio; Panighel, Annarita; Gardiman, Massimo; Ostan, Mauro; Flamini, Riccardo] Ctr Ric Viticoltura CRA VIT, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, I-31015 Conegliano, TV, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Flamini, R (通讯作者)，Ctr Ric Viticoltura CRA VIT, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Viale 28 Aprile 26, I-31015 Conegliano, TV, Italy.",riccardo.flamini@entecra.it,,"Gardiman, Massimo/0000-0003-4541-1201",,,,,11,1,1,0,4,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2014,3.0,,1.0,,,,,,,10.1051/bioconf/20140301006,0.0,,,3,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BB8BQ,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346256100006,0

In this paper, we consider a multivariate continuous distribution of the random returns and use the sample approximation technique to solve the DEA problems approximately.

Firstly, We find that value added in exports are less than gross value, which the method about the measurement of the domestic content in exports put forward by Hummels et al (2001) overestimate value per unit of export. Secondly, bilateral trade balance in value-added terms does not equal to bilateral gross trade balance. Both the absolute and relative proportion of value added in exports and gross exports between trading partners have impact on adjustment magnitude when trade in gross terms convert to value-added terms. Finally, we explore value added in exports of manufacture and high-tech manufacture in China, and find that bilateral trade balance in both sample countries and China have a great transfer, which show there are triangle production-sharing phenomenon in the sample trade of countries' manufactures and high-tech manufactures.","Shandong Womens Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong Womens University,"Su, CH (通讯作者)，Shandong Womens Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",sdz2513@163.com,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,10,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2339-5133,,978-981-09-1682-4,ADV SOC BEHAV SCI,,,2014,6.0,,2.0,,,,209,221,,10.5729/asbs.vol6.209,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC9JK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356465900035,0

Furthermore even if the Slovak economy is rather emerging country, its second moments of the given Slovak aggregate cyclical components better corresponds to the small developed country: consumption is less volatile than output, government purchases are low volatile and countercyclical, trade balance and current account are countercyclical.

This situation occurs in case of using the market timing strategy. They suggest using the Omega ratio instead of the Sharpe ratio. In the Omega ratio the whole distribution of returns is used.

In particular, the trade-off between spending and saving is analyzed within the framework of a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model. The model is further validated against historical data available for 2001-2010. The total factor productivity is calculated endogenously in the model based on a function that reflects the changes in factor productivity. The results suggest that saving oil revenues, whether in an oil fund or through physical investment in domestic sectors, leads to a higher economic growth. However, physical investment is superior in the short to medium term based on the resultant GDP while creating an oil fund might be more beneficial in the post oil era. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

With the production of bioenergy in rural areas, practices within agriculture are transformed, requiring new ways of organizing production processes. Research has left the question largely unanswered of how agricultural biogas production and use are - and can best be - organized within rural society. Which kinds of social organization exist, how are these embedded in existing agricultural institutions and practices, and how do these systems function? Under which conditions may the different kinds of social organization of biogas production and use work sustainably? This introduction article to the Special Issue The social organization of agricultural biogas production and use presents a framework for analysing the different kinds of social organization of biogas production and use presented hereafter.

However, despite such systems' technological feasibility, they are often discontinued. Research so far has not studied the reasons for discontinuation. This article analyses a case of biomass based gasification in India, by studying the type of goods the village system provides, and the distribution of benefits within the system. In this case, the infrastructural and social system provide electricity as a club good. Given fluctuating numbers of service users, the club faced the decision to either expand the system to new members, or to reduce the services provided. The focus on the village community hampered the extension of the club. A reduction in the quality and quantity of services however decreased the comfort provided by the system. The system faced what here is called a club dilemma. To avoid the club dilemma and for a sustained energy provision, policy needs to find means to secure feedstock, i.e. by the means of subsidies or collaboration with agricultural departments.

We explored their impacts in terms of five groups of criteria: (1) forest resource dynamics; (2) variations in wood products prices and quantities consumed and produced; (3) trade balance; (4) budgetary costs; and (5) variations in agent surpluses. We show that no policy option is more desirable than another on the basis of all of these criteria and that trade-offs will determine which is the best policy option to be implemented.

Using the metaphor of China Inc., we compare the Chinese government to a socially responsible corporation that aims to balance the needs of its internal stakeholders with the demands from a resource-dependent world. We find that China's internal stakeholders have more power and legitimacy in the REE debate than the ROW and reconceptualise various possible mitigation strategies that could change current international policy and market dynamics.

By far the largest potential reduction in GHG emissions is achieved by eliminating meat from the diet (35% reduction), followed by changing from carbon-intensive lamb and beef to less carbon-intensive pork and chicken (18% reduction). Cutting out all avoidable waste delivers an emissions saving of 12%. Not eating foods grown in hot-houses or air-freighted to the UK offers a 5% reduction in emissions. We show how combinations of consumer actions can easily lead to reductions of 25% in food related GHG emissions.

A financial model was adapted and run to determine the net present value, internal rate of return, and payback period associated with a 15 MW biomass-to-electricity facility. The analysis suggests that Ontario should consider a stronger incentive than the recently-offered CDN$ 0.13 kW(-1) h(-1) for biomass-to-electricity. If no customer for heat generated from the plant can be found, FIT rates between CDN$ 0.17-0.22 kW(-1) h(-1) are necessary to achieve a 15% internal rate of return and a simple payback of approximately 5 yr; achieving a price of CDN$ 0.013 kW(-1) of thermal output still requires elevated FIT rates between CDN$ 0.15-0.21 kW(-1) h(-1) to meet economic performance criteria.

About one third of rural households of Bangladesh are connected to the grid. To meet the gap, solar energy has been treated as a feasible option for people in rural areas where grid connections are not available. A good number of organizations have been working together to provide Solar Home System (SHS) in rural Bangladesh. There is little evidence that supply of small scale energy supports significant rural development. This paper aims at understanding how increased energy access through SHS in rural Bangladesh contributes towards rural development. Recent published literatures on SHS in Bangladesh have been studied to get insight into the technical, financial, and operational as well as economic and social issues. Later the findings have been critically analyzed with respect to selected indicators of rural development. The study identified that increased access to energy through SHS in rural Bangladesh provides mostly recreational and leisure benefits with the so called 'social status'; income generation is negligible while support for education is average.

J,"Sander, M",,,,"Sander, Michael",,,Conceptual proposals for measuring the impact of internationale regimes on energy security,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy security; Regime effectiveness; Energy governance,INDICATORS; INTEGRATION,"The paper proposes two concepts to assess the effect of international regimes on energy security. Existing indicators focus mainly on state-level factors, excluding international influences. International relation scholars on the other hand see a clear connection between international regimes and stable energy relations. International regimes stabilise energy relations by providing frameworks for negotiations, defining, controlling and sanctioning compliance and allowing the actors to engage in package deals. The researcher needs to include these factors in a complete assessment of political energy security risks. As first step, the paper uses the effectiveness of control mechanisms as basis for such consideration. It refers specifically to international arbitration as the most important control mechanism in international energy relations. The simplest measurement option is the share of a county's energy imports covered by a certain regime. The paper applies the Oslo-Potsdam-Solution to account for outcome effectiveness. It applies a variant of the International Regimes Data Base protocol to account for effective regime structures. In a last section, the paper proposes some possible paths for future research.

Existing district heating pricing methods, such as the cost-plus pricing method and the conventional marginal-cost pricing method, cannot simultaneously provide both high efficiency and sufficient investment cost return. To solve this problem, the paper presents a new pricing model, namely. Equivalent Marginal Cost Pricing (EMCP) model, which is based on the EVE pricing theory and the unique characteristics of heat products and district heating. The EMCP model uses exergy as the measurement of heating product value and places products from different district heating regions into the same competition platform. In the proposed model, the return on investment cost is closely related to the quoted cost, and within the limitations of the Heating Capacity Cost Reference and the maximum compensated shadow capacity cost, both lower and higher price speculations of heat producers are restricted. Simulation results show that the model can guide heat producers to bid according to their production costs and to provide reasonable returns on investment, which contributes to stimulate the role of price leverage and to promote the optimal allocation of heat resources.

It states that fossil-fuel rich countries tend to follow more carbon-intensive developmental pathways than [if they were] fossil-fuel poor countries, due to a hitherto unappreciated syndrome of causal mechanisms. First, fuel rich countries emit significant amounts of CO2 in the extraction of fuel and through associated wasteful practices such as gas flaring. Second, easy access to domestic fuel in such countries leads to crowding-out effects for their energy mix and economic structure (for example, abundant oil may displace other fuels from the energy mix and lead to the Dutch Disease). Third, fuel abundance weakens the economic incentive to invest in energy efficiency. Fourth, governments in fuel rich countries are under considerable pressure to grant uneconomic fuel consumption subsidies, which further augments the carbon intensity of their economic output. Due to the combined effect of these causal mechanisms, it is genuinely difficult for fuel rich countries to evade carbon-intensive developmental pathways. And yet there are remarkable exceptions like Norway. Such positive outliers indicate that the carbon curse is not destiny when appropriate policies are adopted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicate that the relocation decisions of firms are sector-dependent, and the migratory behaviour of firms in knowledge-intensive sectors notably differs from that in less knowledge-intensive sectors. Predominantly low-tech and medium-low-tech manufacturing and less knowledge-intensive service firms paying high average salaries have a higher probability to move out of their present location. For less knowledge-intensive service firms, the average municipal wage negatively affects their propensity to relocate, while those located in municipalities with high sector-specific wages have an increased likelihood to move. Relocating firms are generally attracted by densely populated municipalities with high wage levels, and primarily service firms are drawn to municipalities which are specialized in the firm's own sector and appeal to individuals. Sector-specific wages may either attract, or deter firms, suggesting that this variable may capture both the cost and the quality of the locally available workforce.","[Kronenberg, Kristin] Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci, NL-6401 DL Heerlen, Netherlands; [Kronenberg, Kristin] Maastricht Univ, NL-6211 LM Maastricht, Netherlands; [Kronenberg, Kristin] Stat Netherlands CBS, Heerlen, Netherlands",Open University Netherlands; Maastricht University,"Kronenberg, K (通讯作者)，Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci, NL-6401 DL Heerlen, Netherlands.",kristin.kronenberg@ou.nl,,,,,,,37,37,41,1,54,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Abundance of coal mines and consequently a considerable amount of methane emission requires drastic measures to mitigate harmful effects of coal mining on the environment. One of the commonly adopted methods is to use emitted methane to fuel power generation systems; however, instability of fuel sources hinders the development of systems using conventional prime movers. To address this, application of Stirling engines may be considered. Here, we develop a techno-economic methodology for conducting an optimisation-based feasibility study on the application of Stirling engines as the prime movers of coal mine CHP systems from an economic and an environmental point of view. To examine the impact of environmental policies on the economics of the system, the two commonly implemented ones (i.e. a carbon tax and emissions trading scheme) are considered. The methodology was applied to a local coal mine. The results indicate that incorporating the modelled system not only leads to a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but also to improved economics. Further, due to the heavy economic burden, the carbon tax scheme creates great incentive for coal mine industry to address the methane emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

More recently, electricity has been traded across national borders and in certain cases, viz., Bhutan, has been the dominant export; in other situations, it is used to repay debts owed to neighboring countries. This paper investigates the role of electricity as the primary export, analyzes its valuation, and then goes on to evaluate the impact on the terms of trade. We conclude that in the medium-term, the electric power exporting economy would be better off developing its manufacturing sector to diversify its exposure and to protect its trade interests. The case of Bhutanese hydro-electricity exports to India is studied and the change in trade advantage with every increase in power tariff is ascertained. It is found that a 126% annual increase in (non-food) consumer prices is correlated with a 1% increase in electricity export tariff. While the causality from electric power tariff to Indian manufactures prices is not established statistically, a change in manufactures prices feeding back into consumer prices in Bhutan is statistically significant. Suggestions are offered for Bhutan to reduce dependence on Indian imports and to diversify its export market exposure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike direct CO2 emissions for each sector, CO2 emissions associated with complex linkages among sectors are usually ignored. We integrated the input-output analysis with the hypothetical extraction method to uncover the in-depth characteristics of the inter-sectoral linkages of CO2 emissions. Based on China's 2007 data, this paper compared the output and demand emissions of CO2 among eight blocks. The difference between the demand and output emissions of a block indicates that CO2 is transferred from one block to another. Among the sectors analyzed in this study, the Energy industry block has the greatest CO2 emissions with the Technology industry, Construction and Service blocks as its emission's primary destinations. Low-carbon industries that have lower direct CO2 emissions are deeply anchored to high-carbon ones.

The purpose of this is to evaluate the contribution that electricity from PVs can make to reduce the electricity load of a city, supply the needs of a mixture of building types, reduce peak electricity demand and contribute towards the charging of electric vehicles (EVs). Having established the maximum potential, intermediate stages in PV penetration can be backcasted. The results indicate that low dense suburbia is not only the most efficient collector of solar energy but that enough excess electricity can be generated to power daily transport needs of suburbia and also contribute to peak daytime electrical loads in the city centre. This challenges conventional thinking that suburbia is energy inefficient. While a compact city may be more efficient for the internal combustion engine vehicles, a dispersed city is more efficient when distributed generation of electricity by PVs is the main energy source and EVs are the means of transport.

The success of recent renewable promotion schemes adds a new dimension to ensuring long-term security of supply: it necessitates designing second-best policies to prevent large-scale wind power development from distorting long-run equilibrium prices and investments in conventional generation and in particular in peaking units. We rely upon a long-term simulation model which simulates electricity market players' investment decisions in a market regime and incorporates large-scale wind power development in the presence of either subsidized or market driven development scenarios. We test the use of capacity mechanisms to compensate for long-term effects of large-scale wind power development on prices and reliability of supply. The first finding is that capacity mechanisms can help to reduce the social cost of large scale wind power development in terms of decrease of loss of load probability. The second finding is that, in a market-based wind power deployment without subsidy, wind generators are penalised for insufficient contribution to the long term system's reliability.

By offering plant operators a premium on top of the electricity market price, premium schemes represent an option to increase the alignment of renewable electricity production with market signals, and have been implemented by several EU member states. This paper examines the case study of the German market premium scheme adopted in 2012. Building on an evaluation of early experiences, we discuss whether the market premium contributes to the aims of market and/or system integration (effectiveness), and what potential efficiency gains and additional costs of administering integration are associated with it (efficiency). While exposing renewables to price risks is not the scheme's purpose, it has successfully increased participation in direct marketing. However, risks of overcompensating producers for marketing and balancing costs are high, and the benefits of gradually leading plant operators towards the market are questionable. Incentives for demand-oriented production are established, but they seem insufficient particularly in the case of intermittent renewable energy sources. To conclude, we provide an outlook on alternative designs of premium schemes, and discuss whether they seem better suited for addressing the challenges ahead. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using half hourly electricity demand data, the system marginal price (also called the wholesale price) and the retail price of electricity, we analyse how the gross margin varies across customers with different characteristics. The wholesale price varies throughout the day, thus, the time at which electricity is used affects the gross margin. The main factor in determining gross margin, however, is the level of demand. The highest gross margins are earned from supplying customers that have the following characteristics: being aged between 46 and 55, having a household income of at least 75,000 per annum, being self-employed, having a third-level education, having a professional or managerial occupation, living in a household with seven or more people, living in a detached house, having at least five bedrooms or being a mortgage holder.

Nowadays there are many designs of these NPPs but for political, strategic and economic reasons only few of them will be deployed. International literature proposes many papers and reports dealing with GEN IV NPPs, but there is an evident difference in the types and structures of the information and a general unbiased overview is missing. This paper fills the gap, presenting the state-of-the-art for GEN IV NPPs technologies (VHTR, SFR, SCWR, GFR, LFR and MSR) providing a comprehensive literature review of the different designs, discussing the major R&D challenges and comparing them with other advanced technologies available for the middle- and long-term energy market. The result of this research shows that the possible applications for GEN IV technologies are wider than current NPPs. The economics of some GEN IV NPPs is similar to actual NPPs but the carbon cost for fossil-fired power plants would increase the relative valuation. However, GEN IV NPPs still require substantial R&D effort, preventing short-term commercial adoption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The model has also been introduced as a business model for biomass-based heat entrepreneurship. However, the residential sector has been problematic with regard to ESCo adoption and constitutes a minor share of ESCo operations. The barriers, both social and economic, are many. This paper focuses on the application of ESCo as a business model for heat entrepreneurship in Finland. First, we present the ESCo model and a review of the main barriers. Second, we present the modelling with aspects of profitability and risk sharing. Third, we demonstrate the operation in the residential sector by using 26 housing associations as a case study. We simulate the energy investment, profitability of operation, and the sharing of risks between the customer and the ESCo. The results indicate that the ESCo model is challenging in our case area. Low profit levels and the assumed customer's preference for achieving cost savings from the beginning of energy renovation can result in long contract periods tying up the capital. The ESCo model is unattractive in the current business climate, requiring modifications or integration with other maintenance services of housing associations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It argues for a link between situated knowledge' and geographical imagining' to strengthen understandings about the mobilization of strategic narratives or political projects' around visions of futures. These ideas inform a genealogy of significant moments in rural-urban relations, and enquiry into political projects at work in a national mini-conference on competition over land use.

Regional planning and the mobilization of regional identity': from bounded spaces to relational complexity, Regional Studies. Regional identity refers to the uniqueness of regions and/or to the identification of people with them. Having gained currency in planning and policy circles, the concept is increasingly related to regional competitiveness. Yet, it is unclear how regional identity is understood in planning terms. This paper suggests that this discursive ambiguousness derives from the fuzzy boundary between analysis and practice as well as from the context-bound character of identity discourse. A contextual geo-historical analysis is offered of the emergence of regional identity discourse in Finnish provinces. This provides a background for a study of how regional identity discourse is mobilized in strategic regional/provincial plans and how planners understand this term. These analyses show that the historical discourse on regional identity is at variance with the instrumental, visionary discourse of plans. Planners have diverging views on the roles of regional identity which also differ from the visionary views present in the plans.","Univ Oulu, Dept Geog, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland",University of Oulu,"Paasi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oulu, Dept Geog, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",anssi.paasi@oulu.fi,,,,,,,88,131,142,0,78,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Without adjustments of the fixed cap, decreasing electricity demand (relative to business-as-usual) reduces the carbon price without reducing total emissions. With lower carbon prices, costly low emission processes will be substituted by cheaper high emitting processes. Possible electricity and carbon price effects of electricity demand reduction scenarios under various carbon caps are quantified with a long-term electricity market simulation model. The results show that electricity efficiency policies allow for a significant reduction of the carbon cap. Compared to the 2005 emission level, 30% emission reductions can be achieved by 2020 within the emission trading scheme with similar or even lower costs for the industrial sector than were expected when the cap was initially set for a 21% emission reduction.

A well-known approach associates national net investments with the shadow value of change in stock of capital assets in an economy. Following this capital stock approach, sectoral net investments can be defined as the shadow value of change in stock of capital assets owned by a sector in an economy. An alternative approach is based on future commodity flows to a sector. This commodity flow approach associates sectoral net investments with the present value of changes in future commodity flows to a sector. In the present paper, I compare these two approaches and prove that they coincide with each other only if the future commodity flows to the sector can be attributed to current stock of capital assets in the sector alone. In empirical studies, commodity flow approach can be a better alternative if the purpose is to estimate the contributions to national net investments of a recipient of future cash flows.

These include alternative technical and non-technical options and deployment needs, the cost and benefits of the infrastructure (risks and mitigation measures), and the impact of a number of stakeholders: consumers, distributors, retailers, competitive market operators, competing technology companies, etc. The scale and number of potential variables in the AMI space is an almost unprecedented challenge to policymakers, with the anticipation of new ancillary products and services, associated market contestability, related regulatory and policy amendments, and the adequacy of consumer protection, education, and safety considerations requiring utmost due-diligence. Embarking on AMI investment entails significant technical, implementation, and strategic risk for governments and administering bodies, and an active effort is required to ensure AMI governance and planning maximises the potential benefits, and minimise uncertainties, costs, and risks to stakeholders. This work seeks to clarify AMI fundamentals and discusses the technical and related governance considerations from a dispassionate perspective, yet acknowledges many stakeholders tend to dichotomise debate, and obfuscate both advantages and benefits, and the converse.

Furthermore, two future electricity generation plan-scenarios for Lebanon are investigated, where multi variables are examined, namely: cost, environment and tariff. First, an economical-environmental optimization is carried out, where two reasonable scenarios are introduced based on the fuel source of CCGT power plants. Results revealed that thern investment in wind energy and natural gas for power production should be a main concern in the future. Second, an optimization of the average electricity tariff for each of the two investigated generation scenarios is studied, where three different approaches are illustrated. Results confirm that all tariff plans are acceptable and convincing, and that the use of natural gas in CCGT plants is always preferred against gasoil. Moreover, the optimized average tariff is maximally a double of the current EDL average tariff, which is very convincing compared with the actual cost of electricity for the current Lebanese electricity sector.

The amenity values added to houses by their views were quantified for houses sold during a housing boom and again during a recession. The results of this study show that forest views add significant value to homes during both periods. However, the amenity value added to houses decreased 13 % from the boom period to the recession period, implying that forest views decrease in value when there is an economic recession. Additionally, the value of the view of barren/scrub land, which was not significant in the boom period, became significant during the recession, reducing house value almost $112 per visible acre and showing that while consumers are less inclined to pay more for views of forest, they are also less willing to endure disamenity views during a recession. When the forest land values were mapped to highlight planned areas with consistently high visual amenity values across both periods, some areas exhibited amenity values in excess of $100 per visible acre of forest land. The areas with the highest amenity values of forest land views roughly correspond to the areas with the highest disamenity values of barren/scrub view. These results imply that these areas represent the highest potential return on investment for preservation and reforestation efforts.","[Chadourne, Matthew; Cho, Seong-Hoon; Roberts, Roland K.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Cho, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, 2621 Morgan Circle,314-D Morgan Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",scho9@utk.edu,,,,,,,47,9,9,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Given that currently around 0.1% of the electricity generation comes from wind energy, this paper examines the technical feasibility and economic costs associated with realising this goal. The technical potential for wind energy in Baden-Wurttemberg is determined, along with the costs of electricity generation, which together lead to the derivation of cost-potential-curves. The technical potential is calculated by identifying the available area with the aid of a geographical information system (GIS) and land use information. With the help of a regional wind atlas, turbine power curves and an assumed wind speed frequency distribution, the spatially distributed electricity generation potential on a district level is estimated. The costs of wind energy are investigated for the year 2010 and projected for the years 2020 and 2030 on the basis of learning curves. The result is a suitable area for wind energy of 2119 km(2), which amounts to 5.9% of the total area of Baden-Wurttemberg. Depending on the wind turbine selected, a capacity of 18.5 GW up to 24.5 GW could be installed and depending on the hub height and the turbine, an electricity yield of 29.3 TWh up to 40.7 TWh could be generated. The costs of electricity, depending on the type of turbine and the average wind speed, but lie for 2010 between 3.99 and 21.42 (sic)-cents/kWh, reducing by 2030 to 333-17.84 (sic)-cents/kWh.

In this work, a universal measure of emissions to be applied at the international level is proposed, based on a modification of the Greenhouse Gas Intensity (GHG-INT) measure. It is hoped that the generality and low administrative cost of this measure, which we call the Modified Greenhouse Gas Intensity measure (MGHG-INT), will eliminate any need to classify nations. The core of the MGHG-INT is what we call the IHDI-adjusted Gross Domestic Product (IDHIGDP), based on the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). The IDHIGDP makes it possible to propose universal measures, such as MGHG-INT. We also propose a carbon border tax applicable at national borders, based on MGHG-INT and IDHIGDP. This carbon tax is supported by a proposed global Emissions Trading System (ETS). The proposed carbon tax is analyzed in a short-term scenario, where it is shown that it can result in a significant reduction in global emissions while keeping the economy growing at a positive rate. In addition to annual GHG emissions, cumulative GHG emissions over two decades are considered with almost the same results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As a developed nation, the UK's economic structure has changed from that of a primary producer to that of a primary consumer. Although the UK's energy consumption appears to have peaked, it imports a lot of energy embodied in international trade alongside the more obvious direct energy imports. The UK has seen increasing dependency on imported fossil energy since the UK became a net energy importer in 2005. In this paper an energy input-output model is established to calculate not only the amount of fossil energy embodied in UK's imports and exports, but also the sector and country distributions of those embodied fossil energy. The research results suggest the following: UK's embodied fossil energy imports have exceeded embodied fossil energy exports every year since 1997, UK embodied energy imports through the so-called 'Made in China' phenomena are the largest accounting for 43% of total net fossil energy imports. If net embodied fossil energy imports are considered, the gap between energy consumption and production in UK is much larger than commonly perceived, with subsequent implications to the UK's energy security.

This finding is critical and warns successful design and execution of energy and environmental policy framework which would pave the low carbon sustainable growth path in India.

Agents obtain utility from both resource use and from behaving according to a norm of quota compliance. The users can exceed their quota at the risk of being detected and formally punished, but they also risk informal sanctions in the form of social disapproval and guilt. I find that when accounting for informal enforcement, there is an indirect effect of regulatory change in addition to the intended direct effect. When policy change, such as tougher enforcement, makes individuals more compliant, the norm of compliance is gradually strengthened, which in turn induces more compliant behavior. I study the implications of policy change on compliance level, quota prices, and the norm of compliance, and show how the properties of the punishment function have important implications for the outcome.

In this paper, we address the energy-related GHG emission trajectories, features, and driving forces in Chinese ISI for 2001-2010. First, energy related GHG inventory for ISI is made for both scope 1 (direct emissions) and scope 2 (including imported electricity emission). Then, the driving forces for such emission changes are explored by utilizing the method of logarithmic mean Divisa index (LMDI) decomposition analysis. Results indicate that Chinese ISI experienced a rapid growth of energy related GHG emission at average annual growth rate of 70 million tons CO(2)e. Production scale effect is the main driving factor for energy related GHG emission increase in Chinese IS!, while energy intensity effect and emission factor change effect offset the total increase and energy structure has marginal effect. Construction, manufacture of general purpose and special purpose machinery and manufacture of transport equipment sectors are main sectors for embodied emissions, amounting for more than 75% of the total embodied emissions from Chinese ISI. Such research findings propose that a detailed consideration can help make appropriate polices for mitigating ISI's energy-related GHG emission. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Substantial differences in retirement savings exist among Australians. Little is known, however, about how these patterns play out at a small area level, partly due to an absence of available data about wealth holdings at a small area level. This paper uses spatial microsimulation techniques to produce estimates of superannuation savings for Australian men and women who in 2006 were aged between forty-five and sixty years at a Statistical Local Area (SLA) level. The findings show substantial differences between Australia's small areas in terms of both superannuation ownership and median balances.","[Vidyattama, Yogi; Cassells, Rebecca; Harding, Ann; McNamara, Justine] Univ Canberra, Natl Ctr Social & Econ Modelling NATSEM, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",University of Canberra,"Vidyattama, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Natl Ctr Social & Econ Modelling NATSEM, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Yogi.Vidyattama@natsem.canberra.edu.au; Rebecca.Cassells@natsem.canberra.edu.au; Ann.Harding@natsem.canberra.edu.au; Justine.McNamara@natsem.canberra.edu.au,"Vidyattama, Yogi/AFC-8825-2022","Vidyattama, Yogi/0000-0001-9496-6938; Cassells, Rebecca/0000-0001-7657-9272",,,,,50,5,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Using panel data methods and a difference in differences specification, I measure the impact of each program on plant-level carbon emissions, plant-level carbon intensity, and plant level output. I find that neither program has generated an impact on plant-level carbon emissions, emissions intensity, or output.

We focus on whether individuals with higher educational attainment tend to work in the central city versus the suburbs, and we do so taking into account the residential location of households (central city vs suburb). We show that central cities tend to be the work site of more highly educated workers-those with a bachelor's degree and above. Workers with less than a high school degree also tend to work in the city. Taking account of the residential location preferences of highly educated workers mildly diminishes the direct effect of higher education on city job location, but it does not negate it. In contrast, central city job opportunities for workers with less than a high school education are not so abundant; these workers tend to work in the city mostly because they also live there.","[Sander, William] Depaul Univ, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Testa, William A.] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",DePaul University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Sander, W (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Dept Econ, 1 East Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",wsander@depaul.edu; William.Testa@chi.frb.org,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Data concerning the energy intensity and utilization of different passenger and freight transportation modes in 2005, and per capita income, in 10 different socioeconomic regions of the world are combined with scenarios of population and per capita GDP to generate scenarios of future transportation energy demand. The impact of various technical options (improvements in the energy intensity of all transportation modes, changes in the proportions of vehicles with different drive trains, and a shift to biomass or hydrogen for the non-electricity energy requirements) and behavioural options (a shift to less energy-intensive LDV market segments, a reduction in total passenger-km of travel per capita, and an increase in the share of less energy, intensive passenger and freight modes of transport) is assessed. To eliminate transportation fossil fuel emissions within this century while limiting the demand for electricity, biofuels or hydrogen to manageable levels requires the simultaneous application of all the technical and behavioural measures considered here, with improvements in vehicle efficiencies and a shift to plug-in hybrid and batteryelectric drive trains for light duty vehicles being the most important measures.

Through employment and firms' data the evolving structure of the Italian cultural economy is analysed, and diverging spatial and organizational patterns of cultural production systems in urban and regional areas are highlighted. Whilst large metropolitan areas remain the most important loci of the creative economy, craft-based sectors and creative systems of design have a tendency to locate in small and non-metropolitan centres. Based on the historical formation of manufacturing districts and the growing role of cultural production and consumption systems in urban spaces, the Italian creative economy provides an interesting case study to analyse the geographical patterns of cultural and creative industries. The previous literature on the geography of the creative and cultural economy is extended by offering through the Italian case new insights about idiosyncratic conditions in which cities and regions emerge as leading centres of cultural production and creativity.","[Bertacchini, Enrico E.] Univ Turin, Dept Econ S Cognetti de Martiis, I-10100 Turin, Italy; [Borrione, Paola] IRES Piemonte, I-10125 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Bertacchini, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ S Cognetti de Martiis, Via Po 53, I-10100 Turin, Italy.",enrico.bertacchini@unito.it; borrione@ires.piemonte.it,,"BERTACCHINI, Enrico Eraldo/0000-0003-4832-5798",,,,,48,48,55,2,103,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The paper draws on a seminar series on the 'Geographies of Energy Transition: security, climate, governance' hosted by the authors between 2009 and 2011, which initiated a dialogue between energy studies and the discipline of human geography. Focussing on the UK Government's policy for a low carbon transition, the paper provides a conceptual language with which to describe and assess the geographical implications of a transition towards low carbon energy. Six concepts are introduced and explained: location, landscape, territoriality, spatial differentiation, scaling, and spatial embeddedness. Examples illustrate how the geographies of a future low-carbon economy are not yet determined and that a range of divergent - and contending - potential geographical futures are in play. More attention to the spaces and places that transition to a low-carbon economy will produce can help better understand what living in a low-carbon economy will be like. It also provides a way to help evaluate the choices and pathways available. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant reduction of CO2 emissions could be achieved, although important changes in the gas turbines and gasifiers design and further technological development would be necessary. The aim of this work is to study quantitatively the benefits of using BioIGCC plants instead of fossil fuel technologies, in terms of power supply and CO2 emission avoidance, including the study of pre-combustion CO2 capture. Different biomass substrates are analysed and compared and the required land use in each case and for different scenarios is also studied and quantified. The power generation and greenhouse gas emission avoidance potential of BioIGCC technology in Europe is also studied and the viability of this technology in different circumstances is discussed. In several cases BioIGCC plants are found to be viable from the point of view of availability of biomass resources and the cost of the produced kWh. In the whole EU-27 the potential hovers around 30 GW and a reduction of nearly 4% of the total EU emissions in 2009 in a conservative. scenario, and up to 100 GW and 15% of emission reduction in a more optimistic one.

A tree structure overview of potential interventions classified into three categories is revealed. An integrated behaviour model is developed reflecting the relations between behaviour and influence factors. A latent class model is used to identify segments of local residents who differ regarding their preferences for interventions. Data are collected from a sample of residents in the Eindhoven region of the Netherlands in 2010. The results indicate that social-demographic characteristics, knowledge, motivation and context factors play important roles in energy-saving behaviour. Specifically, four segments of residents in the study area were identified that clearly differed in their preferences of interventions: cost driven residents, conscious residents, ease driven residents and environment minded residents. These findings emphasize that the intervention strategy should be focused on specific target groups to have the right mixture of interventions to achieve effective results on stimulating them to save energy.

(2) It provides a rigorous methodology to evaluate direct energy savings associated with design assistance market transformation programs. (3) It provides a low-cost replicable method to predict energy savings in new buildings by evaluating the integrated design process. (4) It provides quantitative indicators useful for estimating indirect energy savings from market transformation. Applying the recommended analysis method and assuming a 12-year measure life, the direct energy savings of the population (626 buildings; 51,262,000 ft(2)) is estimated as 453 aMW (average megawatts) (electric), and 265,738.089 therms (non-electric). If the entire program budget were divided into the electric savings only, the Lab Network cost per kWh saved ranged from $0.0016 to $0.003 using the recommended method and $0.0092/kWh using the most conservative method. These figures do not isolate contextual influences or represent total resource cost.

At the same time, EU Member States are bound by mandatory renewable energy targets which could prove to be costly to achieve in the current budgetary context and which often face strong local opposition. Directive 2009/28/EC on Renewable Energy makes it possible for Member States to achieve their targets by importing electricity produced from renewable energy sources from non-EU countries. So far, most attention has been on the Mediterranean Solar Plan or Desertec. An EU-Russia Renewable Energy Plan or RUSTEC - being based on onshore wind/biomass/hydro energy and on-land interconnection, rather than solar power and subsea lines - could present a cost-efficient and short-term complement to Desertec. This article examines the political, geopolitical, economic, social and legal challenges and opportunities of exporting green energy from Russia to the EU. It argues that EU-Russian cooperation in the renewable energy field would present a win-win situation: Member States could achieve their targets on the basis of Russia's renewable energy potential, while Russia could begin to develop a national renewable energy industry without risking potential price increases for domestic consumers-a concern of great political sensitivity in Russia.

This phenomenon is usually attributed to a variety of barriers which have been the focus of numerous studies over the last two decades. However, many studies treat EEMs homogenously and assume they have few inherent differences apart from their profitability. We argue that complementing such analyses by considering the characteristics of EEMs in a structured manner can enhance the understanding of EEM adoption. For this purpose, we suggest a classification scheme for EEMs in industry which aims to provide a better understanding of their adoption by industrial firms and to assist in selecting and designing energy-efficiency policies. The suggested classification scheme is derived from the literature on the adoption of EEMs and the related fields including the diffusion of innovations, eco-innovations and advanced manufacturing technology. Our proposed scheme includes 12 characteristics based on the relative advantage, the technical and the information context of the EEM. Applying this classification scheme to six example EEMs demonstrates that it can help to systematically explain why certain EEMs diffuse faster than others. Furthermore, it provides a basis for identifying policies able to increase the rate of adoption. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To explore the role of non-fossil energy in achieving these two targets, this paper first provides an overview of current status of non-fossil energy development in China; then gives a brief review of GDP and primary energy consumption; next assesses in detail the role of the non-fossil energy in 2020, including the installed capacity and electricity generation of non-fossil energy sources, the share and role of non-fossil energy in the electricity structure, emissions reduction resulting from the shift to non-fossil energy, and challenges for accomplishing the mitigation targets in 2020; finally, conclusions and policy measures for non-fossil energy development are proposed.

The past both shapes the current system and influences future options and pathways. Understanding the nature of energy transitions has become particularly important in light of the major changes that the world faces in the next century in the way that energy is sourced, converted and used. Policy-makers and decisiontakers need to understand the extent to which they can, or should, manage the transition. This paper proposes that a detailed study the patterns of change in a specific sector's past can improve our understanding of how it might evolve. A methodology is presented and applied to a case study of the prospective transition towards renewable raw material (RRM) use in the production of liquid fuels and organic chemicals in the UK. A process analysis of the historical transition to petroleum-based fuels and chemicals was used to shape a series of contemporary interviews that explored the perceptions and expectations of key actors in RRM and biorefining. The results show that the innovation system is already experiencing the socio-technical dynamics of regime disruption and competing designs. An empirical basis is offered for the the use of past transitions to inform scenarios for the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We apply the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy, augmented to include detail on the oil sands production processes, including the possibility of carbon capture and storage (CCS). We find: (1) without climate policy, annual Canadian bitumen production increases almost 4-fold from 2010 to 2050; (2) with climate policies implemented in developed countries, Canadian bitumen production drops by 32% to 68% from the reference 4-fold increase, depending on the viability of large-scale CCS implementation, and bitumen upgrading capacity moves to the developing countries; (3) with climate policies implemented worldwide, the Canadian bitumen production is significantly reduced even with CCS technology, which lowers CO2 emissions at an added cost. This is mainly because upgrading bitumen abroad is no longer economic with the global climate policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Reilly, John M.; Paltsev, Sergey; Chen, Y. -H.

However, little attention has been given to the innovation activities of the Chinese wind industry. In our paper, we aim to address this gap, based on second-hand sources and over 50 personal interviews with wind energy-related experts. We argue that China's wind industry has made great progress in terms of manufacturing and installing, but is confronted with various challenges and problems regarding the development of its indigenous innovation capabilities. Using innovation systems approaches as an analytical tool and focusing on institutions, actors, technology and their interaction in supporting innovation activities, we decompose the elements of China's wind energy innovation system and their role in developing the domestic wind industry. Against this backdrop we identify and discuss challenges and obstacles in the development of an innovation-driven wind industry in China. The paper strongly argues that more attention should be paid to improve the coordination and cooperation among the various actors of the wind energy innovation system, to the build-up of a market-oriented education and training system as well as to intellectual property protection.

Motivated by the need to understand future impacts of hydropower alternatives, this study conducted a multi-dimensional, empirical analysis of the full hydropower portfolio. The results show that the full portfolio spans multiple scales of capacity from mega (>1000 MW) to micro (<0.1 MW) projects with a skewed spatial distribution within the provinces, as well as among rivers and canals. Of the total feasible potential, 76% lies in two (out of six) administrative regions and 68% lies in two major rivers (out of more than 125 total channels). Once projects currently under implementation are commissioned, there would be a five-fold increase from a current installed capacity of 6720 MW to 36759 MW. It is recommended that the implementation and design decisions should carefully include spatial distribution and environmental considerations upfront. Furthermore, uncertainties in actual energy generation, and broader hydrological risks due to expected climate change effects should be included in. the current planning of these systems that are to provide service over several decades into the future.

It is based on the typical production process for clinker manufacturing and differentiates among four determining factors: cement output, clinker share, process structure and specific energy consumption per kiln type. The results show that the growth of cement output is the most important factor driving energy consumption up, while clinker share decline, structural shifts mainly drive energy consumption down (similar for CO2 emissions). These efficiency improvements result from a number of policies which are transforming the entire cement industry towards international best practice including shutting down many older plants and raising the efficiency standards of cement plants. Still, the efficiency gains cannot compensate for the huge increase in cement production resulting from economic growth particularly in the infrastructure and construction sectors. Finally, scenario analysis shows that applying best available technology wound result in an additional energy saving potential of 26% and a CO2 mitigation potential of 33% compared to 2009.

As a necessary first step, the authors bring off a concise and straightforward analysis of the different legal frameworks ruling solar PVS implementation in those countries. In the specific case of Spain we have identified some imprecision that could lead to misunderstandings about the role and impact of the PV legal framework on the massive expansion of the sector, especially during the so-called Spanish PV Boom.

In spite of the benefits of EVs, several obstacles need to be overcome before EVs will be widely adopted. A major barrier is that consumers tend to resist new technologies that are considered alien or unproved, thus, policy decisions that consider their critical concerns will have a higher level of success. This research identifies potential socio-technical barriers to consumer adoption of EVs and determines if sustainability issues influence consumer decision to purchase an EV. This study provides valuable insights into preferences and perceptions of technology enthusiasts; individuals highly connected to technology development and better equipped to sort out the many differences between EVs and CVs. This group of individuals will likely be early adopters of EVs only if they perceive them to be superior in performance compared to CVs. These results can guide policymakers in crafting energy and transportation policy. It can also provide guidance to EV engineers' decision in incorporating consumer preference into EV engineering design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We assess the potentials and trade-offs between benefits and costs of increasing levels of energy autarky for a small rural region of around 21,000 inhabitants in Austria. We use a novel modeling approach which couples a regional energy system model with a regional land use optimization model. We have collected and processed data on the spatial distribution of energy demand and potentials of biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal resources. The impacts of increasing biomass production on the agricultural sector are assessed with a land-use optimization model that allows deriving regional biomass supply curves. An energy system model is subsequently applied to find the least cost solution for supplying the region with energy resources. Model results indicate that fossil fuel use for heating can be replaced at low costs by increasing forestry and agricultural biomass production. However, autarky in the electricity and the heating sector would significantly increase biomass production and require a full use of the potentials of photovoltaics on roof tops. Attaining energy autarky implies high costs to consumers and a decline in the local production of food and feed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the review the paper proposes a three-dimensional model for archetyping residential energy consumers in the UK by considering property energy efficiency levels, the greenness of household behaviour of using energy, and the duration of property daytime occupancy. With the proposed model, eight archetypes of residential energy consumers in the UK have been identified. They are: pioneer greens, follower greens, concerned greens, home stayers, unconscientious wasters, regular wasters, daytime wasters, and disengaged wasters. Using a case study, these archetypes of residential energy consumers demonstrate the robustness of the 3-D model in aiding local energy policy/intervention design in the UK. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The results confirm that age, household income, education and environmental awareness play the most important role in explaining household attitudes to green electricity programmes. While the willingness to participate in green electricity programmes is influenced by education and environmental awareness, the willingness to pay for green electricity predominantly depends on household income. The results imply that green marketing should be accompanied by awareness-raising campaigns and should target younger, well-educated and high-income households. The expressed median willingness to pay is found to exceed the current level of mandatory charges for green electricity. Nevertheless, recent increases in final electricity prices might have already exhausted the capacity for additional voluntary contributions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis emphasizes competition between conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, including hybrids, and electric vehicles (EVs), represented by both plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles. We find that EV market penetration could double relative to our baseline case with policies to extend consumers' effective payback period to 7 years. EVs can also reduce per vehicle petroleum consumption by up to 5% with opportunities to increase that fraction at higher adoption rates. However, EVs have limited ability to reduce [DV greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the current energy source mix. Alone, EVs cannot drive compliance with the most aggressive GHG emission reduction targets, even if the electricity grid shifts towards natural gas powered sources. Since ICEs will dominate the LDV fleet for up to 40 years, conventional vehicle efficiency improvements have the greatest potential for reductions in LDV GHG emissions and petroleum consumption over this time. Specifically, achieving fleet average efficiencies of 72 mpg or greater can reduce average GHG emissions by 70% and average petroleum consumption by 81%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on desktop research and semi-structured interviews, this paper has two major findings. First, the development of smart grids in Korea has been shaped by various factors including macroeconomic policy, the role of the government, and experimentation. The complex interactions between these factors at the landscape, regime and niche levels has impacted on the development of smart grids. Second, while Korea's government-led approach has its strengths in driving change, it has also exposed weaknesses in the country's ability to mobilise the private sector and consumer participation. Major obstacles including partial electricity market reform and public distrust exist. A systemic perspective is needed for policy in order to accommodate the changes required for smart grid development. Regulatory reforms, particularly price-setting mechanisms, and consumer engagement are priority areas for policy change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Tests for unit roots, cointegration, and Granger-causality based on error correction model are employed on annual data covering the period 1975-2008. Empirical results of the study confirm the presence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between diesel consumption and economic growth. The error correction model shows that an estimated 1% increase in economic growth causes a rise in diesel consumption of 1.30% in the long-run. The overall results show that there exists bidirectional causality in the long-run relationship and no causality in the short-run relationship between diesel consumption and economic growth at the 5% level of significance. Thus, the energy policies in Cameroon should place priority on the discovery of new oil field and building capacity additions of the refinery to increase production of petroleum products, as this would propel the economic growth of the country.

In Germany regulatory instruments and subsidy programs, together with communicative instruments, represent the most important measures for motivating homeowners to pursue energy-efficient retrofitting to date, however, with little success; a tremendous potential for energy savings still exists particularly in the category of single-family houses. The present article primarily addresses the question of how to improve or supplement the political instruments in order to increase refurbishment rates and tap these potential savings; it presents the results of an analysis of existing policy instruments in Germany focussing on the most promising types of building and refurbishment measures that also takes into account the barriers responsible for the discrepancy between potential and actual refurbishment rates. It is shown that consideration of the specific peculiarities and situations homeowners face, coupled with an analysis of the energy saving potentials of their buildings, offers valuable insights and is critical for evaluating policy instruments and finding the mix of instruments that will purposefully encourage the most effective refurbishment measures. Drawing on these results, recommendations for the improvement of current policy instruments and implementation of new instruments are provided. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The study further evaluates four alternative but equally plausible hypotheses, each with different policy implications. These are: (i) Agricultural technology factors cause energy demand (the conventional view), (ii) energy demand causes technological factors, (iii) There is a bi-directional causality between the two variables and (iv) Both variables are causality independent. By applying techniques of Cointegration and Granger causality tests on energy demand (i.e., total primary energy consumption and electricity consumption) and agricultural technology factors (such as, tractors, fertilizers, cereals production, agriculture irrigated land, high technology exports, livestock; agriculture value added; industry value added and subsides) over a period of 1975-2010. The results infer that tractor and energy demand has bi-directional relationship; while irrigated agricultural land; share of agriculture and industry value added and subsides have supported the conventional view i.e., agricultural technology cause energy consumption in Pakistan. On the other hand, neither fertilizer consumption and high technology exports nor energy demand affect each others. Government should form a policy of incentive-based supports which might be a good policy for increasing the use of energy level in agriculture. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We document that revisions of the data typically represent news, and we introduce backcasting and nowcasting techniques to fill gaps in the real-time data. We show that real-time forecasts of the real price of oil can be more accurate than the no-change forecast at horizons up to 1 year. In some cases, real-time mean squared prediction error (MSPE) reductions may be as high as 25% 1 month ahead and 24% 3 months ahead. This result is in striking contrast to related results in the literature for asset prices. In particular, recursive vector autoregressive (VAR) forecasts based on global oil market variables tend to have lower MSPE at short horizons than forecasts based on oil futures prices, forecasts based on autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models, and the no-change forecast. In addition, these VAR models have consistently higher directional accuracy.","[Baumeister, Christiane] Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada; [Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Bank of Canada; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Baumeister, C (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",CBaumeister@bankofcanada.ca; lkilian@umich.edu,,,,,,,20,190,199,4,63,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Current explanations of this failure look to the nature of different fuels, various barriers in the market and political opposition by hard-path energy industries. Such factors provide only partial explanation. The explanation is incomplete because those factors cannot explain the larger subject of the evolution of fuel types during the past two hundred years. For that, we must add the role of the state, through ownership and regulation, in energy generation. That role has expanded regularly with the evolution of fuel types from coal to oil, electricity and nuclear power, but not with the introduction of new renewables in the 1970s. That pattern is explained by the inherent interest of the state in the use of energy for physical, military force and the fact that new renewables have not had immediate military applications. Although renewable energy is increasing, unless the state is motivated for military reasons to play a greater role, the soft-path vision will continue to languish. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The format of direct public support must be tailored to the characteristics of technologies addressed. Based on the experience accumulated with innovation programs, we have identified those features of innovation that should directly condition the choice of direct support instruments. These include the funding gap between the cost of innovation activities and the amount of private funds leveraged; the ability of technologies targeted to compete for public funds in the market; the probability that these technologies fail to reach the market; and the type of entity best suited to conduct these activities. Clean innovation features are matched to those of direct support instruments to provide recommendations on the use to be made of each type of instrument. Given the large financing gap of most clean energy innovation projects, public grants and contracts should finance a large part of clean pre-deployment innovation. However, public loans, equity investments, prizes and tax credits or rebates can successfully support certain innovation processes at a lower public cost.

But still in an emerging industry, renewable energy requires supportive energy policy helping firms to develop and protect competitive advantages in global competition. As a guideline for designing such policy, we consult well-informed stakeholders within the renewable energy industry: investors. Their preferences serve as explorative indicator for assessing which business models might succeed in competition. To contribute to only limited research on renewable energy investors' preferences, we ask, which business models investment managers for renewable energy prefer to invest in. We report from an explorative study of 380 choices of renewable energy investment managers. Based on the stated preferences, we modelled three generic business models to calculate the share of investors' preferences. We find exiting evidence: a customer intimacy business model that proposes best services is much more preferred by investors than business models that propose lowest price or best technology. Policy-makers can use those insights for designing policy that supports service-driven business models for renewable energy with a scope on customer needs rather than technology or price. Additionally, we state important implications for renewable energy entrepreneurs, managers and research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

K. Y. and CETIN I. B. Locational characteristics of dry ports in developing economies: some lessons from Northern India, Regional Studies. Contemporary economic development has triggered the importance of establishing distribution centres at appropriate locations in developing economies. However, so far, academic studies addressing this issue are rather scarce. Hence, by investigating dry ports within two industrial clusters in Northern India, this paper investigates the locational characteristics of distribution centres in developing economies. Analytical results indicate that the spatial dynamics of dry ports in developing economies are different from Western, advanced economies due to geographical diversifications, the different paces of regional development and local practices. This paper also suggests that dry ports in developing economies are more cluster (rather than supply chain) oriented.","[Ng, Adolf K.

The issues considered are: the measurement of steady states; the determination of exchange rates and the specification of the short-run country-specific models; the identification and estimation of the model subject to the theoretical constraints required for a determinate rational expectations solution; the solution of a large RE model; the structure and estimation of the covariance matrix and the simulation of shocks. The model used as an illustration shows that global demand and supply shocks are the most important drivers of output, inflation and interest rates in the long run. By contrast, monetary or exchange rate shocks have only a short-run impact in the evolution of the world economy. The article also shows the importance of international connections, directly as well as indirectly through spillover effects. Overall, ignoring global inter-connections as country-specific models do, could give rise to misleading conclusions.","[Dees, Stephane] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Pesaran, M.

Regional population divergence follows from in-migration to cities with high income levels. The dynamic relationship between population and income is investigated for Norwegian labour market regions using distribution analysis. Income convergence is shown to result from upward transitions in the income distribution by low- and middle-income regions, and the linkages between income growth and population growth are weak. The population-weighted income distribution diverges, since the expanding city-regions stay at the income top. People are moving to regions with the highest income levels, but these regions do not have the highest income growth.","[Rattso, Jorn; Stokke, Hildegunn E.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Rattso, J (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",jorn.rattso@svt.ntnu.no; hildegunnes@svt.ntnu.no,,"Stokke, Hildegunn E./0000-0003-4633-4172",,,,,25,5,5,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Brazil has emerged as a leading offshore producer with extensive proven reserves yet to be exploited. However, the BRSF has not been updated since 2007, and there are now major concerns about the industry's safety, particularly after the BP Deepwater Horizon accident, along with the technical challenges due to extreme conditions under which Brazil's resources are located. Drawing on experiences from three leading offshore oil and gas producers (Norway, the UK, and the US), we recommend the adoption of three best practices: the UK's 'safety case' approach (where operators are expected to provide convincing and valid arguments that a system is sufficiently safe for a given application in a specific environment), Norway's 'barrier management' (evidence that there are at least two tested and independent barriers to avoid accidents) and greater investment in safety research and development, as suggested by the US's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. We discuss implications for policy reform and how best practices can be applied within the Brazilian context. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Mendes, Pietro A.

One solution to this problem could be the use of solar energy to satisfy the current energy demand. However, solar energy technologies have shown limited success up to now. In the literature it is argued that solar cookers are often implemented as a solution looking for a problem, without consideration of the end-user needs. This study contributes to this debate by investigating the energy patterns and cooking profiles of public institutions for the design and implementation of solar cookers in the case of Mozambique. Interviews were conducted with 12 health institutions in Maputo and Sofala province in Mozambique. The paper concludes that solar cooking presents one solution to overcome the energy crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa but not the only solution. Solar cookers could improve the current cooking situation if combined with heat storage, back up, or a hybrid system that ensures reliability also during evening hours and rainy days. In general we could see that solar cookers should fulfill a variety of requirements related to cooking habits, schedule of daily routine and performance that are considered to enhance levels of use.

The business practices include the formulation of local content strategies that are implemented through programmes and initiatives aimed at developing and using host country suppliers and workforce. Such practices and the narratives used to communicate them implicitly reflect the context in which the effectiveness of local content policies on economic development can be assessed. By comparing and contrasting the narratives across the five IOCs in relation to the wider literature, four emergent narrative strategies justifying the business practices of IOCs are identified and discussed. They include: (1) direct engagement to renegotiate local content requirements with governments, (2) legal compliance framework, (3) the business case for local content strategies, and (4) corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. The conclusion considers the policy implications of these findings for local content development in petroleum-producing developing countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The structure of power generation development is to be optimised to properly balance coal transportation and power transmission. The controversy over the direction of grid transmission and distribution is also to be reconciled. The Plan puts forward specific requirements for energy conservation, developing clean energy, optimising the production of coal-fired electricity, rationalising the allocation of peak power, developing distributed energy and constructing a strong smart grid. It also strongly advocates renewable and other forms of clean energy resources. Considering all the above goals and requirements, it is necessary for China to adjust its blueprint for electricity market development by fine-tuning the original market-oriented reform momentum.

We show that the network and proximity characteristics of co-inventors enable them to access different sources of knowledge, in different geographical and organizational contexts, and finally affect the quality of inventive collaboration. Based on econometric estimations, our results enable to address the proximity paradox argument that proximity acts differently on the formation of collaborations and innovative performance. Our results partly support this paradox. Although all types of proximity positively impact on the formation of new collaborations, only organizational and technological proximities directly impact performance. Moreover, the optimal level of technological proximity critically varies given the organizational and social network context.","[Cassi, Lorenzo] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Cassi, Lorenzo] Univ Paris 01, OST, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Plunket, Anne] Univ Lorraine, BETA, UMR 7522, Nancy, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Lorraine,"Plunket, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, BETA, UMR 7522, Nancy, France.",lorenzo.cassi@univ-paris1.fr; anne.plunket@univ-lorraine.fr,"Cassi, Lorenzo/H-1185-2013","Plunket, Anne/0000-0001-8400-4292; cassi, lorenzo/0000-0003-3871-6680",,,,,45,63,74,7,99,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

More specifically, the parameters that a regulator might use to achieve distributive efficiency under price-cap regulation have not yet been identified. To discern these parameters is the motivation for the research presented in this paper. We study how different weight parameters affect the distributive characteristics of optimal price-cap incentive regulation for electricity transmission.

The model focuses on the energy supply sector with endogenous representation of road transport energy demand. Equilibrium interactions are performed across electricity, hydrogen, biofuels, and road transport sectors. Possible transition paths toward a low-carbon transport in Iceland are explored with implications for fuel demand, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and associated costs. The consumer sector simulates the long-term evolution of light and heavy-duty vehicles through a vehicle choice algorithm that accounts for social influences and consumer preferences. Through different scenarios, the influences of four fundamental driving factors are examined. The factors are oil price, carbon tax, fuel supply-push, and government incentives. The results show that changes in travel demand, vehicle technologies, fuel types, and efficiency improvements Can support feasible transition paths to achieve sufficient reduction in GHG for both 4 C and 2 C climate scenarios of the Nordic Energy Technology Perspectives study. Initial investment in supply infrastructure for alternative fuels will not only mitigate GHG emissions, but also could provide long-term economic benefits through fuel cost saving for consumers and reduced fuel import costs for government.

During the period from 2010 to 2020, we find that current renewable electricity targets result in significant additional renewable energy installation and a reduction in cumulative CO2 emissions of 1.8% relative to a No Policy baseline. After 2020, the role of renewables is sensitive to both economic growth and technology cost assumptions. Importantly, we find that the CO2 emissions reductions due to increased renewables are offset in each year by emissions increases in non-covered sectors through 2050. We consider sensitivity to renewable electricity cost after 2020 and find that if cost falls due to policy or other reasons, renewable electricity share increases and results in slightly higher economic growth through 2050. However, regardless of the cost assumption, projected CO2 emissions reductions are very modest under a policy that only targets the supply side in the electricity sector. A policy approach that covers all sectors and allows flexibility to reduce CO2 at lowest cost - such as an emissions trading system - will prevent this emissions leakage and ensure targeted reductions in CO2 emissions are achieved over the long term.

The revised nuclear energy policy considers searching for possible alternative locations for future nuclear power plants in Turkey. At the most basic level, the public cannot accurately evaluate whether it is willing to support nuclear energy unless it has an idea about where the power plants are likely to be located. It is argued that the selection of a facility location is a multi-criteria decision-making problem including both quantitative and qualitative criteria. In this research, given the multi-criteria nature of the nuclear facility location selection problem, a new decision tool is proposed to rank the alternative nuclear power plant sites in Turkey.

We compare our results with those obtained by the International Energy Agency (based on the World Energy Model) and by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD-Model ENV-Linkages), providing the long-term perspective of an intertemporal optimization model. The results are analyzed in the two dimensions of subsidy phase-out and climate policy scenarios. We confirm short-term benefits of phasing-out fossil fuel subsidies as found in prior studies. However, these benefits are only sustained to a small extent in the long term, if dedicated climate policies are weak or nonexistent. Most remarkably we find that a removal of fossil fuel subsidies, if not complemented by other policies, can slow down a global transition towards a renewable based energy system. The reason is that world market prices for fossil fuels may drop due to a removal of subsidies. Thus, low carbon alternatives would encounter comparative disadvantages. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Conditional on the strength of the hurricane, within 6 months after a hurricane strikes a county, revenues decline as much as 17 %, whereas revenues in neighboring counties increase by upward of 17 % over that same time frame. This decline in revenue is found to be dependent on the commercial makeup of a hurricane-stricken county. Particular focus is given to tourism-related subsectors within the local economy. Finally, we show that along the pathways of hurricanes, initially hit counties face a more severe burden, ranging as high as a 33 % immediate decline in taxable revenues in 1 month for coastal counties. As the hurricane weakens, the direct impact is lessened; however, there is evidence of spillover damage in neighboring areas.","[Belasen, Ariel R.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; [Dai, Chifeng] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Belasen, AR (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",abelase@siue.edu; daic@siu.edu,,,,,,,20,6,11,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The method decomposes total carbon emissions into an interaction result of four components (i.e., emissions from primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, and from residential areas) which composed totally by 13 macro influential factors according to the KAYA identity. Then, 30 provinces in China are clustered into four classes according to the influential factors via the PSO-FCM clustering method. The key factors that determine emission growth in the provinces representing each cluster are investigated by applying Shapley value decomposition. Finally, based on guaranteed survival emissions, the reduction burden is allocated by controlling the key factors that decelerate CO2 emission growth rate according to the present economic development level, energy endowments, living standards, and the emission intensity of each province. A case study of the allocation of CO2 intensity reduction targets in China by 2020 is then conducted via the proposed method. The per capita added value of the secondary industry is the primary factor for the increasing carbon emissions in provinces. Therefore, China should limit the growth rate of its secondary industry to mitigate emission growth. Provinces with high cardinality of emissions have to shoulder the largest reduction, whereas provinces with low emission intensity met the minimum requirements for emission in 2010. Fifteen provinces are expected to exceed the national average decrease rates from 2011 to 2020. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To begin with, there is little research that categorizes the typologies of regulatory capture despite the ubiquity of the phenomenon. After a discussion of theoretical approaches to regulatory capture, I describe the operative definition and theory appropriate to the situation related to authorization of oil and natural gas production in Israel following the discovery of large offshore reserves in 2010. This approach, embodying several facets of existing typologies, is applied to decisions made authorizing construction of the Gabriella offshore exploratory drilling platform. The analysis highlights the nature of capture in the absence of clear agency jurisdiction over new activities located in offshore environs organized as temporal and spatial vacuums. I conclude that comprehensive marine spatial planning would result in less capture and the development of more capture-resistant regulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

One reason for this evolution is just a higher level of health care. Another equally important reason may be more interest in a healthy lifestyle and also a better environment. Given to this evolution, it is more and more important to have the best imagination about how long in average will live not only the youngest persons, but the oldest ones too. From the obtained results it is evident that the level of mortality of younger persons is different in comparison with the oldest ones. Therefore, it is necessary to correct the estimates of mortality at the highest ages. For this correction are used the various types of models.

The purpose of this analysis is to determine how many of the companies listed on the BSE are incorporated in tax havens by their shareholders, subsidiaries or related parties and which are the targeted jurisdictions. In order to reach this target, we analysed annual financial reports of the companies listed on the BSE. The results show that over 42% of these companies are rooted in tax havens.","[Georgescu, Iuliana Eugenia] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania; [Afrasinei, Mihai-Bogdan; Hutanu (Cas Toma), Loredana Oana] Alexandra Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Doctoral Sch Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Georgescu, IE (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania.",iuliag@uaic.ro; bogdan.afrasinei@yahoo.com; loredanaoana.toma@yahoo.com,"Afrasinei, Mihai-Bogdan/HZM-4989-2023",,,,,,17,0,0,0,17,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,1408,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100146,0

The model is estimated on data of the Czech economy covering period 1996: Q2 - 2013:Q4. The behaviour of the model is studied using impulse responses and simulations in reaction to model specific shocks. Situation when central bank is incapable to decrease interest rate because of zero lower bound has implications for behaviour of output and consumption but not inflation. Shocks that cause binding of interest rate for most periods are domestic cost-push shock and foreign preference shock. These two shocks also have non-negligible welfare implications regarding behaviour of consumption. In reaction to three standard deviations of innovations, the drop of consumption was larger by 0.9 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively, when the interest rate hit the zero lower bound.","Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hlousek, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",hlousek@econ.muni.cz,"Hlousek, Miroslav/G-8508-2013",,,,,,5,1,1,0,1,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,293,298,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900051,0

This leads to the use of models that have already been developed, for which their authors have declared a high degree of prediction accuracy. The subject of the research presented in this paper is the testing of the accuracy of such models in a period or environment other than that for which they were designed. The ability of these models to differentiate between companies threatened by bankruptcy and prospering companies and their identification error, i.e, indicating companies that go into bankruptcy as prospering companies and vice versa, were tested. Testing was performed on data on companies in the manufacturing industry operating in the Czech Republic in the years 1999-2013 with the use of three models. The first of the models used is the Altman model, which originated in a different environment and in a different period of time to the tested companies. The second model tested was the Neumaier model, which originated in a similar environment, though at a different time. The last of the models tested is a model developed by the authors of this paper, which originated on the basis of data from the same field, though in a different period. The use of these models over a long time period also enabled testing of the predication capability of the individual models in advance, i.e. one to nine years before bankruptcy. The results of this research clearly demonstrate that the accuracy of such models falls markedly when used in a different environment and different time period. The best results were obtained by the use of a model created with data on the same field, though in a different period of time.","[Karas, Michal; Reznakova, Maria] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,karas@fbm.vutbr.cz; reznakova@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Reznakova, Maria/AAQ-6282-2020; Karas, Michal/HDN-2653-2022; Karas, Michal/C-1261-2018","Reznakova, Maria/0000-0002-7261-607X; Karas, Michal/0000-0001-8824-1594; Karas, Michal/0000-0001-8824-1594",,,,,20,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,988,997,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100103,0

Expanded uranium reserves will be needed to meet this increased demand, highlighting the importance of future exploratory efforts. To shed light on the social desirability of future exploration levels I analyze a past expansionary period in the U.S. uranium industry. I find exploration levels were smaller than socially efficient during this period, resulting from a deviation between the private and social values of information. Looking forward, public policies can encourage optimal exploration levels by addressing this deviation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Especially the increase of the average weather temperature around the world gives rise to the grapes grown into high sugar content and low acidity. The wines produced from these grapes have consequently high alcohol content. High alcohol levels can negatively influence wine aroma balance in conjunction with the consumer acceptance. Furthermore excessive alcohol in wine may increase costs in countries where taxes are levied according to alcohol concentration. Several techniques have been developed for the reduction of ethanol content in wines with excessive alcohol content. The techniques at issue are applied on different stages of wine making process. Implementation of different viticulture techniques including reducing leaf area, monitoring maturity and aroma profiles or winemaking practices like utilisation of enzymes, different yeast strains and post fermentation practices such as distillation, blending and membrane based systems applications form a basis for the adjustment of elevated alcohol levels in wine. The aim of this review is to provide technical and practical information covering the outstanding techniques that may be used to adjust elevated alcohol concentration in wine and their effects on wine from the point of organoleptic characteristics view.","[Ozturk, Burcu] Namik Kemal Univ, Sarkoy Vocat Sch, Wine Prod Technol Programme, TR-59800 Sarkoy Tekirdag, Turkey; [Anli, Ertan] Ankara Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Food Engn, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Namik Kemal University; Ankara University,"Ozturk, B (通讯作者)，Namik Kemal Univ, Sarkoy Vocat Sch, Wine Prod Technol Programme, TR-59800 Sarkoy Tekirdag, Turkey.",bozturk@nku.edu.tr; anli@eng.ankara.edu.tr,"ANLI, ERTAN/AAJ-3169-2020; ÖZTÜRK, Burcu/ABA-4521-2020; , ertan/HMU-9847-2023","ÖZTÜRK, Burcu/0000-0003-0123-2236;",,,,,46,24,25,2,37,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2014,3.0,,1.0,,,,,,,10.1051/bioconf/20140302012,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BB8BQ,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346256100027,0

As part of a larger project developing an automated robotic pruner, we have used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to create an expert system for selecting new canes and cutting off unwanted canes. A domain and ontology has been created for AI, which reflects the expertise of expert human pruners. The first step in the creation of an expert system was to generate virtual vines, which were then 'pruned' by human pruners and also by the expert system in its infancy. Here we examined the decisions of 12 human pruners, for consistency of decision, on 60 virtual vines. 96.7% of the 12 pruners agreed on at least one cane choice after which there was diminishing agreement on which further canes to select for laying. Our results indicate that techniques developed in computational intelligence can be used to co-ordinate and synthesise the expertise of human pruners into a best practice format. This paper describes first steps in this knowledge elicitation process, and discusses the fit between cane pruning expertise and the expertise that can be elicited using AI based expert system techniques.","[Saxton, Valerie] Lincoln Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Botterill, Tom; Green, Richard] Univ Canterbury, Fac Engn, Christchurch, New Zealand",Lincoln University - New Zealand; University of Canterbury,"Saxton, V (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Lincoln, New Zealand.",valerie.saxton@lincoln.ac.nz,,"Botterill, Tom/0000-0002-2305-2650",,,,,24,3,3,0,5,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2014,3.0,,1.0,,,,,,,10.1051/bioconf/20140301016,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BB8BQ,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346256100016,0

For example, CCTV brand kings Qinchi and Aiduo invested a huge amount of money in advertising to establish their own brand images, but finally suffered a complete loss, so that many enterprises often stepped back in front of huge advertising costs. Then, enterprise news planning means emerge, and such means can be used to establish enterprise brand images, have advantages compared with advertising in terms of communication, and have been gradually getting increasingly more concern and attention of enterprises currently.","[Zhang, Yong] Sichuan Univ Sci & Engn, Sch Econ & Management, Zigong 643000, Peoples R China",Sichuan University of Science & Engineering,,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-62520-34-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2014,13.0,,,,,,110,113,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC0SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349486900025,0

This paper explores reasons for the overinvestment. The economic analysis shows that, given uncertain future policy on wind power, it is optimal for power companies to invest more than the amount in a certain world. A part of the overinvestment has a real value, which can be interpreted as the value of holding scarce wind resource. This value exists because the wind-rich sites with convenient locations to connect to the grids are scarce resource, and also because the specific government policies that are essential for promoting wind power are uncertain in the future. This value should be taken into account in the investment decision, but it results in the phenomenon of overinvestment. The concept of the value of holding scarce resource can be generally applied to the resources that are scarce and for which the future policy is uncertain. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to evaluate the costs and GHG emissions of implementing CCS at a coal-fired integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant, at a coal fired ultra-supercritical (USC) power plant, at a synthetic fuel coal-to-liquid (CTL) plant and at a gas-to-liquid (GTL) plant for SA. The approach for comparing of these CCS applications is based on a combination of a techno-economic analysis with a life-cycle assessment. As expected, the generating costs in plants with CCS are higher than without CCS for all case studies. GHG-abatement costs in 2040 are shown to be the lowest for the IGCC power plant at 173 ZAR(07)/t CO2eq, followed by the USC power plant at 227 ZAR(07)/t CO2eq. These costs are considerably higher for the CTL and GTL plants. The results show that from an economic perspective, CCS might be an attractive option for CO2 mitigation in SA especially for the electricity sector. However, a prerequisite for the implementation of CCS is that the technology reaches commercial scale for the investigated options and is socially accepted. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The first article of this study reviews the empirical studies examining various factors, other than income, that may lead to an EKC-pattern. The current article reviews in the first part the major critiques on the EKC-speculation which relate to the following issues: the normal distribution of world income, the feedback from environmental degradation to economic growth, the characteristics of the pollutant in question, various econometric issues, the evolution of consumption when income rises and the assumption about a common developmental pattern in all countries. The second part discusses additional matters reported indirectly in the literature and/or must be further examined. There are doubts whether the GDP-series captures the transition of production to the three productive sectors in empirical estimations and whether services are less polluting compared to industry activities. Finally, the original Kuznets-theory, which laid the groundwork for the EKC-concept, does not seem to solve income inequality problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed model optimizes the power generation mix by striking a trade-off between the expected cost of power generation and its variability. We use Monte Carlo simulation techniques to consider the uncertainty associated with future electricity demand, fuel prices and their correlations, and the capital costs of power plants. Unlike in the case of conventional power generation mix models, we employ CVaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk) in designing variability to consider events that are rare but enormously expensive. A comprehensive analysis on South Korea's generation policy using the portfolio model shows that a large annual cost is additionally charged to substitute a portion of nuclear energy with other alternatives. Nonetheless, if Korea has to reduce its dependency on nuclear energy because of under-mined social receptivity from the Fukushima disaster, it turns out that LNG or coal could be a secure candidate from an economic perspective.

This study investigated selected turbine capacities to optimize electricity production, based on actual wind profiles for three sites in Nova Scotia, Canada (i.e., Sydney, Caribou Point, and Greenwood). The turbine capacities evaluated are also eligible under the current COMFIT-large scheme in Nova Scotia, including 100 kW, 900 kW and 2.0 MW turbines. A capital budgeting model was developed and then used to evaluate investment decisions on wind power production. Wind duration curves suggest that Caribou Point had the highest average wind speeds but for shorter durations. By comparison, Sydney and Greenwood had lower average wind speeds but with longer durations. Electricity production cost was lowest for the 2.0 MW turbine in Caribou Point ($0.07 per kWh), and highest for the 100 kW turbine located in Greenwood ($0.49 per kWh). The most financially viable wind power project was the 2.0 MW turbine assumed to operate at 80 m hub height in Caribou Point, with NPV=$251,586, and BCR=1.51. Wind power production for the remaining two sites was generally not financially feasible for the turbine capacities considered. The impact of promoting local economic development from wind power projects was higher in a scenario under which wind turbines were clustered at a single site with the highest wind resources than generating a similar level of electricity by distributing the wind turbines across multiple locations.

We utilise the methodology from Simshauser and Nelson (2012) to examine whether capital market efficiency losses would occur under certain policy scenarios. The results show that electricity costs would increase by between $51 million and $119 million if the large-scale RET is abandoned even after accounting for avoided renewable costs.

For this purpose we used cointegration techniques and the vector error correction model in order to capture short-run and long-run dynamics over the sample period 1970-2011. The empirical results reveal that in the long-run electricity demand appears to be price inelastic and income elastic, while in the short-run the relevant elasticities are below unity. We also argue that the causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth in Greece is bi-directional. Our results strengthen the notion that Greece is an energy dependent country and well directed energy conservation policies could even boost economic growth. Furthermore, the implementation of renewable energy sources should provide significant benefits ensuring sufficient security of supply in the Greek energy system. This evidence can provide a new basis for discussion on the appropriate design and implementation of environmental and energy policies for Greece and other medium sized economies with similar characteristics.

Primarily it looks at the ways in which specific aspects of energy insecurity impact the stability of the Indian state. The paper contends that energy insecurity in the form of fuel supply and electricity supply insecurities gives rise to social and political instability, which in extreme forms could lead to state destabilisation. A combination of inadequate and unreasonably priced fuel supply gives rise to instability in the social and political spheres; if the fuel supply is also unreliable, it could lead to chronic socio-political instability. Likewise, a combination of inadequate and unreliable electricity supply could, in certain instances, cause limited social instability; if this is also accompanied by an electricity price hike, it could lead to chronic sociopolitical instability. Chronic socio-political instability in an already weakened state could facilitate state destabilisation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Perrons, RK; Richards, MG",,,,"Perrons, Robert K.; Richards, Matthew G.",,,Applying maintenance strategies from the space and satellite sector to the upstream oil and gas industry: A research agenda,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Oil and gas; Maintenance; Space,,"Practitioners from both the upstream oil and gas industry and the space and satellite sector have repeatedly noted several striking similarities between the two industries over the years, which have in turn resulted in many direct comparisons in the media and industry press. The two sectors have previously worked together and shared ideas in ways that have yielded some important breakthroughs, but relatively little sharing or cross-pollination has occurred in the area of asset maintenance. This is somewhat surprising in light of the fact that here, too, the sectors have much in common. This paper accordingly puts forward the viewpoint that the upstream oil and gas industry could potentially make significant improvements in asset maintenance-specifically, with regard to offshore platforms and remote pipelines-by selectively applying some aspects of the maintenance strategies and philosophies that have been learned in the space and satellite sector. The paper then offers a research agenda toward accelerating the rate of learning and sharing between the two industries in this domain, and concludes with policy recommendations that could facilitate this kind of cross-industry learning.

The article shows that scaling up rural energy access demands careful tuning of support to the business models of rural entrepreneurs, in which development finance has only a limited role to play. The article argues for market development approaches that take a programmatic approach, change their intervention model as the market matures, and build on smart use of the limited sector capacity. The ultimate challenge is how to down-tune ambitions and spending power of the development community to match the absorption capacity of rural markets and the reality of entrepreneurs on the ground.

This paper focusses on the technical feasibility (electricity generation and transmission) and CO2-impact of the German nuclear phase-out on the short term (2012-2022). A detailed electricity generation simulation model is employed, including the German transmission grid and its international connections. A range of different conventional and renewable energy sources (RES) scenarios is considered. Results are presented for the change in generation mix, on the flows on the transmission network and on operational reliability issues. The scenario analysis shows that nuclear generation will be replaced mainly by coal- and lignite-based generation. This increases the CO2-intensity of the German electricity sector. Furthermore, the results indicate that the German electricity export will decrease and under certain circumstances, the system becomes infeasible. Keeping some nuclear power plants online, would mitigate these effects. The amount of electricity generated from RES is shown to be the main driver for grid congestion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The cointegration method is applied to estimate electricity intensity of Chinese nonferrous metals industry, in an effort to predict future electricity saving potential. The results show that there is a long-run equilibrium between electricity intensity and factors such as R&D intensity, industrial electricity price, enterprise scale, and labor productivity. By means of scenario analysis, we evaluate different possible measures that might be adopted to narrow down the electricity efficiency gap between nonferrous metals industry in China and that of Japan. The results. indicate that more active electricity conservation policies are needed in order to reduce the electricity intensity of Chinese nonferrous metals industry. We also find that the electricity efficiency gap could be significantly narrowed by 2020 if proper electricity conservation policy is adopted. Finally, based on the results of the scenario analysis, future policy priorities are suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The sudden reform of energy prices in Iran is expected to have a great impact on production and energy consumption in this industry. In this paper, we present a system dynamics model to analyze energy consumption and CO2 emission in Iranian cement industry under various production and export scenarios. We consider new energy prices to estimate possible energy demand by this industry over next 20 years. The model includes demand for cement, production, energy consumption and CO2 emission in an integrated framework with emphasis on direct natural gas consumption. Producing blended cement, production using waste materials as alternative fuel, and wasted heat recovery for electricity generation in cement industry are three main corrective policies simulated and discussed herein. Simulation result show that complete removal of energy subsidy and implementation of corrective policies in the cement industry could potentially lead to reductions of 29% and 21%, respectively in natural gas and electricity consumptions and 22% reduction in CO2 emission.

Hydroelectric reservoirs are anthropogenic aquatic systems that occur across a wide geographical extent, and, in addition to their importance for energy production, they have the potential to release two important greenhouse gases (GHGs), carbon dioxide and methane. We report results from an extensive study of eight hydroelectric reservoirs located in central and southeastern tropical Brazil. In the Brazilian dry tropical biome reservoirs, emissions (in tons of CO2 Eq. per MW h) varied from 0.01 to 0.55, and decreased with reservoir age. Total emissions were higher in the reservoir lake when compared to the river downstream the dam; however, emissions per unit area, in the first kilometer of the river after the dam, were higher than that in the reservoir. The results showed, despite higher carbon emissions per energy production in the youngest reservoirs, lower emission from hydroelectric reservoirs from the studied region in relation to thermo electrical supply, fueled by coal or fossil fuel. The ratio emission of GHG per MWh produced is an important parameter in evaluating the service provided by hydroelectric reservoir and for energy planning policies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This research analyzes changing investment environment for renewable energy with real options approach, and explores its potential in developing economies through studying the case of Mongolia under coal price uncertainty. To evaluate comparative attractiveness of either continuing to use coal-based infrastructures or switching to renewable energy, we formulate social revenue functions for the two environments, assuming that renewable energy has lower external costs, and coal prices follow geometric Brownian motion (GBM) or geometric mean-reverting (GMR) processes. We find the optimal trigger coal prices for switching technologies with some scenarios in electricity price and externality; characterize when renewable energy investments become attractive. In contrast to conventional wisdom, we identify some situations where the value of having more decision opportunities does not exceed that of a now-or-never decision for switching technologies, and welfare losses are incurred. The optimal trigger prices are higher in GBM than in GMR, and our result raises the possible risks for waiting to switch energy. To avoid welfare losses in Mongolia, the government should increase electricity prices or switch to renewable energy earlier, especially when people pay more for the removal of externalities.

Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, on the other hand, are suitable for the analysis of policy interventions from a methodical point of view. In this article, we provide a Bayesian method to combine the statistically rich specification of the former with the conceptual advantages of the latter by using information from a DSGE model to form a prior belief about parameters in the dynamic factor model. Because the method establishes a connection between observed data and economic theory and at the same time incorporates information from a large dataset, our setting is useful to study the effects of policy interventions on a large number of observed variables. An application of the method to U. S. data shows that a moderate weight of the DSGE prior is optimal and that the model performs well in terms of forecasting. We then analyze the impact of monetary shocks on both the factors and selected series using a DSGE-based identification of these shocks.

The primary objective is to investigate and analyze the causal relationship between electricity consumption (EC), Brent oil price (BOP) and economic growth (GDP) for Algeria Over the period of 1971-2010. To examine short-run, long-run and joint causality relationships we used a multivariate cointegration approach based on the recent advances in time series econometrics (e.g., Zivot-Andrews test; Gregory-Hansen cointegration test; Vector Error Correction Models (VECM)). The empirical results show that there is evidence of short-run and a strong long-run bi-directional causal relationship between EC and real GDP in Algeria. Findings indicate also the absence of causal relationship between BOP and EC. Our empirical findings support the idea that there a link between electricity consumption and economic growth and disproves the neo-classical assumption referred to as the neutrality hypothesis.

Research in energy policy is complex and often involves inter-disciplinary work, which traditional economic methodologies fail to capture. Consequently, the more encompassing methodology of contrast explanation is assessed and its use in other social science disciplines explored in brief. It is then applied to an energy policy research topic in this case, nuclear energy policy research in the UK. Contrast explanation facilitates research into policy and decision-making processes in energy studies and offers an alternative to the traditional economic methods used in energy research. Further, contrast explanation is extended by the addition of contested and uncontested hypotheses analyses. This research focuses on the methods employed to deliver the new nuclear programme of the UK government. In order to achieve a sustainable nuclear energy policy three issues are of major importance: (1) law, policy and development; (2) public administration; and (3) project management. Further, the research identifies that policy in the area remains to be resolved, in particular at an institutional and legal level. However, contrary to the literature, in some areas, the research identifies a change of course as the UK concentrates on delivering a long-term policy for the nuclear energy sector and the overall energy sector.

This paper addresses gaps in the research of clusters and place brands by proposing the analysis of clusters as place brands and arguing for the adoption of stakeholder management approaches for such a purpose. Analysis should also recognize the role of diverse stakeholders with potentially incompatible interests in cluster branding initiatives and the associated, processual issues of power application, discord and disagreement in clusters. By addressing these issues, two areas of academic enquiry, clusters and place branding, that share common object and aims of enquiry but which rarely recognize one another can be integrated. The call for a combined look at the two areas is driven by a belief in their complementarities and common inadequacies, and it provides an integrative platform, a dialogical platform as a theoretically enriched basis upon which to open up future research avenues.","[Kasabov, Edward] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Kasabov, Edward] ESRC EPSRC AIM Adv Inst Management Res, London WC1B 5DN, England; [Sundaram, Usha] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England",University of Bath; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Exeter,"Kasabov, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",E.Kasabov@bath.ac.uk; us211@exeter.ac.uk,"Kasabov, Edward/AAJ-8099-2021",,,,,,137,14,16,2,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The VAR coefficients and error covariances may change gradually in every period or be subject to abrupt breaks. The model is applied to 143 post-World War II quarterly variables fully describing the US economy. I show that both endogenous and exogenous shocks to the US economy resulted in the high inflation volatility during the 1970s and early 1980s. The time-varying factor augmented VAR produces impulse responses of inflation which significantly reduce the price puzzle. Impulse responses of other indicators of the economy show that the most notable changes in the transmission of unanticipated monetary policy shocks occurred for gross domestic product, investment, exchange rates and money.","Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Korobilis, D (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, 34 Voie Roman Pays, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",dimitrios.korompilis@uclouvain.be,"Korobilis, Dimitris/P-4532-2015","Korobilis, Dimitris/0000-0001-9146-3008",,,,,40,60,74,3,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

To achieve this target, a number of initiatives and measures have been in force. Europe, is currently the largest market for PV systems with more than 75% of the annual worldwide installations in 2011. The favourable European policies as well as the Member States' supporting legislations have resulted in high market growth for photovoltaics. Applying PV technologies however, requires high qualified technicians to install, repair and maintain them. Until today, national markets have been growing faster than the skilled PV installers force can satisfy. The PVTRIN, an Intelligent Energy Europe action, addresses these issues by developing a training and certification scheme for technicians active in the installation and maintenance of small scale PV systems. During the implementation of the action, a market research was conducted in the six participating countries in order to record the stakeholders' attitudes, perceptions and considerations and to adapt the training methods, tools and materials to the national PV industry requirements and markets' needs. Indicative results of this analysis as well as the current situation regarding relevant training and certification schemes are presented in this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper addresses a paradox in the literature on federal and decentralized states: citizens want their regional governments to do more and yet seem reluctant to embrace the logical consequences of regional control, namely inter-regional policy variation and limited state-wide intervention in policy provision. Based on a survey conducted in fourteen regions across Austria, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the extent of this devolution paradox is clarified and variables that seem to mitigate or exacerbate its presence, including strength of regional identity, regional institutional authority and regional economic wealth, are identified. The analysis helps one to understand where and how multilevel citizenship operates.","[Henderson, Ailsa; Jeffery, Charlie] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wincott, Daniel] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Law Sch, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; [Jones, Richard Wyn] Cardiff Univ, Wales Governance Ctr, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales",University of Edinburgh; Cardiff University; Cardiff University,"Henderson, A (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Chrystal Macmillan Bldg,15A George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland.",Ailsa.Henderson@ed.ac.uk; Charlie.Jeffery@ed.ac.uk; WincottD@cf.ac.uk; WynJonesR@caerdydd.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L002442/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L002442/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,33,26,28,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Since this price enters the investment decision process of regulated firms, this uncertainty increases the cost of capital for investors and might deter investments into new technologies at the company level. We apply a real options-based approach to assess the impact of climate change policy in the form of a constant or growing price floor on investment decisions of a single firm in a competitive environment. This firm has the opportunity to switch from a high-carbon dirty technology to a low-carbon clean technology. Using Monte Carlo simulation and dynamic programming techniques for real data, we determine the optimal CO2 price floor level and growth rate in order to induce investments into the low-carbon technology. We find that a carbon price floor can be used to induce earlier low-carbon technology investment and show this result to be robust to a large variety of input parameter settings.

It investigates whether school districts engage in strategic interaction when making the participation decision. The motivation for testing the strategic interaction hypothesis is to determine whether the driving force behind the participation decision of a district is the competition from neighboring districts, with a potential threat of taking away students and funding. The discrete choice participation decision is modeled using a Bayesian spatial probit model. The results suggest that a given district's probability of participation is positively affected by the participation decisions of its neighbors and this provides strong evidence of horizontal interaction in school choice policies.","Albright Coll, Dept Econ & Business, Reading, PA 19612 USA",,"Ghosh, S (通讯作者)，Albright Coll, Dept Econ & Business, 13th & Bern St, Reading, PA 19612 USA.",sghosh@alb.edu,"Ghosh, Soma/IWM-2427-2023",,,,,,15,3,3,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Devising a strategy for securing gas supply is not straightforward because gas supply depends on complex interactions of production, demand and infrastructure, and it is exposed to economic, regulatory, political, environmental and technical risks. To address this complexity, we propose a simulation approach that replicates the structure of the gas supply chain, including transportation constraints and demand fluctuations. We build and calibrate a computer model for the Colombian gas sector, and run the model to assess the impact of expanding transportation capacity and increasing market flexibility on the security of supply. Our analysis focuses on the operation and planned and proposed expansions of the transportation infrastructure because adequate regulation and development of this infrastructure can contribute to increase the security of supply in the gas sector. We find that proposed import facilities, specifically LNG import terminals at Buenaventura, increase system's security under the current market structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes the development and high-level analysis of a set of transition pathways to a UK low carbon electricity system, explaining key features of the core pathways developed and the distinctiveness and value of the approach. The pathways use an 'action space' concept to explore the dynamic interactions between choices made by actors, which are influenced by the competing governance 'framings' or 'logics' that different actors pursue. The paper sets out three core transition pathways - Market Rules, Central Co-ordination and Thousand Flowers, in which market, government and civil society logics respectively dominate. It summarises the key technological and institutional changes in these pathways, and the roles of actors in bringing these about. This leads to an identification of the key risks to the realisation of each of the pathways, and of the challenges for individuals, businesses, social movements and policy-makers in taking action to bring them about and sustain them.

The Role of Nonlinearities and Asymmetries,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & ECONOMIC STATISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Asymmetry; Nonlinearity; Out-of-sample forecast,SHOCKS; MACROECONOMY; TESTS,"There is a long tradition of using oil prices to forecast U.S. real GDP. It has been suggested that the predictive relationship between the price of oil and one-quarter-ahead U.S. real GDP is nonlinear in that (a) oil price increases matter only to the extent that they exceed the maximum oil price in recent years, and that (b) oil price decreases do not matter at all. We examine, first, whether the evidence of in-sample predictability in support of this view extends to out-of-sample forecasts. Second, we discuss how to extend this forecasting approach to higher horizons. Third, we compare the resulting class of nonlinear models to alternative economically plausible nonlinear specifications and examine which aspect of the model is most useful for forecasting. We show that the asymmetry embodied in commonly used nonlinear transformations of the price of oil is not helpful for out-of-sample forecasting; more robust and often more accurate real GDP forecasts are obtained from symmetric nonlinear models based on the 3-year net oil price change. Finally, we quantify the extent to which the 2008 recession could have been forecast using the latter class of time-varying threshold models.","[Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Vigfusson, Robert J.] Fed Reserve Board, Board Governors, Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC 20551 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Kilian, L (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lkilian@umich.edu; robert.j.vigfusson@frb.gov,,,,,,,27,121,125,1,21,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Electrical energy is the driver of this transformation, with China utilizing latecomer advantages in building an electrical energy generation machine of prodigious size. In terms of electrical energy generated, China's system has expanded twelve-fold in 30 years, from 280 TWh in 1980 to over 3500 TWh in 2010. In this paper we describe the principal features of this remarkable transformation, examining the official projections to 2020, the semi-official projections to 2050, and offering our own projections based on observed logistic industrial dynamics for the uptake of renewable energies as well as the continuing role to be played by fossil fuels, particularly coal. We emphasize the role to be played by China's construction of a 'strong and smart' electric power grid, as envisaged in the 12th Five Year Plan released in March 2011, and the complementary proposals to build a national high speed rail system. We see China as on track to phase out fossil fuels altogether in its power production system by the end of the century. We develop an argument as to why it might be expected that fossil fuel utilization will decline while renewable energy utilization might increase in China, constituting a genuine energy industrial revolution.

Although Japan's worst nuclear accident was triggered by an unprecedented earthquake and tsunami, inadequate safety countermeasures and collusive ties between the plant operators, regulators, and government officials left the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant beyond redemption. A critical examination of the accident reveals that the accumulation of various technical and institutional lapses only compounded the nuclear disaster. Besides technical fixes such as enhanced engineering safety features and better siting choices, the critical ingredient for safe operation of nuclear reactors lie in the quality of human training and transparency of the nuclear regulatory process that keeps public interest-not utility interest-at the forefront. The need for a credible and transparent analysis of the social benefits and risks of nuclear power is emphasized in the context of energy portfolio choice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper revises the shift-share analysis by adopting the net export ratio (NX) to separate the domestic and foreign components of regional employment change and to show the revealed comparative advantage of international trade. The result is found that the effects of international trade on employment change are ubiquitous, and its importance therefore cannot be overlooked. As for the significantly positive values of NX and its relative growth, for example, the employment change mainly arises from the international market and not from domestic demand.

Estimations are conducted for the whole economy and for two specific sectors: manufacturing and agriculture. Especially in the agricultural sector, it is important to include non-CO2 GHG emissions because these are the major emissions present. In most of the regions examined, the improvements in GHG intensities achieved in the manufacturing sector are larger than those in the agricultural sector. Compared with developing regions, most developed regions have consistently larger per-capita consumption-based GHG emissions over the whole economy, as well as higher production-based emissions. In the manufacturing sector, differences calculated by subtracting production-based emissions from consumption-based GHG emissions are determined by the regional economic level while, in the agricultural sector, they are dependent on regional production structures that are determined by international trade competitiveness. In the manufacturing sector, these differences are consistently and increasingly positive for the U.S., EU15 and Japan but negative for developing regions. In the agricultural sector, the differences calculated for the major agricultural importers like Japan and the EU15 are consistently positive while those of exporters like the U.S., Australia and New Zealand are consistently negative.

Further, it reviews the experience of governmental interventions composed of the legal framework, market incentives and manufacturing policies for lessons learning. After the Renewable Energy Law took effect in 2006, PV penetration was accelerated. Capital subsidies and feed-in tariffs, which were still in a trial stage, public bidding and the cooperation among relevant Ministries played important roles. A series of public R&D projects provided elemental technologies and meanwhile the preferential tax policies encouraged PV R&D nationwide. Then the paper looks into the future prospects, based on the technical potential, the national indicative targets in 2020, and the energy planning considering the governmental targets of energy transition and CO2 mitigation. Consequently we analyze problems impeding the future development based on evidences. For instance, there was no predetermined degression of the capital subsidy to push cost reduction; the budget and the organization of public PV R&D were insufficient. Finally, we propose some recommendations on improving policy interventions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

If this number increases, the monopoly airline loses revenue because many passengers use the airline service with lower airfare. However, the increase in rim passengers can strengthen scheduling effects, thereby increasing revenue.

This research does not attempt to classify institutions according to their effectives to foster climate change policies, but rather explores specific circumstances for climate change policy making on developing countries. Contrary to international proposal to find a generic optimal policy choice, the research explored the relevance of certain political and economic institutions that can be present in other national cases. It shows that the legacies on liberalization and state retreat undermine the state ability to effectively engage with the economic actors on decisions and management. Likewise regular engagement with them undermines the state affinity towards pursuing economic efficient solutions.

The density of cluster is inversely related to the damping of knowledge spillovers. Industry cluster is more likely to appear when the production cost is closer but still below the price of the product. Second, smaller companies are more likely to cluster than larger ones. Third, there is an optimal spatial scale, which is primarily determined by workers' wage, land rent, and the supply-demand relationship of land. The scale of a cluster cannot develop freely.

It discusses the determination of income and fuel costs and the possibilities for a relative and common European measure. It examines problems inherent in assessing fuel costs as a percentage of income and puts forward the arguments for a 'budget standard' approach. The paper illustrates how the size of the problem depends on the definition and chosen threshold and suggests advantages for a rating scale. It illustrates how the income composition and thresholds also govern the distribution of the target populations and the relative importance of the main causal factors, and examines the consequent policy implications. It explores the definition of vulnerable households and the importance of severity and questions whether the UK fuel poverty strategy is targeted at households least able to afford their fuel costs (as the name implies) or primarily those at risk from excess winter and summer mortality and morbidity. Finally, after examining the role of supplementary indicators, it looks at the opportunities for changing the definition and comments on the Government review of the definition and targets.

In particular, low income tenants face a phenomenon of energy poverty in which they allocate significantly more of their household income to energy expenditures than other renters. This problem is substantial, affecting 1.89% of all United States' energy use. If effectively addressed, it would create a range of savings between 4 and 11 billion dollars per year for many of the nation's poorest residents. We argue that a carefully designed program of incentives for participants (including landlords) in conjunction with a unique type of utility-managed on-bill financing mechanism has significant potential to solve many of the complications. We focus on three kinds of split incentives, five concerns inherent to addressing split incentive problems (scale, endurance, incentives, savings, political disfavor), and provide a detailed policy proposal designed to surpass those problems, with a particular focus on low-income tenants in a U.S. context.

To address that issue, this paper presents a dynamic model of the world economy with two technologies for production; a resource technology, which uses an exhaustible resource as an input and an alternative technology, which does not. I find that both the time path of resource extraction and the adoption of the alternative technology depend on the optimal allocation of capital across the technologies, and on the size of the capital stock in relation to the resource stock. In particular, if the capital stock is low, only the resource technology is used initially and the alternative technology is adopted with a delay. Next, I use the model to analyze the effects of industrialization of developing countries on the extraction of oil and technology choice for energy production. As a result of industrialization, the alternative technology for energy production is adopted earlier. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Subsidies in the form of feed-in tariffs (FIT) have been introduced in many countries to support the expansion of wind power. These tariffs are highly debated. Proponents say they are necessary to pave the way for decarbonising energy production. Opponents argue they prevent a welfare-optimal energy supply. Thus, in a case study we try to shed light on the welfare economic aspect of FIT by combining spatial modelling and economic valuation of landscape externalities of wind turbines. We show for the planning region West Saxony, Germany, that setting FIT in a welfare optimal manner is a challenging task. If set too high the production costs are overly increased, lowering social welfare. If set too low energy production targets may not be reached and/or external costs are overly increased, again lowering social welfare. Taking a closer look at the tariffs offered by the German Renewable Sources Energy Act we find for West Saxony that the tariffs quite well meet economic welfare considerations. One should note, however, that this finding might apply only to the present data set. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper seeks to calculate a robust measure of national power system resilience by analysing each step in the process of transformation from raw energy to consumed electricity.

The theory of interdependence is a widely used concept in political and economic studies of international relations. As can be seen from the analysis of Czech-Russian energy relations and its costs and benefits, the interdependence cannot be limited to a situation of equal interdependence. Energy sensitivity and vulnerability of the Czech Republic towards Russia is considered as a key source of power for the energy policy of Russia vis-a-vis the Czech Republic. The evidence for this claim can be found in the procedures and expressions of Russia's energy policy. On the other hand, the energy policy of the Czech Republic is influenced by the European Union and its focus on the liberalization of the energy market, diversification of the currently existing transportation routes and legislative proposals aimed at strengthening the EU's own energy security. The European Union significantly contributes to an increase of the energy security of the Czech Republic. The European Union and regional cooperation (such as the V4 group) could balance out the asymmetry of interdependence, thus lowering the sensitivity and vulnerability of the Czech Republic towards Russia.

The cross-country comparison of the freight transportation sector indicates that per capita CO2 emissions span a wide range and are mostly determined by local needs without full knowledge or coordination with policies and practices in other countries. Over the last several decades, while many developed countries have experienced decreased coupling between total freight activity (measured in tonne-km) and income, no major indication of decreased coupling between trucking and income was found. Rather, the coupling has been strengthened in many countries due to a continued increase in the share of trucking in total freight activity. The energy intensity of trucking has exhibited very large variation among the countries, and its recent international trends are mixed, providing greater challenges to reduce freight CO2 emissions. Modal shift toward rail away from truck presents a sizeable opportunity to reduce freight CO2 emissions, although the potential gain varies widely among the countries.

Renewable energy technologies are increasingly becoming the cheapest solutions for off-grid energy access. The dramatic uptake of mobile phones in developing countries shows how quickly decentralized services can develop on a commercial basis under the right conditions, and raises the prospect that private finance could also drive decentralized energy access for the poor. Indeed, there are already a number of instances of clean energy solutions - such as solar portable lights, household biogas units or solar home systems - that have managed to scale-up through leveraging private finance. However, the experience gained from first-generation market development projects show that, in almost all cases, significant public resources have been necessary to increase the affordability of clean energy technologies, provide access to financing for the poor, and remove non-economic barriers. Such public interventions may be funded by international public finance, domestic budgets and carbon finance. Despite mounting fiscal constraints facing governments worldwide, the emergence of new sources of climate finance and the political momentum in support of energy subsidy reforms, as well as new programming modalities, offer opportunities to leverage additional resources to achieve universal energy access by 2030.

In the rim market, the potential scales of demand for the connecting and direct flights are different. Passengers differentiate among the flights of carriers. This study demonstrates that for new entrants, entering the rim market with direct flights could be preferable, if the degree of product differentiation is sufficiently small, or the scale of direct flights demand is large. This may explain the phenomenon that entrants usually enter the market with rim routes. Welfare analysis suggests the necessity for a transport policy to guide potential entrants to enter the socially preferable route.","[Lin, Ming Hsin] Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, Osaka 5338533, Japan; [Kawasaki, Akio] Kagoshima Univ, Fac Educ, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan",Kagoshima University,"Lin, MH (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan.",linmh@osaka-ue.ac.jp; kawasaki@edu.kagoshima-u.ac.jp,"Kawasaki, Akio/P-4727-2017",,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530281] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,29,1,1,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

With determination of priorities for these criteria through questionnaire and AHP method, the overall rank of these criteria that have the most influence on distribution of energy subsidy among socio-economic sub-sectors, are as the following: inflation, economic growth, labor intensity, distribution of energy subsidy among socio-economic levels, energy intensity and social cost of air pollution. According to the model, the first priority for allocation of energy subsidy is commercial sector and the last priority is related to transportation sector. Investigating the impact of changing priority of the criteria on overall results indicates that the socio-economic sub sectors' ranking in receiving subsidy have little sensitivity for changing priority of the subsidy criteria.

The identification hypothesis states that supply-driven oil price shocks have a negative impact on the macroeconomic activity of countries, which are net consumers of oil while demand-driven oil price shocks do not have negative effects. In order to identify global demand-driven shocks, a weighted aggregate GDP series of countries, which are net consumers of oil, is constructed over 1970-2006. The key result is that the main driving force behind oil price shocks has changed from supply-driven shocks in 1970-1992 to demand-driven shocks in 1992-2006. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Ownership and control structures are in flux throughout the heating sector chain. Inefficiencies, causing low service quality and rising prices, have already started eroding the market share of district heating, despite its potential benefits. End-use management practices - such as lack of metering, communal billing, and low prices that do not cover production costs - reduce consumer incentives to cut consumption. The diversity of end-users adds to the complexity of focused measures like energy-saving contracts. However, end-use sector reforms such as mandatory meter installation and increasing prices - even if socially acceptable and fully implemented cannot alone provide the massive investments required. More appropriate is sector-wide reform with the government's financial participation - especially if consumer efforts can yield better service quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The three Japanese regions have been leading the formation of industrial geography of East Asia in the past three decades. Since the reform and opening of China in the 1980s, the industrial landscape has significantly changed from a unipolar structure to a multipolar structure. Three Chinese coastal regions advanced successfully in manufacturing production and they became a substantial force in shifting economic balance towards China away from Japan and Korea. Obviously, the rise of the three Chinese coastal regions has expanded trade and investment relations with other economic regions and they are now becoming centers of expanding inter-regional trading networks of East Asia. The three Japanese core regions, however, seem to retain their influence over other regions perhaps due to Japan's investment and production networks built over the past decades. The continued growth of Chinese coastal regions suggests a different configuration of inter-regional relations in the future, posing an important question of whether the rise of coastal China will make inter-regional relations complementary or competitive in the future.","Korea Res Inst Human Settlements, Gyeonggi Do 431712, South Korea; [Kim, Won Bae] Presidential Comm Reg Dev, Organizing Comm Int Conf 2010, Gyeonggi Do 431712, South Korea",,"Kim, WB (通讯作者)，Korea Res Inst Human Settlements, 1591-6 Gwanyang Dong, Gyeonggi Do 431712, South Korea.",winterpine@krihs.re.kr,,,,,,,42,2,3,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The plan will condition both the medium and long term perspectives of economic restructuring, rebalance between the inclusive economic growth and environmental objectives, which are compounded by multiple constraints faced by China such as aging population, natural resources depletion, energy supply security and environmental deterioration. This article investigates the major energy and climate targets and actions specified in the 12th FYP to gain insights into the nature and magnitude of challenges and difficulties with regard to the medium and long run economic and environmental policies. It points out that China should articulate sectoral policies with the global climate mitigation targets to avoid long term carbon lock-in. Based on an in-depth analysis of the objectives in the plan, it is argued that the implementation should include mainstreaming developments of appropriate instruments to support cost-effective energy efficiency improvements and carbon intensity reduction in the next five years.

Other measures of road freight activity, such as tonnes lifted, tonnes moved, loaded distance travelled and total distance travelled also increased much slower than GDP. The main factor contributing to the observed decoupling was the declining value of manufactured goods relative to GDP. Reductions in the average payload weight, the amount of empty running and the fuel use per vehicle kilometre also appear to have made a contribution, while other factors have acted to increase aggregate energy intensity. The results demonstrate that the UK has been more successful than most EU countries in decoupling the environmental impacts of road freight transport from GDP. However, this is largely the unintended outcome of various economic trends rather than the deliberate result of policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, when the investor is a generator (hereafter the integrated generator) who also can use the interconnector to export its electricity to a distant location, then, once operational, the integrated generator will bid more aggressively in the allocation auctions to increase the auction revenue and thus its profits. As a result, the integrated generator is more likely to win the auction and the capacity is sold for a higher price. This lowers the allocative efficiency of the auction, but it increases the expected ex-ante profitability of the merchant interconnector project. Unaffiliated, independent generators, however, are less likely to win the auction and, in any case, pay a higher price, which dramatically lowers their revenues from exporting electricity over this interconnector.

Using an intertemporal general equilibrium model we show that 'small' market imperfections may trigger a several decades lasting dominance of an incumbent energy technology over a dynamically more efficient competitor, given that the technologies are very good substitutes. Such a 'lock-in' into an inferior technology causes significantly higher welfare losses than market failure alone, notably under ambitious mitigation targets. More than other innovative industries, energy markets are prone to these lock-ins because electricity from different technologies is an almost perfect substitute. To guide government intervention, we compare welfare-maximizing technology policies including subsidies, quotas, and taxes with regard to their efficiency, effectivity, and robustness. Technology quotas and feed-in-tariffs turn out to be only insignificantly less efficient than first-best subsidies and seem to be more robust against small perturbations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A default expectation is that countries with unsolved energy problems will have more ambitious renewable energy policies (including energy efficiency). The Japanese case only partially conforms. The theoretical proposition made here is that it is essential to analyze a country's vested interest structure before we can make any inferences about its renewable energy policies. The vested interest perspective - derived from a combination of Joseph Schumpeter and Mancur Olson, and focusing on structural economic change - both complements and rivals the default expectation. Structural economic change, like the rise of renewables, typically leads to resistance from the existing vested interest structure, which feels that it stands to lose from the rise of new industries. The position of a new industry vis-a-vis the existing vested interest structure is thus crucial. In the Japanese case, the solar industry has been far more on the inside of this structure than wind. This has made it far harder for the wind industry to rise than for solar. Energy efficiency is however the ultimate insider approach to energy policy, not challenging any vested interest structures, and has been the favored approach for over three decades.

Two versions of this model are explored: the more common 'standard version' and a proposed 'alternative version'. Taking a single-area perspective, consideration is given to the extent to which the sequence of stages within the spatial-cycle model is consistent with observed outcomes. The model is then examined from a system-wide perspective. It is concluded that although the spatial-cycle model is found wanting in a number of important respects, its apparent outright rejection does not seem warranted.","Univ Glasgow, Dept Urban Studies, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Parr, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Dept Urban Studies, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",John.Parr@glasgow.ac.uk,,,,,,,21,9,10,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

Therefore, the magnitude of rebound effect is important for the design and timing of an effective energy conservation policy. Under the framework of translog cost share equations, we estimates the direct rebound effect for heavy industry in China for the first time by conducting an empirical research on the relationship between the direct rebound effect and the ease with which energy services can substitute for other inputs. Additionally, asymmetric price responses are specified in the model for the rebound effect estimation. Empirical results in our paper indicate that the rebound effect for heavy industry in China is about 74.3%. This reveals that energy efficiency improvement can save energy to a certain degree since the rebound effect is less than 100% (back-fire), but most of the expected reduction in heavy industry energy consumption is mitigated.

In this study, renewable energy options including pumped hydro, pressurized air, flywheels, Li ion batteries, hydrogen and super-capacitors are compared based on a specific set of criteria. The criteria considered are energy/power density, ease of integration with the existing energy network, cost effectiveness, durability, efficiency and safety. Our study showed that storing renewable energy sources in the form of hydrogen through the electrolysis process is ranked as the most promising option considering the mentioned criteria. It brings about several benefits suggesting that hydrogen and fuel cells are promising contributors towards a more sustainable future, both in energy demand and environmental sustainability.

Whether there is a full compensating differential or how much households are paying implicitly is an empirical question. This study estimates the net implicit price of energy efficient buildings codes, IECC 2003 through IECC 2006, for American households. Using sample data from the American Community Survey 2007, a heteroskedastic seemingly unrelated estimation approach is used to estimate hedonic price (house rent) and energy expenditure models. The value of energy efficiency building codes is capitalized into housing rents, which are estimated to increase by 23.25 percent with the codes. However, the codes provide households a compensating differential of about a 6.47 percent reduction (about $7.71) in monthly energy expenditure. Results indicate that the mean household net implicit price for these codes is about $140.87 per month in 2006 dollars ($163.19 in 2013 dollars). However, this estimated price is shown to vary significantly by region, energy type and the rent gradient. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, this study attempts to quantify the impact of different electricity conservation policies on value-added of industrial and services sectors in Pakistan. Results indicate that unanticipated shocks to electricity consumption and technical efficiency form a positive relationship while electricity price has a negative relationship with value-added in industrial and services sectors in the long run. Direct electricity conservation policies and policies that aim at increasing electricity prices will have an adverse impact on value-added of both the sectors. Policies that induce improvements in energy efficiency will have a positive impact on the sectorial output in the long run. Therefore, the government should not pursue direct consumption curtailment polices to mitigate the electricity crisis rather steps should be taken to enhance energy efficiency in the economy. This can be done by setting targets for reducing energy intensity in both the sectors. Moreover, energy efficiency should be incorporated in the mainstream of energy policy and specific laws should be enacted to establish institutions and develop methods to help in effective conservation and efficient consumption of limited energy resources.

However, there is also significant uncertainty with the amount, location and timing of new generation connection, which in turn will drive the transmission investment needs. Given the absence of efficient market design, we identify three key areas of concern with the current transmission investment arrangements: (i) a misaligned incentives framework for transmission investment and operation; (ii) lack of coordination of investment and operation; and (iii) conflicts of interest. We then propose three options for future evolution of transmission regimes, which cover the full spectrum of institutional arrangements with respect to transmission planning and delivery, i.e. how and who plans, owns, builds and operates the transmission system. For each option we present: key characteristics; evolution of the current regimes; the ability of the option to address the concerns; and key strengths and weaknesses. Overall, we conclude in the case of GB (this conclusion could be extended to other European countries) that the most appropriate option would be that of an Independent System Operator (ISO) who would be responsible for planning and operating the transmission system.

Incentives complement mandatory standards and labeling policies by accelerating market penetration of products that are more energy efficient than required by existing standards and by preparing the market for more stringent future mandatory requirements. Incentives can be directed at different points in the appliance's supply chain; one point may be more effective than another depending on the technology's maturity and market penetration. This paper seeks to inform future policy and program design by categorizing the main elements of incentive programs from around the world. We identify advantages and disadvantages of program designs through a qualitative overview of incentive programs worldwide. We find that financial incentive programs have greater impact when they target highly efficient technologies with a small market share, and that program designs depend on the market barriers addressed, the target equipment, and the local market context. No program design is inherently superior to another. The key to successful program design and implementation is a thorough understanding of the market and identification of the most important local obstacles to the penetration of energy-efficient technologies.

In principle, the CDM simply shifts the location of emission reductions, with no net mitigation impact. Departing from this zero-sum calculus, the Cancun Agreements reached at the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in 2010 called for one or more market-based mechanisms capable of ensuring a net decrease and/or avoidance of global greenhouse gas emissions, an intention reiterated at COP 17 and COP 18. This article explores the extent to which the CDM may or may not already lead to such a net decrease. It finds that the CDM's net mitigation impact likely hinges on the additionality of large-scale power projects, which are expected to generate the majority of CDM credits going forward. If these projects are truly additional and continue to operate well beyond the credit issuance period, they will decrease global greenhouse gas emissions. However, if they are mostly non-additional, as research suggests, they could increase global greenhouse gas emissions. The article closes with a discussion of possible means to increase mitigation benefit. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores the use of these indicators when dealing with observations at the subregional level, based on micro-data sets that impose the conceptualization of spatial interactions in a continuous and multidirectional space. We propose a general methodology to build local indicators for spatial micro-data sets. Based on distance matrix and matrix calculations, some classical indices of specialization and diversity are extended to their local counterparts to explore the full spatial heterogeneity and variability of space. The methodology is applied to 9,839 establishments covering all economic sectors in the Lower St-Lawrence region (Quebec, Canada). We find that the distribution of the local indicator varies significantly with distance, which suggests that the effects of specialization or diversity are not constant over space. Treating space as continuous may become of prime importance, given that more individual data sets are now available, combined with the fact that the performance of microcomputers is still improving.","[Dube, Jean] Univ Laval, ESAD, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Brunelle, Cedric] Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada",Laval University; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Dubé, J (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, ESAD, 2325 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",jean.dube@esad.ulaval.ca; cbrunelle@mun.ca,"Dubé, John/P-2731-2015; Dubé, Jean/L-1751-2019","Dubé, Jean/0000-0003-3445-3449; Brunelle, Cedric/0000-0003-0995-8621",,,,,72,13,14,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The two strategies use a battery of misspecification tests obtained in a maximum likelihood framework. The robust tests to local misspecification errors in the alternative hypothesis and the common factor test have been developed with this purpose. The paper includes a Monte Carlo experiment to compare their performance in a situation of small sample sizes. The results are mixed: Both alternatives work well under ideal conditions, but their efficiency deteriorates for different departures such as non-normality or endogeneity. All in all, Stge appears to be slightly preferable although our impression is that the two are complementary and can be used in common.

Further, these economies are constantly being shaped by series of structural reforms with direct and indirect effects on growth, demand for energy, etc. To this end, this paper examines the causal dynamics among energy use, real GDP and CO2 emissions in the presence of regime shifts in six emerging African economies using the Gregory and Hansen. (1996a). J. Econ. 70, 99-126 threshold cointegration and the Toda and Yamamoto (1995). J. Econometrics. 66, 225-250 Granger causality techniques. Results confirm the presence of regime shift effects in the long run inter-linkages among energy use, real GDP and CO2 emissions in the countries considered, thus indicating that structural changes have both economic and environmental effects. Hence, integration of energy and environmental policies into development plans is imperative towards attaining sustainable growth and development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In France, similar grassroots initiatives. - albeit with certain specificities - only began to emerge recently and so far, very few studies have dealt with them. The purpose of this article is to propose an exploratory and in-depth analysis of one advanced French case: Le Mene, a pioneer in local energy autonomy. We examine the conditions under which the initiative emerged and the processes through which a grassroots innovation is formed. In studying this case (interviews, analysis of documents), comparing it with other sources of data (expert interviews, comparative observation of other initiatives) and taking stock of various social sciences studies, we show that a social innovation was produced in Le Mene through the hybridisation of actors, sociotechniques and discourses. This initiative was innovative not only in terms of the scope of the mechanisms implemented, but also in terms of the social organisation behind the development of the projects and the capacity to use energy production as a social resource. Finally, we reflect on the possible diffusion of these grassroots initiatives and their policy implications in France. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the data on 21 manufacturing sectors in six years (2005-2010) for 31 provinces/regions, we construct four IP indicators to estimate how globalization influences China's industrial capacity and technological composition through foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign trade. The panel estimating results suggest that both FDI and foreign trade generate strong positive effects on manufacturing output and manufacturing exports, but the contributions to industrial upgrading and technological complexity seem to be limited. At the regional level, the effect of FDI and trade on IP is numerically much smaller in the inland area than in the coastal area.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Illinois State University,"Zhang, KH (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",khzhang@ilstu.edu,,,,,,,27,10,11,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

An alternative perspective stresses interregional collaborative networks in which individuals and groups are embedded in wide-ranging webs of relationships. This article uses social network analysis to explore the changing structures of collaborative systems of intermetropolitan co-patenting in American biotechnology from 1979 to 2009. Results show that intermetropolitan network complexity has broadened and deepened. While inventors in major centers are the foremost collaborators, a dense web of knowledge exchange has emerged that is not singularly controlled by a handful of intermediaries. National linkages have developed, but intense local and regional ties persist. Inventive centrality, magnitude, and patent intensity significantly correlate. Inventors in small areas are obliged to substitute intermetropolitan networks for thin agglomerative economies. An estimate is proposed of the size of biotechnology centers needed to generate agglomerative economies. The system approximates a core-periphery structure with core metropolitan areas strongly tied to one another and to peripheral areas. City systems theory and associated American empirical analyses help interpret results.","[HUallachain, Breandan O.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Lee, Der-Shiuan] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Urban Affairs & Environm Planning, Coll Environm Design, Taipei 11114, Taiwan",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Chinese Culture University,"HUallacháin, BO (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, 5006 Coor Hall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",ohuallachain@asu.edu; ldx2@ulive.pccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,77,21,31,0,89,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Yet we know quite little about the dynamics of the underlying policychoices in this area. Using new data on adoptions and changes in feed-in tariff and green certificate schemes in 26 advanced industrialized countries over 20 years, we examine both domestic driving forces as well as international determinants. The findings suggest that three factors play a particularly important role in pushing countries towards market-based support systems: characteristics of the existing energy supply system, a federalist structure of the political system, and EU membership. Particularly noteworthy is the finding that higher shares of fossil and nuclear energy in the national energy supply as well as higher CO2 intensity of the economy do not, as we had expected, stand in the way of policies for supporting renewables in electricity production. To the contrary, they increase the likelihood of a country adopting such policies. We also find, however, that higher economic growth and higher growth in solar and wind energy capacity tend to reduce the political appetite for reforms of existing schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, many utilities pursue energy efficiency programs. We study a case where utilities could choose whether to allocate their energy efficiency budget to either end-use efficiency or vehicle electrification as a means to reduce CO2 emissions. We build a decision space that displays the conditions under which utilities should pursue either strategy. To build such decision space, assumptions are needed on how consumers respond to electric vehicle incentives, and what would be the baseline vehicle selected by consumers if no incentives were in place. Since these two aspects are highly uncertain, we treat them parametrically: if consumers are replacing a conventional vehicle with a PHEV, utility incentive programs to induce PHEV adoption appear to be cost-effective for a wide range of efficiency program costs and grid emissions factors.

We present the properties of the model, derive the closed-form solutions for the model given the relevant constraints, and use numerical experiments to illustrate the results. We find that subsidies, loss aversion, the performance of both EVs and internal combustion engine-powered vehicles (ICEVs), and the coefficient of variation of demand are significant factors influencing the optimal production quantity and the expected utilities of EV production. The high selling price and other high costs of ICEVs help offset the influence of loss aversion, whereas the high costs of EV enhance loss aversion. Our study enriches the literature on subsidies for EVs by establishing a behavioral model to incorporate the decision bias in terms of loss aversion at the firm level. These findings provide guiding principles for both policymakers and EV managers for making better strategies to promote EVs in the early immature market. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Measure-explicit marginal abatement cost curves depict the cost and abating potential of available mitigation options. Using a simple intertemporal optimization model, we demonstrate why this information is not sufficient to design emission reduction strategies. Because the measures required to achieve ambitious emission reductions cannot be implemented overnight, the optimal strategy to reach a short-term target depends on longer-term targets. For instance, the best strategy to achieve European's -20% by 2020 target may be to implement some expensive, high-potential, and long-to-implement options required to meet the -75% by 2050 target. Using just the cheapest abatement options to reach the 2020 target can create a carbon-intensive lock-in and make the 2050 target too expensive to reach. Designing mitigation policies requires information on the speed at which various measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions can be implemented, in addition to the information on the costs and potential of such measures provided by marginal abatement cost curves.

First, we applied the Sato-Vartia index decomposition to the energy intensity of the manufacturing industry in Korea. Second, we attributed the growth rate of aggregate energy intensity to 10 sub-manufacturing industries through two channels: real energy intensity and structural change. The result of the decomposition illustrates that the aggregate energy intensity index decreased in the period 1981-2010. The index decomposition analysis demonstrates that real energy intensity decreased by 85.85%, whereas structural change increased energy intensity by 69.37% over the same period of time. The negative effect of structural change is partly a result of the increasing portion of energy intensive industry in manufacturing. The result reflects that industrial structure in Korea can be an important aspect for improving energy efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

When viewed in a holistic manner, including initial materials extraction, manufacturing, use and disposal/decommissioning, these 41 studies show that both wind and solar systems are directly tied to and responsible for GHG emissions. They are thus not actually emissions free technologies. Moreover, by spotlighting the lifecycle stages and physical characteristics of these technologies that are most responsible for emissions, improvements can be made to lower their carbon footprint. As such, through in-depth examination of the results of these studies and the variations therein, this article uncovers best practices in wind and solar design and deployment that can better inform climate change mitigation efforts in the electricity sector.

The GMM is particularly powerful for analyzing complex datasets such as longitudinal and panel data, and it has wide applications in econometrics. This article extends the least squares based adaptive elastic net estimator by Zou and Zhang to nonlinear equation systems with endogenous variables. The extension is not trivial and involves a new proof technique due to estimators' lack of closed-form solutions. Compared to Bridge-GMM by Caner, we allow for the number of parameters to diverge to infinity as well as collinearity among a large number of variables; also, the redundant parameters are set to zero via a data-dependent technique. This method has the oracle property, meaning that we can estimate nonzero parameters with their standard limit and the redundant parameters are dropped from the equations simultaneously. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the performance of the new method.","[Caner, Mehmet] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27518 USA; [Zhang, Hao Helen] Univ Arizona, Dept Math, Tucson, AZ 85718 USA; [Zhang, Hao Helen] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University; University of Arizona; North Carolina State University,"Caner, M (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, 4168 Nelson Hall, Raleigh, NC 27518 USA.",m.caner@ncsu.edu; hzhang@math.arizona.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [DMS-0654293, 1347844, 1309507]; National Institutes of Health [NIH/NC1 R01 CA-08548]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1347844] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1309507] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"Zhang's research is supported by National Science Foundation Grants DMS-0654293, 1347844, 1309507, and National Institutes of Health Grant NIH/NC1 R01 CA-08548.

It can be successfully applied in the field of regional analysis. Comparisons of regions at various NUTS levels are more and more frequently used together with the rise of importance of regional policy and effort in decreasing regional disparities. When the analyses are carried out, it is necessary to present the results in a comprehensible and transparent way. One of the latest tools is a checkerplot chart which combines the depicting of size differences as well as spatial differences. In this paper the checkerplot is constructed for 77 Czech LAU 1 regions. The first important step is to decide the size of a grid in which regional data can be presented. After that, the regions are matched with the most proper fields in the grid using the optimization assignment model. Some of the fields remain vacant. The third step consists in checking whether the spatial distribution of regions in the grid corresponds with reality. In our case, simple linear assignment model that minimizes the sum of differences between the centers of grid fields and real regional centers and model that minimizes maximum difference are compared and discussed. Finally, possible manual changes can be performed. However, application of assignment problem proves to be a useful tool for regional data visualization.","[Kramulova, Jana] Univ Econ, Dept Reg Studies, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Jablonsky, Josef] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Zeman, Jan] Univ Econ, Dept Econ Stat, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kramulová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Reg Studies, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jana.kramulova@vse.cz; jablon@vse.cz; jan.zeman@vse.cz,"Jablonsky, Josef/N-8711-2019; Jablonsky, Josef/U-2395-2018","Jablonsky, Josef/0000-0003-0606-354X;",,,,,10,0,0,0,3,PALACKY UNIV OLOMOUC,OLOMOUC,"KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,489,494,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900085,0

Applying this integrated methodology, we investigate China's regional inequality at the county level using a comprehensive panel dataset that includes socioeconomic, environmental, locational, policy and GIS data from 1992 to 2010. The results show that Chinese regional inequality at the county level has a non-stationary dynamic structure, mirroring global inequality and spatial autocorrelation. In addition, the spatial panel data models analysis reveals the relative influence of explanatory variables. The impact of essential productive factors on regional development is gradually fading. Industrialization and decentralization play the most important role. The influence of marketization on regional development is not clear. The expansion of urban built-up areas has exerted a strong influence on the uneven regional development. Policy and transportation factor plays an indispensable role in regional inequality. The analysis additionally recognizes that socioeconomic factors play a dominant role, beyond policy and location factors. The role of environmental factors appears to be masked. This paper suggests that more attention needs to be paid to micro-inequality to coordinate inter-county and intra-county inequality under the pressure of rapid industrialization, urbanization and modernization of agriculture. Given the pattern of economic development, deepening balanced development reforms, optimizing and upgrading the industrial structure might be effective ways to develop a more coordinated regional development structure in China at the county level.","[Li, Guangdong; Fang, Chuanglin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res IGSNRR, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Guangdong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Fang, CL (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res IGSNRR, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",ligd.11b@igsnrr.ac.cn; fangcl@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,,,,,72,51,63,2,118,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Globally in a scenario allowing the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) nearly 500 billion barrels of existing 2P oil reserves must remain unused by 2035. In a scenario where CCS is unavailable this increases to around 600 billion barrels. Besides reserves, arctic oil and light tight oil play only minor roles in a scenario with CCS and essentially no role when CCS is not available. On a global scale, 40% of those resources yet to be found in deepwater regions must remain undeveloped, rising to 55% if CCS cannot be deployed. The widespread development of unconventional oil resources is also shown to be incompatible with a decarbonised energy system even with a total and rapid decarbonisation of energetic inputs. The work thus demonstrates the extent to which current energy policies encouraging the unabated exploration for, and exploitation of, all oil resources are incommensurate with the achievement of a low-carbon energy system.

In particular, it focuses on the Czech labour market. Labour markets and their dynamics may be described by the standard Cobb-Douglas matching functions. Successful matches are thus treated as an output of a production process where unemployed are paired with available vacancies. Unemployment outflows are determined by the efficiency of corresponding matching process.

A center of sub-region must have at least 1,000 inhabitants and basic amenities. Based on the methodical procedure described in the article, there were defined 411 sub-regions in the Czech Republic. Sub-regional units are more suitable for measuring disparities than independent municipalities that represent too detailed level of assessment.

Using the estimated net costs and the volume of CO2 reduced by the measures, a marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for the average household's CO2 emissions is produced. An analysis using the curve suggests that in order to provide households with an incentive to take actions that can lead to CO2 emission reductions in using energy-consuming durables, a high level of carbon price is needed. In addition, a regression analysis reveals that the net benefits of the measures are larger for households that put a higher priority on energy saving, for those living in detached houses, for those with a smaller number of persons living together, and for those with less income. The result of the analysis using the MAC curve may suggest that promoting energy-saving behavior will require not only a policy to provide economic incentives but also interventions to influence psychological factors of household behavior.

Turkey, as one of those countries, has restructured its electricity market and intensively privatized the distribution companies. As one of the main targets of the liberalization efforts in the sector was announced to be reduced consumer prices, it is a matter of interest to look at the related developments after privatizations. Hence, this study attempts to explore the impact of power distribution privatization in Turkey on the national end-user electricity prices. Results of the analysis suggest that privatization of electricity distribution companies has not yielded the expected retail price declines within the first 4 years of the program. Whereas wholesale tariffs exhibit a reduction in the rate of 10%, retail tariffs show an increase of 5.9% within the period in question. Besides, the unstable patterns of the two tariffs imply that the market is not yet ready for the automatic pricing mechanism planned to be implemented based on a cost-reflective methodology. Therefore, results indicate that the factors behind the unsatisfactory outcomes of the program should be explored in order for the privatization efforts in the Turkish electricity distribution market to serve the purpose.

The paper will discuss important methodological issues with regard to various energy indicators and it will, by means of a few selected energy indicators, show examples of results for hydropower, wind power and electricity from biomass, gas and coal. Lastly it will suggest methods to achieve results which are more consistent when comparing electricity production technologies. In general, methodological issues can affect the results of life cycle assessments. In this paper, the authors have focused on the effect of system boundaries for energy indicators and found that the internal ranking of cases within one electricity generation technology is dependent on the indicator used. These variations do not, however, alter the general ranking of the major technologies studied. The authors suggest that future assessments should focus on a smaller set of indicators: the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), which is the most universal indicator, Energy Payback Ratio (EPR) for assessment of upstream activities, and a suggested Cumulative Fossil Energy Demand (CFED) for resource depletion assessments. There is also a need for stricter standardisation and increased transparency in the assessment of energy products. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A process-based hybrid life-cycle assessment model is used to quantify the life-cycle energy use for both urban and rural residential buildings in China and determine the energy use characteristics of each life cycle phase. An input-output model for the pre-use phases is based on 2007 Chinese economic benchmark data. A process-based life-cycle assessment model for estimating the operation and demolition phases uses historical energy-intensity data. Results show that operation energy in both urban and rural residential buildings is dominant and varies from 75% to 86% of life cycle energy respectively. Gaps in living standards as well as differences in building structure and materials result in a life-cycle energy intensity of urban residential buildings that is 20% higher than that of rural residential buildings. The life-cycle energy of urban residential buildings is most sensitive to the reduction of operational energy intensity excluding heating energy which depends on both the occupants' energy-saving behavior as well as the performance of the building itself.

The research adopts a discrete choice experiment approach and focuses on two micro-generation technologies: solar voltaic and solar thermal. Our empirical analysis revealed firstly that households prefer micro-generation systems that have low installation costs but high energy saving benefits and long warranty periods; and secondly that households prefer direct subsidies to low-interest loans. However, we also found that households are reluctant to install photovoltaic or solar thermal systems in reality because they see the cost of system installation as being higher than the benefits they would receive from such installation. In short, while existing government supports are somewhat effective in promoting household adoption of micro-generation systems, there also exists the obstacle that the majority of households are unwilling to install such systems despite government support. Thus several policy improvements, which focus on increasing the benefits and decreasing the installation costs of micro-generation systems, are suggested in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

SM cause considerable investment and operating expenses. For providers of such systems one avenue to recoup SM costs is to explicitly invoice various SM price components to end customers. The feasibility of this strategy heavily depends on residential electricity customers' willingness to pay (WTP) for SM and, furthermore, an understanding of factors that have an impact on WTP. Therefore, the present article develops hypotheses on associations between three perceived SM benefit facets, one perceived intangible SM cost type as well as environmental awareness in general on the one hand, and WTP for SM on the other. The hypotheses are tested in a sample of 453 German-speaking residential electricity customers who filled in an online questionnaire. PLS analysis of the survey data reveals that trust in the protection of personal SM data and the intention to change one's electricity consumption behaviors after SM deployment are the constructs most strongly related to WTP for SM. Expectations regarding SM-triggered electricity volume saving and environmental awareness contributed less toward explaining WTP. Overall, the considered WTP antecedents left 72% of the criterion variance unaccounted for. Implications of the findings are discussed for electricity suppliers planning large-scale SM deployments and future research in the field of energy policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The data and analyses demonstrate how this new industry was fostered by interactions between existing companies, public R&D funding programmes and research organisations and policy contexts; illustrating a policy-driven technological agency in accordance with a Triple Helix innovation process. During the last decade, a solar PV manufacturing industry has emerged in Norway and gone on to a 10 to 20 per cent share of various segments of world markets for solar PV feedstock, wafers and related components. The present financial crisis has caused an investment slump in solar PV installations, especially in Europe. Therefore, the future prospects for the Norwegian solar PV industry are at risk despite of its focus on innovation and R&D, and its technological agency. Political action is needed: (1) creation of market incentives in near markets for the deployment of solar PV, (2) international cooperation for boosting deployment of solar PV in developing countries.

This is done in a model that incorporates the main features of the industry: non-storable production, time-varying price-elastic demand, and sequential investment and production decisions. The paper considers contracts for difference that have as reference price the average spot price. Assuming that the spot market coordinator sets competitive prices, the paper shows that installed capacity increases with the quantity of energy contracted, reaching the welfare-maximizing capacity when energy contracted equals this same level. Next, the paper studies the case where the quantity of energy contracted is endogenous and contracts are traded before capacity decisions are taken. Regarding purchasers of contracts, two polar cases are considered: either they are price-taker speculators or they are an aggregation of consumers that auctions a long (buy) contract for a given energy quantity. In the former case the strike price equals the reference price, i.e., arbitrage is perfect, and the quantity of energy contracted falls short of the efficient level. In turn, in the latter case, the strike price equals the average efficient spot price. Moreover, an aggregation of all consumers would choose to auction the social optimum quantity.

When this data is expressed graphically it illustrates important differences in the characteristics of the gas and electricity demand; these include the quantity of energy delivered through the networks on a daily basis, the scale of variability in the gas demand over multiple timescales (seasonal, weekly and daily) and the relative stability and predictability of the electrical demand. As the United Kingdom proceeds to migrate heating demands to the electrical network in its drive to cut carbon emissions, electrical demand will increase, but equally importantly the variability and uncertainty shown in the gas demand will also migrate to the electrical demand, which suggests both technical challenges and opportunities for management of future energy networks.

One underlying reason is that such projects require the involvement of many stakeholders, such as feedstock producers, engineers, authorities and the concerned public. We analyze the role of bioenergy-specific non-technical factors for the success of bioenergy projects. In a broad literature review we first identify potential success factors belonging to the five dimensions project characteristics, policy framework, regional integration, public perception and stakeholders. Using these factors as conceptual framework, we next analyze six Japanese pilot projects for bioenergy utilization supported by Japans Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Research Council. We apply Rough Set Analysis, a data mining method that can be used for small sample sizes to identify patterns in a dataset. We find that, by and large, non-technical factors from all five dimensions such as the stability of the local policy framework co-occur with project success. Furthermore, we show that there are diverging interpretations as to what success in a bioenergy project means. This requires tradeoffs between various goals, which should be identified and addressed explicitly at early stages of such a project. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The POLES global energy model has been modified to widen the coverage of climate change impacts on the European energy system. The impacts considered are changes in heating and cooling demand in the residential and services sector, changes in the efficiency of thermal power plants, and changes in hydro, wind (both on- and off-shore) and solar PV electricity output. Results of the impacts of six scenarios on the European energy system are presented, and the implications for European energy security and energy imports are presented. Main findings include: demand side impacts (heating and cooling in the residential and services sector) are larger than supply side impacts; power generation from fossil-fuel and nuclear sources decreases and renewable energy increases; and impacts are larger in Southern Europe than in Northern Europe. There remain many more climate change impacts on the energy sector that cannot currently be captured due to a variety of issues including: lack of climate data, difficulties translating climate data into energy-system-relevant data, lack of detail in energy system models where climate impacts act. This paper does not attempt to provide an exhaustive analysis of climate change impacts in the energy sector, it is rather another step towards an increasing coverage of possible impacts.

This article examines similar television series from three regional public German broadcasting stations focusing respectively on the histories of Mitteldeutschland (Middle-Germany), Bayern (Bavaria) and Brandenburg.

In Turkey, with growing demand in electricity consumption and incentives offered for natural gas fired electricity generation, CO2 emissions sourced from electric power industry had tripled over the last two decades. Current governmental strategy focuses on energy security and resource diversity in a growing economy and does not articulate sufficient mitigation targets and appropriate regulations. In this research, an original dynamic simulation model is built, validated and analyzed to explore the options for carbon mitigation in Turkish electric power industry. Model structure represents the investment, dispatch and pricing heuristics as well as the natural resource base of electricity generation in Turkey. It operates on annual basis over 30 years to simulate installed capacities and generations of power plants with alternative resources and their resulting CO2 emissions. The analysis presented in this paper reveals that there are mitigation options below 50% of business as usual growth, with common policy options such as feed-in-tariffs, investment subsidies and carbon taxes. The model can serve as an experimental platform for further analysis of problems related to carbon mitigation in Turkish electricity sector. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

But a 2003 law mandates the closure of Belgium's nuclear power plants at a service age of 40 years; only force majeure could lift the strict obligation. Opposition to the law argued with climate change danger, financial losses, and loss-of-load risks. The financial issue got interwoven with a fuzzy debate on the definition, height and appropriation of nuclear rents. As plausible hypothesis is adopted: the prospected transfer of hundreds millions of euro from power companies to the public interest will create public support for life extension. But the nuclear rents discussion had faded in July 2012 when the Belgian government admitted a 10-year life extension for TIHANGE I (962 MW) and imposed the closure of the 2 x 433 MW DOEL I and II. Loss-of-load risk was the government's only public argument. The opacity of the decision process and its fifty-fifty outcome do not allow proper testing of the hypothesis. The case illustrates that politicians cannot bind their followers except through the deployment of alternative power sources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The emission and energy reductions are estimated for speed reductions of 10%, 20%, and 30%. The CATCH (cost of averting a tonne of CO2-eq heating) model is applied to evaluate the cost efficiency of speed reduction. Results show that speed reductions of 10%, 20%, and 30% reduce fuel consumption by 27.1%, 48.8%, and 60.3% and CO2 emissions by 19%, 36%, and 51%, respectively. Speed reduction leads to emission reductions, with greater reductions for larger ships. CATCH values are positive, indicating that reducing speed increases cost. Line C3 of Capesize is used to determine the optimal ship number and operational speed under energy conservation. The minimum number of vessels in service is 9, with an average operational speed of 14.53 knots and one port call per week. If speed is reduced by 10%, 20%, and 30%, one, two, and four additional ships are needed, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Similarly, sector emissions are factored by travel distance, vehicle fuel intensity and fuel GHG (carbon) intensity. Analyzing these factors using US and China data reveals that for a broad range of conditions, stringent GHG emissions limits for the auto sector imply limits of comparable stringency for fuel carbon intensity. However, carbon intensity is a modeled representation of complex energy supply and use systems rather than a measurable property of fuels themselves. Carefully examining the locations and magnitudes of fuel-related emissions indicates that the proper policy focus is on the sectors that supply fuel rather than the choice of fuels in the auto sector. Therefore, beyond fundamental R&D, policies to commercialize AFVs are not necessarily required for climate protection at present. In addition to managing travel demand and improving vehicle efficiency, the implied policy priority is limiting net GHG impacts in the energy and other natural resource sectors that supply fuels. Future work is needed to develop GHG management protocols for liquid fuel supply systems involving fungible commodities and dynamic global supply chains. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

By exploring technology-specific solutions in all major sectors of the Chinese economy, we find that a combination of measures, underpinned by low-carbon power options based on a mix of renewables, nuclear and carbon capture and storage, would fundamentally transform the Chinese energy system, when combined with increasing electrification of demand-side sectors.

The proposed approach can isolate the effects of changes in GDP composition and energy supply composition on the change of carbon emissions. In addition, it is capable of identifying the effects of changes in different input ratios, which may be very important if there are substitution effects among different inputs. Moreover, the proposed model can measure the effects of changes in good and bad output technical efficiencies. Consequently, this decomposition technique allows a change of carbon emissions to be decomposed into contributions from ten factors, which provides more insights for policy makers. We apply this model to decompose carbon emissions in 25 OECD counties and China. For the sample countries as a whole, the empirical results indicate that the economic growth is the crucial driver to carbon emissions increase, while the changes in GDP composition and capital-energy ratio are two main drivers to carbon emissions reduction. In particular, we discuss in detail the driving forces of China's carbon emissions change in order to propose some valuable policy implications for China from an international perspective.

However, due to intensive energy consumption and dependence on fossil fuels, industrial parks have become the main areas for greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it is critical to quantify their carbon footprints so that appropriate emission reduction policies can be raised. The objective of this paper is to seek an appropriate method on evaluating the carbon footprint of one industrial park. The tiered hybrid LCA method was selected due to its advantages over other methods. Shenyang Economic and Technological Development Zone (SETDZ), a typical comprehensive industrial park in China, was chosen as a case study park. The results show that the total life cycle carbon footprint of SETDZ was 15.29 Mt, including 6.81 Mt onsite (direct) carbon footprint, 8.47 Mt upstream carbon footprint, and only 3201 t downstream carbon footprint. Analysis from industrial sector perspectives shows that chemical industry and manufacture of general purpose machinery and special purposes machinery sector were the two largest sectors for life cycle carbon footprint. Such a sector analysis may be useful for investigation of appropriate emission reduction policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecuador is a small oil producer and exporter with significant renewable (mainly hydropower) resources, hosting some of the richest biodiversity areas in the world, part of which are inhabited by so far indigenous un-contacted people. Being a developing country, tensions arise between conservation aims and development imperatives, as well as between resource nationalism and much-needed foreign financing. However, the really limiting factor for the country's energy development seems to be its constraints in financing the government's development and redistributive policies. Resorting to Chinese loans-for-oil may be part of the solution in the short term, but it does not substitute fora more consistent energy policy. Ecuador's case illustrates the dilemmas of energy policy in natural resource-rich developing countries when confronted with diverging political economy, social, environmental and macro-financial goals.

The literature provides evidence of their magnitude as well as of the role of certain factors in explaining the unemployment gap between regions. Most of these studies, however, adopt an aggregate approach and so do not account for the individual characteristics in each region. This paper, by drawing on micro-data from the Spanish wave of the Labour Force Survey, seeks to remedy this shortcoming. An appropriate decomposition of the regional gap in the average probability of being unemployed enables us to distinguish between the contribution of differences in the regional distribution of individual characteristics from that attributable to a different impact of these characteristics.","[Lopez-Bazo, Enrique] European Commiss, JRC, IPTS, E-41092 Seville, Spain; [Lopez-Bazo, Enrique; Motellon, Elisabet] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Spanish Econ, AQR IREA, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain; [Motellon, Elisabet] Univ Oberta Catalunya, E-08035 Barcelona, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); University of Barcelona; UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,"López-Bazo, E (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC, IPTS, C Inca Garcilaso 3, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",elopez@ub.edu; emotellon@uoc.edu,"Lopez-Bazo, Enrique/AAY-3187-2020; Motellon, Elisabet/L-2352-2014","Lopez-Bazo, Enrique/0000-0002-4654-8237; Motellon, Elisabet/0000-0002-5461-2825",,,,,37,19,19,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

However, the great variation in the outcomes reported makes the drawing of any definitive conclusions difficult. Given this situation, a meta-analysis serves as an excellent tool to discover which characteristics of the various markets analyzed, and which specific features of these studies, might account for these differences. In adopting such an approach, this paper shows how the particular segment of the industry analyzed, the characteristics of the data, the years under review, the type of publication and the introduction of control variables might explain this heterogeneity in results. The paper concludes on these grounds that increased competition may significantly reduce the possibility of occurrence of asymmetric behavior. These results should be taken into consideration therefore in future studies of asymmetries in the oil industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we describe the rhetoric of resistance to wood heater regulation amongst citizens in the regional Australian town of Armidale, where wood smoke levels regularly exceed national health advisory limits. We discuss how this is related to particular sources of resistance, such as affective attachment to wood heating and sociocultural norms. The research draws on six focus groups with participants from households with and without wood heating. With reference to practice theory, we argue that citizen discourses favouring wood burning draw upon a rich suite of justifications and present this activity as a natural and traditional activity promoting comfort and cohesion. Such discourses also emphasise the identity of the town as a rural community and the supposed gemeinschaft qualities of such places. We show that, in this domain of energy policy, it is not enough to present 'facts' which have little emotional association or meaning for the populace. Rather, we need understand how social scripts, often localised, inform identity and practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that a pure strategy Nash equilibrium in price competition always exists for all location pairs and guarantees uniqueness if we utilize a coalition-proof refinement introduced by Bernheim et al. (J Econ Theory 42:1-12, 1987). Decreasing returns to scale reduce the profit a firm can capture through price undercutting and stabilize the price equilibrium due to the increasing average production cost of firms. As a consequence, duopoly firms agglomerating at the center of a line are shown to be at the unique location equilibrium.

A composite cost function model, using a panel data set, is used for this study. The data set consists of nine electric power companies from 1990 to 2008. Based upon the estimation results, this study examines whether economies of scale and vertical economies exist in the industry. Then, this study conducts a cost subadditivity test that is a necessary condition of natural monopoly. The empirical results indicate that the electric power firms exhibit the status of economies of scale in their transmissions and distributions and the operation as a whole. However, they do not exhibit economies of scale in their generations. Thus, the transmission operation, by integration, in a large area can improve its economic efficiency. Furthermore, the industry should introduce more competition in both generation and wholesale power markets where more firms can participate in their power trades. This study also empirically confirms that vertical economies have existed in the industry. Moreover, this study confirms that all the estimates in the cost subadditivity test satisfy the necessary condition of natural monopoly, where each estimate indicates cost saving in cost subadditivity. The test does not guarantee a sufficient condition of natural monopoly. However, it clearly indicates that the functional separation between generation and transmission will increase total production cost in the industry. The complete separation may result in a net loss of economic efficiency if a competition benefit does not exceed an expected economic loss. Consequently, this study suggests that the industrial structure of future Japanese electric power industry should be evaluated from not only an expected benefit by introducing competition but also an unbundling cost that occurs with a loss of vertical integration.

However, there have been very few comparisons and decomposition analyses of the data underlying this increase in travel. This paper addresses this gap by (i) refining passenger transport data estimates, in particular improving existing estimates of passenger-kilometre data, (ii) comparing trends in Irish private car ownership, usage, and activity to international historical trajectories, and (iii) performing a decomposition analysis of Irish passenger transport using the Refined Laspeyres Method. The international comparison indicates that Ireland's per capita private car usage and car activity have followed intermediate trajectories relative to the historical paths of Sweden and the UK. These trajectories of car usage and activity have contributed to the growth in fuel use, and the Refined Laspeyres decomposition formally decomposes the factors accounting for this growth. Activity was the main driver of the increase in fuel use, although intensity also contributed significantly. Despite decreasing load factors and average annual distances in cars, activity has continued to rise each year. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Duro, JA",,,,"Antonio Duro, Juan",,,International mobility in carbon dioxide emissions,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inequality/mobility measures; Environmental distribution; Carbon emissions,INCOME MOBILITY; CO2 EMISSIONS; CONVERGENCE; EFFICIENT,"In this paper, we analyse the evolution of international mobility in per capita CO2 emissions for the period 1971-2007. This concept reveals the distribution's degree of entrenchment which is fundamentally different from other distribution concepts. In particular, we use several different synthetic mobility measures in order to capture the various perceptions of mobility proposed in the literature. This approach can be seen as complementary to the dynamics of distribution approach. The empirical analysis yields the following main results. First, the evolution observed varies according to the mobility index used. Second, when broader mobility indices are used, the most recent years analysed (i.e. 20002007) and the 1970s appear to be the most dynamic periods. Third, their decomposition reveals the major role played by the non-high income countries group. Fourth, the calculation of fictitious indices associated with the three major decomposition components of general mobility indicates that exchange (i.e. changes in position) and dispersion (i.e. distribution effects) have typically been the most important mobility factors.

Coalition stability is assessed under alternative assumptions concerning the pure rate of time preference, the aggregation of social welfare, and the severity of climate damages. The profitability, stability, and strong potential internal stability of a number of coalitions, those potentially effective in reducing GHG emissions, is explored in the paper. The main conclusion is that only the grand coalition, i.e. a coalition where all world regions cooperate to reduce emissions, can maintain GHG concentration below 550 ppm CO2-eq. However, this coalition is not internally stable, even when allowing for monetary transfers across world regions. Nonetheless, the paper also shows that strongly potentially internally stable coalitions exist, though of smaller size, which can mitigate global warming and limit GHG concentrations to 600 ppm CO2-eq.

Diesel vehicles have higher fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions than their gasoline counterparts. On a well-to-wheels per vehicle per km basis it has been estimated that diesel light-duty vehicles in 2015 will emit 14-27% less CO2 than their gasoline counterparts. We estimate here that on a gCO(2)/kWh at peak torque, diesel medium-duty vehicles currently have an approximately 10% CO2 advantage over their gasoline counterparts. At light and moderate loads the CO2 advantage for medium-duty diesels with SCR after-treatment will be greater than 10% (reflecting pumping losses when gasoline engines are operated at low and moderate loads). Emission of NOx, HCs, and PM from diesel (and gasoline) vehicles has decreased substantially over the past decade and further reductions,are anticipated in the future. In addition to the heavy-duty segment, which diesels currently dominate, modern diesel engines are likely to continue to play an important role in the medium-duty segment, and perhaps also in the light-duty segment in a transition to more sustainable mobility.

This research examines citizens' views on climate change and a number of energy systems, with a specific focus on the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a technology to address greenhouse gas emissions. An all-day workshop with 82 local participants was held in the city of Calgary in Alberta, Canada to explore the views of climate change, energy and CCS: Participants were provided the opportunity to ask experts questions and discuss in small groups their views of climate change policy and energy systems. Results demonstrate that participants' assessments of energy systems are influenced by social-political-institutional-economic contexts such as trust in industry and government, perception of parties benefiting from the technology, and tradeoffs between energy systems.

An example is the reform of China's method of dispatching power plants, which potentially affects the economic relationships between consumers and producers, between grid and generating companies, and between central and provincial governments. Historically, coal-fired power plants in China all received roughly the same number of operating hours, regardless of efficiency or cost. In 2007, Chinese government agencies began to pilot energy efficient dispatch, which requires that generators be dispatched on the basis of thermal efficiency. Using a case study of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China, we evaluated potential energy and cost savings from a change to energy efficient dispatch. We found that the savings are at best relatively small, because large, efficient generators already account for a significant share of total generation. Moreover, as an administrative policy that does not change economic incentives, energy efficient dispatch exacerbates imbalances and center-provincial tensions in the current system. We argue that incentive-based dispatch reform is likely to produce better outcomes, and that the keys to this reform are empowering an independent regulator with pricing authority and establishing a formal, transparent ratemaking process.

Based on the electrical output and embodied energy of a selection of fixed and tracking systems and including concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) and varying cell technology, we calculate a number of energy evaluation metrics, including the energy payback time (EPBT), energy return factor (ERF), and life-cycle CO2 emissions offset per unit aperture and land area. Studying these metrics in the context of a regionally limited setting, it was found that utilizing existing infrastructure such as existing building roofs and shade structures does significantly reduce the embodied energy requirements (by 20-40%) and in turn the EPBT of flat-plate PV systems due to the avoidance of energy-intensive balance of systems (BOS) components like foundations. Still, high-efficiency CPV field installations were found to yield the shortest EPBT, the highest ERF and the largest life-cycle CO2 offsets under the condition that land availability is not a limitation.

However, it will potentially cause a significant increase of electricity peak demand and have adverse consequences on the electricity system, in particular on distribution networks. This paper will address the benefits of various applications of smart network control and demand response technologies for enhancing the integration of these future load categories, and for improvements in operation management and efficient use of distribution network assets. A range of numerical simulations have been carried out on different distribution network topologies (rural and urban networks) to identify the need and the cost of network reinforcement required to accommodate future load under various operating strategies such as Business as Usual (passive demand and passive network) against the smart grid approach. Applications of smart Plug-in vehicle (PiV) charging, smart heat pumps, and optimised control of network voltage regulators to reduce network investment have been studied, and selected key results of our studies on evaluating the benefits of implementing these technologies for Great Britain's distribution networks are presented and discussed in this paper.

Previous research on energy use and energy efficiency has focused mainly on the diffusion of energy efficient technologies. The discrepancy between optimal and actual implementation of energy efficient technologies has been illustrated in numerous articles and is often referred to as the energy efficiency gap. However, efficient technologies are not the only ways to increase energy efficiency. Empirical studies have found that a cost-effective way to improve energy efficiency is to combine investments in energy-efficient technologies with continuous energy management practices. By including energy management into an estimated energy efficiency potential this paper introduces an extended energy efficiency gap, mainly in manufacturing industries and the commercial sector. The inclusion of energy management components in future energy policy will play an important role if the energy savings targets for 2020, and later 2050, are to be met in the EU.

The results indicate no market integration between SEM and other European markets except for Elspot and GB. We show that the current state of market integration between SEM and GB is just 17% indicating potential to improve market integration via increased interconnector capacity.

By applying a dispatch strategy that minimizes the balancing energy needs for a given storage size, the interplay between storage and balancing is quantified, providing a hard upper limit on their synergy. An efficient but relatively small storage reduces balancing energy needs significantly due to its influence on intra-day mismatches. Furthermore, we show that combined with a low-efficiency hydrogen storage and a level of balancing equal to what is today provided by storage lakes, it is sufficient to meet the European electricity demand in a fully renewable power system where the average power generation from combined wind and solar exceeds the demand by only a few percent.

One source that has received considerable attention in Europe, but very little in Canada, is the energy crop miscanthus. This study examines the economic feasibility of miscanthus from a Canadian perspective. A net present value approach is used to determine the breakeven price of miscanthus production in Ontario. Based on assumptions specific to Ontario regarding miscanthus production, input costs, and opportunity costs associated with alternative land use, the breakeven price is estimated to be $88.02/t. To account for uncertainty inherent in the imposed assumptions, sensitivity analysis is conducted on various life cycle factors, yield, and cost components. The results of this analysis indicate a range of breakeven prices from $77.79 to $105.08/t. These results are then applied to Ontario's greenhouse industry, where the cost of energy derived from miscanthus is found to be competitive with the costs of current non-renewable energy sources.

Importantly, we disentangle the dynamics of conditional volatility and conditional skewness in a coherent way. Our approach allows current asset returns to be asymmetric conditional on current factors and past information, which we term contemporaneous asymmetry. Conditional skewness is an explicit combination of the conditional leverage effect and contemporaneous asymmetry. We derive analytical formulas for various return moments that are used for generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. Applying our approach to S&P500 index daily returns and option data, we show that one- and two-factor SVS models provide a better fit for both the historical and the risk-neutral distribution of returns, compared to existing affine generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH), and stochastic volatility with jumps (SVJ) models. Our results are not due to an overparameterization of the model: the one-factor SVS models have the same number of parameters as their one-factor GARCH competitors and less than the SVJ benchmark.","[Feunou, Bruno] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada; [Tedongap, Romeo] Stockholm Sch Econ, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tedongap, Romeo] Swedish House Finance, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Bank of Canada; Stockholm School of Economics; Swedish House of Finance,"Feunou, B (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",feun@bankofcanada.ca; Romeo.Tedongap@hhs.se,"Tédongap, Roméo/JQV-4545-2023","Tédongap, Roméo/0000-0002-2213-6430; Feunou, Bruno/0000-0001-8023-0161",,,,,41,17,18,0,16,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

In this paper energy use from all industrial sectors in China's economy of 2007 was explored by conducting an extended environmental input-output analysis. We compare the energy consumption embodied in the final demand for goods and services from 29 sectors with the energy demand required for the actual production process in each sector. Two different viewpoints for sectoral energy use have been presented: energy use is directly allocated to the producer entity, and energy use is reallocated to sector's supply chain from consumption perspective. Our results show that considerable amount of energy use is embodied in the supply chain, especially for Construction and Other Service Activities sectors, which is not detected if energy use is allocated on a production basis. When further dividing embodied energy consumption into direct energy consumption and indirect energy consumption, total indirect energy consumption is much higher than that of total direct energy consumption, accounting for 80.6% of total embodied energy consumption in 2007. Our results provide a more holistic picture on sectoral energy consumption and therefore can help decision-makers make more appropriate policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper uses a unique data set to explore one alternative measure of fuel poverty based on whether consumers feel able to afford their energy, similar to one introduced by the government a few years ago. We explore the links between an expenditure based and our subjective measure of fuel poverty and compare these differences with those between official measures. Amongst low income households, 28% spent more than a tenth of their income on energy in the home, and so would be likely to qualify as fuel poor under the most usual definition; but only 16% felt unable to afford sufficient energy to keep their homes warm. Amongst this group who felt they had difficulty in affording sufficient energy, less than half were 'expenditure' fuel poor.

Total energy consumption, including space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting and other household appliances, was simulated by considering building construction and materials, equipment and appliances, local climates and occupancy patterns. The model was used to analyse energy use by private dwellings in more than five thousand CCDs in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The predicted results focus on electricity consumption (natural gas and other fuel sources were excluded as the data are not available) and track the actual electricity consumption at CCD level with an error of 9.2% when summed to state level. For NSW and Victoria 2006, the predicted state electricity consumption is close to the published model (within 6%) and statistical data (within 10%). A key feature of the model is that it can be used to predict hourly electricity consumption and peak demand at fine geographic scales, which is important for grid planning and designing local energy efficiency or demand response strategies.

Using a vector autoregression framework and a modified version of the Granger (1969) causality test proposed by Toda and Yamamoto (J.

The variance decomposition analysis report that urban population and coal affect electricity production variability over the forecast period.

Maximising the use of the cross-border interconnection capacity, market coupling increases the level of market integration and facilitates the access to low-cost generation by consumers located in high-cost generation countries. Thus, it is expected that a high-priced area such as Italy could greatly benefit from the introduction of this mechanism.

Findings indicate that opposition to nuclear power was strong, and only a small number of respondents endorsed it by listing it in their top two choices. Conversely, almost two-thirds of the sample endorsed investment in renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar), and only a small minority was opposed to it. Econometric analyses revealed that knowledge of the climate change problem was a common factor that explained endorsement of both nuclear and renewables. Yet, high levels of concern for the environment and a negative perception regarding its future differentiated the endorsers of renewables from those of nuclear energy. Endorsers of nuclear energy were found to be males who were knowledgeable about climate change and engaged in environmental issues, but less concerned about the environment, and optimistic about its future. Nuclear opponents, on the other hand, were found to be concerned about the environment, pessimistic about its future, and not fully relying on technology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In these programs tax exemptions are granted if the participating firms carry out energy efficiency measures following an energy audit. We employ a panel data set of 19 pulp and paper firms, and estimate both the own- and cross-price elasticities of electricity demand as well as the impact of knowledge accumulation following private R&D on electricity use. The empirical results show that electricity use in the Swedish pulp and paper industry is relatively own-price insensitive, and the self-reported electricity savings following the voluntary so-called PEE program support the notion of important information asymmetries at the company level. However, the results display that already in a baseline setting pulp and paper firms tend to invest in private R&D that have electricity saving impacts, and our model simulations suggest that up to about one-third of the industry sector's self-reported electricity savings in PEE could be attributable to pure baseline effects. Future evaluations of voluntary energy efficiency programs must increasingly recognize the already existing incentives to reduce energy use in energy-intensive industries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The European Commission wishes to strengthen this financial regulation of energy trade. It has put forward a set of regulatory proposals aimed at stabilizing financial markets and limiting volatility of energy prices. The most noteworthy are EMIR, MAD, REMIT and the revised MiFID. Key elements are transparency, new trading venues, central clearing obligations and mandatory transaction reporting. This article evaluates the likely outcomes for energy markets, given the new incentives for market parties. It argues that although there is no ground to exempt particular energy market participants such as energy companies from financial legislation, increased regulation will not necessarily bring about the effects the Commission desires. The causal link between derivatives trading and volatility of energy prices is not known precisely and many of the economic effects of the proposed legislation are theoretically and empirically ambiguous. Moreover, potentially conflicting instruments and objectives risk policy inconsistency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposal is based on the management problems verified in most of this kind of renewable hybrid systems installed in Brazil. The main idea is the implementation of a pre-paid metering system with some control functions that directly act on the consumer demand, restricting the consumption proportionally to the monthly availability of renewable energy. The result is a better distribution of the electricity consumption by month and by consumer, preventing that only one user, with larger purchasing power, consumes all the renewable energy available at some time period. The proportionality between the consumption and the renewable energy's availability has the objective to prevent a lack of energy stored and a high use of the diesel generator-set on months of low renewable potential. This paper also aims to contribute to the Brazilian regulation of renewable energy systems supplying micro-grids. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Blasques, L. C. M.; Pinho, J.

One year of detailed market simulations are undertaken to determine the impact on wholesale electricity prices, system operation costs and CO2 emissions with and without this installed wave power under a number carbon prices assumptions. In both scenarios (with and without wave energy), Ireland's installed renewable capacity is fixed such that 40% of Ireland's electricity in 2020 is from renewable source. The likely revenue a wave energy device would earn in the market is also investigated and compared with what is required to achieve 500 MW installed capacity. It is shown that in general the inclusion of wave energy has a negligible effect on wholesale electricity prices, reduces total system cost in Ireland and can increase CO2 emissions on the island of Ireland under certain carbon price assumptions. It is also shown the current REFIT for wave energy is adequate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Deane, J. P.; Gallachoir, B. P.

Furthermore we consider an upstream industry of RES-E equipment producers engaged in learning by doing. We show that a first-best policy requires two instruments, a tax in the fossil-fuel sector and an output subsidy for RES-E equipment producers. We then study second-best-optimal feed-in tariffs that are paid to the generators of RES-E.

While both instruments provide opportunities for misrepresenting actual pollution, enforcement of international price-based instruments is additionally hampered by potential fiscal cushioning, i.e. an adjustment of domestic fiscal policies offsetting the tax incentive to reduce emission reductions. The present paper extends the formal debate on Prices vs. Quantities by including the risk of fiscal cushioning. We find the level of the marginal benefit curve and the variance of costs become key elements for instrument choice and can render quantity regulations strictly preferable. Remarkably, in the latter case, the slopes of the marginal curves do not affect optimal instrument choice. Numerical calculations, using data taken from the international climate policy context, support the potential dominance of quantity regulations found in our formal analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the comparison of copula densities, the test is easy to implement because it does not involve a weighting function in the test statistic, and it can be applied in general settings since there is no restriction on the dimension of the time series data. In fact, to apply the test, only a bandwidth is needed for the nonparametric copula. We prove that the test statistic is asymptotically pivotal under the null hypothesis, establishes local power properties, and motivates the validity of the bootstrap technique that we use in finite sample settings. A simulation study illustrates the size and power properties of the test. We illustrate the practical relevance of our test by considering two empirical applications where we examine the Granger noncausality between financial variables. In a first application and contrary to the general findings in the literature, we provide evidence on two alternative mechanisms of nonlinear interaction between returns and volatilities: nonlinear leverage and volatility feedback effects. This can help better understand the well known asymmetric volatility phenomenon. In a second application, we investigate the Granger causality between stock index returns and trading volume. We find convincing evidence of linear and nonlinear feedback effects from stock returns to volume, but a weak evidence of nonlinear feedback effect from volume to stock returns.","[Bouezmarni, Taoufik] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Math, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Rombouts, Jeroen V.

The use of locally renewable energy resources and the implementation of energy efficiency measures could make a significant contribution to their economic development by reducing fossil fuel imports. An electrification of vehicles has been suggested as a way to both reduce pollutant emissions and increase security of supply of the transportation sector by reducing the dependence on oil products imports and facilitate the accommodation of renewable electricity generation, such as wind and, in the case of volcanic islands like Sao Miguel (Azores) of the geothermal energy whose penetration has been limited by the valley electricity consumption level. In this research, three scenarios of EV penetration were studied and it was verified that, for a 15% LD fleet replacement by EVs with 90% of all energy needs occurring during the night, the accommodation of 10 MW of new geothermal capacity becomes viable. Under this scenario, reductions of 8% in electricity costs, 14% in energy, 23% in fossil fuels use and CO2 emissions for the transportation and electricity production sectors could be expected.

Exploiting intermittent renewable energy resources demands power system planning models with high temporal and spatial resolution. We use a mixed-integer linear programming model - SWITCH - to analyze least-cost generation, storage, and transmission capacity expansion for western North America under various policy and cost scenarios. Current renewable portfolio standards are shown to be insufficient to meet emission reduction targets by 2030 without new policy. With stronger carbon policy consistent with a 450 ppm climate stabilization scenario, power sector emissions can be reduced to 54% of 1990 levels by 2030 using different portfolios of existing generation technologies. Under a range of resource cost scenarios, most coal power plants would be replaced by solar, wind, gas, and/or nuclear generation, with intermittent renewable sources providing at least 17% and as much as 29% of total power by 2030. The carbon price to induce these deep carbon emission reductions is high, but, assuming carbon price revenues are reinvested in the power sector, the cost of power is found to increase by at most 20% relative to business-as-usual projections.

Using a mixed-method, both quantitative and qualitative approach, this study finds that barriers to energy efficiency can be interpreted as strategic drivers for the emergence of five forms of voluntary and mandated program forms. We argue that the links between energy efficiency programs in commercial buildings should be conceptualized in a comprehensive manner by evaluating the strategic drivers that have ultimately led to the emergence of the principal forms of voluntary programs: economic incentives; certifications; alliances and partnerships; and internal company programs. We develop a conceptual framework that helps building owners and managers: identify the primary drivers for energy efficiency efforts; assess the efficacy and limitations of available program forms; apply each program form strategically in conjunction with a number of other program forms; and, ultimately, predict the emergence of new program forms.

The innovation mode in China began with imitative innovation, then transitioned to cooperative innovation, and has more recently set its sights on attaining truly indigenous innovation. Public policy serves as a key driving force for the evolution of innovation modes, as well as the development of the market. The policy focus has evolved in the following sequence: 1. building the foundation for technological innovation; 2. encouraging technology transfer; 3. enhancing local R&D and manufacturing capabilities; 4. enlarging the domestic market; and 5. cultivating an open environment for global competition and sustainable market development in China.

The empirical results are discussed in relation to the reported outcomes of the Swedish voluntary energy efficiency programme PFE. The estimated electricity efficiency gap is relatively stable over the time period; it equals roughly 1 TWh per year for the sample mills and this is three times higher than the corresponding self-reported electricity savings in PFE. This result is largely a reflection of the fact that in the pulp and paper industry electricity efficiency improvements are typically embodied in the diffusion of new capital equipment, and there is a risk that some of the reported measures in PFE simply constitute an inefficient speed-up of capital turnover. The above does not preclude, though, that many other measures in PFE may have addressed some relevant market failures and barriers in the energy efficiency market. Overall the analysis suggests that future energy efficiency programs could plausibly be better targeted at explicitly promoting technological progress as well as at addressing the most important information and behaviour-related failures.

We examine the patterns of diffusion of renewable energy technologies in the BRICS, the factors associated with their diffusion, and the incentives provided by the Kyoto mechanisms. Preliminary analysis suggests that the Kyoto mechanisms may be supporting the spread of existing technologies, regardless if such technologies are still closely tied to environmental un-sustainability, rather than the development and diffusion of more sustainable variants of renewable energy technologies. This raises questions about the incentives provided by the Kyoto mechanisms for the diffusion of cleaner variants of renewable energy technologies in the absence of indigenous technological efforts and capabilities in sustainable variants, and national policy initiatives to attract and build on Kyoto mechanism projects. We provide an empirical analysis using aggregated national data from the World Development Indicators, the International Energy Agency, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and secondary sources.

However, such systems usually imply the need for oversizing and considerable energy storage requirements leading to relatively high costs. On the other hand, hybrid configurations that may exploit both wind and solar potential of a given area may considerably reduce energy storage capacity and improve the economic performance of the system. In this context, an integrated techno-economic methodology for the evaluation of hybrid wind-photovoltaic stand-alone power systems is currently developed, aiming at the designation of optimum configurations for a typical remote consumer, using economic performance criteria. For the problem investigation, the developed evaluation model is applied to four representative areas of the Greek territory with different wind potential characteristics in order to obtain optimum configurations on the basis of minimum initial investment, 10-year and 20-year total cost. According to the results obtained, the proposed solution is favorably compared with all other stand-alone energy alternatives, reflecting the ability of hybrid systems to adjust even in areas where the local RES potential is not necessarily of high quality.

Factor analysis of selected variables from the 2005 U.S. Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) identified five lifestyle factors reflecting social and behavioral patterns associated with air conditioning, laundry usage, personal computer usage, climate zone of residence, and TV use. These factors were also estimated for 2001 RECS data. Multiple regression analysis using the lifestyle factors yields solutions accounting for approximately 40% of the variance in electricity consumption for both years. By adding the household and market characteristics of income, local electricity price and access to natural gas, variance accounted for is increased to approximately 54%. Income contributed similar to 1% unique variance to the models, indicating that lifestyle factors reflecting social and behavioral patterns better account for consumption differences than income. Geographic segmentation of factor scores shows distinct clusters of consumption and lifestyle factors, particularly in suburban locations. The implications for tailored policy and planning interventions are discussed in relation to lifestyle issues. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the UK, various macro-economic and energy system wide, top-down models are used to explore the potential for energy demand and carbon emissions reduction in the transport sector. These models can lack the bottom-up, sectoral detail needed to simulate the effects of integrated demand and supply-side policy strategies to reduce emissions. Bridging the gap between short-term forecasting and long-term scenario models, this paper introduces a newly developed strategic transport, energy, emissions and environmental impacts model, the UK Transport Carbon Model (UKTCM). The UKTCM covers the range of transport-energy-environment issues from socio-economic and policy influences on energy demand reduction through to life cycle carbon emissions and external costs. The model is demonstrated in this paper by presenting the results of three single policies and one policy package scenario. Limitations of the model are also discussed. Developed under the auspices of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) the UKTCM can be used to develop transport policy scenarios that explore the full range of technological, fiscal, regulatory and behavioural change policy interventions to meet UK climate change and energy security goals.

Consistent with theory and other analysts we find that the nonuniform treatment of emitting sectors in EU raises abatement costs - by a factor of two to three. Under cost effective emission reductions - a more comprehensive tradable cap electricity generation abates more than its proportional share in emissions. The European economy abates by substitution towards natural gas, by energy efficiency improvements, and by reductions in emission intensive manufactures. Applied policies such as renewable support - and responses such as carbon leakage - hold down the prices for emission and electricity, thus also holds down incentives for energy efficiency and technological change. This leads to little preparation for the future and global mitigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As with any infrastructural development: wind farms must consider potential environmental impacts prior to construction. One particular issue that must be examined is the emission of noise from the development. In Ireland wind farm developments must adhere to planning conditions that usually outline permissible noise levels for both the construction and operational phases of the development. The critical wind speed is often cited as the wind speed at which these limits apply. This paper examines how the critical wind speed is determined and investigates its relationship with background noise levels and turbine choice. The study consisted of ten one-week monitoring periods during which meteorological conditions and background noise levels were simultaneously recorded. It was found that the critical wind speed is non-transferable, i.e. it depends on both the turbine choice and background noise environment and is specific to that particular turbine/site combination. Furthermore the critical wind speed during the night-time is often different to the overall critical wind speed suggesting that future noise studies should consider a range of critical wind speeds, particularly for night-time noise assessments.

The mistrust on the ability of the market, left to its own devices, to provide sufficient generation availability when needed, is more and more leading to the implementation of additional regulatory mechanisms. This matter is undoubtedly gaining importance and it has taken a key role in the energy regulators' agendas. In this paper, we revisit this discussion under the light of thirty years of electricity market experience.

Regional responses to recession: the role of the West Midlands Regional Taskforce, Regional Studies. Regional taskforces were set up across the English regions in late 2008 in response to the most severe recession since the Second World War. This paper examines the role of one such body, the West Midlands Regional Taskforce, as an example of regional response to recession, and offers potential lessons for the future in dealing with such situations. In so doing it reflects on the contested concept of regional 'resilience' and its relevance for policy actions at the regional level. Understanding how the region responded in this way could help in maintaining a 'permanent capacity' to deal with shocks, especially in the context of the abolition of regional development agencies (RDAs) in England from 2012 and their replacement with local enterprise partnerships (LEPs).","[Bailey, David] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Berkeley, Nigel] Coventry Business Sch, SURGE, Coventry, W Midlands, England",Aston University; Coventry University,"Bailey, D (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",D.Bailey@aston.ac.uk; N.Berkeley@coventry.ac.uk,,"Bailey, David/0000-0002-1956-0556; Berkeley, Nigel/0000-0001-9727-243X",,,,,26,31,33,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Fuel switching is often considered as the main short-term abatement measure under the EU ETS. It consists in substituting combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) for hard-coal plants in power generation. Thereby coal plants run for shorter periods, and CO2 emissions are reduced. This paper provides the first theoretical analysis of fuel switching, in a context where power plants involved are not equally efficient. We begin with a preliminary work using illustrative examples and sensitivity analyses, which enables us to observe how differences in the efficiency of power plants impact the cost of fuel switching, and how this is related to the level of switching effort. Based on this, we build a theoretical model taking into account the effect of differences in the of power plants involved in fuel switching. We also efficiency investigate the effect of the timing of fuel switching abatements, within the temporally defined environment of our dynamic model. Results demonstrate that the gas price and uncontrolled CO2 emissions act together on the carbon price. We show that the influence of the gas price on the carbon price depends on the level of uncontrolled CO2 emissions, due to heterogeneity of power plants that are used in the fuel switching process. Furthermore, we show that the time of occurrence of uncontrolled emissions matters so that shocks have a stronger impact when they occur in a period that is closed to the end of the phase.

We compared quantitatively the sustainability of two 'future-mapping' exercises (the 'Governmental' scenario, which relies on fossil fuels, and the Greenpeace scenario, which emphasises renewable energy and excludes nuclear power). The comparison was based on a range of environmental and technological perspectives, and contrasted against two additional nuclear scenarios that instead envisage a dominant role for nuclear energy. Sustainability metrics included energy costs, external costs (greenhouse-gas emissions, air pollutants, land transformation, water consumption and discharge, and safety) and additional costs. The nuclear-centred scenarios yielded the lowest total cost per unit of final energy consumption by 2050 ($14.37 GJ(-1)), whereas the Greenpeace scenario has the highest ($25.36 GJ(-1)). We used probabilistic simulations based on multi-factor distributional sampling of impact and cost metrics to estimate the overlapping likelihoods among scenarios to understand the effect of parameter uncertainty on the integrated recommendations. Our simulation modelling implies that, despite inherent uncertainties, pursuing a large-scale expansion of nuclear-power capacity offers the most sustainable pathway for South Korea, and that adopting a nuclear-free pathway will be more costly and produce more greenhouse-gas emissions.

Nevertheless, these studies usually ignore the impacts generated by the upstream mining works. This paper contributes to existing literature and attempts to fill this gap by exploring the externalities of lignite mining owing to the emission of suspended particulate matter. To this end, a 'bottom-up' approach is implemented, using as case study the largest operational lignite surface mine at the Lignite Center of Western Macedonia (Greece). The results indicate that annual air pollution externalities of lignite mining are of the order of 3 (sic)/ton of lignite, which corresponds to around 5.0 (sic)/MW h. The estimated costs are significantly lower, i.e. up to 80%, when dust deposition is considered in air dispersion models. In any case, these findings should be seen as a starting point for discussion owing to the lack of specific emission rates for Greek lignite mines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Not much is known about what drives entrepreneurship in unstable environments characterized by significant institutional changes that affect the availability of entrepreneurial opportunities. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on post-communist regions in which start-up activity was basically nonexistent under socialism, but significantly more in evidence after the institutional shock of introducing a market economy. It is argued and shown that the allocation of talent into productive entrepreneurship is higher in areas abundantly endowed with individuals who have a relatively high ability to detect viable entrepreneurial opportunities, as indicated by their qualification, and in regions home to a population that is characterized by a high alertness toward opportunities, as indicated by remnants of an entrepreneurial culture that predates socialism. How institutional context affects entrepreneurship over the course of transition is reflected by the negative relationship between urbanization and entrepreneurship that presumably has to do with ill-devised socialist urban planning policies. The regional application of the theory on institutions and entrepreneurship outlined in this paper shows that an entrepreneurial rebound after an adverse large-scale shock accompanied by massive structural change and economic dislocation is most pronounced in areas with a strong human capital basis and a regional culture that favors entrepreneurship.","Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Wyrwich, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",michael.wyrwich@uni-jena.de,,,,,,,95,6,6,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This price discrepancy stems primarily from differences in non-hardware or soft costs between the two countries, which can only in part be explained by differences in cumulative market size and associated learning. A survey of German PV installers was deployed to collect granular data on PV soft costs in Germany, and the results are compared to those of a similar survey of U.S. PV installers. Non-module hardware costs and all analyzed soft costs are lower in Germany, especially for customer acquisition, installation labor, and profit/overhead costs, but also for expenses related to permitting, interconnection, and inspection procedures. Additional costs occur in the United States due to state and local sales taxes, smaller average system sizes, and longer project-development times. To reduce the identified additional costs of residential PV systems, the United States could introduce policies that enable a robust and lasting market while minimizing market fragmentation. Regularly declining incentives offering a transparent and certain value proposition combined with simple interconnection, permitting, and inspection requirements might help accelerate PV cost reductions in the United States.

While PV technologies provide the environmental benefit of zero emissions during use, the use of heavy metals in thin-film PV cells raises important health and environmental concerns regarding the end-of-life disposal of PV panels. To date, there is no published quantitative assessment of the potential human health risk due to cadmium leaching from cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV panels disposed in a landfill. Thus, we used a screening-level risk assessment tool to estimate possible human health risk associated with disposal of CdTe panels into landfills. In addition, we conducted a literature review of potential cadmium release from the recycling process in order to contrast the potential health risks from PV panel disposal in landfills to those from PV panel recycling. Based on the results of our literature review, a meaningful risk comparison cannot be performed at this time. Based on the human health risk estimates generated for PV panel disposal, our assessment indicated that landfill disposal of CdTe panels does not pose a human health hazard at current production volumes, although our results pointed to the importance of CdTe PV panel end-of-life management.

J,"Keutiben, O",,,,"Keutiben, Octave",,,On capturing foreign oil rents,RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exhaustible resources; Tariff; Oil rent; Differential game; Open loop; Stackelberg equilibrium; Spatial model,TARIFFS; CONSISTENCY; ECONOMICS; RESOURCES,"A common assumption in the literature on tariff and exhaustible resources is that no stocks of the resource are available within the importing country's borders and therefore the importing country is not itself a producer. Reality is in fact quite different: there are many instances of countries that are simultaneously importers and producers of an exhaustible energy resource. This paper makes use of a spatial trade model that departs from this restriction and examines the rent-extracting tariff in a more general framework where the importing country is allowed to have access to a stock of the resource of its own and to determine simultaneously the optimal tariff and the rate of depletion of its own stock. Allowing the importing country to hold some resource deposits reduces the available rent to foreign producers and, in essence, reinforces the ability of the importer to capture the foreign rent. In effect, the optimal tariff is shown to be a decreasing function of the initial resource stock in the importing country. Interestingly, the paper identifies the spatial distribution of consumers as the primary reason of time-inconsistency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Centralized population and polycentric structures have only a moderate impact in our analyses. Given that household travel and residential energy use account for 42% of total U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, these findings highlight the importance of smart growth policies to build more compact and transit friendly cities as a crucial part of any strategic efforts to mitigate GHG emissions and to stabilize climate.
