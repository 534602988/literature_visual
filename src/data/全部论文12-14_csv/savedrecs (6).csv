When agents' beliefs or behaviors are developed by averaging what they see among their neighbors, then convergence to a consensus is slowed by the presence of homophily but is not influenced by network density (in contrast to other network processes that depend on shortest paths). In deriving these results, we propose a new, general measure of homophily based on the relative frequencies of interactions among different groups. An application to communication in a society before a vote shows how the time it takes for the vote to correctly aggregate information depends on the homophily and the initial information distribution.

The first objective is to investigate empirically the pattern of adjustment that UI users exhibit over a multiple claim horizon. Our secondary objective is to investigate a behavioural channel that might potentially underlie observed adjustment effects, namely, individual learning effects. We estimate an econometric model of how certain features of their claims change as they file subsequent claims. We find strong empirical patterns suggesting that there does appear to be some sort of an adjustment process; beneficiaries tend to approach a desired value for these particular facets of their UI claims. There appears to be some process of growing sophistication of UI use which some might label gaming the system reflecting the adjustment of claims and the concomitant employment patterns to the provisions and rules of the regime. We also uncover evidence in favour of the existence of individual learning effects.","[Gray, David] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [McDonald, Ted] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Econ, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of New Brunswick,"Gray, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",dmgray@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

While tax-induced labor supply distortions lead to overprovision of the public good, spouses' failure to internalize the collective effect of their choices points towards underprovision. A large parameter range exists for which a move from individual to joint taxation improves the welfare of both spouses. The source of Pareto-improvement consists in moving the level of the public good closer to its first-best, while an adjustment of intra-family transfers compensates the secondary earner for the increased tax load.

The cases of both partial and total relocation via foreign direct investment are separately considered. A simple international duopoly model highlights the differences between short-term and long-term effects. In the short-term no change in location is a likely outcome in very capital-intensive sectors and, when there is a strategy shift, this takes the form of partial rather than total relocation. In the long-run total relocation becomes a feasible outcome. However, when tighter mitigation measures are introduced by the larger country and unit transport cost is high, with a pronounced market asymmetry, the probability of firms not relocating abroad is high even in the long-term. The welfare implications of unilateral environmental measures are assessed considering global industrial pollution and accounting for shifts in location strategy.","[Sanna-Randaccio, Francesca; Sestini, Roberta] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Ingn Informat Automat & Gestionale A, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Sanna-Randaccio, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Ingn Informat Automat & Gestionale A, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",fsr@dis.uniroma1.it; sestini@dis.uniroma1.it,"Sestini, Roberta/F-3840-2011","SESTINI, Roberta/0000-0003-0497-9394",,,,,29,25,25,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Our results from both traditional cross-sectional regressions and first-differenced and system GMM estimators for dynamic panel data suggest that most traditional indicators of financial development are positively associated with economic growth. This result runs contrary to the existing conclusion that a state-ruled banking sector, such as that in China, hinders economic growth because of the distorting nature of the government. Since we focus on the years after China's accession to the World Trade Organization (yam in 2001 while the existing studies mainly covered the years before 2001, our finding suggests that the financial reforms that have taken place after China's accession to the WTO are in the right direction.

Agents have independent private values, which represent the maximum cost they are willing to sustain to obtain an object of unitary quality. The designer faces a trade-off between allocative efficiency and cost of screening, because the cost sustained is wasted. The optimal mechanism ranks agents based on their marginal contribution to social surplus and distributes objects to higher-ranked agents. The ranking is independent of the scarcity of objects or the extent of their heterogeneity. If the hazard rates of the distributions of values are increasing, agents are ranked according to their expected values. If hazard rates are decreasing and agents are symmetric, the objects are allocated to the agents that sustain the highest costs. In general, optimal mechanisms combine both pooling and screening of values. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A municipal government can be viewed as a hierarchy, whose stability over time depends on the degree of cooperation between and within ranks. We find that in municipalities headed by female mayors, the probability of early termination of the legislature is higher. This result persists and becomes stronger when we control for municipality fixed effects as well as for non-random sorting of women into municipalities using regression discontinuity in gender-mixed electoral races decided by a narrow margin. The likelihood that a female mayor survives until the end of her term is lowest when the council is entirely male and in regions with less favourable attitudes towards working women. This evidence is suggestive that group dynamics are an important factor in driving the gender difference. Other interpretations receive less support in the data. Our results may provide an alternative explanation for the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions.","[Gagliarducci, Stefano] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; [Paserman, M.

We focus on estimation by local linear regression, which was shown to have attractive properties (Porter, J. 2003, Estimation in the Regression Discontinuity Model (unpublished, Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin, Madison)). We derive the asymptotically optimal bandwidth under squared error loss. This optimal bandwidth depends on unknown functionals of the distribution of the data and we propose simple and consistent estimators for these functionals to obtain a fully data-driven bandwidth algorithm. We show that this bandwidth estimator is optimal according to the criterion of Li (1987, Asymptotic Optimality for C-p, C-L, Cross-validation and Generalized Cross-validation: Discrete Index Set, Annals of Statistics, 15, 958-975), although it is not unique in the sense that alternative consistent estimators for the unknown functionals would lead to bandwidth estimators with the same optimality properties. We illustrate the proposed bandwidth, and the sensitivity to the choices made in our algorithm, by applying the methods to a data set previously analysed by Lee (2008, Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House Elections, Journal of Econometrics, 142, 675-697) as well as by conducting a small simulation study.","[Imbens, Guido] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kalyanaraman, Karthik] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",Harvard University; University of London; University College London,"Imbens, G (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"imbens, guido/P-2333-2019",,,,,,31,954,958,8,153,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Investigating the norms the firms use to establish cooperation with clients and suppliers, it shows that the standardization of tasks facilitate arm's length interactions within the chain. The paper studies the distribution of risks in client-supplier pairs and concludes that their asymmetry in risk-taking may be indicative of relative importance that the risk takers assume within the pairs. Finally, the paper touches on the role that federal and provincial governments play in regulated segments of the chain and suggests that government-sponsored standardization may need to get reconciled with market practices.

Despite ever more marked deviations of leftist political platforms from the centralised model of the URSS, it is clear that self-management has not taken the place of central planning in Marxist plans for the future. In contrast, the author will come up with evidence that an analysis of the self-managed firm system may offer clues for a critical discussion of major points of Marxian theory, including the labour theory of value, alienation, dialectics or the subjectobject inversion in capitalism. Accordingly, in the individual sections of this paper each of these central aspects of Marxian theory will be separately addressed in the light of insights flowing from the economic theory of producer cooperatives.","Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, I-80132 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Jossa, B (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, Via Mezzocannone 16, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",bruiossa@unina.it,,,,,,,111,5,5,2,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In the electric power sector, nuclear power generation, which emits no carbon dioxide in the process of generating electricity, has come under scrutiny. However, this energy produces a new environmental issue: the disposal of radioactive waste. First, we derive shadow prices of carbon dioxide and low-level waste as marginal abatement costs in the case of the electric power sector in Japan, employing a directional output distance function. It is found that the shadow prices are US$39 per tonne for carbon dioxide and US $1531 per liter for low-level waste. Secondly, we calculate the indirect Morishima elasticity between carbon dioxide and low-level waste in order to identify their substitutability, and it is found that the substitution of low-level waste for carbon dioxide is easier than the reverse. This result suggests that, with the amount of generated electricity fixed, carbon dioxide can be substituted more easily by low-level waste when the relative price of carbon dioxide increases, for example, as a result of implementation of a carbon dioxide tax or an emissions trading system.

We propose a variant of log linear learning that is completely uncoupled and that selects an efficient (welfare-maximizing) pure Nash equilibrium in all generic n-person games that possess at least one pure Nash equilibrium. In games that do not have such an equilibrium, there is a simple formula that expresses the long-run probability of the various disequilibrium states in terms of two factors: (i) the sum of payoffs over all agents, and (ii) the maximum payoff gain that results from a unilateral deviation by some agent. This welfare/stability trade-off criterion provides a novel framework for analyzing the selection of disequilibrium as well as equilibrium states in n-person games. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Little has been said on the relationship between financing constraints and capital stock in the long run. This note focuses on this last issue. To keep the model tractable, we assume that the firm employs a single input, and this input is used as collateral. We get three main results. Firstly, we show that the optimal capital stock chosen by a firm is affected by financing constraints even when they are slack at the current time. Secondly, we show that the net present value of the potentially constrained firm is always smaller than the one of the never constrained firm. Finally, we find that in the presence of latent financing constraints the firm does not limit itself to reducing its investment when the upper limit is reached. What it actually does is to lower its long run optimal capital stock, amplifying the effects of constraints in the long run. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A simple back of the envelope comparison of the marginal costs and benefits of training policy suggests that the latter are higher than the former. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While a multitude of explanations for the Great Moderation exist, notable research has focused on the role of monetary policy. Specifically, early evidence suggested that this increased stability is the result of monetary policy that responded much more strongly to realized inflation. Recent evidence casts doubt on this change in monetary policy. An alternative hypothesis is that the change in monetary policy was the result of a change in doctrine; specifically the rejection of the view that inflation was largely a cost-push phenomenon. As a result, this alternative hypothesis suggests that the change in monetary policy beginning in 1979 is reflected in the Federal Reserve's response to expectations of nominal income growth rather than realized inflation as previously argued. I provide evidence for this hypothesis by estimating the parameters of a monetary policy rule in which policy adjusts to forecasts of nominal GDP for the pre- and post-Volcker eras. Finally, I embed the rule in two dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with gradual price adjustment to determine whether the overhaul of doctrine can explain the reduction in the volatility of inflation and the output gap.

We test the relevance of the three main theories: the Static Trade-off Theory, the Pecking Order Theory, and the Agency Theory, which have been derived primarily for developed markets, because our knowledge on their validity for emerging European countries is limited. We confirm the positive impact of size and asset tangibility on the leverage, while rejecting both the positive impact of profitability and tax, as well as the negative impact of business risk and non-debt tax shields. We report that SMEs behave homogeneously, and the relevant capital structure determinants show remarkable steadiness. Our results show a special time varying behaviour, in which the relevant determinants become stronger, while most of the country-specific factors present weakening effects. We argue that firms of the CEE countries remarkably converged their financial decision-making procedure to that of developed countries through the investigated period. The relevance of the Trade-off Theory is weak, as firms respect a one-sided upper threshold rather than converging to a fixed target on both sides, while they are not indifferent to the hierarchy of financing alternatives.","[Ormos, Mihaly] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Finance, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Ormos, M (通讯作者)，Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Finance, Magyar Tudosok Krt 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",ormos@finance.bme.hu,"Ormos, Mihály/E-1051-2011","Ormos, Mihaly/0000-0002-3224-7636",,,,,47,20,20,0,36,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Modeling employment as a bivariate decision process, the study examines different factors that influence the worker's labor market participation decision, the employer's hiring decision and the wage rate. The study finds the evidence that the worker's positive attitude and optimism affect the worker's employment probability from different angles: the former through the participation decision and the latter through the hiring decision. Following an alternative approach, this study also provides strong support to the earlier finding that positive attitude affects the worker's wage positively.

Using propensity score matching, our empirical results indicate that subsidized firms indeed show a higher level of R&D intensity (R&D expenditures relative to total turnover) and a higher probability for patent application compared with non-subsidized firms. We find that, on average, the R&D intensity increases from 1.5% to 3.9%. The probability of patent application rises from 20% to 40%. These results closely match earlier empirical findings for East Germany. Given the fact that the East German innovation system is particularly driven by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we draw special attention to the effectiveness of R&D subsidies for this latter subgroup. Here, no specific empirical evidence is available so far.

Using a simple stochastic growth model, this paper demonstrates that the coefficient of variation of aggregate output or GDP does not go to zero even if the number of sectors or economic agents goes to infinity. Non-self-averaging phenomena imply that even if the number of economic agents is large, dispersion could remain significant, and we cannot legitimately focus solely on the means of aggregate variables. This, in turn, means that the standard microeconomic foundations based on representative agents have little value for they are meant to provide us with accurate dynamics of the means of aggregate variables. Contrary to the main stream view, micro-founded macroeconomics such as a dynamic general equilibrium model does not provide solid micro foundations.","[Yoshikawa, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Aoki, Masanao] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of Tokyo; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Yoshikawa, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",aoki@econ.ucla.edu; yoshikawa@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,45,10,10,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Second, we estimate multipliers for more disaggregate spending variables which behave differently relative to aggregate fiscal policy shocks, with military spending having the largest multiplier.

The context is provided by an academic literature on the role of universities in regional innovation systems, some of which casts doubt on the capacity of universities to operate in this domain, particularly within a lagging region. The empirical case reports on a bold experiment initiated by the Regional Development Agency in the older industrial region of the North-East of England to create and support new TICs in the fields of process innovation in high-value manufacturing and new and renewable energy, and on the engagement of a regionally committed university with these centres. The evidence presented suggests that while there are links between the university and the centres, both are principally operating in a national science and technology system in which contributing to addressing uneven regional economic development is a secondary concern.","[Goddard, John; Vallance, Paul] Newcastle Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Dev Studies, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Robertson, Douglas] Newcastle Univ, Res & Enterprise Serv, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK; Newcastle University - UK,"Goddard, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Dev Studies, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",john.goddard@ncl.ac.uk,"moonsamy, ghaneshree/B-2467-2010","Goddard, John/0000-0001-8262-5394; Vallance, Paul/0000-0002-0024-7105; Robertson, Douglas/0000-0003-2903-5496",,,,,75,45,49,5,98,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

First, the paper examines the effect of FDI on economic growth for 44 developing countries using heterogeneous panel cointegration techniques that are robust to omitted variables and endogenous regressors. The main result is that FDI has, on average, a negative effect on growth in developing countries, but there are large differences in the effect across countries. Second, a general-to-specific model-selection approach is used to systematically search for country-specific factors explaining the cross-country differences in the growth effects of FDI. The results suggest that the cross-country heterogeneity in the growth effect of FDI can be explained mainly by cross-country differences in freedom from government intervention, business freedom, FDI volatility, and primary export dependence.","Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Herzer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",dierkherzer@gmx.de,,,,,,,47,94,104,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We set forth theoretically possible agglomeration (bifurcation) patterns for a system of cities spread uniformly on a circle. A possible and most likely course predicted is a gradual and successive one, which is called spatial period doubling. For example, eight cities concentrate into four cities and then into two cities en route to the formation of a single city. The existence of this course is ensured by numerical simulation for the model. Such a gradual and successive agglomeration presents a sharp contrast to the agglomeration of two cities, for which spontaneous concentration to a single city is observed in core-periphery models of various kinds. Other bifurcations that do not take place in two cities, such as period tripling, are also observed. The need for study of a system of cities has thus been demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines whether rent-seeking behavior can improve social welfare by focusing on the welfare effects of firms' competitive lobbying efforts when governments can impose market entry regulation against foreign firms. We demonstrate that competitive lobbying efforts can improve social welfare when such lobbying efforts are directed to reduce market entry barriers. In addition, social welfare can be maximized when the government shows the maximum sensitivity to the foreign firm's political contributions while maintaining competitive market structure. Moreover, it is shown that the dominant strategy for a domestic firm is to allocate more resources to R&D sectors while it is optimal for foreign firms is to exert more efforts in lobbying to reduce the market entry barriers when a government makes political economic approach in market entry regulations.

Our research is motivated by suggestions in the literature that emission-relevant consumption patterns may depend on the position in the life cycle and on the birth cohort to which people belong. We augment standard macroeconomic emission regressions by including the age and cohort composition of the population. Our estimation results on a panel of data for 26 countries, spanning the period 1960-2005, suggest that both life-cycle and cohort effects belong in a macroeconomic emission function for carbon dioxide. We find that shifts in both the age and the cohort composition have contributed to rising carbon emissions in OECD countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We consider four large traditional UK universities that have gained significant funding for such activities. We examine the changes in institutional structures necessary to enable universities to transform from single-discipline-based schools to multidisciplinary institutes. New incentives for working across schools, the cross-subsidy transfer of industry-funded research and teaching income, and senior role models are observed to enable the development of a multidisciplinary research capability. Yet, this capability is not easily sustained. It appears that for institutes to survive beyond the initial funding round, they regress towards traditional school activities of peer-reviewed research and teaching. We conclude that to transform academic behaviour, a fundamental shift in promotion procedures, which remain heavily weighted towards peer-reviewed journal publication within single disciplines, is required.","[Mosey, Simon] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Wright, Mike; Clarysse, Bart] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of Nottingham; Imperial College London,"Mosey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",simon.mosey@nottingham.ac.uk,"Mosey, Simon/AAB-4707-2021; Mosey, Simon/JXW-6801-2024","Mosey, Simon/0000-0002-3452-5230;",,,,,41,30,32,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We find strong evidence that firms' access to credit was affected by changes in the financial conditions of their banks. During the crisis firms were more credit constrained if they were dealing with banks that experienced a decline in equity and Tier 1 capital, as well as losses on financial assets. We also find that access to credit reflects the balance sheet conditions of foreign parent banks.

We single out education as the main determinant of behavior, by assuming that education is inversely related to (time) opportunity cost that the individual bears when he gets informed. In our model, two sources of information compete for an audience composed by rational individuals, assumed to be heterogeneous regarding their education level. We show that two market configurations may emerge. In the first one, individuals split into two groups, one composed by those who do not demand news at all, and another one composed by individuals who consult both sources. In the second configuration, individuals split into a group of non-readers, a group of one-report readers and a group of two-report readers. The former configuration is associated to high costs of news production and high opportunity costs. One of the sources in the latter configuration provides higher quality news than any of the two sources in the former, and it may also result in a larger number of news-demanding individuals.","[Battaggion, Maria Rosa; Vaglio, Alessandro] Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-20147 Bergamo, Italy",University of Bergamo,"Battaggion, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Caniana 2, I-20147 Bergamo, Italy.",battaggi@unibg.it; alessandro.vaglio@unibg.it,"Battaggion, Maria-Rosa/AAG-1094-2020",,,,,,25,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The methodology consists of using micro data from the PSID to construct a panel of individuals and an aggregate time series obtained by aggregating these individuals each year. These two data sets represent exactly the same sample at different levels of aggregation, and we use them to identify the parameters of two distinct MaCurdy-type micro and macro equations. We find a micro elasticity of about 0.1 and a much larger macro elasticity that ranges from 1.1 to 1.7. There is no conflict between the two estimates: the micro one reflects only the intensive margin while the macro one reflects, in addition, the much more volatile extensive margin. Furthermore, aggregation of only continuously employed individuals allows us to provide a reliable estimate of the intensive margin elasticity in the range 0.3-0.4. This implies an extensive margin elasticity in the range 0.8-1.4. These findings suggest that micro evidence is not a benchmark for assessing how large the Frisch elasticity of labor supply should be in a model of the aggregate economy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We propose an alternative measure that focuses on short-run fluctuations in the fiscal stance, namely, a model-based indicator that compares a target level of the debt-GDP ratio at a given point in the future with a forecast based on the government budget constraint (GBC) where the forecasts are obtained using a recursively estimated VAR. By log-linearising the GBC the index can be decomposed into the various different components of which it is comprised. Using data from 1970 to 2011 we conduct a detailed time-series study of the fiscal stances of four countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Greece and we calculate the index for 11 other EU countries. For most countries the index shows that their fiscal stances vary from being too loose to too tight. Almost without exception the index drops sharply from 2007 showing the harmful effect on their fiscal stances of the recent recession. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We assume that there is a large set of assets which all promise a risk less payoff but which distinguish themselves by their collateral requirements. In equilibrium m agents default, the assets have different payoffs, and there are as many linearly independent assets available for trade as there are states of the world. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for equilibria to be Pareto-efficient in the presence of uncertainty. We explore some examples for which the collateral equilibrium allocation is identical to the Arrow-Debreu allocation, either when agents have a high preference for the durable good, or when the endowment distribution of the durable good is relatively homogeneous. We examine a series of examples to understand which collateral-levels prevail in equilibrium and under which conditions there is scope for regulating margin-requirements, that is, restricting the sets of tradable assets through government intervention. In these examples equilibrium is always sub-optimal but regulation never leads to a Pareto-improvement. While the competitive equilibria are constrained efficient, there do exist regulations which make large groups of agents in the economy better off. These regulations typically restrict all trades to take place in the low-collateral loans and benefit the poor and the rich agents in the economy through their effects on the equilibrium interest rate and the equilibrium prices of the durable goods.

The model was first developed and estimated by means of classical GMM in Argov and Elkayam (2010), and since then it has been used at the Bank of Israel for monetary policy analysis. It is widely believed that in 2007 (out of sample year) as elsewhere worldwide, inflation rose in Israel due to high commodity prices in global markets. However, our baseline model attributes most of the high inflation in 2007 to supply shocks. One conjecture is that this model's result derives from the inappropriate original use of the unit value of imported consumer goods (which do not include unprocessed food and energy) as the main foreign price measure. We test this conjecture by re-estimating the model with various other foreign price measures that typically do reflect the global rise in commodity prices and compare the log-marginal likelihoods. We find that no other price measure outperforms the original choice in the sample period. Only the foreign trade-weighted CPI equals the performance of the original choice while improving the 2007 interpretation of inflation, and should therefore be considered the main foreign price measure. The proposed methodology for comparing the suitability of alternative measures for observable variables can be applied to any model with exogenous variables that are characterized by univariate equations.

We test this model empirically for a sample of emerging markets. Our findings show that the degree of market integration is time-varying and that the premium associated with the domestic risk factors is the most important component of the total risk premium.

It is shown that the combination of liquidity constraints and imperfect commitment are a source of underinvestment in migration. More precisely, we highlight that, if remittances are unenforceable as a repayment for the parent's contribution in migration transaction costs, then both the migrant and the parent's liquidity constraints, rather than the household's liquidity constraint as a whole, matter in determining the investment decision. Besides, the insurance motive for remittances is shown to generate divergence of interest over the characteristics of migration. This result calls for a theoretical approach that properly takes account of potential internalization problems, which the paper intends to offer. Plausibility checks of the model are provided by comparative statics whose outcomes are consistent with previous research on migration and remittances.","Catholic Univ Louvain, FNRS Postdoctoral Researcher Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Delpierre, M (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, FNRS Postdoctoral Researcher Earth & Life Inst, Pl Croix Sud 2-15, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",Matthieu.Delpierre@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,27,4,4,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Second, we have independent raters separately code front-page election stories and headlines. Third, we tabulate the number of electoral endorsements that newspapers give to each side of politics in federal elections. Overall, we find that the Australian media are quite centrist, with very few outlets being statistically distinguishable from the middle of Australian politics. It is possible that this is because of the lack of competition in the Australian media market.

We argue that bivariate models, which analyze the causality only at the macro level, are eventually misleading, especially in cases where both variables do not cover the same scope of economic activity. After discussing appropriate pairs of variables, we investigate Granger causality between energy and growth in the U.S. for the period from 1970 to 2007 for three sectors, industry, commercial sector, transport, as well as on the macro level. Using the recently developed ARDL bounds testing approach by Pesaran and Shin (1999) and Pesaran et al. (2001), we find evidence for unidirectional long-run Granger causality in the commercial sector from growth to energy, as well as evidence for bi-directional long-run Granger causality in the transport sector. The dependence of causality on the level of aggregation is interpreted as evidence for 'Simpsons' Paradox'. The choice of control variables is based on findings from the Environmental Kuznets Curve literature: we find that controlling for the increasing energy productivity of production as well as trade significantly improves the fit of the bivariate model.

We find that domestic saving rates in Developing Asia have, in general, been high and rising but that there have been substantial differences from economy to economy, that the main determinants of these trends appear to have been the age structure of the population (especially the aged dependency ratio), income levels, and the level of financial sector development, and that the impacts of income levels and the level of financial sector development have been nonlinear (convex and concave, respectively). We then project future trends in domestic saving rates in Developing Asia for the 2011-2030 period based on our estimation results and find that the domestic saving rate in Developing Asia as a whole will remain roughly constant during the next two decades despite rapid population aging in some economies in Developing Asia because population aging will occur much later in other economies and because the negative impact of population aging on the domestic saving rate will be largely offset by the positive impact of higher income levels.

Households appear to be fairly well insured against health shocks. Our results suggest that households sell livestock in response to health shocks and short term insurance is therefore attained at a significant long term cost. However microcredit has a significant mitigating effect. Households that have access to microcredit do not need to sell livestock in order to insure consumption.

We suggest that competition affects trust not only within dyads including direct competitors, but also between individuals who do not compete against each other. We test this idea in a trust game where trustors and trustees are rewarded based either on their absolute performance or on how well they do relative to players from other dyads. In Experiment 1, we show that competition among trustors significantly increases trust. Competition among trustees decreases trustworthiness, but trustors do not anticipate this effect. In Experiment 2, we additionally show that the increase in trust under competition is caused by a combination of increased risk taking and lower sensitivity to non-financial concerns specific to trust interactions. Our results suggest that tournament incentives might have a blinding effect on considerations such as betrayal and inequality aversion.","[Keck, Steffen; Karelaia, Natalia] INSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France",INSEAD Business School,"Keck, S (通讯作者)，INSEAD, Blvd Constance, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France.",Steffen.Keck@insead.edu; Natalia.Karelaia@insead.edu,"Keck, Steffen/C-6815-2017","Keck, Steffen/0000-0003-0090-3456",,,,,47,12,13,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

In this paper I analyse how men's wage inequality has changed during the period of transition to a market economy in Serbia. a country which has experienced a particularly dramatic transition. Changes in the distribution of earnings are examined using the Lemieux (2002) decomposition methodology and five annual Labour Force Surveys (2001-2005). I find that the change in wage inequality is mostly driven by changes in wage premiums, while the effect of changes in the composition of the labour force is very small. Isolating the effect of the emerging private sector reveals that changes in the private sector size and wage premium account for an average 25 per cent of the changes in inequality during this period. Moreover, the minimum wage is found to exert a dampening effect on wage inequality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses hypertension as an example and documents the association of socioeconomic status with various measures of this condition, i.e., prevalence, awareness, treatment and control. We find no wealth and education gradients in the prevalence of hypertension. Given education, wealth plays some roles in improving the treatment and control of hypertension. Some associations exist between education and diagnosis/treatment/control in urban areas but not in rural areas. We also find that the public health care services in China contribute little in informing patients of their hypertension status, suggesting that how to improve the effectiveness of the health care system in dealing with emerging chronic illnesses should be policy priority.

Two common forms of technology sharing are compared: a research joint venture (RJV) and licensing. Under licensing, firms can use the licensing fee to elicit higher levels of R&D than with an RJV. However, firms must also be induced to license innovations ex post. For a broad set of cases, licensing yields higher collusive profits to firms and higher prices to consumers. In other cases, licensing can only be induced through a very high license fee, leading to excessive R&D and lower profits. In these cases, the colluding firms prefer to share technology through an RJV. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, this view fails to provide solid theoretical and empirical support to the claim that net inflows of foreign savings reduced U.S. long-term real interest rates and inflated asset prices. It also ignores the role of the global financial system in shaping the development strategy and macroeconomic imbalances in emerging Asian economies. Furthermore, forcing currency revaluation in China and other surplus countries may risk reducing global demand instead of shifting demand from the United States to surplus countries. The paper argues that an overhaul of the defunct global financial system lies at the root of global rebalancing; whereas in the short run, the United States should actively pursue demand-enhancing policies to strengthen global economic recovery.","Willamette Univ, Dept Econ, Salem, OR 97301 USA",Willamette University,"Liang, Y (通讯作者)，Willamette Univ, Dept Econ, Salem, OR 97301 USA.",,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

By doing an empirical analysis on quarterly data for China over the period 1992-2010, our results show that the actual reactions of China's monetary policy can be well characterized by a two-regime forward-looking Taylor rule. Furthermore, it is also suggested that the interest rate policy in response to inflation and output gap is asymmetric, behaving a significant characteristic of regime-switching nonlinearity. Specifically, in the first regime the People's Bank of China targets inflation, but not focuses on the output gap; while in the second regime the central bank targets the output gap and the policy rule is not a stable framework.

This paper offers a general equilibrium (GE) exploration of the key mechanisms and factors underlying the size of carbon leakages. We developed a two-region, two-goods simplified GE framework, incorporating three types of fossil fuels (coal, oil and low-carbon energy), international trade and capital mobility. The model was designed to make tractable extensive multidimensional sensitivity analysis. The results suggest that the coal supply elasticity plays a critical role, while substitution elasticities between traded goods and international capital mobility appear relatively less influential. The shape of the production function also matters for the size of the leakages. Confirming the results obtained with large computable GE models, for a wide range of parameters' values, carbon leakages appear to be small. Therefore, the argument that unilateral carbon abatement action taken by a large group of countries (such as the Annex 1 group) is flawed by significant carbon leakages is not supported by our sensitivity analysis. The likelihood of small leakages favours in fact the formation of a worldwide coalition to stabilise climate change.","[Burniaux, Jean-Marc; Martins, Joaquim Oliveira] OECD, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Martins, JO (通讯作者)，OECD, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",Jean-Marc.Burniaux@oecd.org; Joaquim.Oliveira@oecd.org,"OLIVEIRA MARTINS, Joaquim/ABB-7737-2021","OLIVEIRA MARTINS, Joaquim/0000-0003-3736-3035",,,,,28,76,80,4,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

But what is the best method of granting state aid to firms? We use a theoretical model with firms that differ in their success probabilities and compare different types of direct subsidies with indirect subsidies through bank loans. We find that, for a large range of parameters, subsidies through banks entail higher social welfare than direct subsidies, avoiding windfall gains to entrepreneurs and economizing on screening costs. For selfish politicians, subsidizing a bank has the additional advantage that part of the screening costs are born by private banks. Consequently, from a welfare perspective, politicians use subsidized banks inefficiently often. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, point estimates from a regression discontinuity design-comparing the stock market impact of close union election wins to close losses-are considerably smaller and close to zero.

A necessary condition is time invariance, which is satisfied by any common solution concept in an overlapping-generations model with exogenous growth. This tool is applied to derive the discount rate for cost-benefit analysis under two different utilitarian welfare functions: classical and relative. It is only with relative utilitarianism, and assuming time-invariance of the set of alternatives (policies), that the discount rate is well defined for a heterogeneous society at a balanced growth equilibrium, is corroborated by an independent principle equating values of human lives, and equals the growth rate of real per-capita income.","[Rubinchik, Anna] Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Mertens, Jean-Francois] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium",University of Haifa; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Rubinchik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",annarubinchik@gmail.com,,"Rubinchik, Anna/0000-0001-8754-3400",,,,,41,3,3,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We show that, compared to the equilibrium without bundling, (i) prices, profits and social welfare are lower, whereas (ii) consumer surplus is higher in the equilibrium with mixed bundling. In addition, the population of consumers who purchase both products from the same firm is larger in the equilibrium with mixed bundling. These results are largely in line with those obtained in the previous literature on competitive mixed bundling with horizontal differentiation. Further, we conduct a comparative static analysis with respect to changes in quality differentiation parameters. When the quality gap between brands narrows under no bundling and symmetric mixed bundling, prices and profits decrease. When quality differentiation is asymmetric across products, however, complicated effects occur on prices and profits due to strategic interdependence that mixed bundling creates.","[Ahn, Illtae] Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Yoon, Kiho] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Korea University,"Ahn, I (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",illtae@cau.ac.kr; kiho@korea.ac.kr,,"Yoon, Kiho/0000-0001-7598-1999",,,,,19,1,1,0,21,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This has caused high product prices and limited the accessibility of the commodities to numerous prospective consumers. The implication is chronic malnutrition in children and various degrees of manifestation of diseases in nursing mothers and adults. This study therefore treats the economics of marketing of food grains in South Western Nigeria with a view to addressing some of the militating factors in distribution chains. A total of 250 respondents were sampled for the study in the five states in the zone. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to gather the sample. The marketing margin was highest for food grain marketers in Osun State, with N900.00 per 100 kg of maize. The least value of N433.00 per 100 kg was however recorded for marketers in Oyo State. The average marketing margin for food grain marketers in the region is N662.60 per 100 kg of maize. The average marketing margin for cowpea stood at N1347.60, which is slightly higher than the least value of margin recorded for the marketers in Oyo State. Marketers in Ogun State recorded the least margin of N300.00 per 50 kg bag of polished rice. This is against the N550.00 margin recorded by the marketers in Ekiti State. The average marketing margin for the product in the region is N440.00, which is slightly lower than the marginal values in Osun, Ondo and Ekiti States. The mean marketing efficiency for maize in South Western Nigeria is 0.82. This is slightly lower than the average efficiency level for Oyo State (i.e. 0.90). For cowpea and polished rice, the mean marketing efficiency levels are 0.78 and 0.71, respectively. The levels of market concentration stood at 0.326, 0.369 and 0.4943 for the marketers of maize, cowpea and polished rice, respectively. The marketers of these commodities should be more evenly distributed over the marketing space, so that the level of marketing efficiency could improve. The bottlenecks created by the activities of middlemen in the distribution network should also be minimized, so that many households in the region can have access to the food grain products.","Olabisi Oabanjo Univ, Coll Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria",,"Akanni, KA (通讯作者)，Olabisi Oabanjo Univ, Coll Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria.",altannikunle2003@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,24,0,1,0,6,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

This paper proposes and estimates a structural vector autoregression model to investigate the dynamic relationship between these variables. Impulse responses are calculated in two ways (standard and the recently developed projection based methods). The model supports stylized facts. In particular, positive shocks to oil prices tend to depress emerging market stock prices and US dollar exchange rates in the short run. The model also captures stylized facts regarding movements in oil prices. A positive oil production shock lowers oil prices while a positive shock to real economic activity increases oil prices. There is also evidence that increases in emerging market stock prices increase oil prices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The problem is analyzed in three variations: (i) a 'decentralized' scheme, in which parents control the main budget, but their children dispose of their time as they see fit, together with any earnings from work on their own account: (ii) 'hierarchy', in which parents can enforce, at some cost, particular levels of schooling and supervised work contributing to the main budget; and (iii) the cooperative solution, in which resources are pooled and the threat point is one of the non-cooperative outcomes. Adults choose which game is played. While the subgame perfect equilibrium of the overall game is pareto-efficient, it may yield less education than 'hierarchy'. Restrictions on child labor and compulsory schooling generally affect both the threat point and the feasible set of bargaining outcomes. Families may choose more schooling than the legal minimum.

First, spatial or adresses network models in economics can be easily adapted to describe a significative part of the episodic memory mechanism as defined by Tulving (1983). Second, brain viewed as a network behaves as a decision-maker who arbitrates between two economic dimensions of recollection: the reward-i.e., the satisfaction for recovering old informations located in mnesic traces-and the cost-i.e., the price for stimulating the traces network. Indeed, the two results exhibited in the paper-and devoted to a formal and appealing characterization of true and false recollections-are directly derived from the idea of a rational brain. Finally, this paper aims at showing that it could be relevant to model memory processes in a pure symbolic way-contrary to most of the neuroeconomics contributions which are generally experimental-and also that such an attempt for an abstract and analogical representation of the episodic memory process based on a spatial microeconomics methodology seems to be specially efficient and illustrative of Hintzman (1986) and recent Doeller et al.

This study investigates which characteristics of firm performance and Chapter 11 bankruptcy are linked to successful emergence upon reorganization.

I analyze the generalized model where firms pre-order input and forward sell output. First. I consider oligopolists producing homogenous goods, generalize the Cournot-Stackelberg endogeneity to oligopoly, and show that it additionally includes Bertrand in the generalized model. This shows that the mode of competition between firms may be entirely endogenous. Second, I consider duopolies producing heterogenous goods. The set of equilibrium outcomes is characterized and shown not to contain the Bertrand solution anymore.

J,"Chreptaviciene, V; Starkute, J",,,,"Chreptaviciene, Virginija; Starkute, Jovita",,,Relationship between Career and Competency: Verification of Theoretical Model Validity,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,career planning; competency; levels of competency; career planning model,,"In a constantly changing environment, a new approach to an organization as a performance system where employee'ss are becoming the most important factor determining the efficiency of organizational performance is developing. However, the ability to attract and retain competent specialists is often a challenge for the organization since it has to recognize the range of factors that motivate each employee's and serve as incentives for activity. One of such incentives is the possibilities to make a successful career as each person wants to 'grow in an organization' literally. Structural changes in the organization, i.e. transition from pyramidal structure through team organization structure to learning organization, which, according to Salopek (2004), Giesecke and McNeil (2004), has the characteristics of experimentation and future vision, have direct impact on employee's's career development: the possibilities for vertical career are reduced, it is difficult to anticipate workforce flow in an organization, employee'ss' individual career do not anchor them in one organization, which increases the importance of competency and the insights into the future career possibilities. In order to preserve unique skills and competencies, each organization must foresee the possibilities for employee's's career. If career is considered to be the process of personal development, authority, power influence, status, prestige, growth, climbing the ladder of hierarchy, qualification and promotion, the significance of career planning in the organization becomes obvious. Successful career planning in the organization, according to Lovelock and Wright (2002), helps to satisfy employee'ss' needs for training and professional growth; to use employee'ss' competencies efficiently; to increase employee'ss' self-reliance; to form an internal reserve of professional growth. Moreover, career planning helps to combine the aims of the organization and an employee's, to meet the latter's interests and in such a way to retain competent specialists in an organization. Knowing their perspectives in the organization, employee'ss will try to act more efficiently, i.e. to use their competency and experience while striving for organizational goals. Yet when aiming at the effective usage of every employee's's competency in a particular activity, one should know not only the structure of the activity but also its levels and levels of competency respectively (Dreyfus, Dreifus, 1986, Reich (1993), Bowden & Monton (1997, 2003), Juceviciene, Liepaite (2000), Vernhout (2005). Chreptaviciene (2009), Chreptaviciene, Starkute, 2010), on the basis of which career should be planned and developed in the organization. Scientific literature analysis revealed that the impact of competency level on career as well as its relation to career planning has not been studied yet. Consequently, it allows proposing adequate perspectives to employee's's career planning in the organization on the basis of his/her competency levels. Having analyzed scientific literature, the authors of the article prepared a theoretical-hypothetical model of career planning based on the impact of competency level (Chreptaviciene & Starkute, 2010). The Model of Cohesions between Career and Competence. Inzinerine Ekonomika-Engineering Economics, 21(5), 537-549. In the model, employee's's competency level is equated to four stages of career. The employee's progresses in professional career consistently passing through all the stages, where he/she faces activities and challenges of respective complexity. The employee's's ability to perform a certain task/activity (his/her level of competency) is assessed in each stage. Levels of competency distinguished by Bowden and Marton, (1997, 2003) as well as by Juceviciene and Lepaite (2000) correlate with four professional career stages identified by Dalton and Thompson (1986), which emphasize the relationship between an individual's age and his/her position, show how employee'ss move from one stage to another. The movement determines changes in activity, in complexity of performed functions, and simultaneously the need for respective level of competency. Therefore, when conditions change and new activities appear; they require the acting person to apply the possessed competency to the conditions of the new activity or to be able to evaluate personal experience critically and engage in further development. The growth in the level of competency ensures the possibilities for professional career. The career based on the identification of competency levels shows that it is not enough to have only a certain competency; the level of competency and its recognition is important as well. This research is an attempt to verify the validity of the theoretical-hypothetical career model prepared by the authors of the article. Case study is chosen for this research, i.e. there is one single object in the research - the company that manages shopping malls. The choice was determined by the following two reasons: first, the subject has successfully been realizing employee's's career planning; second, case study is the only way to verify a theoretical model (Andrikiene & Anuziene, 2006, Zydziunaite, 2008). To validate the theoretical-hypothetical career planning model, the article presents the methodology to study career planning in the organization and relationships of employee's's competencies, research procedure and results. While applying the methods of written and oral survey, all employee'ss of one organization (managers and subordinates) were surveyed (N=30). The empirical research revealed that career planning in the organization depends on employee's's level of competency. Improved professional skills and increased level of competency has influence and is the main factor and guideline for employee's's career planning in the organization. The research findings confirmed the theoretical-hypothetical career model and theoretical conclusions maintaining that career planning in the organization on the basis of employee's's competency level is purposeful and relevant. On the grounds of obtained research results, the article presents a practical model of relationship between career planning and employee's's competency (see Figure 5), which basically does not differ from the theoretical-hypothetical model (Chreptaviciene, Starkute, 2010); the practical model is more adapted to the characteristics of the organization being studied.","[Chreptaviciene, Virginija; Starkute, Jovita] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Chreptaviciene, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",virginija.chreptaviciene@ktu.lt; jovita.starkute@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,4,8,3,69,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this context, the area of possible compromise is depicted as regards the possible policy changes in the period 2014-2020. The probable changes in the CAP are also assessed from the point of view of their impact on the Polish agriculture. Emphasizing the achievements of the CAP to date with respect to structural changes in agriculture and its adjustment to the needs of the sustained development, the authors discuss such new questions as the intended change in the mechanism of direct subsidies, the inclusion of ecological elements in the system of financial support, reorientation of the market support for agriculture, and implementing of new requirements related to the provision of public goods. The article compares the standpoints of the individual member countries as regards the future CAP regulations with the proposals included in the project prepared by the European Commission with special consideration given to the position taken by the Polish government. The authors indicate which elements of the expected change in the CAP after 2013 might be advantageous for the Polish agriculture, and which components of it are definitely disadvantageous. The authors believe that the future shape of the CAP is a very important and complicated problem, and some proposed elements are controversial, but a compromise solution is necessary and possible.","[Czyzewski, Andrzej; Stepien, Sebastian] Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, Katedra Makroekon & Gospodarki Zywnosciowej, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Czyzewski, A (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, Katedra Makroekon & Gospodarki Zywnosciowej, Poznan, Poland.",a.czyzewski@ue.poznan.pl; sebastian.stepien@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,17,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2012,,2,,,,,145,174,,,,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,930IU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303133900001,0

Our hypothesis stresses that the cultural dimensions of a country can have an impact on its financial set-up. We consider multiple dimensions of culture, identified in the literature by Tabellini (2008), to test our hypothesis. As culture evolves in the form of greater trust, control and other traits, individuals' attitudes towards financial market change, and they engage in greater financial transactions. This, in turn, leads to better financial development. Using quantile estimation technique for a cross section of 90 countries, we find that culture significantly influences the level of financial development. To ensure the robustness of our findings we use Hofstede's cultural dimension - Uncertainty Avoidance Index' (UAI) - as an alternative measure for culture. Our results hold for multiple measures of financial development.","[Dutta, Nabamita] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Mukherjee, Deepraj] Waldorf Coll, Dept Econ, Forest City, IA 50436 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Dutta, N (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA.",dutta.naba@uwlax.edu,"MUKHERJEE, DEEPRAJ/ABI-7532-2020; Dutta, Nabamita/K-3728-2019","MUKHERJEE, DEEPRAJ/0000-0002-2032-477X; Dutta, Nabamita/0000-0002-0943-5217",,,,,19,21,24,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We estimate a demand system that distinguishes between cable, DSL, satellite and fiber broadband versus dial-up Internet services. We allow household preferences for Internet services to vary depending on the share of rural households in each geographic market, and find a significant impact of rural geography on demand. The estimated own-price elasticity of demand for broadband declines over time from -1.5 in 2005 to -0.7 in 2008. Consumer surplus from Internet is found to concentrate in broadband services, with the net consumer benefits from home broadband in 2008 on the order of $32 billion per year.","[Dutz, Mark A.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Willig, Robert D.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",The World Bank; Princeton University,"Dutz, MA (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mdutz@worldbank.org,,,,,,,36,2,2,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

High-skill individuals however move only according to financial opportunities be they standard of living or returns to skill within a class.

We also test for the presence of spatial effects in determination of regional growth rates. In line with the results of the research done in some other countries, we observe a sigma divergence, and unconditional beta divergence rather than convergence of income across Polish subregions. Conditional convergence is only observed between the regions around cities of similar size.

By implementing the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimators, Frank (2009) concluded that there is a significant and positive relationship between inequality and growth. However, we find that Frank (2009) was actually measuring the effect of inequality on economic development (proxied by the logarithm of the real state income per capita) rather than on economic growth (defined by the first difference of the logarithm of the real state income per capita). To this purpose, we suggest a more adequate specification to reassess the relationship using the same data set and estimation technique.

This is because individuals that benefit from pollution-generating activities are more capable of influencing political decisions, as they are relatively wealthy and well educated.","[Jauregui Nolen, Elena Catalina] Empleos Verdes, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Tello Medina, Diana Cristina] Murex North Amer Inc, New York, NY USA",,"Nolen, ECJ (通讯作者)，Empleos Verdes, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",c.jauregui@empleosverdes.com; dtellom@yahoo.com; pili.rivas@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,4,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

When controlling for changes in hours worked, however, we find that the notable increase in the fraction of people at work at unusual hours was for low-income nonregular employees (part-time, temporary and contract workers) while relatively higher income regular employees' work timing remains stable. These observations imply that there is a trend of diversification of work timing in Japan between regular and nonregular employees. A possible explanation is that the increase in the average hours worked per weekday by regular employees, possibly because of the spread of the 5-day workweek since the 1990s, increased services and goods demand at unusual hours as they returned home. An Oaxaca-Blinder type decomposition suggests that such an increase in the average hours worked by regular employees explains partially the rise in the employment rate of nonregular employees at unusual times.","[Kuroda, Sachiko] Waseda Univ, Fac Educ & Integrated Arts & Sci, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Yamamoto, Isamu] Keio Univ, Fac Business & Commerce, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Waseda University; Keio University,"Kuroda, S (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Fac Educ & Integrated Arts & Sci, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",s-kuroda@waseda.jp,,"Yamamoto, Isamu/0000-0002-4936-613X; Kuroda, Sachiko/0000-0002-3125-3970","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24000003, 22730188, 22000001] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,4,4,4,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

With the notable exception of the case of Sweden, opinion on this issue is still divided. In this paper, we look at public- and private-sector wage interactions from an international perspective (18 OECD countries). We focus on the causal two-way relationship between public and private wage setting, confirming that the private sector, on the whole, appears to have a stronger influence on the public sector, rather than vice versa. However, we also find evidence of feedback effects from public wage setting, which affect private-sector wages in a number of countries. When the private sector takes the lead on wages, there are few feedback effects from the public sector, while public wage leadership is typically accompanied by private-sector feedback effects.","[Lamo, Ana; Schuknecht, Ludger] European Cent Bank, DE-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Perez, Javier J.] Bank Spain, Madrid 28014, Spain",European Central Bank; Banco de Espana,"Lamo, A (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, DE-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",ana.lamo@ecb.europa.eu; javierperez@bde.es; ludger.schuknecht@ecb.europa.eu,,"Lamo, Ana/0009-0008-5455-6422",,,,,14,32,33,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Current serial methods are affected by sudden leaps in the magnitude of table elements, which occur straight after a period of data unavailability. Current parallel methods require two complete tables for base and final years in the same classification, and therefore do not work under misaligned or incomplete data.

The model presents three innovations. First, it formalizes the production of skills in the economy by following sex-age cohorts through the various levels of the education and training systems, given dropout and repetition rates. Second, it incorporates a module that projects social insurance expenditures as a function of the demographic structure of the country and the rules of the pension system. Finally, it develops a very detailed description of the labour market, where informality reflects strategic decisions by workers and not necessarily exclusion. The model is applied to Morocco. The results of various simulations illustrate the importance of coordinating macro, education and social protection policies in order to achieve meaningful effects on employment levels. In particular, we show that isolated interventions to improve the internal efficiency of the education system can aggravate the unemployment problem; that subsidies to investments are more efficient in sectors intensive in skilled labour; and that not controlling the growth of pension expenditures and the tax-wedge can depress employment in the formal sector.","[Robalino, David A.] World Bank, IZA, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Marouani, Mohamed A.] Univ Paris 01, UMR Dev & Soc, DIAL, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Marouani, Mohamed A.] IEDES, ERF, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",The World Bank,"Robalino, DA (通讯作者)，World Bank, IZA, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",drobalino@worldbank.org,"Marouani, Mohamed Ali/AAV-5017-2020","Marouani, Mohamed Ali/0000-0002-9052-1517",,,,,14,2,2,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I study the nontransfer allocation of two ex-ante identical objects under Bayesian incentive compatibility, with symmetric agents and independent private valuations. I find the ex-ante utilitarian-optimal mechanism, in which the probability of receiving a specified object is used as numeraire to purchase probability units of the other object. I characterize this mechanism as an appropriate combination of lotteries, auctions and insurance. The latter element ensures that efficient auctions are feasible. If the problem is constrained to guarantee exactly one object per agent, then the optimal mechanism uses no information other than the agents' ordinal preferences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Motor fuel taxes should also account for congestion and other externalities associated with vehicle use, at least until mileage-based taxes are widely introduced. An examination of existing energy/environmental tax systems in Germany, Sweden, Turkey, and Vietnam suggests that there is substantial scope for policy reform. Policy options include harmonizing taxes for pollution content across different fuels and end users, better aligning tax rates with (albeit crude) values for externalities, and scaling back excise taxes on vehicle ownership and electricity use that are redundant (on environmental grounds) in the presence of more targeted taxes.","[Parry, Ian W.

The problem can not be solved only by discounting future costs. It has much deeper, moral foundation.

Although both types of capital - physical capital in particular - play important roles, using a sample of 43 countries, I find that in terms of capturing the observed disparities, either in relative labor productivity in agriculture or aggregate output per worker between the rich and the poor countries, the role of labor market distortions outweighs the role of either sectoral human or physical capital.","[Priyo, Asad Karim Khan] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Priyo, Asad Karim Khan] North South Univ, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of Toronto; North South University (NSU),"Priyo, AKK (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",asad.priyo@utoronto.ca,"Priyo, Asad/HKO-5451-2023","Priyo, Asad/0000-0003-0428-6555",,,,,35,1,1,1,21,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Industries are linked with each other by domestic and international trade in intermediate goods. The model is parametrized using data for eight industries in 1989. It is used to perform several counterfactual simulations that are relevant to today's policy debates. First, the model is used to study the effects of the US-EU trade wars. It is found that trade wars have a greater negative effect on countries with large initial net export positions. It is also found that some trade war scenarios are more beneficial to the US while others to the EU. Second, the model is used to study the effects of trade barrier reductions between the high-income and middle-income countries. The results show that this trade liberalization tends to reinforce the pattern of trade according to technological comparative advantages. The results also show which industries should be targeted for barrier reductions depending on policy goals. The third set of simulations investigates spillovers from the technological growth in the US machinery industry. The results show how geography, technology, and industry links affect the propagation of this growth across countries and industries.","Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02108 USA",Suffolk University,"Shikher, S (通讯作者)，Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02108 USA.",serge.shikher@suffolk.edu,,,,,,,18,16,22,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Given that money supply is the principal policy instrument of the People's Bank of China (PBC) and its monetary targeting regime, this paper utilizes the counterfactual simulation method to evaluate the feasibility of the McCallum rule as a policy guideline for China in two simple macroeconomic models. The simulation results show that following the McCallum rule could significantly reduce China's nominal GDP fluctuations. The analysis shows that a rule-specified path for monetary base changes could be used as a benchmark for PBC's policy decision. Therefore, we strongly advocate that the PBC adopt the McCallum rule as its policy guideline in future policymaking.","[Gan, Christopher; Hu, Baiding] Lincoln Univ, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Sun, Shuzhang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Nanchang, Peoples R China",Lincoln University - New Zealand; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Gan, C (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Canterbury, New Zealand.",christopher.gan@lincoln.ac.nz,"gan, cc/JSL-2036-2023; Gan, Christopher/D-6635-2018; Hu, Baiding/E-4678-2018","Gan, Christopher/0000-0002-5618-1651; Hu, Baiding/0000-0002-0991-1375",,,,,59,4,4,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

By using a vector autoregressive model, we decompose labor productivity into technological and non technological shocks. We find that: (1) labor productivity responds positively to technological shocks, leading to a transition from one equilibrium to another; (2) capital accumulation shows a persistent decline in response to a positive technological shock, revealing that, in energy sector, technology and capital stock are substitutes. From our analysis we get some policy lessons. The obtained results point out the importance of a comprehensive strategy aimed at increasing technological progress through research, innovation and human capital investment in energy sector. Conversely, our findings state that institutional reforms and changes in regulation can only have a transitory effect on labor productivity in energy sector, without permanent gains in the future.

But the standard measure of unemployment agreed at international level has some shortcomings. For one thing, the objective definition of unemployment is a poor fit with the Italian labour market. And for another, the considerable increase in labour hoarding and the emergence of semi-employment-the alternation of brief periods of work with periods of unemployment or economic inactivity-make the state of the market hard to assess. The paper offers a more in-depth examination of the impact of the crisis, using labour force survey data to count labour underutilization, funded and unfunded labour hoarding, the discouraged, and semi-employed workers. The picture that emerges is one of a long wave of available labour underutilization: the Italian labour market has to cope with an increase in joblessness broadly conceived of about 1,400,000-more than twice the rise in official unemployment. This wave will inevitably last for years to come, until the pools of implicit and explicit unemployment are reabsorbed and jobs are created for those now unoccupied and the new entrants. So now is the time for reform of unemployment benefits, not just to provide income support for those caught up in the long wave of joblessness, but also to permit quicker reorganization of production. The reform will have to highlight the diverse interests and roles of government and of the social partners, within the framework of a new development and industrial policy.","[Tronti, Leonello] Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy; [Gatto, Riccardo] ISTAT, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Tronti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy.",l.tronti@funzionepubblica.it; rigatto@istat.it,"Gatto, Riccardo/AAQ-8156-2020","Gatto, Riccardo/0000-0001-8374-6964",,,,,11,3,3,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTR 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-916X,,978-3-7908-2772-9; 978-3-7908-2771-2,AIEL SER LABOUR ECON,,,2012,,,,,,,171,+,,10.1007/978-3-7908-2772-9_9,0.0,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDD90,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312877400009,0

Instead of blindly trusting the asymptotic distribution of the test, we extend Rudebusch's method to estimate its finite sample distributions under the null and alternative hypotheses. With these distributions, we can obtain the probabilities that the test statistic comes from the null and alternative hypotheses, and quantify the asymptotic size as well as the test power for each specific series. Our simulation experiments show that first, due to the higher power raised by the inclusion of covariates, the test can overwhelmingly reject the unit root null for the 16 industrialized countries; secondly, the Ng and Perron tests deliver lower powers in most countries, and thus lead to the false conclusion of non-stationary real interest rates. Finally, allowing for multiple endogenous breaks in the real interest rates provides only stationary evidence in half of the 16 countries.","[Tsong, Ching-Chuan] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou 545, Taiwan; [Lee, Cheng-Feng] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Tsong, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou 545, Taiwan.",tcc126@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,33,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Firms sell differentiated products and compete in a Bertrand fashion in product markets. Two effects play key roles in determining equilibrium market structure: the tariff saving effect and the protection gain effect. The balance between these two effects implies that, when foreign country practices free trade, low home tariffs yield international mergers irrespective of the substitutability levels. By contrast, when foreign tariffs are sufficiently high and products are close substitutes, national mergers obtain in the equilibrium. Unlike this asymmetric result of unilateral trade liberalization, we find that when bilateral tariffs are sufficiently low, international mergers arise. These results fit well with the fact that global trade liberalization has been accompanied by an increase in international merger activities. From a welfare perspective, we show that international mergers are preferable to national mergers and thus social and private merger incentives become aligned together as trade gets bilaterally liberalized. Finally, if countries can commit to a trade policy, they would optimally commit to a low tariff to induce international mergers when products are close substitutes while any tariff commitment is optimal when products are sufficiently differentiated.","[Ulus, Aysegul] Galatasaray Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Yildiz, Halis M.] Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada",Galatasaray University; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Ulus, A (通讯作者)，Galatasaray Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",aulus@gsu.edu.tr; hyildiz@ryerson.ca,,"Ulus, Aysegul Yildiz/0000-0002-0363-7328",,,,,29,1,1,1,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Values and impact level of unique factors on the portfolio are changing over time; therefore every investor should take into account the fact that there always will be a certain level of risk associated with any portfolio involving stocks. There is a number of ways to form a collection of most appropriate stocks and bonds for investment portfolio as well as to allocate weights of assets based on various criteria. All of these methods, dedicated for selection and allocation of assets, have their specific features and some disadvantages. In order to be able to conclude which of the asset selection methods have least disadvantages, four popular techniques were analysed and compared. These techniques were based on different variables: correlation coefficients between asset returns, maximisation of the utility function (diverse values of risk aversion coefficients were analysed), selection of assets with highest historical returns, and employment of modified price-to-earnings ratio. The article deals with multistage extension to the mean-variance and expected utility maximisation portfolio choice. Multistage investing consists of several essential stages, where each stage forms a basis for the next stage by providing useful input data, derived by stage-specific analysis. For construction of optimal portfolio the following stages are used: asset allocation, security selection, investment strategy development, construction of the model and its evaluation. After asset allocation was made and stocks for the portfolios had been selected, different theoretical asset allocation models (equal weight asset allocation, Markowitz model, Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), model where risk free asset is incorporated when constructing a portfolio) have been modified and adapted in order to become suitable for real market situation. Such prerequisites as normal distribution of stock returns were not satisfied by most Lithuanian companies' stocks when different interims were investigated, therefore authors set a presupposition that distribution properties of the stocks can be disregarded when Markowitz and CAPM models were applied to real market. Some other changes for the prerequisites of models were made; otherwise these theoretical models could not have been applied to Lithuanian market. After all models had been applied in Lithuanian equity market, back testing was carried out and certain characteristics of outcomes of different investment strategies were compared. Results were judged against characteristics of popular stock exchange indices of Baltic States in order to obtain conclusions. Most models were developed for broad financials markets (global markets). In the paper we analyse financial market of Lithuania. Since this market does not fit assumed conditions of general models, the models were slightly modified to apply for Lithuania market. The results of portfolio were compared with Baltic States index. It was concluded that the highest return rate is achieved by constructing the investment portfolio with employing modified Capital Asset Pricing Model. The best technique for selecting stocks proved to be the maximisation of utility function when risk aversion coefficient A = 3. In addition to this, after comparison of different asset selection methods, it was noted that the highest value of the Sharpe ratio was achieved by utilising the same technique. After investigation it was noted that investors should add a risk free asset into portfolio of stocks because it usually improves the results of most portfolios, irrespective of their contents. Constructing portfolios based on asset allocation according to indices analysed in the paper is not recommended because characteristics of indices were worse than the ones of constructed portfolios. Stocks of every company quoted in NASDAQ OMX Baltic (2011) Stock Exchange in Vilnius Official list for more than 10 years (2001 beginning - 2010 end) were investigated. Stocks of 14 companies satisfied preset 10 year interim criterion.","[Valakevicius, Eimutis; Vaznelyte, Kristina] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-3031 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Valakevicius, E (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Studentu St 50-219, LT-3031 Kaunas, Lithuania.",eimutis.valakevicius@ktu.lt; kristina.vaznelyte@stud.ktu.lt,"Valakevičius, Eimutis/Q-9444-2019",,,,,,37,1,1,1,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The authors' approach uses a bias correction term proportional to the inverse Mills ratio with argument equal to the normit of a consistent estimation of the conditional probability of being observed given cohort membership.

By doing so, the paper contributes to existing research which has predominantly adopted a utility-based perspective. I show, using simulations based on a route choice model estimated on stated choice data, that the two perspectives - regret based and utility based - generate markedly different benefits. These are caused by the fact that the regret based perspective takes into account choice set composition effects. For example, in line with its behavioral premises, the regret based model predicts that adding an attractive alternative to the set choice only results in a large reduction in regret when the alternative outperforms existing alternatives in terms of every attribute (i.e., becomes a 'clear winner'). In general, the benefit of adding a new alternative to one's choice set is predicted to be substantially higher by a utility based model, compared to a regret based counterpart. This implies that, to the extent that regret minimization (utility maximization) is an important determinant of decision-making, a utility (regret) based model would overestimate (underestimate) the true size of the decision-maker's choice set.

Specifically, we relate historical measures of conflicts associated with the Stolypin reform to contemporary views on whether the privatization of the 1990s should be revised. These historical measures could influence contemporary views in two ways: first, differences in privatization-related conflicts in the past could have directly altered attitudes towards privatization in the 1990s and, second, these differences could merely reflect pre-determined dissimilarities in preferences. We first show that historical measures of resistance to privatization are associated with views that favor state ownership. One standard deviation increase in the historical resistance to privatization explains a quarter of the negative sentiment toward private property today. We also find that negative experiences with the Stolypin reform are associated with views on the procedural unfairness of modern privatization reforms, suggesting that pre-determined preferences cannot fully explain the weight of history.

Given that seigniorage and public debt are also important means of financing public spending in these countries, we take into account in this paper their respective impacts on growth, as they might deform the existing relationship between taxes and growth. To this end, we develop a growth model with public investment as the engine of perpetual growth, and look for the effect of debt, tax and money financing on economic growth. We study in particular the way fiscal and monetary policies deform the Growth Laffer Curve in developing countries.

Assuming a proactive role of institution in the persistence of TFP and minimum inequality spread for social optimum, we quantify the extent to which embodiment characteristics determine the long-term dynamics among these factors. It is shown that the amelioration (deterioration) of institutional quality influences skilled labour mobility across sectors (in developing economies) thereby decreasing (increasing) long term income inequality. Long run scenarios are built using our model in which the production sophistication of the economy under embodiment is shown to be compatible with both better institutions and less income inequality. Quantile regression results for a sample of 27 developing countries over 1990-2010 provide broad support to the theoretical predictions. In particular, it is found that - along the distribution path of embodied technical progress - there is heterogeneous response of productivity growth to the inequality spread and innovation intensity.

An overlapping generations model of budgetary and allocation decisions is presented in a political dynamic equilibrium framework. The model's key feature is that the size of the budget is predetermined according to majority voting, taking into account the subsequent allocation decisions. Then, funds are allocated either efficiently or inefficiently on a quality-quantity frontier in hiring teachers. Under these assumptions, this study highlights the implications of existing inefficiencies and demonstrates how they might explain stylized facts. First, the majority of voters may channel more funds to an inefficient education system, in case its return to the marginal units of funding is higher, which helps explain the difficulty in finding budget effects in the data. Second, in certain circumstances, the majority of voters may actually prefer an inefficient education system. Finally, other disadvantages of inefficient education systems, in addition to low educational achievements, include high income inequality and low teacher quality in the long run.","Tel Aviv Univ, Berglas Sch Econ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Hatsor, L (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Berglas Sch Econ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",limor.hatsor@gmail.com,,"Hatsor, Limor/0000-0002-3446-3930",,,,,54,4,4,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Although estimates of the absolute level of pass-through vary, some studies document a decline in pass-through over time. In order to better illuminate the policy implications of pass-through, this paper seeks to add to the literature by decomposing pass-through into a number of time-varying impulses. This has the advantage of providing deeper insights of pass-through over time and across various monetary policy regimes. We then analyse the determinants of time-varying pass-through. Our results confirm that pass-through has declined over time but is subject to a stable and low inflation environment. We also show that a volatile exchange rate leads to higher pass-through.","[Jooste, Charl] Natl Treasury, Dept Econ Policy, ZA-0002 Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa",,"Jooste, C (通讯作者)，Natl Treasury, Dept Econ Policy, 240 Vermeulen St, ZA-0002 Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa.",Charl.Jooste@treasury.gov.za,,,,,,,32,13,13,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Numerous studies have documented the generally negative effect of this environment on the innovation capacities of the manufacturing sector. This paper, however, analyses the possible emergence of new innovation capacities in the period, bringing two important phenomena to light. First, a quite substantial number of firms, even in unstable settings, redoubled their innovation efforts. Second, these firms are mainly found in a small group of sectors associated with the countries' static advantages or in sectors favoured by specific sectoral regimes. The findings, although exploratory, are a contribution to the debate on the development of innovative capacities in unstable macroeconomic contexts and the ability of sectors associated with the two countries' static advantages to generate spaces of innovation and value creation.","[Marin, Anabel] Natl Council Sci & Technol Res CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Marin, Anabel; Stubrin, Lilia; Amelia Gibbons, Maria] Res Ctr Ind Transformat CENIT, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Marin, Anabel] Tres de Febrero Natl Univ UNTREF, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Amelia Gibbons, Maria] Univ San Andres, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad de San Andres Argentina,"Marín, A (通讯作者)，Natl Council Sci & Technol Res CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",a.i.marin@fund-cenit.org.ar; stubrin@merit.unu.edu; amelygibb@gmail.com,"Stubrin, Lilia/AAS-4808-2021",,,,,,55,1,1,0,3,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,DEC,2014,,114,,,,,153,170,,,,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF4LI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352520200009,0

We look at three different measures of intergenerational mobility social, educational, and income mobility. We find that downward mobility with respect to all three measures has a negative effect on the self-reported level of happiness and subjective health while upward mobility is associated with positive outcomes in subjective well-being. The positive and negative effect of social and educational mobility, however, is entirely through the income and health channels while income mobility has an impact on subjective well-being even after controlling for the current level of income and health. We further find that the effect of income mobility on subjective well-being peaks between the ages of 35-45 years and then slowly dissipates. Finally, the negative effect of downward mobility on subjective well-being is much stronger than the positive effect of upward mobility. This is consistent with the decision theory of loss aversion according to which the experienced disutility from loses outweighs the utility from acquiring proportionate gains. We do not find evidence for loss aversion when it comes to social and educational mobility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

With the public authorities seeking to create an environment of quasi-markets in the higher education sector, the increased competition induced by recent reforms has pushed all publicly financed higher education institutions (HEIs) to use their resources more efficiently. HEIs increasingly now aim at differentiating themselves from their competitors in terms of the range of outputs they produce. Assuming that different market positioning strategies will have different effects on the performance of HEIs, this article explores the existence of economies of scale and scope in the German higher education sector. Using an input-oriented distance function approach, we estimate the economies of scale and scope and the technical efficiency for 154 German HEIs from 2001 through 2007. Our results suggest that comprehensive universities should indeed orientate their activities to the concept of a full-university that combines teaching and research activities across a broad range of subjects. In contrast, praxis-oriented small and medium-sized universities of applied sciences should specialize in the teaching and research activities they conduct.","[Olivares, Maria] Disney Res Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Wetzel, Heike] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, D-50931 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Olivares, M (通讯作者)，Disney Res Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",maria.olivares@disneyresearch.com; heike.wetzel@uni-koeln.de,,"Wetzel, Heike/0000-0002-3945-6318",,,,,45,17,17,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

We use student scores from tests administered by the international consortium Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) for a number of MENA countries and over time since 1999 to estimate the effect of circumstances children are born into on their academic achievement in science and mathematics. We find that inequality of opportunities explains a significant part of the inequality in educational achievements in most MENA countries, but there is ample heterogeneity. Family background variables are the most important determinants of inequality in achievement, followed by community characteristics. The results show that, despite great efforts in past decades to invest in free public education, most MENA countries are less opportunity equal in educational achievement than European countries, and several are less so than Latin America and the United States. From the variation in inequality of education opportunities across countries and over time we draw lessons on the influence of different education systems or changes in policy on equality of opportunity.","[Salehi-Isfahani, Djavad] Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Salehi-Isfahani, Djavad] ERF, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Hassine, Nadia Belhaj] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Assaad, Ragui] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Assaad, Ragui] ERF, Minneapolis, MN USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; The World Bank; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Salehi-Isfahani, D (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",salehi@vt.edu,,"Assaad, Ragui/0000-0002-2608-5335",,,,,38,30,40,2,28,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Coefficients are consistently estimable by nonparametric mean regression with square density weighted average derivatives (SWADE). Relaxed requirements for SWADE allow more general applications. The asymptotic distribution of SWADE is equivalent in precision to the aforementioned average derivatives estimators (PSSE and HSE). Monte Carlo simulations show that SWADE outperforms HSE in finite sample but is slightly and weakly outweighed by PSSE. These imply that SWADE allows more flexible applications with relaxed distributional characteristics than PSSE and HSE at the expense of slightly deteriorated behavior in finite sample.","Hongik Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 121791, South Korea",Hongik University,"Sung, MJ (通讯作者)，Hongik Univ, Sch Econ, 94 Wausan Ro, Seoul 121791, South Korea.",mjaesung@hongik.ac.kr,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,10,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

For this, we use data on families migrating into Sweden from countries that are poorer, with less healthy conditions. Late-life health is proxied by adult height and other adult outcomes. The relation between siblings' ages at migration and their adult outcomes allows us to estimate the causal effect of conditions at specific childhood ages. We effectively exploit that, for siblings, the migration occurs simultaneously in calendar time but at different developmental stages (ages). We find evidence that the period just before the puberty growth spurt constitutes a critical period for adult height and we find related critical periods for adult cognition, mental health, and education.","[van den Berg, Gerard J.] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] IFAU Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden; [Lundborg, Petter] Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Nystedt, Paul] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Nystedt, Paul] Jonkoping Acad Improvement Hlth & Welf, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Rooth, Dan-Olof] Linnaeus Univ, Smaland, Sweden",University of Mannheim; Lund University; Jonkoping University; Linnaeus University,"van den Berg, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",vandenberg@uni-mannheim.de; petter.lundborg@nek.lu.se; paul.nystedt@jibs.hj.se; dan-olof.rooth@lnu.se,,"Rooth, Dan-Olof/0000-0001-8887-5677",,,,,50,50,55,2,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

CO2 certificate trading is then advocated as a first best instrument for emission abatement in Europe, the US and beyond. An important element of the trading scheme is the initial allocation of allowances. This article is to show how permit allocation rules, applied within an Emission Trading System (ETS), interfere with the long-term pricing and investment on power markets. In particular it is demonstrated that free allocation of certificates contingent on plant availability and fuel used is likely to provide distorting incentives both for continued operation of existing plants and for investments. Consequently, marginal abatement costs within the ETS are increased above efficient levels and new power plant investments may crowd out excessively older power plants. Analytical results are derived for two technology cases and a numerical case study is devoted to the EU 27 power sector.","[Weber, Christoph; Vogel, Philip] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Weber, C (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany.",christoph.weber@uni-due.de,"Weber, Christoph/A-5780-2010","Weber, Christoph/0000-0003-0197-7991",,,,,41,6,6,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The empirical strategy used to estimate the island effect proceeds in two steps: first an augmented gravity model is estimated for mainland and island regions; then a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition is applied to the gravity estimation results in order to disentangle the distance and border effects for those regions. Results show that island regions are at a substantial disadvantage compared to continental regions, which is due to the higher and non-linear effect of distance coefficients.","[Luis Groizard, Jose; Marques, Helena; Santana, Maria] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma De Mallorca, Balearic Island, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Marques, H (通讯作者)，Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma De Mallorca, Balearic Island, Spain.",joseluis.groizard@uib.es; helena.ferreira-marques@uib.es; maria.santana@uib.es,"Groizard, José L./L-3676-2017","Groizard, José L./0000-0002-0772-1156",,,,,44,2,2,1,3,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 13,2014,8,,,,,,,,201440.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-40,0.0,,,46,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CL4AQ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356894900001,0

If current economic policies are dysfunctional, could information about alternatives sway the voters? We examine if a simple argument emphasizing the need to increase electricity prices for improved supply can change public opinion in the case of India's power sector reforms. The evidence comes from a survey experiment in rural Uttar Pradesh, which is both India's largest state and has one of the lowest levels of household electrification. As expected, people respond to information about the relationship between electricity pricing, capacity investment, and reliability of supply by increasing their support for higher prices. However, no corresponding increase is observed for privatization of electricity generation. For external validity, we analyze an existing national survey on electricity privatization conducted in 2004/2005, finding patterns that support our argument.","[Aklin, Michael; Harish, S.

This article provides a novel examination of whether the part-time training gap is gender-dependent. Using a Swiss dataset, we find that men engaged in part-time employment suffer from a serious training disadvantage in comparison to men working full-time and that this effect is not found for women. Thus, in countries where part-time participation levels differ significantly between men and women, part-time employment is a bane to men but not to women.

The entry model accounts for post-entry demand conditions and strategic spillover effects. I recover a brewer's fixed costs using a two-step estimator and find spillover effects on brewers' entry decisions. I find that a brewer has higher fixed costs at locations where Anheuser Busch employ exclusive distributors, but the effect is only statistically significant in certain local areas. The estimates also show that a brewer is less likely to enter a location that is farther from its brewery, has lower expected demand, or is smaller in store size. I implement counterfactual experiments to study the effect of banning exclusive contracts between Anheuser Busch and its distributors. The results show that the welfare improvement associated with banning such contracts is very small. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In a framework that allows project returns to accrue over time, as well as strategic default, we show that sequential lending can help resolve problems arising out of coordinated default, thus improving project efficiency vis-a-vis individual lending. Inter alia, we also provide a justification for the use of frequent repayment schemes, as well as demonstrate that, depending on how it is manifested, social capital has implications for project efficiency and borrower default. We next examine the optimal choices for the MFI and derive conditions for the optimality of the group lending arrangement. Our framework also provides for some plausible hypotheses as to why there has been a recent transition from group to individual lending. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We characterise the perfect equilibrium of a supergame in which LM firms play an infinitely repeated Cournot game under grim trigger strategies.

First, the severity of the consequences of disasters depends not only on the natural hazards, but also on societal factors. Second, the effects of the disasters on physical and human capital could go far beyond the directly observable loss of properties and lives. Third, disasters could have positive long-term consequences if they lead to a change in the total factor productivity of the economy. Fourth, the effects of disasters could spread beyond the country of origin, naturally and economically. Finally, assistance from the government provides implicit insurance that could crowd out private insurance, but the failures of the government in dealing with recent catastrophic disasters may help reduce the extent of this effect.","Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Samphantharak, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",krislert@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,34,14,17,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

We construct a single-knowledge-stock model of R&D, growth and climate to assess the importance of this effect. The contribution of induced R&D is shown to be very sensitive to (i) the duplication externality, (ii) the feasibility of dedicated research subsidies to internalize inter-firm knowledge spillovers, (iii) the opportunity cost of R&D, (iv) the initial level of research expenditure, and (v) the elasticity of substitution between energy and other factors of production. In contrast, the direction and scale of the inter-temporal research spillover are of secondary importance. We find strong support for Rezai's (2011) argument that, when the business-as-usual scenario (no policy) is modeled appropriately (all externalities treated as external), sacrifices for early generations associated with optimal climate policy are minor or non-existent. Employing our preferred selections for the parameters, we find that adding an induced R&D component to the model increases the welfare impact of the first-best policy (optimally chosen carbon tax and research subsidies) by an average value of more than 400%, and of the second-best policy (carbon tax alone) by approximately 22%.

Second, a rule is identified with a set of parametric functions indexed by the claimants, and for a given claims problem, each claimant receives the value of his parametric function at a common parameter value, but truncated by his claim. Third, a rule is identified with an additively separable, strictly concave social welfare function, and for a given claims problem, the amount awarded is the maximizer of the social welfare function subject to the constraint of choosing a feasible award.

Using state-and-sector level US exports data, this paper shows analytically and proves empirically that ignoring the internal location of production (of international exports), which leads to the overestimation of distance effects by about twofold, is a possible explanation. This overestimation is mostly attributed to the mismeasurement of the distance elasticity of trade costs when internal locations of production are ignored. A corrective distance index is proposed to avoid such mismeasurements and is shown to work well for the median sector.

We define labour market exposure as the cumulated amount of excess unemployment generated by a shock before unemployment returns to steady-state. We use a panel of 19 countries covering the period 1985-2010 to assess the influence of labour market policies on labour market exposure, which is also calculated country by country. We find that less generous unemployment insurance, more active labour market policies or a lower minimum wage imply a trade-off between average unemployment and labour market exposure, as they help low-skilled workers to get out of unemployment at the cost of increased vulnerability to adverse shocks. On the other hand, reducing the tax wedge is conducive to both lower steady-state unemployment and labour market exposure.

This measure of information exchanges is useful given that it may be used to detect various types of asymmetry in the interaction among two systems and, thus, distinguishes between driving and responding forces. We examine the European Union's case for a time span between 1995 and 2011 and conclude that Northern Europe, the Germanic countries, the United Kingdom and Ireland are generating the dominant net information outflows.

This paper analyzes the effects of introducing a coordinated cross-border tax relief in a setting where multinational firms choose the size of a risky investment and host countries non-cooperatively choose tax rates. We show that coordinated cross-border loss compensation may intensify tax competition when, following current international practice, the parent firm's home country bases the tax rebate for a loss-making subsidiary on its own tax rate. In equilibrium, tax revenue losses may thus be even higher than is implied by the direct effect of the reform. In contrast, tax competition is mitigated when the home country bases its loss relief on the tax rate in the subsidiary's host country. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The magnitude of the requested assistance is extremely large relative to GDP (100%) and studying this event provides useful lessons for avoiding such crises in the future. The crisis resulted from a worsening European economic environment (especially in Greece), bad choices with regards to public finances, weak corporate governance within the local banking sector, inadequate and/or difficult regulation of cross-border banking, worsening competitiveness, and bad political decisions at the European and, especially, the local (Cypriot) level. Local politics, reflected in short-term political calculations and/or inadequate understanding of the magnitude of the crisis, delayed corrective action for 18months until election time, making a bad situation almost impossible to deal with.

To date, all studies in this field have been based on the assumption that matching processes only transpire within distinct occupational labour markets and that no occupational changes occur. I present theoretical and empirical arguments that undermine the validity of this assumption. I construct an 'occupational topology' based on information about the ways occupational groups may be seen as alternatives in searches for jobs or workers. I then use different empirical models that consider cross-sectional dependency to test the hypothesis that job search and matching occur across occupational labour markets. The results support my hypothesis. The findings suggest that an augmented empirical model should be used that considers job and worker searches across occupational labour markets in estimating job matching elasticities.","IAB, Inst Employment Res, D-90479 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Stops, M (通讯作者)，IAB, Inst Employment Res, Weddigenstr 20-22, D-90479 Nurnberg, Germany.",michael.stops@iab.de,"Stops, Michael/R-6702-2017","Stops, Michael/0000-0002-8620-6338",,,,,41,11,12,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We observed a positive correlation between the WLB practices and TFP among sampled firms. However that correlation vanished when we controlled for the unobserved firm heterogeneity, and we found no general causal relationship in which WLB practices increase firm TFP in the medium or long run. For firms with the following characteristics, however, we found positive and sizable effects: large firms, manufacturing firms, and firms that have exhibited labor hoarding during recessions. Since these firms are likely to incur large fixed employment costs, we infer that firms investing in firm-specific human skills or having large hiring/firing costs can benefit from WLB practices through a decrease in turnover or increase in recruiting effectiveness.","[Yamamoto, Isamu] Keio Univ, Fac Business & Commerce, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; [Matsuura, Toshiyuki] Keio Univ, Keio Econ Observ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University; Keio University,"Yamamoto, I (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Business & Commerce, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",yamamoto@fbc.keio.ac.jp; matsuura@sanken.keio.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26380371, 24000003, 23530289] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,23,3,3,0,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In this paper, we study this question using a two-country (North-South) extension of Acemoglu et al. (2012) which introduces directed technical change into a general equilibrium model of climate change. We find that, first, the optimal policy necessarily requires global policy coordination, with the implementation of research subsidies and carbon taxes in both North and South. Second, under certain circumstances, appropriately chosen environmental regulations in the North alone can prevent the worst environmental disasters. In particular, such disasters can be prevented by a combination of carbon taxes and clean research subsidies under the restrictive conditions that (a) the two inputs are substitutable in both countries; (b) there is no international trade between the North and the South; and (c) the South imitates technologies invented in the North. Third, international trade between the North and the South typically makes it more difficult to prevent environmental disasters through unilateral policies in the North, because environmental regulation in the North may induce full specialization by the South in dirty input production, as imitation of clean technologies by the South then ceases to be profitable. Hence, given current circumstances, global policy coordination is highly desirable.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Acemoglu, Daron; Aghion, Philippe] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hemous, David] INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France; [Hemous, David] CEPR, Aulnay Sous Bois, France",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; INSEAD Business School,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",daron@mit.edu; paghion@fas.harvard.edu; david.hemous@insead.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023","Hemous, David/0000-0001-6024-5294",,,,,44,45,49,10,121,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In a setting where players' preferences are represented by maxmin expected utility, as characterized in Gilboa and Schmeidler (J Math Econ 18(2):141-153, 1989), our definitions capture the intuition that players may consider the possibility of slight arbitrary mistakes. This generalizes the idea leading to trembling-hand perfect equilibrium as introduced in Selten (Int J Game Theory 4(1):25-55, 1975), by allowing for ambiguous trembles characterized by sets of distributions. We prove existence for two of our equilibrium notions and relate our definitions to standard equilibrium concepts with expected utility maximizing players. Our analysis shows that ambiguity aversion can lead to behavioral implications that are distinct from those attained under expected utility maximization, even if ambiguous beliefs only arise from the possibility of slight mistakes in the implementation of unambiguous strategies.","[Aryal, Gaurab] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Stauber, Ronald] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Chicago; Australian National University,"Stauber, R (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",aryalg@uchicago.edu; ronald.stauber@anu.edu.au,,"Stauber, Ronald/0000-0001-6373-4034",,,,,39,9,11,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

It uses a structural VAR analysis to identify credit supply shocks separately from standard macroeconomic shocks. It finds that credit supply shocks can account for most of the weakness in bank lending since the onset of the recent financial crisis and 1/3 - 1/2 of the fall in GDP relative to its historic trend.

In this paper, I argue that SOEs' inefficiency is not due to state ownership per se, but is rather caused conditions other than ownership, to which SOEs often - though not necessarily always - relate. In particular, I focus on dynamic efficiency - specifically, the production of technological innovation - of SOEs in manufacturing industries, where SOEs should contend with POEs in a competitive environment. I suggest that targeted measures, which are aimed at increasing managers' commitment to long-term investment strategies and at reducing corruption and political interference - albeit complex and difficult to implement can be much more (positively) impactful on long-run technical progress than the simple privatization of companies. This leaves room for exploration and implementation of policies that might reconcile state ownership and market competition in industrial sectors.","Univ G DAnnunzio, Dept Econ Studies, Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Belloc, F (通讯作者)，Univ G DAnnunzio, Dept Econ Studies, Pescara, Italy.",,,,,,,,120,52,58,7,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This mode of unionism, which may be characterized as macro-focused, requires the trade union to work closely with the ruling party in order to contribute to economic development. The required symbiosis between such a trade union and the ruling party may not be sustainable when there is a change in government. This paper argues that a union can remain macro-focused as long as it is not part of any political party and therefore can work with any government regardless of which political party is in power. The paper will examine the various conditions, both economic and non-economic, under which such an outcome can exist and be sustainable. The paper will also analyze how a macro-focused union induces workers to join the union based on the results of a field survey of 690 respondents in Singapore.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanaties & Social Sci, Div Econ, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Beng, CS (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanaties & Social Sci, Div Econ, Singapore, Singapore.",asbchew@ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,12,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

However, when the economies in Eastern Europe started transforming into market economies, they suddenly experienced high and volatile inflation rates. Transformation countries are therefore interesting laboratories for studying individual inflation aversion. In this paper we study the level and determinants of individual inflation aversion in the three Baltic countries. Using data from 11 waves of the Eurobarometer survey, we find age, education and the macroeconomic situation to have significant effects on the likelihood to mention inflation among the most important problems facing the country. Moreover, we find the populations of all three Baltic countries to be significantly more inflation averse than the population of the United Kingdom, a western democracy with a long tradition as a market economy. We attribute this finding to the specific experiences of the Baltic populations with inflation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is well known that an optimal experimentation strategy for such problems sometimes results in the best alternative being dropped altogether, which is the so-called Rothschild effect. Many experimentation problems of interest, however, involve learning from both individual experience and the experience of others. This paper shows that learning in society can overcome the Rothschild effect. We consider an economy with a continuum of infinitely lived players in which each player faces a multi-armed bandit and in each period a player observes the action choice of another randomly chosen player. We show that social conformity always happens in the long run, and we use this fact to derive a condition on the distribution of prior beliefs that implies that the fraction of players who choose the best alternative always converges to one in the long run.

We propose that this dramatic migration was rooted in institutional changes initiated by the 1906 Stolypin land titling reform. One might expect better property rights to decrease the propensity to migrate by improving economic conditions in the reform area. However, this titling reform increased land liquidity and actually promoted migration by easing financial constraints and decreasing opportunity costs. Treating the reform as a quasi-natural experiment, we employ difference-in-differences analysis on a panel of province-level data that describe migration and economic conditions. We find that the reform had a sizeable effect on migration. To verify the land liquidity effect, we exploit variation in the number of households participating in the reform. This direct measure of the reform mechanism estimates that land liquidity explains approximately 18% of migration during this period. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Based on some 78,000 firm-year observations from 40 countries over the period 1990-2007, we show that good shareholder rights lower financial frictions, especially for firms with large external finance relative to their capital stock (e.g., small, growing or distressed firms). However, creditor rights generally do not affect financial frictions. It thus appears that in explaining cross-country differences in firm investment, frictions related to shareholder rights (e.g., shirking or tunneling) are more relevant than debt-related frictions (e.g., limited liability or collateral constraints).

To answer this, Energex and Ergon Energy conducted one of the largest tariff trials in Australia. The trial investigated time of use, dynamic peak pricing and load capacity tariffs across three climatic regions. This article presents empirical and participant survey results from the 27-month trial. Results show participants across all regions achieved approximately a 19 per cent reduction in consumption during peak times on event days.

Herds cannot occur if congestion on every action can get so large that an agent prefers a different action regardless of his beliefs about the state. To the extent that switching away from the more popular action reveals private information, it improves learning. The absence of herding does not guarantee complete (asymptotic) learning, however, as information cascades can occur through perpetual but uninformative switching between actions. We provide conditions on congestion costs that guarantee complete learning and conditions that guarantee bounded learning. Learning can be virtually complete even if each agent has only an infinitesimal effect on congestion costs. We apply our results to markets where congestion costs arise through responsive pricing and to queuing problems where agents dislike waiting for service. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In the considered model, a continuum of households with different income levels and the same preference for local public goods, private spending and housing choose a location from a finite set. Each location has an initial endowment of housing that is priced competitively and that belongs to absentee landlords. Each location is also endowed with a specific technology for producing public goods. Households' preferences are assumed to be homothetically separable between local public goods on the one hand and private spending and housing on the other. Public goods provision is financed by a given, but unspecified, mixture of (linear) wealth and housing taxes. It is shown that stable jurisdiction structures are segregated by income only if households have a Marshallian demand for any public good (conditionally on the quantities of the other public goods) that is a monotonic function of the price of private spending. It is also shown that if there is only one public good, or if household preferences are additively separable between public and private goods, then the condition is also sufficient for segregation. Examples showing the sensitivity of the results to the assumptions of homothetic separability and additive separability are also provided.

We re-examine the relationship between inflation and unemployment in the long run, using quarterly US data from 1952 to 2010, and state-of-the art econometric methods. Using a band-pass filter approach, we find strong evidence that a positive relationship exists, where inflation leads unemployment by some 3-31/2 years, in cycles that last from 8 to 25 or 50 years. Tests for multiple structural changes at unknown dates show that this relationship is stable. Our statistical approach is atheoretical in nature, but provides evidence in accordance with the predictions of Friedman (1977) and the recent New Monetarist model of Berentsen et al.

As a result, an increase in the variance of shocks to the trend inflation process decreases welfare not only by increasing the volatilities of consumption and leisure, but also by decreasing their average levels. I find that the welfare cost of drifting trend inflation is modest and that it comes mainly from reduced average levels of consumption and leisure, not from their increased volatilities.

The development was extraordinary due to its size and because it was based on small firms, the study of which contributed to the rediscovery of the Marshallian industrial district. In recent decades Prato has become increasingly known for the rise of the largest agglomeration in Italy of Chinese immigrants' businesses specialised in fast fashion clothing. Despite the attention devoted to this phenomenon, how and why the Chinese in Prato were so successful remains somewhat of a mystery. This paper explores the case of the Chinese in Prato, considering first their influx into the district as subcontractors and then their transformation into final producers of pronto moda.

We show that there is no a priori assurance of substantial positive spillovers from environmental policies to income growth, or for a monotonic transition to a 'green steady state' along an optimal path. The greenness of an optimal growth path can depend heavily on initial conditions, with a variety of different adjustments occurring concurrently along an optimal path.

Managers play a peculiar role in the economy, both because of their supervisory function - which results in surplus extraction and wage inequality - and because of their saving behavior. The adjustment of capacity utilization to accommodate goods market disequilibrium produces two distinct regimes with respect to the responsiveness of investment demand to profitability: a low investment-response regime, where effective demand appears to be both wage-led and inequality-led; and a high investment-response regime, where demand looks profit-led. In accordance with recent empirical evidence for the US, we introduce distributional dynamics that hinge on inequality squeezing workers' wage growth. We find that the low investment-responsiveness regime produces a stable demand-distribution equilibrium only if the wage squeeze effect is relatively small. On the other hand, the equilibrium in the high investment-response regime is saddle-path stable. The main distributional implication of the wage squeeze and inequality is that the effect of redistribution toward workers in both the low investment response regime and the high investment response regime leads to declining inequality and capacity utilization. Hence, in both regimes, the inequality-led features of the equilibrium dominate the wage-led or profit-led nature of effective demand. These findings imply that distributive dynamics lead to a stronger basis for cohesion in the interests of managers and capitalists compared to workers and managers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this model, the ratio of financial income to GDP increases with the ratio of aggregate wealth to GDP. Both rise along the convergence path to steady state growth.

An instrumental variable estimator is used to account for the endogeneity of the tariff reduction. The results indicate that China's trade liberalization in the five years following its WTO entry has led to a 0.94% annual increase in total factor productivity for Chinese manufacturing firms. However, the overall productivity gain from the tariff reduction is a net result of a productivity depressing effect of output tariff reduction and a productivity enhancing effect of input tariff reduction. Both effects have diminished in magnitude over the years after China joined the WTO. Firm heterogeneity and turnover plays an important role in generating gains from trade liberalization. The surviving firms have managed to cope with and take advantage of lower tariffs. The extent to which the tariff reduction affects Chinese firms' productivity is also dependent on the ownership structure of the firms with foreign-invested firms being the clear winner.","[Hu, Albert Guangzhou; Liu, Zhengning] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117568, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Hu, AG (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117568, Singapore.",ecshua@nus.edu.sg,"HU, ALBERT/JXN-4272-2024; Hu, Albert Guangzhou/O-9460-2017","Hu, Albert Guangzhou/0000-0003-3686-4882",,,,,41,29,34,1,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Results reveal that tourism development and carbon emissions are in long-term equilibrium relationship: carbon dioxide emission converges to its long-term equilibrium level by 76.0% speed of adjustment through the channels of tourism, energy consumption, and output growth. Tourist arrivals have a negatively significant effects on carbon dioxide emission levels both in the long-term and the short-term periods. Finally, results of the Granger causality tests reveal that there is unidirectional causality that runs from tourism development to carbon emission growth in the long-term of the economy of Singapore.

At the same time, and as a result of the continuous enlargement processes it has undergone, the European Union (EU) is a very interesting case to study how the reforms that enhance logistics performance have affected exports. Therefore, this paper aims to analyse the importance of logistics performance in regard to EU exports over the period 2005-2010 in an attempt to identify possible advances on behalf of Member States. Several gravity equations are estimated using the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) and its components as characteristic proxy variables of trade facilitation. In order to avoid the possible heterogeneity caused by sample bias, the two-stage model proposed by Heckman is used. The estimations of the gravity models using the two-stage Heckman model for all 26 EU countries have led us to conclude that logistics was more important for exporting nations than importing nations in both 2005 and 2010, reinforcing the interest in the exporter side of the paper.

We test this method to deal with several problems, especially those in stochastic volatility environments. We introduce stochastic state variables into volatility dynamics and analyse the influence of state-variable volatile characters on investment stopping boundaries. For arbitrary coefficient circumstances, we set up a Riccati equation that satisfies the transformation. For circumstances involving Heston stochastic-volatility, we propose an analytical solution. This paper extends research on the optimal investment stopping issue to a stochastic investment opportunity environment.

We find most emerging equity markets are independent in limiting joint extremes. However, the dependence in finite levels of extremes is still much stronger than the dependence implied by multivariate normality. Therefore, simple correlation analysis can lead to gross underestimation of the chances of joint crashes in multiple markets. Assuming risk-averse investors guarding against extreme losses, diversification benefits are measured for each two-country optimal portfolio by the reduction in quantile risk measures such as value-at-risk and expected shortfall relative to an undiversified portfolio. It is shown that tail dependence measures developed from multivariate extreme value theory are negatively related to diversification benefits and more importantly can explain diversification benefits better than the correlation coefficient at the most extreme quantiles.","Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Policy Anal Unit, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond,"Ergen, I (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Policy Anal Unit, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",ibrahim.ergen@rich.frb.org,"ergen, ibrahim/R-4233-2019",,,,,,20,6,6,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article focuses on the scope of these institutional investors when they are not satisfied with a management team of a company in which the pension fund holds a block of shares. Stock holdings by pension funds are largely dispersed. Therefore, any intervention by pension funds in corporate governance requires the formation of a coalition of pension funds. The realization of a coordinated intervention, in turn, is subject to the problems related to the provision of public goods, such as free riding. We find that the stock dispersion and the combined share of pension funds, coordination costs and the attractiveness of the exit option are relevant factors for determining the probability of the success of interventions.","[Schaefer, Andreas] Univ Leipzig, Inst Theoret Econ Macroecon, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [von Arx, Urs] Univ Zurich, ETH Zurich CER ETH, Ctr Econ Res, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [von Arx, Urs] Univ Zurich, CCRS, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",Leipzig University; University of Zurich; University of Zurich,"von Arx, U (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, ETH Zurich CER ETH, Ctr Econ Res, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",uvonarx@ethz.ch,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019","Schaefer, Andreas/0000-0002-4703-7914",,,,,25,5,5,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Specifically, we investigate the impact of switching from a weak to a strong state-level FOIA law on corruption convictions of state and local government officials. The evidence suggests that strengthening FOIA laws has two offsetting effects: reducing corruption and increasing the probability that corrupt acts are detected. The conflation of these two effects led prior work to find little impact of FOIA on corruption. We find that conviction rates approximately double after the switch, which suggests an increase in detection probabilities. However, conviction rates decline from this new elevated level as the time since the switch from weak to strong FOIA increases. This decline is consistent with officials reducing the rate at which they commit corrupt acts by about 20%. These changes are more pronounced in states with more intense media coverage, for those that had more substantial changes in their FOIA laws, for FOIA laws which include strong liabilities for officials who contravene them, for local officials, and for more serious crimes. Conviction rates of federal officials, who are not subject to the policy, show no concomitant change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The goal is to derive consistent estimates of the short-run price elasticity of crude oil supply at the country level. I find that oil producers hardly respond to demand shocks within the same month, and that the corresponding impact price elasticities of supply are statistically indistinguishable from zero. While there is little evidence of differences in the dynamic responses to a typical flow demand shock, on average over the sample period, OPEC members seem to curtail production in response to a speculative demand shock, whereas non-OPEC production expands significantly. Flow and speculative demand shocks account for a nontrivial fraction of the total variability in country-level crude oil supply. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

The model's implications change significantly in this setting: with hidden income, stronger warm glow will lead to greater crowd out, not less.

In this paper we extend their analysis and assume that lobbies have private information to analyze the effects of information transmission in a Grossman and Helpman lobby game. Information transmission leads to two agency costs. One refers to the cost of signaling and the other to the cost of screening the lobby's competitiveness. The signaling cost reduces distortions resulting from the screening cost. On the other hand, distortions from the screening cost enhance the signaling cost. The two combined effects generate more distortions in the political game than each effect separately. Tariff protection and lobbies' rents are lower than those found in Grossman and Helpman's truthful equilibrium. Therefore, information transmission may improve welfare through the reduction of rent-seeking activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Will continued structural transformation in these countries result in a permanently higher oil price? To address these issues I identify an inverted-U shaped relationship in the data between aggregate oil intensity and the extent of structural transformation: countries in the middle stages of transition spend the highest fraction of their income on oil. I construct and calibrate a multi-sector, multi-country, general equilibrium growth model that accounts for this fact by generating an endogenously falling aggregate elasticity of substitution between oil and non-oil inputs. The model is used to measure and isolate the impact of changing sectoral composition in the developing world on global oil demand and the oil price in the OECD. I find that structural transformation in non-OECD countries accounts for up to 53% of the oil price increase in the OECD between 1970 and 2010. However, the impact of structural transformation is temporary. Continued structural transformation induces falling oil intensity and an easing of the upward pressure on the oil price. Since a standard one-sector growth model misses this non-linearity, to understand the impact of growth on the oil price, it is necessary to take a more disaggregated view than is standard in macroeconomics.

China's projected future development, especially increasing urbanization, implies that such migration will further intensify. However, migration does not come without cost. There are concerns about the potential negative impacts of migration on children's care, education, and, in particular, the self-esteem of children left behind in villages where one or both parents have out-migrated to cities. In this paper, we employ unique survey data collected from Shaanxi Province, where more than 4700 ninth grade students from 36 rural junior high schools in five counties were surveyed in late 2011. The results show that having both parents migrate into cities significantly reduced children's self-esteem. The effects are also gender sensitive. Girls that had a father or both parents who had out-migrated were inclined to have lower self-esteem than boys. Moreover, our study findings indicate that parental migration decreased children's self-esteem more for individuals with initial low self-esteem.","[Zhan, Xuefeng; Li, Shaoping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Xuefeng; Li, Shaoping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chengfang; Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Zhang, LX (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhanxf.09b@igsnrr.ac.cn; lisp.11b@igsnrr.ac.cn; cfliu.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023",,,,,,40,16,18,2,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2014,22,4,,,,,83,101,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12076.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AN4YU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340596700005,0

The literature suggests that good managers use employee ownership as a reward management tool, whereas bad managers implement it for entrenchment, thus suggesting the existence of an equilibrium level of employee ownership. The contributions of this paper are both theoretical and empirical. Theoretically, this paper fills a gap in the published research by taking into account both positive and negative outcomes of employee ownership. Our model produces three main conclusions: (i) Low-performing managers use employee ownership as an entrenchment mechanism (ii) that increases the signaling cost of employee ownership for high-performing managers. (iii) We suggest that employee ownership should not be left only to the management's discretion because both types of managers have an incentive to implement employee ownership. Our empirical study investigates how employee ownership affects management tenure. This study takes into account the two main motives for employee ownership examined by the model (i.e., management entrenchment and reward management). We find a positive relationship between employee ownership and management tenure. This result provides new evidence that employee ownership can be used as an entrenchment mechanism.

This study constructs monthly indices of exchange market pressure (EMP) for Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda over the past decade. Two methods of constructing these indices are shown to exhibit large differences. Vector autoregressive approaches are then applied to the main EMP series and a set of global stock price proxies. Kenya, the dominant economy, is shown to have the largest effect on the region but is not itself affected by other regional currencies. Foreign stock price declines increase EMP for all countries except Tanzania, which is also the least integrated in terms of trade.

We also analyse the profit and welfare effects of multiple-task delegation. It has been shown in the literature that, when there is only one delegation task - output determination - delegation of output decisions to managers leads to lower profits for owners than non-delegation as pure profit-maximisation. However, when there are two delegation tasks as in our model output determination and wage bargaining - we show that owners are better off delegating both tasks than delegating only the output decision or not delegating at all. This result provides a rationale and managerial insight for strategically delegating multiple tasks to managers. Moreover, we show that union utility, consumer surplus and social welfare are all higher when owners do not delegate the task of wage bargaining than when they do. This result suggests that governments implement union contracts that require owners, rather than managers, to negotiate wages with unions in order to benefit unions and consumers and to improve social welfare as well.","[Liao, Pei-Cheng] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Liao, PC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Accounting, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",pcliao@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,40,6,6,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

A benchmark inter-daily GJR-GARCH model is also employed. Based on four asset classes, i.e. equity, FOREX, fixed income and commodity, and a turbulent six year out-of-sample period (2007-2013), we find that statistical accuracy and regulatory compliance is essentially improved when we use quantile methods which account for the fat tails and the asymmetry of the innovations distribution. In particular, empirical analysis gives evidence in favor of the skewed student distribution and the Extreme Value Theory (EVT) method. Nonetheless, efficiency of VaR estimates, as defined by the minimization of Basel II capital requirements and its opportunity costs, is reassured only with the use of realized volatility models. Overall, empirical evidence support the use of an asymmetric HAR realized volatility model coupled with the EVT method since it produces statistically accurate VaR forecasts which comply with Basel II accuracy mandates and allows for more efficient capital allocations.

The key anomalies considered are (1) the persistence of inflation, both in reduced form and after conditioning on inflation's driving processes, (2) the positive correlation between the output gap and the change in the inflation rate, and (3) the apparent bias in survey measures of expected inflation. The Taylor rule in this model includes the now standard assumption that the central bank smoothes changes to its target interest rate. It also includes Markov switching of a persistent inflation target between a low target rate and a high target rate. The model is calibrated to match Benati's (2008) result that, historically, changes in monetary policy lead to a statistically significant change in the persistence of inflation. Matching Benati's result requires a reduction in an exogenous, hence structural, source of persistence. However, inflation in the model inherits additional, non-structural, persistence from the process that governs the inflation target. As a result, the model is able to replicate measures of inflation persistence, even after conditioning on inflation's driving processes. Agents with rational expectations and knowledge of the current inflation target will be aware of the possibility of a future target switch, causing their expectations to appear biased in small samples. Finally, with sticky nominal prices a discrete drop to the low-inflation target requires a loss of output while previously-set prices adjust. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We estimate augmented Taylor (1993) rules for the period 1976Q2-1994Q1 using the dynamic GMM estimator. We find, first, that interest rates did reflect society's preferences since the central banks raised rates when society's inflation aversion was above its long-run trend. Second, the reaction to inflation is was non-linearly increasing in the degree of inflation aversion. Third, this emphasis on fighting inflation did not have a detrimental effect on output stabilization. We conclude with some implications concerning the democratic legitimation of central banks.

By denying migrant workers the right to health benefits and housing, China's Household Registration (Hukou) system presents a significant distortion to the Chinese labor market that discourages the reallocation of its labor from agriculture to non-agriculture. I find that the elimination of Hukou could increase China's real income per capita by about 4.7%. Moreover, although for most countries the impact of removing Hukou is modest (less than 1% changes in real income per capita), substantial changes in real income could take place for China's small neighboring economies. For example, the decreases in real GDP per capita are 2.7%, 3.2%, and 4.1% for Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam, while Thailand stands to enjoy a 3.8% increase in its income. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Estimates from all models show that financial market development, including both the stock market and the banking sector, has significant effect on trade openness in both short-run and long-run phenomena in the majority of countries.

We find that the probability that the wife is responsible for decisions increases as the wife's characteristics in terms of age, education and income become closer or even higher than those of her husband's. Thus, consistently with a bargaining approach, decision-making responsibility is associated with marriage heterogamy, and not only along strictly economic dimensions. However, in support of an alternative household production approach, we also find that the probability that the wife is responsible is lower when she is employed, which suggests the presence of a specialization pattern assigning responsibility to the spouse with more available time. Our results are robust to additional controls and alternative samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We use micro data from Puerto Rico, where unskilled laborers were forced to work for landowners during 1849-1874. Using variation in municipality-level suitability for coffee cultivation and international coffee prices, we estimate the response of schooling to exogenous increases in relative demand for unskilled labor in regimes with and without forced labor. During the coercive regime, increased coffee prices had no effect on individuals' literacy rates in coffee growing regions. Following the abolition of forced labor in 1874, similar changes in coffee prices reduced literacy rates by 12%, consistent with a diminished skill premium in the free labor market regime relative to the coercive period.

As a result, ideas that are flawed can come to dominate the profession, while useful ideas are left on the proverbial side-walk of intellectual affairs.

In contrast to WY selection, however, we require selection to be robust to misspecifications of payoffs. Robust selection is a strong notion in the sense that, among types with multiple rationalizable actions, almost all selections are fragile; but it is also a weak notion in the sense that any strictly rationalizable action can be robustly selected. We show that robust selection is fully characterized by the curb collection, a notion that generalizes the curb set in [2].

In order to find a solution of reasonable quality, some amount of communication is required. We study algorithms where the communication is substantially less than the size of the game. When the communication is polylogarithmic in the number of strategies, we show how to obtain epsilon-approximate Nash equilibrium for epsilon approximate to 0.438, and for well-supported approximate equilibria we obtain epsilon approximate to 0.732. For one-way communication we show that epsilon = 1/2 is the best approximation quality achievable, while for well-supported equilibria, no value of epsilon < 1 is achievable. When the players do not communicate at all, epsilon-Nash equilibria can be obtained for epsilon = 3/4; we also provide a corresponding lower bound of slightly more than 1/2 on the smallest constant epsilon achievable.

To deal with structural breaks in the models, firstly, a dummy for the recent financial crisis was added. Secondly, a Kalman (J Basic Eng 82(1):35-45, 1960) filter model allowing for time-varying coefficients was estimated to cope with remaining breaks.

This may be due to the diluting effect of different tax regimes across countries and time on estimates of bequest motives. Relative to market-based economies, the former German Democratic Republic can be viewed as an experimental institutional setting where life-insurance demand was not influenced by tax considerations. This allows isolating bequest motives from other life-cycle and precautionary savings motives. Analyzing the demand for life insurance, we find a significantly higher ownership probability among households with children and a high regard for the family, confirming bequest motives in life-insurance demand.","[Sauter, Nicolas] Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Sauter, N (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich Grad Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Marchioninistr 15, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",nicolas.sauter@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,24,7,7,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

A unique feature of this paper is the use of monthly deposit interest rates posted by 106 regional banks from March 1999 to March 2010. Following the theoretical results from a simple banking activity model with Cournot competition, I estimate the long run pass-through of each regional bank utilizing the panel cointegration method. The empirical results of this paper show a significant negative correlation between regional market concentration and pass-through, which implies the existence of geographical market segmentation.

Our study of it focuses on the Michelin Guide selection, covering the 60-year period 1950-2012. We then applied multiple correspondence analysis to establish the profiles of the Parisian restaurants and to find out whether these profiles have evolved.

We expand this work by allowing short- and long-run effects of democracy upon growth to differ since effects during political transitions need not coincide with those under established democracies. We also allow these short- and long-run effects to differ across world regions since history, demography and geography vary across regions. Using annual, cross-county data from 1960 to 2010, we find that democratizations increased growth rates in sub-Saharan Africa both in the short run and in the long run but lowered them in Europe. Effects in other regions appear less strong. Our results suggest that democracy could be most beneficial for growth in poorer, less stable regions. We also do not find any evidence of a transitional cost. Stronger evidence arises that these effects come from rising productivity rather than through greater investment. Finally, some support though mixed suggests that democracy's ability to mitigate the effects of ethnic heterogeneity provides a partial explanation for the cross-regional heterogeneity.","[Assiotis, Andreas] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Sylwester, Kevin] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",University of Cyprus; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Assiotis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, Nicosia, Cyprus.",assiotis.andreas@ucy.ac.cy; ksylwest@siu.edu,,,,,,,48,1,1,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

This article builds a simple model of securitization that accounts for the foregoing retention strategies.

It can be difficult to measure the reaction of monetary policy to the movements of the exchange rate, due to the simultaneous response of monetary policy to the exchange rate and the possibility that both variables respond to several other variables. This study addresses these problems by using an identification method based on the heteroscedasticity in the high-frequency data. The results in this paper suggest that the ECB systematically responds to exchange rate movements but that quantitative effects are small. Such a significant but small reaction coefficient seems consistent with the hypothesis that the central banks do not target the fluctuations in the exchange rate but consider them only to the extent they impact on the expected inflation and output path.

In particular, we show how perceptions of rational agents of the workings of the economy (a) shape the environment, (b) affect the environment sufficiently to ensure that rational economic agents find the observed environment consistent with their beliefs even though it is not. As a by-product, we illustrate that endogenous macro uncertainty can arise as an outcome if rational economic agents whose expectations are anchored on endogenous variables expect them to arise.

Optimal contracts that retain workers exhibit properties such as first-best effort and surplus, or non-responsiveness to changes in underlying conditions.

To this end, it proposes a simplified version of the original agent-based model and subjects it to mathematical analysis. The proposed model is transformed into an analytically tractable discrete Markov model, and its city size distribution is examined. Its discrete nature allows the Markov model to be used to validate the algorithms of computational agent-based models. We show that the Markov chains lead to a power-law distribution when the ranges of migration options are randomly distributed across the agent population. We also identify sufficient conditions under which the Markov chains produce the Zipf's Law, which has never been done within a discrete framework. The conditions under which our simplified model yields the Zipf's Law are in agreement with, and thus validate, the configurations of the original heterogeneous agent-based model.

The Prescott model consists of isolated economies that are not linked by international capital mobility or international exchange of goods. We study a two-country model with free international capital mobility. We find that imposing higher marginal labour tax rates in one country leads to international capital inflows into that country, which acts to counteract the negative employment effect of higher taxes. Market hours worked in the low marginal labour tax rate country fall with an increase in its net foreign assets. With identical preferences, total market hours worked are equalized across the two countries. With factor price equalization, the international equalization of hours worked result still holds with goods trade substituting for international capital mobility.","Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Hoon, HT (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",hthoon@smu.edu.sg,"HOON, Hian Teck/D-1428-2009","Hoon, Hian/0000-0002-3048-4152",,,,,15,0,0,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

To do so, we exploit administrative records on individual hospital admissions classified by ICD-10 diagnosis codes. These records allow the construction of a quarterly panel data set for London boroughs running from 1997 to 2009 to estimate the short and long run impacts of the depenalization policy unilaterally introduced in Lambeth between 2001 and 2002. We find that the depenalization of cannabis had significant longer term impacts on hospital admissions related to the use of hard drugs, raising hospital admission rates for men by between 40 and 100% of their pre-policy baseline levels. The impacts are concentrated among men in younger age cohorts. The dynamic impacts across cohorts vary in profile with some cohorts experiencing hospitalization rates remaining above pre-intervention levels three to four years after the depenalization policy is introduced. We combine these estimated impacts on hospitalization rates with estimates on how the policy impacted the severity of hospital admissions to provide a lower bound estimate of the public health cost of the depenalization policy.

Firms which might face credit constraints in future investments become endogenously risk averse when accumulating pledgable assets. In the short run, the optimal supply contract involves risk sharing, so inducing double marginalization. Credit constraints thus result in higher retail prices, and this is true whether the firm is debt or equity funded. Further, we offer a new theory of supplier finance arms as we show an intrinsic complementarity between supply and lending which reduces financing inefficiencies created by informational asymmetries. The model offers: a theory of countervailing power based on credit constraints; a transmission mechanism linking the cost of borrowing with retail prices; and a motive for outsourcing supply (or distribution) in the face of market risk.","[Nocke, Volker] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Thanassoulis, John] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Mannheim; University of Warwick,"Nocke, V (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",nocke@uni-mannheim.de; john.thanassoulis@wbs.ac.uk,"Nocke, Volker/JZT-1952-2024","NOCKE, VOLKER/0000-0002-5000-6828",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G037566/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G037566/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,41,10,11,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Building on and innovating on the mathematical models of Evans and Roos in the second half of the 1920s, Paretian economists proposed models in which the economic cycle could be considered as an endogenous equilibrium phenomenon. In the 1930s they sought to develop a nonmonetary theory of the economic cycle of that was highly analytical in style, in keeping with their view of general economic equilibrium. This approach also had some international visibility as there were some contributions (Vinci, 1934; Amoroso, 1935; 1940) that were published in the newly founded Econometrica, the journal of the Econometric Society and some of the best-known Italian economists contributed to its creation. These works have so far not received the attention they probably deserved, as a great deal of Italian economic thinking between the two world wars The purpose of this article is to fill a historic gap by systematically presenting the research which the Pareto school realized in the field of the mathematical theory of the economic cycle, to highlight the vitality of Italian economic research in the international context.","Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali Marco Fanno, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Pomini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali Marco Fanno, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",mario.pomini@unipd.it,,"POMINI, Mario/0000-0001-5046-2228",,,,,69,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

First, we broaden analysis of the effects of beauty beyond the labour market to examine its relation to household income. We find that beauty significantly affects total household income - via respondents' probability of employment and their hours of work and hourly wage, and whether they have a partner who contributes income to the household. Second, we examine whether the returns to beauty in Australia changed between the 1980s and 2000s. It is found that, for the most part, the effect of beauty was constant across this period. There is, however, some evidence of an increasing effect of beauty on the likelihood that a female respondent is employed, which we suggest may be due to selection effects and the growth in female workforce participation.","[Borland, Jeff] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Leigh, Andrew] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Melbourne; Australian National University,"Leigh, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",andrew_leigh@ksg02.harvard.edu,"Leigh, Andrew/AAV-1366-2020","Leigh, Andrew/0000-0002-5639-0509",,,,,32,24,27,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Whereas in the short run limiting firms' investment reduces capacity utilization and capital accumulation, in the long run, allowing the adjustment of the normal to the actual degree of capacity utilization, the direction of the impact of the constraint goes in the opposite direction: relaxing the constraint reduces capital utilization and accumulation. Moreover, an increase in the saving propensity or a fall in wages do not always cause a reduction in the degree of capital utilization - the so-called paradoxes of thrift and costs - as predicted by the standard post-Keynesian/Kaleckian analysis; and growth could be profit led.

The findings reveal substantial policy intervention: a total of 82 measures were implemented in CEE during the period considered. The paper presents a panel data analysis of the effectiveness of the policy measures adopted in the region. The overall results indicate that certain measures - particularly asset classification and provisioning rules and loan eligibility criteria - might have been effective in taming bank credit growth, especially if applied in the context of more general policy measures featuring a combination of various instruments. However, in countries in which the authorities managed to somewhat decrease the flows of bank credit into the economy, the measures were often circumvented via direct, cross-border credit from foreign banks and credit provided by domestic, non-bank financial companies.

Using data on net capital flows for 56 EMEs over 1980-2011, we find that global factors, including US interest rates and investor risk aversion act as gatekeepers that determine when surges of capital to EMEs will occur. Whether a particular EME receives a surge, and the magnitude of that surge, however, depends largely on domestic factors such as its external financing need, capital account openness, and exchange rate regime. Differentiating between surges driven by exceptional behavior of asset flows (repatriation of foreign assets by domestic residents) from those driven by exceptional behavior of liability flows (nonresident investments into the country), shows the latter to be relatively more sensitive to global factors and contagion.

Returns to skill and tenure premia are highest in young vintages, where skill is scarcest and agents accumulate human capital fastest. As the vintage ages, the skill premium decreases and vanishes entirely upon vintage death. Workers run through cycles of human-capital accumulation: their wages rise as they accumulate skill, undergo downward pressure as the technology ages, and finally drop sharply when the worker switches to a new technology. The results are in line with German linked employer-employee data: tenure premia are highest in young establishments, as well as in fast-growing industries, occupations and establishments. A calibration exercise suggests that human-capital accumulation is the most important determinant of workers' wage profiles, whereas changes to the price of skill and vintage productivity gains play a smaller quantitative role.

Large second-round effects of currency depreciation on inflation are detected in the former but not the latter crisis, and the reported estimates suggest that these effects were propelled by monetary accommodation and wage indexation. A side result was that exchange rate pass-through into prices was moderate and slow in Serbia in the 2000s, remaining unchanged even in the currency crash of 2008-9.

We use segregation measures for the uncontrolled cooperative housing segment as benchmarks for analysing whether rent control counteracts segregation. We apply the analyses to a rich dataset encompassing some 400,000 households. We find that income segregation is significantly lower in the rent control segment than in the free market benchmark. However, when analysing segregation with respect to other segregation measures, the rental housing market is more segregated in these respects than in the non-regulated market for cooperatives. Rent control has arguably led to a comparatively flat rent gradient over the city and thus the comparatively low rents in the central, and most attractive, areas of the city provide a general subsidy to those who live in these areas. But according to our results this subsidy does not efficiently benefit households with low educated level, households with children, young households or households with a migrant background.

The application of the cointegration methodology allows distinguishing between long-run (debt-to-GDP ratio, potential growth) and short-run (inflation, short-term interest rates, etc.) determinants of sovereign borrowing costs. We find that in the long run, government bond yields increase by about 2 basis points in response to a 1 percentage point increase in government debt-to-GDP ratio and by about 45 basis points in response to a 1 percentage point increase in the potential growth rate. In the short run, sovereign bond yields deviate from the level determined by the long-run fundamentals, but about half of the deviation adjusts in one year. When considering the impact of the global financial crisis on sovereign borrowing costs in euro area countries, the estimations suggest that spreads against Germany in some European periphery countries exceeded the level determined by fundamentals in the aftermath of the crisis, while some North European countries have benefited from safe-haven flows.

Fuzzy time series methods are based on fuzzy set theory. In the early years, classical fuzzy set operations were used in the fuzzy time series methods. In recent years, artificial intelligence techniques have been used in different stages of fuzzy time series methods. In this paper, a novel fuzzy time series method which is based on particle swarm optimization is proposed. A high order fuzzy time series forecasting model is used in the proposed method. In the proposed method, determination of fuzzy relations is performed by estimating the optimal fuzzy relation matrix. The performance of the proposed method is compared to some methods in the literature by using three real world time series. It is shown that the proposed method has better performance than other methods in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we examine whether this bias may be due to forecasters having an asymmetric loss function. In contrast to previous research, we account for the time variation in the bias by making the loss function depend on the state of the economy. The asymmetry parameter in the loss function is specified to depend on set state variables which may cause forecaster to intentionally bias their forecasts. We consider both the Lin-Ex and asymmetric power loss functions. For the commonly used Lin-Ex and Lin-Lin loss functions, we show the model can be easily estimated by least squares. We apply our methodology to the consensus forecast of real U.S. GDP growth from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. We find that forecast uncertainty has an asymmetric effect on the asymmetry parameter in the loss function dependent upon whether the economy is in expansion or contraction. When the economy is in expansion, forecaster uncertainty is related to an overprediction in the median forecast of real GDP growth. In contrast, when the economy is in contraction, forecaster uncertainty is related to an underprediction in the median forecast of real GDP growth. Our results are robust to the particular loss function that is employed in the analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical analysis for the impact of external debt on growth is based on the ARDL approach to cointegration.

This effect occurs because government indebtedness extracts a portion of young people's savings to pay interest on the debts. Therefore, the payment of debt interest requires an allocation exchange system across generations that is similar to a pay-as-you-go pension system, which results in changes in the savings rate of the economy. The major conclusions of the theoretical model were verified using an econometric model that provides evidence of the validity of this conclusion. Our empirical analysis controls for time-invariant, country-specific heterogeneity in growth rates. We also address endogeneity issues and allow for heterogeneity across countries in the model parameters and for cross-sectional dependence. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In Korea, which follows a strict seniority-based employment structure, this legislation will bring forth social benefits to those that are eligible for extended retirement by increasing their income, but it may also create a loss in social benefit by increasing the burden of employers who have to pay their salaries. This study uses the contingent valuation method to estimate the socioeconomic benefits and losses due to the introduction of this legislation. According to the results, if the ADPL is implemented, the willingness to pay regarding the representative employer towards nonenforcement of the legislation is higher if the respondent has stronger opposition towards the legislation, a higher burden of labor costs, a higher number of workers eligible for extended retirement, and if the company has an age-limit system in place. As for the size of the socioeconomic benefit and the loss due to enforcement of the legislation, the benefit for workers eligible for extended retirement will be 5.77 trillion KW (Korean Won) annually, and the loss for employers will be approximately 4 trillion KW annually. The net benefit of the legislation will be 1.56 trillion KW annually. Therefore, since the legislation creates socioeconomic net benefit, a win-win situation can be created for both groups by restructuring the wage profile for senior workers. As a redistribution policy to warrant the win-win situation, extended retirements for senior workers can be exchanged with the lower increasing rate of wage or establishing a wage ceiling through a wage peak system, which is popularly adopted in Japan.","[Rhee, Hae-Chun; Cho, Joonmo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea; [Woo, Kwangho] Sungkyunkwan Univ, HRD Ctr, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",trustcho@skku.edu,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Entrepreneurs without effective habits or heuristics, or who have acquired less knowledge or fewer routines, may not be able to learn fast enough from feedback during the startup process to avoid being selected out.

Our empirical investigation is based on the wavelet squared coherence which allows us to assess the co-movement in both time-frequency spaces. Our results reveal frequent changes in the pattern of the co-movements especially after 2007 for all the selected GCC markets at relatively higher frequencies. We further note an increasing strength of dependence among the GCC stock markets during the last financial crisis signifying enhanced portfolio benefits for investors in the short term relative to the long term. On the financial side, we uncover that the strength of co-movement between GCC markets may impact the multi-country portfolio's value at risk (VaR) levels. These findings provide potential implications for portfolio managers operating in the GCC region who are invited to consider co-movement through both frequencies and time when designing their portfolios.

In some applications, this method will fail to provide an accurate ranking of competitors based on ability. In particular, rankings will not accurately reflect ability when competitors enter different numbers of races or when the level of competition varies by race. Additionally, point-based rankings are dependent on a subjective points scale. Three alternative models of performance and corresponding maximum likelihood estimation methods are presented that can be used to rank competitors and overcome the shortcomings of point-based rankings. Two methods are based on paired-comparisons among competitors and can be estimated using common binary-choice regression methods; the other is based on the rank-ordered logit model. These methods are valuable tools for stakeholders who need to evaluate the relative abilities of competitors to efficiently allocate resources. Application is demonstrated using results from the 2012 Formula One season, and the results of the maximum likelihood methods are compared to each other and the official point-based rankings.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Anderson, A (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",aaron.m.anderson@colostate.edu,,,,,,,15,6,8,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that, on average, 65% of the forecast error variance of the 27 countries' business cycle shocks is due to international spillovers. However, the magnitude of international business cycle spillovers varies considerably over time. There is a clear increasing trend since the end of World War II and until the mid-1980s. After that, international business cycle interdependencies declined during the period that was dubbed the Great Moderation and stabilized around the beginning of the twenty-first century. During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, international business cycle spillovers increased to unprecedented levels. Finally, developed countries are consistently ranked as net transmitters of cyclical shocks to developing counties throughout the sample.","[Antonakakis, N.] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Econ & Finance Subject Grp, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England; [Antonakakis, N.; Badinger, H.] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Int Econ, Dept Econ, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Badinger, H.] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",University of Portsmouth; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Antonakakis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Econ & Finance Subject Grp, Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England.",nikolaos.antonakakis@wu.ac.at,", Nikolaos/J-5915-2012; Antonakakis, Nikolaos/ABF-2754-2020","Antonakakis, Nikolaos/0000-0002-0904-3678; Badinger, Harald/0000-0002-7238-5136",,,,,36,9,9,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We conduct experiments measuring risk and ambiguity aversion with Midwestern grain farmers. Risk aversion has only a small impact on the timing of adoption of GM soy, while ambiguity-aversion has a large impact speeding up farmer adoption of GM corn. We hypothesize that this unusual finding is due to the fact that GM corn often contains an insect-resistance trait which reduces the ambiguity of pest damages for adopters. GM soy never contains this insect-resistance trait. This highlights the importance of distinguishing between risk and ambiguity when studying the effects of aversion to uncertainty on adoption of new technologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

On the supply side, we acquire samples of five popular brand-name prescription drugs from three types of online pharmacies: tier 1 are US-based and certified by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) or LegitScript.com, tier 2 are certified by PharmacyChecker.com or the Canadian International Pharmacy Association but not by NABP or LegitScript, and tier 3 are not certified by any of the four agencies. Most tier-2 and tier-3 websites are foreign. We find that 37 of the 365 delivered samples are different from the products we ordered and, therefore, non-testable. Conditional on testable samples, Raman spectrometry test finds no failure of authenticity except for eight Viagra samples from tier-3 websites. After controlling for testability and authenticity, tier-2 websites are 49.2% cheaper (p < 0.01) and tier-3 websites are 54.8% cheaper (p < 0.01) than tier-1 sites. These differences are driven by non-Viagra drugs. For Viagra, failing samples are cheaper, but there is no significant price difference across tiers once we condition on testability and authenticity. To study the demand side, we designed a survey that was distributed by RxRights. Among the 2,522 respondents who have purchased prescription medication and are concerned about the price of US pharmaceuticals, results show that 61.54% purchase drugs online and mostly from foreign websites, citing cost saving as the leading reason. Conditional on shopping online, 41.11% check with a credentialing agency. Both samples convey a consistent message that certification agencies deliver useful information for foreign websites and online consumers. Further, while these findings confirm the Food and Drug Administration warning against rogue websites, they do suggest that a blanket ban against all foreign websites may deny consumers substantial savings from certified tier-2 websites.","[Mathur, Aparna] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bate, Roger] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Jin, Ginger Zhe] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Mathur, A (通讯作者)，Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, 1150 Seventeenth St, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",rbate@aei.org; ginger@umd.edu; amathur@aei.org,,,,,,,47,9,13,1,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This study finds evidence that the competitive effects of two other big-box retailers-Costco and Walmart-owned Sam's Club-are quite different. Using city-level panel grocery price data matched with a unique data set on Walmart and warehouse club locations, we find that Costco entry is associated with higher grocery prices at incumbent retailers and that the effect is strongest in cities with small populations and high grocery store densities. This is consistent with incumbents competing with Costco along nonprice dimensions, such as product quality or quality of the shopping experience. We find no evidence that Sam's Club entry affects grocery stores' prices, consistent with Sam's Club's focus on small businesses instead of consumers.","[Courtemanche, Charles] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Carden, Art] Samford Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Quantitat Anal, Brock Sch Business, Birmingham, AL 35226 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Samford University,"Courtemanche, C (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, POB 3992, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",ccourtemanche@gsu.edu; art.carden@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,20,27,12,83,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We find that the association between household wealth portfolios at the intensive margin (the level of assets) and household characteristics is different from that found at the extensive margin (the decision to own). Characteristics explain most of the cross-country differences in asset and debt levels, except for housing wealth, which displays large unexplained differences for both the under-50 and over-50 populations. However, there are cohort differences in the drivers of wealth levels. We observe that younger households' levels of wealth, given participation, may be more responsive to the institutional setting than mature households. Our findings have important implications, indicating a scope for policies which can promote or redirect investment in housing for both cohorts and which promote optimal portfolio allocation for mature households.","[Doorley, Karina; Sierminska, Eva] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Sierminska, Eva] CEPS INSTEAD, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Sierminska, Eva] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Doorley, K (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",,"Sierminska, Eva/AAJ-6665-2021","Sierminska, Eva/0000-0003-1936-814X; Doorley, Karina/0000-0002-6535-0648",,,,,17,1,1,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78350-556-2; 978-1-78350-567-8,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2014,22,,,,,,43,85,,10.1108/S1049-258520140000022000,0.0,,,43,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360561500002,0

Such developments are often attributed to the increased integration of world financial markets. We present a model that allows us to examine how greater integration in world financial markets affects the behavior of international capital flows and financial returns. Our model predicts that international capital flows are large (in absolute value) and very volatile during the early stages of financial integration when international asset trading is concentrated in bonds. As integration progresses and households gain access to world equity markets, the size and volatility of international bond flows decline. This is the natural outcome of greater risk sharing facilitated by increased integration. This pattern is consistent with declining volatility observed during 1975-2007 period in the G-7 countries. We also find that the equilibrium flows in bonds and stocks predicted by the model are larger than their empirical counterparts, and are largely driven by variations in equity risk premia. The model also predicts that volatility of equity and bond returns decline with integration, again consistent with the data for G-7 economies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, in an experiment with 288 high-caste and 294 low-caste students in India, cues to one's place in the caste system turned out to starkly influence the expression of these traits. The experiment allows us to discriminate between two classes of models that give different answers to the question of how someone's identity affects his behavior. Models of the fixed self assume that identity is a set of preferences. Models of the frame-dependent self assume that identity entails a set of mental models, that are situationally evoked and that mediate information processing.

We investigate whether the proxy for worldwide real economic activity, dry bulk maritime freight costs, represents anything more than transportation costs by analyzing the relation between these costs and oil prices. The meaning of this variable is critical because transportation costs appear on both sides of the equations estimated by Kilian, directly as dry bulk maritime freight costs and as part of the measure for oil prices. We also investigate the effects of representing oil supply with an aggregate of OPEC and nonOPEC production because they likely use different criteria to chose output. Finally we investigate Kilian's use of the first difference of supply while the other variables in his model are represented as levels. The results suggest that OPEC and nonOPEC nations use different criteria to set output and that reductions (increases) in OPEC production raise (lower) oil prices. The elements of the cointegrating relations, their loadings, and impulse response functions suggest that the positive relation between dry bulk maritime freight costs and oil prices simply represents the effect of higher oil prices on transportation costs. Sensitivity analyses suggest that these differences are caused by including transportation costs in the measure of oil prices, aggregating OPEC and non-OPEC productions, and using a very long lag length to estimate the VAR. Together, these results suggest that conclusions about the importance of demand shocks and the unimportance of supply shocks are not robust to alternative specifications that are consistent with many empirical findings about the world oil market.

However, these approaches often show very narrow perspectives and address only a few factors. As a result, over the past few years new approaches to leadership with broader perspectives and qualitative research methodologies have been developed, but only a few scholars have as yet managed to conduct studies within this framework. The main goal of this paper is to find out more about the social and cultural context in which leaders make sense of their leadership, and how the mixture of old and new socio-cultural influences affects them. Discursive leadership, with its social and cultural focus, emerged as the appropriate model for this study. Our findings reveal the important role of communication in leadership, identify two major forces that influence Serbian managers' leadership and show their willingness to accept new values and standards in making sense of their leadership. The value of this study is its contribution to a new, broader and more meaningful way of the approach to leadership, as well as its influence on scholars, leadership experts and practitioners, primarily in non-Western and post-transitional environments. It also gives recommendations to scholars to conduct social constructionist leadership research, so that in the near future a true balance between social constructionist and psychological approaches can be achieved.","[Konja, Valentin; Matic, Dejan; Lalic, Danijela] Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Konja, V (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Trg Dositeja Obradov 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",valentink@uns.ac.rs; dejan.matic@uns.ac.rs; danijelalalic@uns.ac.rs,"Lalic, Danijela/X-2301-2019","Lalic, Danijela/0000-0002-1277-5116",,,,,37,2,3,0,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We study how these two policy instruments affect return-to-work and medium-run labour market outcomes of mothers of newborn children. Analysing a series of major PL policy changes in Austria, we find that longer cash benefits lead to a significant delay in return-to-work, particularly so in the period that is job-protected. Prolonged parental leave absence induced by these policy changes does not appear to hurt mothers' labour market outcomes in the medium run. We build a non-stationary model of job search after childbirth to isolate the role of the two policy instruments. The model matches return-to-work and return to same employer profiles under the various factual policy configurations. Counterfactual policy simulations indicate that a system that combines cash with protection dominates other systems in generating time for care immediately after birth while maintaining mothers' medium-run labour market attachment.","[Lalive, Rafael] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Lalive, Rafael; Zweimueller, Josef] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Schlosser, Analia] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Steinhauer, Andreas; Zweimueller, Josef] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Lausanne; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Tel Aviv University; University of Zurich,"Lalive, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,"Schlosser, Analia/0000-0001-6283-8632; Lalive, Rafael/0000-0003-1938-692X",,,,,22,64,77,3,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

For the venue country's viewpoint, lagged remittances have a greater marginal impact on domestic than on transnational terrorism. However, when we investigate remittances to the home country of the perpetrator, lagged remittances have the greatest marginal impact on transnational terrorism.

Effectiveness of liquid assets investments is only one from possible explanations of liquidity measures in firms. Too small liquid assets lead some firms to negative changes in their sale levels and as effect to weaker profits. Destruction of cash revenues creation possibilities is dangerous for them and is hard to rebuild possibilities to create cash revenues. Financial liquidity investment efficiency model (FLIEM) predicts that before the crisis, during the crisis and after the crisis phases are connected with higher levels of working capital in processing enterprises. Investments in liquidity are a hedging instrument against individual risk sensitivity that is higher in crisis affected times. The paper aim is to compare real economy data with FLIEM predictions. The FLIEM model expected that liquidity measures like current liquidity indicator should be treated as forecasting indicator about future risk sensitivity of the entities.

As such, familial support remains the number one source of old age protection, be it monetary or social support. Nevertheless, with industrialization and rural-urban migration on the rise, familial support is slowly losing its importance for old age protection. The objectives of this paper are twofold; namely, i) to compare and contrast the existing old-age protection plans in Malaysia, Singapore and Philippines; and ii) to determine views of the working population on retirement and retirement planning. The study interviewed the elderly and working population between the age of 18 - 54 years old in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Manila by using a structured questionnaire. In general, the study indicates that youth in all three major cities plan to shift away from traditional familial support for old age with support from other means such as personal savings and insurance. The major reason for the change in perception of familial support is inadequacy of retirement benefits provided by formal old-age programs currently available to their parents. Incidentally, youth in Manila still feel that familial support is highly needed for old age protection.","[Mohd, Saidatulakmal; Ismail, Nor Asmat] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Senadjki, Abdelhak] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Perak, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR),"Mohd, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",eieydda@usm.my; norasmat@usm.my; abdelhak@utar.edu.my,"Mohd, Saidatulakmal/J-1535-2014; Senadjki, Abdelhak/A-8476-2013","Mohd, Saidatulakmal/0000-0002-7947-7324; Senadjki, Abdelhak/0000-0002-4302-4091",,,,,10,0,0,0,5,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-206-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,199,206,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0OB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366474600026,0

The process of the economic integration and globalisation is taking form of foreign direct investment (FDI). This transfer of capital is usually accompanied by the transfer of technologies and knowledge. The so-called knowledge spillover in the area of HR planning is the phenomenon the paper focuses on.

The content and the development of R&D activities; Hungary's locational advantages for R&D projects, and their local impact are analysed based on interviews with twenty foreign-owned companies in the two selected sectors. We show that local R&D units' activity is multifaceted, though they feature similar upgrading trajectories. Investors' motivations: the knowledge-and efficiency-seeking nature of their projects and the related locational advantages are examined. We demonstrate that local R&D-intensive subsidiaries have a limited local impact except for the intensive contacts with local universities - with varying content and motives on the side of the R&D units. Drawing on our findings we formulate economic policy recommendations about the ways to foster and enhance R&D-based upgrading.","[Sass, Magdolna] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Inst Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Szalavetz, Andrea] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Inst World Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Sass, M (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Inst Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",sass.magdolna@krtk.mta.hu; szalavetz.andrea@krtk.mta.hu,"Sass, Magdolna/K-3112-2016","Sass, Magdolna/0000-0002-6819-6041",European Union; Hungarian National Scientific and Research Fund [K83982],European Union(European Union (EU)); Hungarian National Scientific and Research Fund(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement Growth-Innovation-Competitiveness: Fostering Cohesion in Central and Eastern Europe (GRINCOH) and of the Hungarian National Scientific and Research Fund (K83982).

We shed light on the interference of public and private decisions regarding corporate socially responsible investment and on the manner it affects the expected outcomes. The influence of public authorities on corporate social responsibility decisions is complex. First, we explain the failure of public services as the motivation for socially responsible actions undertaken by companies. Second, we deal with the response of public authorities to corporate responsible investment. Public authorities may adopt cooperative or noncooperative behavior that affects the equilibrium reached in the market. Their choice influences the decision of the company to develop socially responsible projects. We exemplify by a simple model the microeconomic insights of corporate social responsibility decisions. The study can be useful as a start point in the capital budgeting of this type of investment. It also offers a new perspective showing how corporate social responsibility can become an instrument for improving market equilibrium.","[Semenescu, Andreea] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania; [Badarau, Cristina] Univ Bordeaux, LAREFI, Bordeaux, France",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Universite de Bordeaux,"Semenescu, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Curmei-Semenescu, Andreea/AAI-9627-2021","Curmei-Semenescu, Andreea/0000-0001-9367-3965",,,,,28,1,1,0,16,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

An alternative simple to compute estimator based on the empirical distribution function is proposed for the generalized random functional. For test statistics based on this estimator, limit properties are established. A Monte Carlo experiment demonstrates good finite sample performance of the statistics for testing logit and probit specification in binary choice models.","[Tuvaandorj, Purevdorj; Zinde-Walsh, Victoria] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, CIREQ, CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; Universite de Montreal,"Tuvaandorj, P (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, CIREQ, CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0731-9053,,978-1-78441-182-4; 978-1-78441-183-1,ADV ECONOMETRICS,,,2014,33,,,,,,397,423,,10.1108/S0731-905320140000033012,0.0,,,27,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360559300013,0

The paper analyses the basic design of the scheme, its workings during the first trading period (200507), the adjustments made for the second trading period (200812) and its performance during the years 2008 and 2009. It also discusses the European Commissions (EC) proposal to revise the EU ETS for the period 201320 and the agreement reached. The paper offers a critical assessment of the EU ETS from a value-theoretic and class-based standpoint, challenging mainstream accounts. Following the consultation and co-decision processes that preceded the adoption of the EU ETS Directive and its amendment, one reaches the conclusion that the EU ETS has become the flagship of the European climate change programme because it is more conducive to the dominant EU industrial capitals that compete with non-EU capitals under strenuous international market conditions. The limited environmental effectiveness, the windfall profits and distributional injustice that characterise the scheme from its start are pitfalls generated from the embeddedness of the scheme in the EU capitalist economies.","Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Vlachou, A (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, 76 Patission St, Athens 10434, Greece.",Vlachou@aueb.gr,,,,,,,43,23,26,5,68,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using a novel dataset of municipal vote returns during the rise of black mayors in U.S. cities, this paper establishes new facts about turnout and competition in close interracial elections. In the South, but not the North, close black victories were more likely than close black losses, involved higher turnout than close black losses, and were more likely than close black losses to be followed by subsequent black victories. These results are consistent with a model in which the historical exclusion of Southern blacks from politics made them disproportionately sensitive to mobilization efforts by political elites, leading to a black candidate advantage in close elections.

Following the widespread literature on host-country determinants of foreign direct investments (FDI), we distinguish among economic, institutional and technological factors. We find that Chinese automotive ODI are mostly driven by the market size of host economies - a result which is robust to alternative specifications - but important non-linear effects are at work, i.e. their market-seeking investment strategies are targeted to non high-income countries. Moreover, macroeconomic stability and efficient labour markets both act as attraction factors, while the same does not seem to be true for political stability.

In the main treatments, subjects had a chance to revise their decision after seeing decisions of others, which I take as an indicator of herding behaviour. The main findings are that the propensity to herd was not significantly influenced by different levels of time pressure, although there could be an indirect effect through other variables, such as the time subjects spent revising the decision. Heart-rate significantly increased over the baseline during the performance of a task and its correlation to the subjectively stated level of stress was positive but very weak, which suggests that time pressure may not automatically induce stress but increase effort instead.","IES FSV Charles Univ, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Cingl, L (通讯作者)，IES FSV Charles Univ, Opletalova 26, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",lubomir.cingl@gmail.com,"Cingl, Lubomír/C-2801-2019","Cingl, Lubomír/0000-0001-8842-4876",,,,,26,6,8,1,20,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Theoretical models by Chaney, Manova, and others suggest that credit constraints are detrimental for exports. We examine this hypothesis empirically at the firm level by using data on Chinese enterprises compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. We approximate credit constraints by financial variables such as a firm's debt ratio or the liquid-to-total-capital ratio. We then consider the impact of these financial fundamentals on the extensive and the intensive margins of firm-level exports. In particular, we focus on the impact of credit constraints on a firm's propensity to export at all (which we model by means of a logit model) and on a firm's export-sales ratio (which we model by a fractional response model based on Papke and Wooldridge (1996 Journal of Applied Econometrics 11, 619-32). The empirical results confirm the negative relationship between exports and credit constraints suggested by previous theoretical work.

By combining these different classes of models with several volatility dynamics of the GARCH type, we aim at taking into account the dynamics of financial returns in a realistic way. The associated risk neutral dynamics of the time series models is obtained through two different specifications for the pricing kernel: we provide a characterization of the change in the probability measure using the Esscher transform and the Minimal Entropy Martingale Measure. We finally assess empirically the performance of this modelling approach, using a dataset of European options based on the S&P 500 and on the CAC 40 indices. Our results show that models involving jumps and a time varying volatility provide realistic pricing and hedging results for options with different kinds of time to maturities and moneyness. These results are supportive of the idea that a realistic time series model can provide realistic option prices making the approach developed here interesting to price options when option markets are illiquid or when such markets simply do not exist.

It is important that house price indexes take account of these quality differences. Hedonic methods which express house prices as a function of a vector of characteristics (such as number of bedrooms and bathrooms, land area and location) are particularly useful for this purpose. I consider here some developments in the hedonic methodology, as it is applied in a housing context, that have occurred in the last three decades. A number of hedonic house price indexes are now available. However, it is often difficult to see how these indexes relate to each other. For this reason I attempt to impose some structure on the literature by developing a taxonomy of hedonic indexes, and then show how existing indexes fit into this taxonomy. Also discussed are some promising areas for future research in the hedonic field. In particular, greater use needs to be made of spatial econometric and nonparametric methods to exploit the increased availability of geospatial data. The main criticisms of the hedonic approach are evaluated and compared with those of the repeat-sales and stratified median methods. The overall conclusion is that the advantages of the hedonic approach outweigh its disadvantages.","Graz Univ, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Hill, RJ (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",,,"Hill, Robert/0000-0002-7483-9701",,,,,178,79,87,1,104,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The paper evaluates the impact of short parental leave on mothers' employment status and subsequent wages, with a special focus on the part-time parental leave option. It exploits a policy reform that took place in 2004 in France and increased the incentive to prolong the maternity leave after the first birth by six months paid parental leave. Data from the fourth round of the Generation 98 survey (CEREQ) and both difference-in-differences and propensity score matching approaches are used to estimate the effect of the reform. The results show that full-time short paid parental leave had almost no effect on labour market participation and wages of first mothers at the global level. However, for part-time paid leave takers, the reform increases the employment rate but decreases the subsequent wages. The wages remain lower two years after child birth, especially for the most educated, who mainly choose the part-time option. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find that labor productivity varies systematically within industries by ownership type and that non-state firms face implicit labor taxation relative to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). We also find that, in keeping with ongoing reforms of the state sector, ownership differentials fall over time, with gaps between non-state enterprises and SOEs falling by about half over time. Within the non-state sector, enterprises registered as legal persons have higher MRPL, on average, than do firms registered as collective or private enterprises. Disaggregating this group using information on equity shares reveals that firms registered as legal persons and majority owned by legal persons have the highest MRPL relative to SOEs. Indeed, these enterprises show significantly higher MRPL than those firms directly controlled by the state. Legal-person firms with majority state ownership have MRPL differentials similar to those for legal-person firms with majority private or majority collective ownership. This evidence is consistent with continuing, albeit diminishing, implicit labor subsidies for directly SOEs but not for firms whose shares are owned by the state, even if those shares are registered to legal persons.","[Kamal, Fariha] US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, Washington, DC 20233 USA; [Lovely, Mary E.] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,"Kamal, F (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",fariha.kamal@census.gov; melovely@maxwell.syr.edu,,,,,,,29,4,4,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

We show that, under the assumption of homogeneous productivity among workers, growth negatively affects the employment rate of workers having a short working horizon before retirement (senior workers) while it positively affects the employment rate of workers having a long working horizon (young workers).

Japanese firm-level data show that their volatility is countercyclical, whereas it is procyclical among the United States firms reported in a previous study. We formulate a theoretical model that accounts for these opposing behaviors over the business cycles. The key driving factor behind the relationship is the bankruptcy cost structure, more specifically, the relative magnitude of the fixed and marginal costs of bankruptcy. The fixed bankruptcy cost operates as an entry barrier and the marginal bankruptcy cost operates as an additional cost of hiring. These distinct impacts affect the type of firms entering/exiting the market over the business cycle. We also examine the welfare and policy implications of the model by comparing the structures of bankruptcy costs in terms of efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Our focus is the analysis of inputs involving the use of client (customer) time in co-production and informational inputs, which may be produced by either the service provider or the client. In particular, we focus on those features that are associated with the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in service definition and delivery. Second, it models user choices in terms of the time-allocation between self-production, co-production and purchase as influenced by competences and time-saving preferences, and supplier choices as governed by opportunities to benefit from informational economies, cost saving arising from the stimulation of co-production and productivity increasing opportunities arising from the use of ICE Third, it uses the conceptual framework to re-interpret the well-known theory of innovation in services, the Barras reverse product cycle model.

The analysis is based on large samples from the personal income tax (PIT) files. According to the Gini coefficient, increases in earnings inequality were moderate; however, relatively large increases in the shares accruing to the top 5% and top 1% of employees did occur. Inequality of employees' after-tax earnings (i.e. net of employee social contributions and PIT) remained fairly stable in this time period, due to the increasing progressivity of PIT, as shown by the Kakwani index of progressivity. Increases in progressivity of the personal income tax came in leaps, following the introduction of new income tax legislation. Institutional settings and the introduction of minimum wage legislation in 1995 also appear to have moderated inequality increases, which were quite large in the early years of the transition.","[Stanovnik, Tine; Verbic, Miroslav] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Verbic, Miroslav] Inst Econ Res Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Verbic, Miroslav] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana,"Stanovnik, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",stanovnikt@ier.si; miroslav.verbic@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Verbic, Miroslav/0000-0001-5506-0973",,,,,18,9,9,1,15,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We first investigate the existence problem of strategy-proof and second-best efficient rules, where a strategy-proof rule is second-best efficient if it is not Pareto-dominated by any other strategy-proof rules. We show that there exists an egalitarian rational (consequently, non-dictatorial) strategy-proof rule satisfying second-best efficiency.

Using Indian Census data as a benchmark and enrollment rates at different levels of education, we compute annual attainment levels for a panel of 16 Indian states from 1961 to 2001. Results indicate that if the reduction in illiteracy stops at the primary level of education, it is not worthwhile for growth. Instead, the findings reveal a strong and significant effect on growth of a greater share of population completing tertiary education. The economic impact is also found to be large: a one percent change in tertiary education has the same effect on growth as a 13% decrease in illiteracy rates. A sensitivity analysis shows the results are unlikely to be driven by omitted variables, structural breaks, reverse causation or atypical observations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An economy consists of different sectors, each of which is concentrated in one or more electoral districts. Each district is represented by a legislator in the Congress. Legislative process is modeled as a multilateral sequential bargaining game a la Baron and Ferejohn (1989). Some surprising results emerge: bargaining can be welfare-worsening for all participants; legislators may vote for bills that make their constituents worse off; identical industries will receive very different levels of tariff.

Driven by three stochastic factors including the load process, our power price model allows for the calculation of closed-form pricing formulas for forwards and some options, products often used for hedging purposes.

Increasing bank equity may mitigate the bank-level moral hazard but exacerbates the firm-level moral hazard due to the reduction of firm equity. Competition among banks tends to result in an inefficiently low level of equity. In this case, imposing capital requirements on banks leads to a socially optimal capital structure for the economy in the sense of maximizing aggregate output. Such capital regulation is second-best and must balance three costs: excessive risk-taking by banks, credit restrictions that banks impose on firms with low equity, and credit restrictions due to high loan-interest rates. We discuss the implications of these findings for capital requirements, competition policy and banking crises. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using an economic experiment, we studied the impact of offering donors the option to restrict their charitable gift. Our primary finding demonstrates that allowing the option to restrict a charitable gift increases the average gift size, whether or not the donor chooses to exercise that option. This result implies that restricted gifts both are an important tool for increasing donations and may be less costly to the nonprofit organizations than originally believed.

We study the game induced by the student-optimal stable matching mechanism. We assume that students play their weakly dominant strategy of truth-telling. Roth and Sotomayor (1990) showed that equilibrium outcomes can be unstable. We prove that any stable matching is obtained in some equilibrium. We also show that the exhaustive class of dropping strategies does not necessarily generate the full set of equilibrium outcomes. Finally, we find that the 'rural hospital theorem' cannot be extended to the set of equilibrium outcomes and that welfare levels are in general unrelated to the set of stable matchings. Two important consequences are that, contrary to one-toone matching markets, (a) filled positions depend on the equilibrium that is reached and (b) welfare levels are not bounded by the optimal stable matchings (with respect to the true preferences).

The specific institutional factors we address concern the fairness in the procedures or mechanisms through which individuals believe initial positions or roles in society are determined. Subjects' initial positions (rich vs. poor) are determined based on various criteria (random, meritocratic, arbitrary, and rewarding uncooperative behavior) and individuals' willingness to approve Pareto improvement when the improvement is mainly in favor of the already rich is measured. Our findings show that individuals' willingness to accept higher but more unequal outcomes depends on the source of the initial inequality and random assignment leads to the most tolerance for disadvantageous inequality, generating doubt about commonly held views concerning meritocracy. Moreover, holding the procedures constant, subjects reveal greater tolerance for inequality when self and the opponent share common group identity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First, we account for quality differences correlated with selection into owner-occupied versus rental tenure. This correction increases estimated household consumption by 5% over uncorrected estimates and decreases estimated poverty rates quite dramatically. Second, we propose that measurement error induced by the imputation be corrected by imputing a consumption distribution, rather than a consumption level, for each household. This correction increases estimated poverty rates slightly. We use our methods to measure consumption poverty in Canada, and find that the imputation strategy used influences the patterns observed. For example, measured poverty among the elderly barely declines when one uses our methods, in contrast to the almost 6 percentage point reduction we find using traditional methods. In our assessment of the over-time evolution of consumption poverty, we find that substantial progress has been made on overall poverty and on child poverty, but that poverty among the elderly hardly changed.","[Norris, Sam] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Pendakur, Krishna] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Northwestern University; Simon Fraser University,"Norris, S (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,17,10,11,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The main focus is on the firms' hiring and firing decisions, on the implications for fiscal balances and on Spain's international competitiveness. We find that measures aiming at reducing (policy-induced) outside option of workers, such as a decrease in unemployment benefits, public wages or, to a lesser extent, public-sector employment, seem most beneficial to foster output, employment, international competitiveness and fiscal balances. Decreasing the unions' bargaining power also accomplishes this task. Our simulation suggests that reforming employment protection legislation does not seem to be a suitable tool from the perspective of improving international competitiveness. All measures imply (income) redistribution between optimizing and liquidity-constrained consumers. Our analysis also suggests that those reforms that are beneficial for Spain generate positive spillovers to the rest of EMU, too.","[Schwarzmueller, Tim] Kiel Inst World Econ, Forecasting Ctr, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Schwarzmueller, Tim] Res Area Monetary Policy, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Staehler, Nikolai] Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Econ, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Deutsche Bank,"Stähler, N (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",tim.schwarzmueller@ifw-kiel.de; nikolai.staehler@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Four aspects of the risk management are investigated: an investment universe, dependence structure, allocation strategies under risk minimization and trade-off between risks and returns. A regime-switching copula model is developed to investigate the dynamic dependence between assets. One regime emphasizes a short-term safe asset and the other regime emphasizes a long-term safe asset. The optimal allocation is derived following two strategies: risk minimization and trade-off between risks and returns in utility maximization with disappointment avoidance. If the central bank focuses solely on risk minimization, the asymmetries in the asset return dependence encourage the flight to safety. However, if higher risks are allowed in exchange for higher returns, even the exchange is very conservative, and the asymmetries would discourage the flight to safety. Therefore, we suggest that China should mitigate its flight to safety after 2008 and increase holdings of short-term bank deposits, long-term treasury bonds and euro bonds.","[Zhang, Zhichao; Zhang, Fan; Zhang, Zhuang] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England",Durham University,"Zhang, ZC (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England.",zhichao.zhang@durham.ac.uk; fan.zhang@durham.ac.uk; zhuang.zhang@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV,2013,21,6,,,,,1,21,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12043.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,291TN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329853000001,0

Our subjects play a modified VCM game-one in which they can voluntarily join groups that provide reduced rates of return on private investment. This leads to both endogenous sorting (because free-riders tend to reject the reduced-rate option) and substitution (because reduced private productivity favours increased club involvement). Seemingly unproductive costs thus serve to screen out free-riders, attract conditional cooperators, boost club production, and increase member welfare. The sacrifice mechanism is simple and particularly useful where monitoring difficulties impede punishment, exclusion, fees, and other more standard solutions.","[Aimone, Jason A.] Virginia Tech, Caril Res Inst, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Aimone, Jason A.] Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Iannaccone, Laurence R.; Rubin, Jared] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA USA; [Makowsky, Michael D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Baylor University; Chapman University System; Chapman University; Johns Hopkins University,"Aimone, JA (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Caril Res Inst, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,"Makowsky, Michael/K-9641-2013","Makowsky, Michael/0000-0002-5558-0490; Rubin, Jared/0000-0002-3133-7947",NIH HHS [DP1 OD003874] Funding Source: Medline,NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),,,68,46,49,3,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

As Simon (1985) pointed out it, nothing is more fundamental in setting our research agenda and informing our research methods than our view of the nature of the human beings whose behavior we are studying. The paper examines optimal workplace-level organization structure (decision-making delegation, incentives and monitoring) relative to four common types of individuals, just selfish, civil, decent and dedicated employees (characterized in terms of their social preferences, self- versus other-regarding, reciprocity, trusting and trustworthiness). Four principal propositions arise from this analysis. (I) Mismatch between organization structure and employee preferences reduces productivity and profits. (2) The less prosocial employees in an organization, the more complex and sophisticated and therefore expensive the organization structure must be. (3) The less complex and less interdependent are employees' tasks, the less dependent is organization structure on employee social preferences. (4) Heterogeneity of preferences poses a design a dynamic challenge as practices generally have to be tailored to one type of employee, and will be associated with exit of other types or adverse-selection by types that will seek to exploit it.

We use different econometric techniques and show that, when correcting for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity, contract-farming has a positive effect on subjective well-being. We find diverging effects for different types of contracts, suggesting that contract-farming contributes more to farmers' subjective well-being under certain conditions and contract design. Our main finding corroborates earlier findings from empirical studies using cross-sectional data and income-based measures of welfare. In line with earlier results from the subjective well-being literature, we find that absolute income has a positive but decreasing effect on subjective well-being while comparison income has a negative effect.

To show this, we develop a decomposition framework for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita which deals with the impact of both ageing and immigration on economic growth. Using a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) for the Netherlands during 1973 to 2009, we demonstrate the empirical relevance of some crucial interactions between elements of that decomposition. The conclusion is that even temporary immigration may help to alleviate the ageing problem through a positive long-term contribution to employment, wages and GDP per capita, as long as the immigrants are able to participate in the labour force in tandem with the native population. Unfavourable short-term effects should be avoided through a gradual phasing in of immigration policies.","[Muysken, J.; Ziesemer, T. H.

This issue is studied within a noisy rational expectations framework of asset pricing under asymmetric information in which traders specialize in different driving factors of asset payoffs and interact with others who mechanically link their asset supply to ratings. We show that ratings hardwiring leads to predictable supply shocks and induces informed traders to overreact to new information, thus creating a channel through which shocks are amplified and prices become less informative and more volatile.","Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Pagratis, S (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.",,,"Pagratis, Spyros/0000-0001-8582-2377",,,,,34,2,2,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2013,80,320,,,,,621,649,,10.1111/ecca.12029,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,227IZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325107500001,0

Internet use yields direct utility and economic returns that may increase life satisfaction. But the Internet might also have detrimental effects (e.g. addiction, social isolation). This paper aims to examine the impact of Internet use on individual well-being. Using Luxemburgish data extracted from the European Value Survey, we find evidence that non users are less satisfied in their life than Internet users. Moreover, the positive influence of Internet use is stronger for individuals who are young or not satisfied with their income. These findings suggest that public policies aiming to reduce the digital divide by reaching out to non-Internet users are socially desirable. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The double auction is not a tatonnement mechanism. Disequilibrium trades take place. The absence of any influence of disequilibrium trades, which have the capacity to change the theoretical equilibrium, appears to be due to a property found in the Marshallian model of single market adjustments. The Marshallian model incorporates a principle of self-organizing, coordination that mysteriously determines the sequence in which specific pairs of agents trade in an environment in which market identities and agent preferences are not public. Disequilibrium trades along the Marshallian path of trades do not change the theoretical equilibrium. The substance of this paper is to demonstrate that the Marshallian principle captures a natural tendency of the adjustment in single, continuous, double auction markets and to suggest how it takes place. The Marshallian model of quantity adjustment and the Walrasian model of market price adjustment can be seen as companion theories that explain the allocation and price processes of a market. The Marshallian model explains the evolution of the allocation, who will meet and trade, and the Walrasian excess demand explains the evolution of prices when they do. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This note, by considering how these rates vary by age group, reaches two important and policy relevant conclusions and emphasizes a central avenue for future research. The first is that child extreme poverty rates are 50% higher than adult ones and almost twice those of the elderly. This result depends on assuming that all individuals in a household have the same resource needs and no economies of scale exist, as in the World Bank standard approach. Conversely, if conservative estimates of economies of scale and individual discount factors are adopted, global extreme poverty rates and the child-adult gap are much smaller than the Chen and Ravallion estimates.

We analyze this question by using an empirical econometric model based on Poisson regression with cross-section data covering 51 states in the US. 13 provinces in Canada and 51 other countries. In the course of the study, we check the validity of three important arguments of New Institutional Economics (NIE) for the power market liberalization process. The first argument is the path-dependency. To test its impact on the reform progress, we try to explain whether the background of the chairperson of the regulatory agency when reforms started or that of the governor/minister responsible for energy policy at that time has an impact on the subsequent reform progress. The second argument is the impact of democracy as an institution on the reform progress. We look at the effect of two important indicators of democracy (i.e., civil liberties and political rights) on the reform progress. The final argument of NIE is about transaction costs. We concentrate on the level of corruption in a country as one of the key factors that determine transaction costs and try to explore its impact on the reforms. The results show that the backgrounds of the chairperson and the minister/governor, the level of democracy and corruption in a country are significantly correlated with how far reforms have gone in that country. The negative relationship between reform progress and civil liberties may indicate that reforms may be limited in democratic countries with strong civil society institutions such as trade unions or other organized structures in the society that may consider reforms as 'harmful' to their self-interest.

In this paper we introduce to this macroeconomic system the notion of extinction analysis, a technique often used in the analysis of ecosystems, for the purpose of investigating the robustness of this network. In particular, we subject the WTW to a principled set of in silica knockout experiments, akin to those carried out in the investigation of food webs, but suitably adapted to this macroeconomic network. Informed by results in network theory as well as studies of contagion in economic networks, we seek to understand the role of connectance in the robustness of the system. We interpret increasing connectance as one aspect of a move towards globalization and liberalized trade policy. Broadly, our experiments confirm two conjectures. First, that the WTWs are robust yet fragile networks robust to random failures but fragile under targeted attack. Second, that growing connectance has both positive and negative impacts on robustness. More specifically, we find that increasing connectance corresponds to increasing robustness for small shocks but to decreasing robustness in the face of large, cascading shocks up to the system. This yields evidence in support of the view that globalization, as witnessed by increasing connectance, increases the ability of a system to absorb shock up until a certain size, whereupon the shock overwhelms the system and sparks a broader contagion. We anticipate that experiments and measures like these can play an important role in the evaluation of the stability of economic systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Sellers compete in bidding a menu of contracts, where a contract specifies a vector of characteristics and a payment required from the buyer for delivering these characteristics. The buyer does not commit ex-ante to a decision rule but rather upon observing all the menus offered by sellers chooses the best contract. This paper establishes the existence of a continuum of separating monotone equilibria in this game bounded above by the jointly ex-post efficient outcome and below by the jointly interim efficient outcome.

It is found that Chinese impacts are significantly positive in all sectors and in general Chinese impacts are stronger than those of the United States and France. A South-South trade theoretical framework is then explored to interpret this finding: When the absorptive capability of a poorly-developed country is quite limited and (or) a sizeable substitution effect of importing intermediate goods on this country's local production is present, it is better to import from a Southern country with a superior technology than from a Northern country with a very advanced technology.

In particular, do changes in money have additional effects on aggregate demand outside of those induced by changes in short-term nominal interest rates? This article revisits and reinterprets the empirical evidence based on single equation regressions which is quite mixed, with some results supporting and other results denying the existence of direct effects. We use a structural model with no direct effects of money to show that the finding of positive and statistically significant coefficients on real money growth can be misleading. The model generates data that, when used to estimate analogues of the empirical regressions, produce positive and statistically significant coefficients on real money growth, similar to those often found when using actual data. The problem is that single equation regressions leave out a set of variables, which in turn, give rise to an omitted variables bias in the estimated coefficients on real money growth. Hence, they are an unreliable guide to calibrate monetary policies, in general, including at the zero lower bound.","[Kulish, Mariano] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Elias, Stephen] Reserve Bank Australia, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Reserve Bank of Australia,"Kulish, M (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",m.kulish@unsw.edu.au,,"Kulish, Mariano/0000-0002-1668-8343",,,,,20,1,1,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We base ourselves on an extension of the variety model of technology-driven growth, and are able to demonstrate that the desirable regulation depends non-monotonically on the overall available amount of skilled human capital.

A vertical FDI-based model of heterogeneous firms is proposed to analyze how agglomeration economies and technology incompatibilities between parent firms and their affiliates can affect firm productivity. This model suggests that firms located in areas with more concentrated industrial agglomerations are more productive, while those engaging in OFDI may not perform better in terms of TFP. Using plant-level data, this article constructs an indicator of industrial agglomeration to appraise agglomeration economies on firm productivity. Based on the data for 578 manufacturing firms and the agglomeration indicator, we estimate a cross-sectional econometric model to empirically assess the productivity effects of industrial agglomeration and OFDI. The empirical results show that local industrial agglomerations exert a positive contribution to firm productivity, but that FDI in China has no significant effects on Taiwanese firms' TFP.","[Lee, Yi; Chyi, Yih-Luan; Lin, Eric S.; Wu, Shih-Ying] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Lee, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",ylee@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,50,10,10,2,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We test the assumptions of another theory-that slums are a just transitory phenomenon characteristic of fastgrowing economies-by examining the relationship between economic growth, urban growth, and slum growth in the developing world, and whether standards of living of slum dwellers are improving over time, both within slums and across generations.

As the crisis has revealed, a crucial function of many shadow financial units such as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) has been to make complex debt structures marketable and liquid. To what extent can the financial malaise of 2007 be attributed to the widespread use of such schemes? And how can this problem be conceptualized in contemporary political economy? In this paper we address these questions, examining the case of Northern Rock and its offshore SPV structure, Granite Master Trust. Drawing on the financial instability framework of Hyman Minsky, we find that the collapse of Northern Rock was caused by a confluence of two institutional trends in modern finance. First, it is the tendency of financial firms to exploit the regulatory gap by relying on financial innovation; second, it is the spread of the Ponzi culture as the defining mode of financing for today's economic units. In this, the crisis of Northern Rock is symptomatic of a wider problem of today's financial system where the process of securitization and liquefying debt structures is facilitated through the shadow financial system and often involves illicit practices, as well as outright fraud.(1) JEL Classification: P16; B310; H260; G010; G210; G280.","[Nesvetailova, Anastasia] City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London, England; [Palan, Ronen] City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London, England",City University London; City University London,"Nesvetailova, A (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London, England.",a.nesvetailova@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,91,13,13,2,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Using a one-sector model with infinitely-lived households, we consider a specification of preferences derived from Jaimovich (2008) [14] and Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009) [15] which is flexible enough to encompass varying degrees of income effect. When the income effect is not too large, we show that there exists a Laffer curve, which explains the multiplicity of steady states, and that non-linear consumption taxation may destabilize the economy, promoting expectation-driven fluctuations, if the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption is sufficiently larger than one and the tax rate is counter-cyclical with respect to consumption. Numerical illustrations also show that consumption taxation may be a source of instability for most OECD countries for a wide range of structural parameters' configurations. We finally prove the robustness of our conclusions if we consider a discrete-time setup. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We construct a production function in which the output is produced from conventional inputs of labor and capital, as well as inputs that are more specific to the recorded music industry. We consider two types of output: a commercial output (albums sales) and a creative output (number of new albums released). We show that labels that have adapted to digitization are more efficient in respect of creative output, but that there is no effect of adaptation to digitization on the commercial output, which is consistent with the predictions of the long-tail hypothesis.","[Bourreau, Marc; Gensollen, Michel; Waelbroeck, Patrick] Telecom ParisTech, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Paris, France; [Moreau, Francois] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, ICI, Brest, France",IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale,"Bourreau, M (通讯作者)，Telecom ParisTech, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Paris, France.",marc.bourreau@telecom-paristech.fr; michel.gensollen@telecom-paristech.fr; francois.moreau@univ-brest.fr; patrick.waelbroeck@telecom-paristech.fr,,"Moreau, Francois/0000-0002-5818-5680; Bourreau, Marc/0000-0003-3913-3014",,,,,31,11,15,1,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,,,J CULT ECON,J.

In sharp contrast to traditional Keynesian-type stabilization policies, our analysis finds that raising the tax progressivity may destabilize an endogenously growing economy with fluctuations driven by agents' self-fulfilling expectations.","[Chen, Shu-Hua] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Guo, Jang-Ting] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Guo, Jang-Ting] Acad Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan",National Taipei University; University of California System; University of California Riverside; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",shchen@mail.ntpu.edu.tw,"Guo, Jang-Ting/AAY-8365-2021","Guo, Jang-Ting/0000-0001-9948-9691",,,,,31,12,12,1,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

To do that, we construct a sample of CDS premia and bond spreads on a generic 5-year bond for 17 financials and 18 sovereigns. First, we run panel vector error correction model estimations, showing that the CDS market has a lead over the bond market for financial institutions. This also holds for high-yield sovereigns, whereas the reverse is found for low-yield sovereigns in the core of the euro area. We interpret these results according to the relative liquidity of both markets for different types of entities. Second, we check for nonlinearities in the adjustment process. Results show that the CDS market's lead is amplified when default risk increases, during crisis periods, as well as continuously when CDS premia increase.","[Coudert, Virginie] DGO, Banque France, F-75001 Paris, France; [Gex, Mathieu] DGEI, Banque France, F-75001 Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Coudert, V (通讯作者)，DGO, Banque France, DSF Code 35-1537,31 Rue Croix des Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France.",virginie.coudert@banque-france.fr; mathieu.gex@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,26,13,17,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

A case study that represents these characteristics examines the influence of trust on consumers' reactions to recurring food safety incidents in the context of the first three Canadian bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) cases. We employ Homescan (R) data on household meat purchases and responses to questions on trust administered to those households. Engel functions are used to assess the dynamics of monthly beef expenditure shares of these Canadian households before and after the first three BSE cases. Our results show that trust had no impact on households' reactions to the initial BSE event, but did play a significant role in mitigating the negative impact of the second pair of BSE cases on beef expenditure shares for the appreciable group of trusting households. Potential implications for other risk events with similar characteristics are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence of moral hazard among a sub-group of policyholders with less driving experience (less than 15 years).

It is shown that there exists a range of parental income where the fertility rate is high and children participate in the labour market and receive an incomplete education if a parent believes the return to education is low. The act of participating in the labour market reduces the child's ability to accumulate human capital; thus, the action of sending a child into the labour market is sufficient to ensure that the parents' initially pessimistic expectations are fulfilled. It is then shown that a one-time policy intervention, such as banning child labour and mandatory education, can be enough to move a country from the positive child labour equilibrium to an equilibrium with no child labour.","[Emerson, Patrick M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Knabb, Shawn D.] Western Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA",Oregon State University; Western Washington University,"Emerson, PM (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",patrick.emerson@oregonstate.edu; shawn.knabb@wwu.edu,,,,,,,62,4,5,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We thus expect the price of international long-distance to vary with political regime.

We examine co-movement patterns and show that these are very sensitive to changes in macroeconomic volatility over time.

If such checks and balances limit presidential abuses of power and rents, why do voters support their removal? We argue that by reducing politician rents, checks and balances also make it cheaper to bribe or influence politicians through non-electoral means. In weakly institutionalized polities where such non-electoral influences, particularly by the better organized elite, are a major concern, voters may prefer a political system without checks and balances as a way of insulating politicians from these influences. When they do so, they are effectively accepting a certain amount of politician (presidential) rents in return for redistribution. We show that checks and balances are less likely to emerge when the elite is better organized and is more likely to be able to influence or bribe politicians, and when inequality and potential taxes are high (which makes redistribution more valuable to the majority). We also provide case study evidence from Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela consistent with the model.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Robinson, James A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Torvik, Ragnar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023",,,,,,47,63,78,4,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

It is therefore not surprising that energy efficiency in the residential market has gained importance in recent years. In this paper, we examine awareness, literacy and behavior of households with respect to their residential energy expenditures. Using a detailed survey of 1721 Dutch households, we measure the extent to which consumers are aware of their energy consumption and whether they have taken measures to reduce their energy costs. Our results show that energy literacy and awareness among respondents is low: just 56% of the respondents are aware of their monthly charges for energy consumption, and 40% do not appropriately evaluate investment decisions in energy efficient equipment. We document that demographics and consumer attitudes towards energy conservation, but not energy literacy and awareness, have direct effects on behavior regarding heating and cooling of the home. The impact of a moderating factor, measured by thermostat settings, ultimately results in strong variation in the energy consumption of private consumers.

We test three theories that predict such relative overconfidence. The first theory argues that overconfidence can be generated by Bayesian updating from a common prior and truthful statements if individuals do not know their true type. The second theory suggests that self-image concerns asymmetrically affect the choice to receive new information about one's abilities, and this asymmetry can produce overconfidence. The third theory is that overconfidence is induced by the desire to send positive signals to others about one's own skill; this suggests either a bias in judgement, strategic lying, or both. We formulate this theory precisely. Using a large data set of relative ability judgements about two cognitive tests, we reject the restrictions imposed by the Bayesian model and also reject a key prediction of the self-image models that individuals with optimistic beliefs will be less likely to search for further information about their skill because this information might shatter their self-image. We provide evidence that personality traits strongly affect relative ability judgements in a pattern that is consistent with the third theory of social signalling. Our results together suggest that overconfidence in statements is more likely to be induced by social concerns than by either of the other two factors.","[Burks, Stephen V.] Univ Minnesota, Morris, MN 56267 USA; [Carpenter, Jeffrey P.] Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; [Goette, Lorenz] Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rustichini, Aldo] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Morris; University of Lausanne; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Burks, SV (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Morris, MN 56267 USA.",,,"Goette, Lorenz/0000-0002-1050-0354; Burks, Stephen/0000-0003-4524-2954",,,,,39,83,94,5,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We do, however, find that measures of ambiguity aversion, loss aversion and the willingness to take advantage of a risk pooling scheme all correlate with well-being. Participants who are ambiguity averse, loss averse, and who react conservatively in the risk pooling condition all have significantly lower scores on our well-being index.

This paper uses a laboratory experiment to examine if sellers successfully coordinate to fund a joint research project to reduce their costs, and how this collaboration affects their pricing behavior. The experiment includes control treatments with separate R&D cooperation and markets. Our results show that although participants usually cooperate when given an opportunity, cooperation is observed less frequently when they also compete in the market. Communication improves cooperation in all environments, particularly when the market is present. Nevertheless, the data provide no evidence of seller collusion in the market.

A standard assumption is that agents form expectations by using the correctly specified reduced form model of the economy, the minimal state variable solution (MSV), but they do not know the parameters. However, with medium-sized and large models the closed-form MSV solutions are difficult to attain given the large number of variables that could be included. Therefore, agents base expectations on a misspecified MSV solution. In contrast, we assume that agents know the deep parameters of their own optimising frameworks. However, they are not assumed to know the structure nor the parameterisation of the rest of the economy, nor do they know the stochastic processes generating shocks hitting the economy. In addition, agents are assumed to know that the changes (or the growth rates) of fundament variables can be modelled as stationary ARMA(p,q) processes, the exact form of which is not, however, known by agents. This approach avoids the complexities of dealing with a potential vast multitude of alternative misspecified MSVs. Using a new multi-country euro area model with boundedly estimated rationality we show that this approach is compatible with the same limited information assumption that was used in deriving and estimating the behavioural equations of different optimising agents. We find that there are strong differences in the adjustment path to the shocks to the economy when agents form expectations using our learning approach compared to expectations formed under the assumption of strong rationality. Furthermore, we find some variation in expansionary fiscal policy in periods of downturns compared to boom periods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The key contribution of this approach is that it allows to identify the impact of money growth on inflation without having to model money demand explicitly. Using our results, that provide evidence for a substantial impact of money on prices in the US, we analyze the consequences of the Fed's response to the financial crisis. Our results indicate a raise of US inflation above 5% for more than a decade. Alternative exit strategies that we simulate cannot fully compensate for the monetary pressure without risking serious repercussions on the real economy.

Large, private-property farms owned by powerful landowners coexist with subsistence peasants who farm small plots with limited property rights. At the same time, there is broad consensus that individual, well-specified and secure property rights over land improve economic outcomes. If property rights in land are so beneficial, why are they not adopted more widely? I put forward a theory according to which politically powerful landowners choose weak property rights to impoverish peasants and force them to work for low wages. Moreover, because weak property rights force peasants to stay in the rural sector protecting their property, the incentives to establish poor property rights are especially salient when peasants can migrate to an alternative sector, such as when urban wages increase with industrialization.

Stronger patent rights were associated with faster growth in more patent-intensive industries, and the effect was larger in higher-income countries. Between 1991-1995, an increase in the level of effective patent rights from Turkey to Singapore was associated with the average growth of the other chemicals and leather industries being respectively 1/6 and 1/17 higher.

The replicator dynamic is a special case in which the initial population state is homogeneous, i.e. when all agents use the same mixed strategy. We apply the continuity dynamic to various classes of symmetric games. Using 3 x 3 coordination games, we show that equilibrium selection depends on the variance of the initial strategy distribution, or initial population heterogeneity. We give an example of a 2 x 2 game in which heterogeneity persists even as the mean population state converges to a mixed equilibrium.

In that regard, curtailing CO2 emissions from transport activities is a major objective. In its attempts of decarbonising transport, the European Commission set in 2009 different emission limits on the vehicles sold in Europe. With this background, this paper aims to test the ability of the major car manufacturers to meet these present and future targets with the existing technological trends. To that end, we provide an in-depth analysis on the temporal evolution of emission efficiencies in the Spanish car market. The well-known DEA-Malmquist method is applied over a large sample of car models sold in Spain between 2004 and 2010. A second-stage regression allows us to identify the main drivers of efficiency, catch-up and technical change over the period. Finally, the estimated trends are extrapolated to predict future emission levels for the car manufacturers. Using post-regulation rates of technical change, results show that the vast majority of companies would meet the 2015 target, 27% of the current market would meet the 2020 target, and around 3% would be able to comply with the 2025 target. Thus, since all targets are technologically feasible, stricter regulation is the recommended approach to encourage manufacturers to meet the goals set by the European Commission.

We first analyze patent breadth, which captures the traditional positive effect of patent rights on innovation. Then, we consider a profit-division rule between entrants and incumbents. Given the division of profit, increasing the share of profit assigned to incumbents reduces entrants' incentives for innovation. This aspect of blocking patents captures the recently proposed negative effect of patent rights on innovation. Finally, blocking patents generate a nonmonotonic effect on innovation when the step size of innovation is endogenous because of a novel escape-infringement effect. Calibrating the model to aggregate data, we find that a marginal increase in the blocking effect of patent protection is likely to enhance economic growth.","[Chu, Angus C.] Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham DH1 3HP, England; [Chu, Angus C.] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Pan, Shiyuan] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Durham University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University,"Pan, SY (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Res Private Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.",shiyuanpan@zju.edu.cn,"Chu, Angus/GNH-3700-2022",,,,,,31,23,23,0,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We find that regulation has statistically and economically significant effects on aggregate output and the factors that produce it-total factor productivity (TFP), physical capital, and labor. Regulation has caused substantial reductions in the growth rates of both output and TFP and has had effects on the trends in capital and labor that vary over time in both sign and magnitude. Regulation also affects deviations about the trends in output and its factors of production, and the effects differ across dependent variables. Regulation changes the way output is produced by changing the mix of inputs. Changes in regulation offer a straightforward explanation for the productivity slowdown of the 1970s. Qualitatively and quantitatively, our results agree with those obtained from cross-section and panel measures of regulation using cross-country data.","[Dawson, John W.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Seater, John J.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; North Carolina State University,"Seater, JJ (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",john_seater@ncsu.edu,,"Dawson, John/0000-0002-4556-9474",,,,,59,71,85,0,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

It illustrates how pluralism can be applied to economic research. Specifically, the Minsky-Veblen Cycles combine three elements of institutional and post- Keynesian thought to explain key features of the current crisis. These elements are (1) John Maynard Keynes's postulate of effective demand, (2) Hyman Minsky's financial instability hypothesis, and (3) Thorstein Veblen's concept of conspicuous consumption. In this paper, we have a two-fold approach to them: First, we systematize the connection between the Minsky-Veblen Cycles as a theoretical argument and the epistemological rationale of a pluralist approach to economics. Second, we contrast the implications of our approach for incorporating behavioral assumptions in macroeconomic arguments to mainstream claims for a microfoundation of macroeconomic theory.","[Kapeller, Jakob] Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, Linz, Austria; [Schuetz, Bernhard] Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Kapeller, J (通讯作者)，Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, Linz, Austria.",,"Kapeller, Jakob/AAP-1109-2020",,,,,,28,10,10,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Specifically, Albert advanced a series of epistemological arguments to illustrate conceptual shortcomings in neoclassical theory, which may be utilized to immunize the latter against conflicting empirical evidence. This article summarizes Albert's main arguments and illustrates his most important insights by using simple propositional logic. Based on these findings, a clarification and definition of 'Model-Platonism' is offered and the applicability of the Model-Platonism-critique to current developments in mainstream economics is assessed. Finally, two possible extensions of Albert's argument, the concepts of oscillating informational content and axiomatic variation, are illustrated with respect to their potential for immunization against critique.","Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, A-4040 Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Kapeller, J (通讯作者)，Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",jakob.kapeller@jku.at,"Kapeller, Jakob/AAP-1109-2020",,,,,,64,15,16,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The results reveal a significant decrease in the poverty headcount over the period and small but insignificant decreases in the country's extremely high levels of inequality. Decomposition analysis shows that poverty reduction in Namibia is largely driven by growth in mean incomes rather than redistribution.

It is studied whether the present spatial allocation of turbines in a region affects choices on alternative programmes describing the future shape of wind power generation. Due to the present allocation turbines affect inhabitants of the study region differently. Using a Geographical Information System variables describing respondents' exposure to turbines are calculated, e.g. distance to the nearest turbine. Including them into multinomial and latent class logit models shows that exposure to turbines affects the propensity to choose the non-buy alternative and willingness to pay (WTP) values. Respondents who live further away from turbines are more likely to be the opponents of wind power generation and thus have a higher willingness to pay for moving turbines further away from residential areas. Tests for global and local spatial autocorrelation reveal that global spatial autocorrelation of the individual-specific WTP values is low. However, local clusters of similar WTP exist. Particularly in the biggest city of the study region clusters of respondents with low WTP values are present. Spatial analysis thus provides otherwise invisible pattern. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is usually estimated by means of the consumer's Euler Equation using an instrumental variable approach, and the estimates are usually zero or close to zero. Nevertheless, such attempts present two major problems: first, the use of weak instruments, and second, the absence of a rate of return that is representative of the agent's asset portfolio. The latter has been addressed by using the return of a synthetic mutual fund (SMF), which is a weighted combination of the returns of all assets held by the average household. The use of SMF returns led to EIS estimates of about 0.2 for the US economy. In this paper, we first investigate whether the EIS estimates using the SMF returns for the US suffer from the weak instrument problem. Next, we conduct robustness analyses using different estimators and instrument sets. Our findings show that estimates using SMF returns are plagued by weak instruments, but in some cases partially robust estimators were able to deliver a positive and statistically significant EIS estimate. Furthermore, we found that the Treasury Bill return does not suffer from weak instruments, but the EIS is not precisely estimated and seems to be close to zero. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We show for a homogeneous goods duopoly that the intuition can be misleading, as the intensity of price competition depends on the initial market split. We derive mixed-strategy equilibria, and show that competition is often most intense when the market is split evenly. As a result, firms coordinate on an asymmetric split when consumers are not yet attached to firms. We also allow for asymmetric costs, and analyze when firms with a larger customer base are more eager to innovate.","Humboldt Univ, Inst Competit Policy, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Schmidt, RC (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Competit Policy, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",robert.schmidt.1@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,24,5,7,0,63,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Something went wrong with the free market myth. From this perspective, the paper brings to the fore the regulatory roots of the crisis and highlights the importance of the cognitive bias as well as the incompatibility between micro-rationality and macro-stability in the occurrence of crises. It then analyzes the endogenous instability of finance-led capitalism in a Minskyian vein to point out the crucial role of regulatory structures for macro-stability. The paper then argues that financial stability calls for fundamental modifications of the institutional structure of markets and for new policy principles. Macro-prudential regulation must replace market-oriented supervisory approaches to prevent shortsighted speculative activities and to direct financial markets toward funding productive activities in ways other than though neoclassical market-based incentives.","[Uelgen, Faruk] Univ Grenoble 2, F-38040 Grenoble, France; [Uelgen, Faruk] Univ Grenoble 2, CREG, Branch Campus Valence, F-38040 Grenoble, France; [Uelgen, Faruk] Grenoble Sch Management, Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Grenoble Ecole Management,"Ülgen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble 2, F-38040 Grenoble, France.",,"Ulgen, Faruk/T-9908-2019","ULGEN, Faruk/0000-0003-2625-6293",,,,,38,6,6,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The results show that an increase in maternal labor supplied outside of the household leads to a higher schooling probability for younger children. Specifically, a 1 day per week increase in maternal labor supply is associated with an approximately 5 % points increase in the schooling probability for children between the ages of 7 and 10. However, father's labor supply has an insignificant effect on child schooling across all specifications. The effect for older children between the ages of 11 and 14, who face a tradeoff between schooling, market work, and domestic work, is also found to be insignificant.","[Ural Marchand, Beyza] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada; [Rees, Ray] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany; [Riezman, Raymond] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Alberta; University of Munich; University of Iowa,"Ural Marchand, B (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada.",beyza.ural@ualberta.ca; ray.rees@lrz.uni-muenchen.de; raymond-riezman@uiowa.edu,"Marchand, Beyza Ural/L-7610-2015","Marchand, Beyza Ural/0000-0002-7164-591X",,,,,34,1,3,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

When a country shifts from autocratic rule to highly imperfect democracy (an electoral democracy') it is frequently perceived that the level of corruption increases. Conversely, when the democracy level is already relatively high (approaching mature democracy') an increase in the level of democracy is typically expected to decrease the level of corruption. To assist with our discussion of these issues, before going on to theempirical part of the paper, we look specifically at the case of South Korea to illustrate how corruption responded to an increasing level of democracy. Using panel data, we find strong empirical support for the non-monotonic relationship. For Asia-Pacific countries, we find that the democracy-corruption relationship becomes negative, at a surprisingly high level of democracy. Moreover we also find that the South Asian region is the most corrupt.","[Campbell, Neil] Bond Univ, Fac Business, Gold Coast, Australia; [Saha, Shrabani] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Perth, WA, Australia",Bond University; Edith Cowan University,"Campbell, N (通讯作者)，Bond Univ, Fac Business, Gold Coast, Australia.",ncampbel@bond.edu.au,,"Saha, Professor Shrabani/0000-0001-6729-3811; Campbell, Neil/0000-0003-0758-8452",,,,,29,13,16,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Prominently featured in this reconstruction was a set of contract provisions called Collective Action Clauses, or CACs. CACs are supposed to help governments and private creditors to renegotiate unsustainable debt contracts, and obviate the need for EU bailouts. But European sovereign debt contacts were already amenable to restructuring; adding CACs could make it harder. Why, then, promote CACs at all, and cast them in such a central role in the market reform initiative? Using interviews with participants in the initiative and those affected by it, as well as observations at policy and academic meetings, we attempt to shed light on the puzzle and draw implications for the role of contract techniques in market construction.

The aim of this paper is to investigate how sub-national political differences influence the effect of natural resources on economic growth. Using a dataset of Russian regions, this paper demonstrates that sub-national democratization influences the growth effects of resources and considers possible mechanisms for this influence. The paper finds that in Russia, natural resources are only capable of promoting growth in the regions with non-democratic political systems that, at the same time, have an efficient and non-corrupt bureaucracy.

In previous literature of export-led growth hypothesis, the possibility of nonlinearity in the relationship has been generally ignored. There were comprehensive studies based on linear model, but only a few isolated cases in developed countries focused on nonlinearity in testing this hypothesis. The key drawback of the linear model is the restricted classical assumptions in hypothesis testing. Moreover, the linear model may possibly overlook a significant nonlinear relationship. In this study, the potential nonlinear long-run and short-run relationships are respectively examined by nonparametric cointegration test and nonlinear causality test, in ASEAN-5 countries. The nonparametric cointegration results contribute to the literature by highlighting the nonlinear long-run relationship between exports and GDP per capita for Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore. The findings obtained from the nonlinear causality test also showed that the causal effect of export and GDP is in the nonlinear form, in the case of Thailand and the Philippines.

Additionally, we found that oil prices led exchange rates and vice versa in the crisis period but not in the pre-crisis period.

Each player's constant marginal cost of effort is drawn from a potentially different continuous distribution. In order to study the impact of incomplete information, we compare three informational settings to each other; players are either completely informed, privately informed about their own costs, or ignorant of all cost realizations. For the first and the third setting, we determine the unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Under private information, we prove existence of a pure-strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium and identify a sufficient condition for uniqueness. Assuming that unit cost distributions all have the same mean, we show that under ignorance of all cost realizations ex ante expected aggregate effort is lower than under both private and complete information. Ex ante expected rent dissipation, however, is higher than in the latter settings if we focus on the standard lottery contest and assume costs are all drawn from the same distribution. Between complete and private information, there is neither a general ranking in terms of effort nor in terms of rent dissipation.","Humboldt Univ, Inst Econ Theory 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Wasser, C (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Econ Theory 1, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",cedric.wasser@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,29,38,41,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We find that, in the normal case, there are two attractors for the ratio of experts versus noise traders. Either experts disappear almost entirely from the market, or they account for a certain fraction, with noise traders still being present. In the dynamic framework, the dynamics switches between these attractors, which leads to the emergence of some typical statistical features of financial markets, such as long memory, leptokurtic returns, and bubbles and crashes. Furthermore, we achieve a general approximation of the attractors and of the switching point in between from relevant determinants. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The findings show that most countries have switching between two states: one way causality from growth to financial development but not the other way round, and coexistence of bi-directional causality. Poorer countries are represented by a system with stable steady state while the clusters of advanced economies tend to exhibit multiple steady states.

These policy actions produce different effects on the economic system depending on the regulatory tools adopted and the specific objective of public intervention. The impact on innovation is particularly difficult to predict, especially with regard to the direction of technological change. As a case study, we have chosen the energy sector, in which the strong interrelations between socio-economic and technological dimensions may exacerbate the negative consequences of implementing conflicting policies. The aim of this paper is to show how the lack of strong coordination between different public policies implemented in the energy sector may lead to an incoherent policy mix with negative effects on the development and diffusion of environmentally-friendly energy technologies. We have adopted a gravity equation model based on bilateral export flows of technologies for production and consumption of renewable energies and energy-saving technologies for OECD countries. Our key findings show that alternative measures of public support in the energy sector have been producing contrasting effects on the international competitiveness of energy technologies.","[Costantini, Valeria; Crespi, Francesco] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Econ, I-00145 Rome, Italy; [Crespi, Francesco] BRICK Bur Res Complex Knowledge Innovat, Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy",Roma Tre University; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Crespi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Dept Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",crespi@uniroma3.it,"COSTANTINI, VALERIA/AHA-2817-2022; Costantini, Valeria/I-8461-2016","Costantini, Valeria/0000-0001-6249-3099; Crespi, Francesco/0000-0001-7657-7824",,,,,95,43,47,3,69,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Results are derived from an econometric framework based on nonparametric iterated stationary bootstrap methods, whose statistical reliability and performance we assess through Monte Carlo simulations.","[De Pace, Pierangelo] Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College,"De Pace, P (通讯作者)，Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Carnegie Bldg,Room 205,425 N Coll Ave, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",pierangelo.depace@pomona.edu,"De Pace, Pierangelo/AAC-8621-2019",,,,,,45,6,6,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Can tourism be explained as other export activities? Does service liberalisation have a positive or negative impact on tourism receipts in destination countries? Previous research has either focused on the demand side factors (i.e. factors of demand in the origin countries) or on tourism as a long-run factor of economic growth. The research shows that a complementary perspective such as that offered by trade in a supply side perspective can render additional insights towards understanding tourism. This approach can explain why countries have absolute and comparative advantage. Another finding is that tourism as an export can be explained by some of the same destination factors that explain other service exports. Using different panel estimators the importance of supply side factors that are to some extent exclusive to tourism are demonstrated: the general price competitiveness of the destination, tourism infrastructure and the provision of safety. The econometric models also confirm the relevance of other conventional explanatory factors of trade in services such as GDP per capita and internet usage. The last part of the article analyses the welfare gains from trade under the general agreement on trade in services (GATS). The revenue (tourism receipt) effect is decomposed into a volume (arrival) and price effect. Results suggest that liberalisers under the GATS gained especially from a volume effect with average higher growth rates in the number of arrivals. There is also found to be a positive effect on the average income earned per tourist from being a liberaliser.","[Jensen, Camilla] Univ Nottingham, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sch Econ, Jalan Broga 43500, Semenyih, Malaysia",University of Nottingham Malaysia,"Jensen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sch Econ, Jalan Broga 43500, Semenyih, Malaysia.",camilla.jensen@nottingham.edu.my,"Jensen, Camilla/B-5568-2008","Jensen, Camilla/0000-0002-4367-2638",,,,,37,8,10,10,89,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Such economists, belonging to the original (old) institutional economics and the historical school maintain that the constraint function is riddled with inefficient technologies and institutions which agents fail to replace with superior ones even when the switching cost is clearly lower than expected benefit. The argument ultimately rests on a theory of action a la Herbert Simon-where agents become habituated for whatever is the default institution. Such a theory recognizes that agents are ready to replace habits with more viable ones-but only when agents face shocks or crises. Such recognition, though, necessarily allows rational choice, in the sense of responsiveness to incentives, to enter from the rear window: after all, shocks and crises are merely severe incentives.

The data set includes previously studied demographic factors, as well as records associated with the household's use of computers, television, pay television services, and broadband. Analysis of the data indicate that, when controlling for a number of demographic factors, the purchase of television services is positively correlated with broadband adoption, with consumers who purchase either cable or satellite television service adopting broadband at a higher rate than those who utilize over-the-air television services. The results suggest that consumers who prefer over-the-air television services may face a more substantial hurdle in broadband adoption, one that might be lowered through the availability of affordable stand-alone broadband services.","Roycroft Consulting, Brewster, MA 02631 USA",,"Roycroft, TR (通讯作者)，Roycroft Consulting, 51 Sea Meadow Lane, Brewster, MA 02631 USA.",trevor@roycroftconsulting.org,,,,,,,29,5,8,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Precisely, we argue that more generous employment protection for public sector workers may induce risk averse individuals to select into public sector employment even if they have a low intrinsic motivation and talent for this type of occupation. To empirically assess this effect, we use Germany as a testing ground and exploit changes in employment protection induced by the German reunification in 1990 as a source for identification. Specifically, while occupational choices in West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) and post reunification East Germany may be affected by the described security motive, workers in pre reunification East Germany (German Democratic Republic, GDR) enjoyed an employment guarantee irrespective of their occupation. Using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel, we employ a difference-in-differences approach and use absenteeism as a proxy for intrinsic worker motivation and productivity. The results suggest a significant selection effect: public sector employees who chose their occupation in the FRG report more days of absence relative to comparable private sector workers than the control group of public sector workers who chose their occupation in the former GDR. This effect turns out to be robust against controlling for potential socioeconomic and cultural differences between the groups.","[Boehm, Tobias] Univ Munster, Dept Econ, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Riedel, Nadine] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, Stuttgart, Germany",University of Munster; University Hohenheim,"Böhm, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Dept Econ, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",tobias.boehm@uni-muenster.de; nadine.riedel@uni-hohenheim.dea,,,ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,34,7,8,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

It helps to tackle two main questions 1) Whether oil markets are more or less integrated during periods of extreme energetic prices movements and 2) Whether price-setter markets change during such periods. Our findings indicate that the integration level between crude oil markets tends to decrease during extreme periods and that price-setter markets also change. Such results have policy implication and stress the importance of an active energetic policy during episode of extreme movements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Four days later, the opposition party won the election, against all predictions that were made prior to the terror attacks. This change in expectations presents a unique opportunity to take advantage of event study techniques to test some politico-economic hypotheses. The quantitative exercise is carried out employing Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR). Hypothesis testing is improved by means of bootstrapping techniques. Convergence theories prove quite resilient as, jointly, quoted firms were not significantly affected by the election outcome. The impact on politically connected companies and particular economic sectors, however, suggest that a combination of capture and agency problems may play a role in explaining the effects of the change in expectations.","[Castells, Pau] UK Govt Econ Serv, London, England; [Castells, Pau; Trillas, Francesc] Univ Autonoma Barcelona UAB, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Trillas, Francesc] Inst Econ Barcelona IEB, Barcelona, Spain; [Trillas, Francesc] IESE SP SP Ctr, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Navarra,"Trillas, F (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Barcelona IEB, Barcelona, Spain.",francesc.trillas@uab.es,"Trillas, Francesc/L-4642-2014","Trillas, Francesc/0000-0002-2148-3545",,,,,49,12,12,4,29,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Several robustness tests with different estimators have also confirmed these results.

We find that variance risk-premia are equal to a daily sample average of 0.79 for European Union Allowances and 0.18 for Certified Emissions Reductions. In the spirit of the CAPM, we show that the beta can only explain a small portion, and that macro risk factors specific to CO2 markets and energy volatilities can improve this result. Hence, there exists a systematic variance risk factor in CO2 markets that asks for a highly risk premium. Further analysis shows that variance risk-premia are time-varying, and can be used as strong predictors for forecasting CO2 returns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We provide an explanation for this poor performance. In our model, the political leader of a developing country chooses a policy and whether to implement it in an honest or corrupt manner. These choices affect domestic production and aid inflows. Production is high when productive capacity is high, and when the policy is appropriate in the country-specific circumstances and implemented honestly. Aid inflows are high when the policy is close to the paradigm. In equilibrium, countries with low productive capacity and high corruption resulting from weak political institutions follow the paradigm more closely. Hence, our model suggests that development paradigms have a tendency to fail because they are primarily followed by countries that would fail anyway. We provide empirical evidence in support of the main assumptions and results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this model, stronger patent protection raises the profit flow obtained by innovation but reduces the factor demand for capital. This process accelerates innovation but discourages capital accumulation, and because of the negative effect on economic growth through reducing capital accumulation, strengthening patent protection may then impede economic growth. This result contrasts with earlier studies where innovation is the sole driving force for economic growth. Moreover, in an open economy model where technologies are transferred and capital is imported from abroad, the strictest protection of patents enhances technology adoption from abroad but impedes capital accumulation, and thus, the relation derived between patent protection and output can be nonmonotone. In terms of implications, these findings may be able to partly explain the complex relation found by some empirical studies in this area.","[Iwaisako, Tatsuro; Futagami, Koichi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Iwaisako, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",iwaisako@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Iwaisako, Tatsuro/AAD-7103-2019","Iwaisako, Tatsuro/0000-0003-2285-4456","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22530179, 25780134] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,42,69,73,5,68,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

With gradual information dissemination, slowly decaying uncertainty about the asset's future fundamentals generates persistent conditional volatility and a drift in asset return. Volatility-based proxies for information flows are proposed to examine empirically the asset pricing implications. The results confirm a significant intertemporal relationship between return on the price of oil futures, information diffusion and volatility components. An important implication of our study is that the slow diffusion of information generates predictability in price dynamics. A forecasting model is then constructed and tested in relation to our theory. It is found that the lagged series of the pricing factors possess significant predicting power for returns.

Furthermore, in view of the possibility that China's first demographic dividend will turn negative in 2014, we offer insight into how and to what extent China's labor market needs to adjust and how much labor income must increase for the first demographic dividend to remain positive up to year 2050. For this goal to be achieved, the labor income age profile needs to be shifted to a considerable extent. We conduct an exercise in which the 2007 peak labor income age of 32 years is shifted to 40 years. In the case of the elderly, this implies an annual labor income growth of 3.1 percent over the period of 39 years.

Our empirical results for six OECD countries suggest that though the nominal interest rate and inflation move together in the long run, the cointegrating coefficients between the two variables display an asymmetric pattern depending on the sign and size of the shocks, in sharp contrast to the counterparts with the conventional cointegration methods. In details, in the lower quantiles, the nominal rate is low, and would rise less proportionally than the inflation, leading to the se-called Fisher effect puzzle; by contrast, in the upper quantiles where the level of the nominal rate is high, the former would adjust on a one-to-one basis to changes in the latter, and therefore, support the Fisher hypothesis. Asymmetric monetary policies may be responsible for the findings. Finally, a further checking shows that our findings are robust to the changes of econometric modeling and data frequency.

We exploit a natural experiment that took place during the period in which Germany was divided. Owing to geographical reasons TV programs from the Federal Republic of Germany could not be received in all parts of the German Democratic Republic. Therefore a natural variation occurred in exposure to West German television. We find robust evidence that watching TV is positively correlated with aspirations.

AN ASSESSMENT OF PAROLE VERSUS FIXED-SENTENCE REGIMES,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CRIME; TRUTH,"Over the past 30 years, many states have abolished parole boards, which traditionally have had the discretion to release inmates before the expiration of their full sentence, in favor of fixed-sentence regimes in which the original sentence is binding. However, if prison time lowers recidivism risk and if parole boards can accurately estimate inmates' recidivism risk, then relative to a fixed-sentence regime, parole can provide allocative-efficiency benefits (costly prison space is allocated to the highest-risk offenders) and incentive benefits (prisoners know they must reduce their recidivism risk to gain an early release, so invest in their own rehabilitation). Exploiting quasi-experiments from the state of Georgia, I show that prison time reduces recidivism risk and that parole boards set prison time in an allocatively efficient manner. Prisoners respond to these incentives; after a reform that eliminated parole for certain offenders, they accumulated a greater number of disciplinary infractions, completed fewer prison rehabilitative programs, and recidivated at higher rates than inmates unaffected by the reform. I estimate that eliminating parole for all prisoners would increase the prison population by 10% while also increasing the crime rate through deleterious effects on recidivism.","[Kuziemko, Ilyana] Columbia Business Sch, Columbia, MO USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kuziemko, I (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, Columbia, MO USA.",,,,,,,,41,55,83,1,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Moreover, the recent crisis affecting firstly the GDP growth had also a negative impact on foreign trade and on FDI inflow. Today, there is a strong competition both on the goods market and on the capital market. As a rule, in countries where the stock of FDI is high, the foreign trade is in expansion and has a high level of efficiency and, consequently, a relatively stable economic growth is demonstrated. Based on available statistical data, we estimated a model to simulate the impact of FDI on GDP growth in the EU. Further, a similar approach permitted us to investigate the FDI-Export-GDP relationship in the case of Romania for the last decade.

Employing an overlapping generations framework with endogenous growth, this article analyses the intergenerational welfare effects of: (1) a wealth transfer policy where the entire wealth is transferred to the generations alive at present; (2) an income transfer policy where the wealth is saved and the permanent income of the wealth is transferred to all present and future generations, forever. Not surprisingly, present generations are unambiguously better off with the wealth transfer policy. Less trivially, however, the wealth transfer policy can be associated with higher welfare also for future generations. The intuition for this result is that while a wealth transfer depresses growth only in the periods subsequent to the transfer, income transfers constitute a permanent drag on growth. Perhaps counter to the naive intuition, the policy of saving the wealth and distributing the permanent income to all present and future generations is less beneficial for the future generations if the real return to saving is high.","Norwegian Sch Management BI, Dept Econ, N-0484 Oslo, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School,"Andersen, JJ (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Management BI, Dept Econ, Nydalsveien 37, N-0484 Oslo, Norway.",jorgen.j.andersen@bi.no,,,,,,,39,2,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, we use a reduced form test to short-list bidders whose bidding behavior is at-odds with competitive bidding. Second, we estimate the (latent) cost for these bidders under both competition and collusion setups. Since for the same bid the recovered cost must be smaller under collusion as collusion increases the mark-up than under competition, detecting collusion boils down to testing for first-order stochastic dominance, for which we use the classic Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Our bootstrap based Monte Carlo experiments for asymmetric bidders confirm that the procedure has good power to detect collusion when there is collusion. We implement the tests for highway procurement data in California and conclude that there is no evidence of collusion even though the reduced form test supports collusion. This highlights potential pitfalls of inferring collusion based only on reduced form tests. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Mass production continues to migrate to developing and undeveloped countries as the effect of globalization. Manufacturing companies need long-term strategies which involve innovative products, efficient platforms and adaptable factories and business processes. Such strategies need modern IT solutions to manage customization, to reduce costs and delivery periods, and to support new technologies. This paper presents the competitive environment of manufacturing industries and the main objectives for competition. It describes the new paradigms for manufacturing and technologies for the future. An ERP platform designed for the customization of manufacturing is described. The ERP platform supports fast engineering and fast process chains from customer order to product delivery. It supports the consumer desire for individualized products offering uniqueness against mass production. The paper describes the system's components and the main processes divided into pre-order processes and post-order processes. For each software component the paper presents the data model, the data structures and the main functionalities. The ERP platform aims to support manufacturing companies to gain market shares by responding efficiently to the personalized, unpredictable and sometimes even chaotic consumer requirements.","[Avram, Constantin Daniel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,costin.avram@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2013,,,,,,,254,258,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BGV43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324282200046,0

This may be due to either production plant closures or downsizing by firms that remain active. This paper evaluates the importance of both phenomena for multinational and domestic firms in Belgium over the period preceding the crisis (1997-2008), using a firm-level dataset. Our results reveal that multinational enterprises tend to leave the local market more frequently than domestic firms with comparable firm and sector characteristics. Further, multinational incumbents face employment adjustment costs for white-collar workers that are around half of those borne by domestic firms. In sum, our findings suggest that multinational firms are more flexible in terms of plant location as well as in terms of employment adjustment. However, before the crisis, foreign multinationals created more jobs on average than other types of firms.","[Blanchard, Pierre; Mathieu, Claude] Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE, UPEC, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Dhyne, Emmanuel; Fuss, Catherine] Natl Bank Belgium, Res Dept, Brussels, Belgium; [Dhyne, Emmanuel] Univ Mons, Ctr Rech Warocque, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Fuss, Catherine] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; European Central Bank; National Bank of Belgium; University of Mons; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Fuss, C (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Belgium, Res Dept, Brussels, Belgium.",catherine.fuss@nbb.be,,,,,,,31,1,2,1,12,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Hence, one unintended consequence of the program could be an increase in the size of the informal sector. The introduction of the Seguro Popular program was conducted in stages, across municipalities and time. We exploit this variation and implement a differences-in-differences approach in order to identify the causal effect of the program in formal employment outcomes. We analyze the effect of Seguro Popular using 33 large and relatively rich cities from labor force surveys conducted from 2001 to 2004. In order to measure the effect for poorer municipalities, we also use the individual-level Oportunidades dataset that covers 136 municipalities from 2002 to 2004. We find little evidence of any correlation between Seguro Popular and the decision of workers to be employed in the formal or informal sector. One possible explanation of our findings is the low enrollment of the Seguro Popular program during the period we study. We provide suggestive evidence from the 33 cities that the result holds for the 2005 to 2006 period as well. We conclude that the recent increase in informal employment in large municipalities in Mexico is due to other causes.","[Campos-Vazquez, Raymundo M.] Colmex, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Knox, Melissa A.] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Colegio de Mexico; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Campos-Vázquez, RM (通讯作者)，Colmex, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",rmcampos@colmex.mx; knoxm@uw.edu,"Knox, Melissa/AAN-3457-2021","Knox, Melissa/0000-0001-7525-0854; Campos-Vazquez, Raymundo M./0000-0003-0251-5051",,,,,26,7,7,0,11,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

In the past few decades many scientific theories were studied, dealing with the optimal structure of capital resources and analyzing multiple factors affecting the process of determination of the optimal ratio between capital equity and debt capital. In this way a wide platform of theoretical approaches and opinions on this matter was created. The aim of this article is to discuss theoretical approaches to the evaluation of capital structure of enterprises and Its application under the terms and conditions of the existing Czech accounting and tax legislation. Based on the research into the current state of knowledge in this area, a comparative analysis of the influence of selected effects on the methods used for the displaying and evaluation of the capital structure of an enterprise was executed. The initial study analyzes the Impact of the different approach to displaying of financial leasing liabilities within the leaseholder balance-sheet liabilities. In accordance with the Czech legislation, the leasing liability may or may not be displayed in debt capital section of the balance-sheet The second study confronts the theory of tax shield with the current tax legislation provisions. When credits are arranged between defined entities, debt capital Interests, as the essence of the tax shield theory, cannot be fully recognized from the tax point of view. This is reflected by lowered effect of the tax shield and it also affects the result of business of an enterprise. This article should open discussion with regard to contrasts between theories and economic reality. The difference creates a platform for innovative approach to the development and assessment of the enterprise capital structure.","[Cernikova, Martina; Malikova, Olga] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,martina.cernikova@tul.cz; olga.malikova@tul.cz,"Malikova, Olga/B-5200-2016","Malikova, Olga/0000-0001-7860-8145",,,,,17,2,2,0,5,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,104,113,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300011,0

This may pose a difficult problem either when agents receiving those goods have private information in regards to their values or needs. In this paper, we find an optimal mechanism to allocate goods when the designer is benevolent. While the designer cannot charge agents, he can receive a costly but wasteful signal from them. We find conditions for cases in which ignoring these costly signals by giving agents equal share (or using lotteries if the goods are indivisible) is optimal. In other cases, those that send the highest signal should receive the goods; however, we then show that there exist cases where more complicated mechanisms are superior. Also, we show that the optimal mechanism is independent of the scarcity of the goods being allocated. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This paper aims to explain these developments by estimating a system of simultaneous equations on a panel of 10 advanced economies. The results suggest that the deterioration in the youth labour market has been due to inward shifts in relative demand, offset only partially by reductions in relative supply. The heterogeneity in the deterioration across countries was caused partly by differential rates of relative pay adjustment, depending on each country's mix of labour market institutions and the priority attached by social partners to youth employment.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Christopoulou, R (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, 1787 Neil Ave 235C Campbell Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",Christopoulou.1@osu.edu,,"Christopoulou, Rebekka/0000-0002-7145-5497",,,,,48,3,3,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The analyses are based on all available and appropriate national data sets, each offering unique strengths and measuring a different drug-related outcome. We investigate self-reported illicit drug use (from the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse and National Surveys on Drug Use and Health), drug-related prison admissions (from the National Corrections Reporting Program), drug-related arrests (from Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports), and drug-related emergency department episodes (from the Drug Abuse Warning Network). We find robust evidence that welfare reform led to a 10%21% decline in illicit drug use among women at risk of relying on welfare, as well as associated declines in drug-related arrests (6%7%), drug-related hospital emergency department episodes (7%11%), and possibly drug-related prison admissions (11%19%).

By reviewing the literature, this article argues that closer cooperation in tax issues, for both indirect and direct taxation, needs to accompany the current state of integration in the EU. Advances have taken place in indirect taxes, value added tax (VAT) and excises. With respect to VAT, the major agreements were achieved with the Sixth VAT Directive (1977) and the agreements on rates after the elimination of the frontier controls (1992),In the case of excise duties, the progress have been less significant and there can be noted only the agreements of minimum rates for alcohol, tobacco and energy (fuels). In direct taxation, it is necessary to point out that the powers are national and the EU is limited to guaranteeing the performance of the single market. Community legislation is centered on company taxation and the taxation of savings income. Taxes and social security contributions strongly influence patterns of saving, consumption, investment and employment, and thus shape the operation of markets for goods, services, capital and labor. The reforms launched by the Cardiff European Council of June 1998 are designed to ensure that the differences between systems that have become even more apparent since the introduction of the euro do not hamper trade, result in fragmentation of the single market or prevent the efficient allocation of resources. Tax fraud is another problem of increasing concern in the Community. European Parliament and Council Decision 888/98/EC instituted a program (Fiscalis) to improve the operation of indirect taxation systems in the single market and to secure wide-ranging and effective cooperation between Member States and with the Commission, and to improve administrative practice. International VAT fraud, particularly on sales and deliveries within the EU, has led to serious losses of revenue. Only through closer coordination of national tax policies a balance can be struck between the diversity of Member States' tax and social contribution systems and the right to the freedom of establishment and movement throughout the EU. In a monetary union, with one currency and common policies, a larger harmonization and coordination of the fiscal policies are forced.","[Cuenca Garcia, Eduardo; Navarro Pabsdorf, Margarita; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Garcia, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Campus Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",ecuenca@ugr.es; pabsdorf@ugr.es; amihi@ugr.es,"Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017; , Eduardo/HIK-2340-2022","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906;",,,,,28,7,10,3,95,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Existing studies of income shifting use changes in corporate tax rates as a source of identification. In contrast, this paper exploits exogenous earnings shocks at the parent firm and investigates how these shocks propagate across low-tax and high-tax multinational subsidiaries. This approach is implemented using a large panel of European multinational affiliates over the period 1995-2005. The central result is that parents' positive earnings shocks are associated with a significantly positive increase in pretax profits at low-tax affiliates, relative to the effect on the pretax profits of high-tax affiliates. The result is robust to controlling for various other differences between low-tax and high-tax affiliates and for country-pair-year fixed effects. Additional tests suggest that the estimated effect is attributable primarily to the strategic use of debt across affiliates. The magnitude of income shifting estimated using this approach is substantial, but somewhat smaller than that found in the previous literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Extant literature has found that besides R&D investment, systematic risk, financial leverage and complementary asset investment are also associated with growth opportunities. Accordingly, we employ structural equation modelling to simultaneously estimate both a direct influence of RDI as well as indirect influences of RDI on growth opportunities via these three mediating effects. We find that the direct effect of incremental RDI on growth opportunities is independent of R&D intensity. Instead, the heterogeneous effects of RDI on systematic risk, financial leverage and complementary asset investment across firms with different R&D intensity level accounts for the diminishing marginal returns to R&D investment. We specifically observe that the greatest indirect effect is via the financial leverage of the firm. This study shows the importance of accounting for the interdependencies in R&D investment.","[Ho, Yew-Kee; Lin, Weiling] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Singapore 119224, Singapore; [Faff, Robert] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Yap, Chee-Meng] Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Engn, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 119224, Singapore",National University of Singapore; University of Queensland; National University of Singapore,"Ho, YK (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, 1 Business Link, Singapore 119224, Singapore.",bizhoyk@nus.edu.sg,"Simbolon, Parlindungan/AAV-3622-2020; Faff, Robert/G-1654-2014; Ho, Yew Kee/IUN-5854-2023","Simbolon, Parlindungan/0000-0003-2071-6295; Faff, Robert/0000-0001-6867-9599; Ho, Yew Kee/0000-0002-8500-4806",,,,,49,19,22,1,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, the adequacy of these models is difficult to assess, as money laundering takes place secretly and, hence, goes unobserved. An exception is Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML), a special form of trade abuse that has been discovered only recently. TBML refers to criminal proceeds that are transferred around the world using fake invoices that under-or overvalue imports and exports. This article is a first test on the well-known prototype models proposed by Walker and Unger to predict illicit money laundering flows and to apply traditional gravity models familiar in international trade theory. To do so, we use a dataset of Zdanowicz of TBML flows from the US to 199 countries. Our test rejects the specifications of the Walker and Unger prototype models, at least for TBML. The traditional gravity model that we present can explain TBML flows worldwide in a plausible manner. An important determinant is trade in which TBML is hidden. Furthermore, our results suggest that criminals use TBML in order to escape the stricter anti-money laundering regulations of financial markets.","[Ferwerda, Joras; Kattenberg, Mark; Chang, Han-Hsin; Unger, Brigitte; Groot, Loek; Bikker, Jacob A.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bikker, Jacob A.] Nederlandsche Bank, Supervisory Policy Div, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University; European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV,"Bikker, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.a.bikker@dnb.nl,"Ferwerda, Joras/AAH-4401-2021; Groot, Loek L.

The issue of corruption Is a major issue in almost every country, including the Czech Republic. We are constantly discovering new cases and the media report on their development With a certain amount of optimism we can say that in the fight against corruption. the Czech Republic has experienced a positive shift with regard to punishing the culprits of corruption cases, with first convictions currently emerging. Why is corruption so dangerous? Corruption not only undermines macroeconomic and fiscal stability. causing inefficient use of public funds, but If not timely addressed, it causes growing distrust in the legal system and in the state as such. Despite the work of authors who have come to the conclusion that corruption can have a positive impact on economic growth, the dominant view (supported by a much larger number of studies) is that corruption has a negative effect on growth variables and in turn on economic growth. The aim of this paper is to use dynamic panel regression model to verify the hypothesis of the impact of corruption on economic growth on a sample of OECD countries. To express the perceived level of corruption, we used the index of corruption of PRS Group, which has the advantage of having a much longer history and being more consistent in terms of methodology than compared to the much better known the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) drawn up by Transparency International. Its other advantage is that in case of follow-up studies, it will be able to be used in the future, which in the case of CPI will not be possible due to major changes In its methodology.","[Kotlanova, Eva] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,kotlanova@opf.slu.cz; igor.kotlan@vsb.cz,"Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020","Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216",,,,,33,4,4,1,13,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,307,315,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300032,0

Our results more closely align with the interpretation that standard methods to elicit discount rates reveal the market interest rate faced by an individual rather than their pure rate of time preference. It follows directly from such an interpretation that factors which influence the interest rate at which a household can borrow and lend, such as the inflation rate and household income, ought to be correlated with the elicited discount rate - a prediction supported by our data.

In contrast, learning that one co-worker is receiving a higher piece rate than oneself does significantly affect performance.

To the means by which the transport system can be maintained under extreme weather events is an emerging topic in transport studies, and this is augmented by a growing concern about climate change. This paper considers transport system as dual-network composed of an interrelated operation level and management level that has some similarities with the theory behind the Wardrop Principle. Evidence from the case study on the snow event in South China in early 2008 is used to draw the dual-network formulation to generalise the law of maintaining the transport system under extreme weather. The mathematical models of the dual-network focus on entropic dynamics in the operation network and matching control activities in the management network. Quantitative evidence is provided to prove the methodology. Interactions through the form of information communication and organisational collaboration within and between networks are highlighted. Incentive mechanisms are emphasised for achieving effective anticipation, prevention and collaboration to coping with extreme weather events. This paper contributes to a better understanding about the role of networks, collective behaviour, information interchange and inter-organisational collaboration in influencing the maintenance of transport system under extreme weather conditions.","[Miao, Xin; Tang, Yanhong; Li, Min] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Banister, David] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Xi, Bao] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; University of Oxford; Dalian University of Technology,"Miao, X (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",miaoxin@hit.edu.cn,,,,,,,38,2,2,1,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The results provide strong evidence of a demand-led growth transition. Although the government-led expenditure strategy of the 1980s fulfilled the role of moving the Indian economy out of its slow-growing demand regime (195279) into a faster-growing one, it could not sustain demand growth at the natural rate due to a balance-of-payments constraint. Consistent with the prediction of the BPC growth model, faster export growth in the post-1990 liberalisation period sustained demand growth at its maximum rate by allowing expenditure (including government spending) to grow at a fast rate. The analysis further suggests that India's export surge in the post-1990 liberalisation period has a significant demand-side explanation, rather than an exclusively supply-side interpretation.","Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Nell, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",k.s.nell@uu.nl,,"Nell, Kevin/0000-0001-9243-476X",,,,,64,12,16,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We estimated two types of volatility measures (one based on the ARCH model and the other the usual standard deviation) utilizing daily data from Jan. 2002 through Dec. 2011 and examined both short-run and long-run effects of this volatility on exports of each country to the other with an ARDL approach. The results indicate that Japan's exports to China are not affected by the exchange rate volatility, but China's exports to Japan are negatively influenced during the reform period. Furthermore, the level of the exchange rate has no influence on Japanese exports, but it has a significant impact on Chinese exports. This asymmetric result may be due to differences in the depth of financial markets and in the maturity of exporters of the two countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Prior to this, both in Lithuanian, where the research was conducted, and in the world literature the issues of human resource evaluation and organizational climate were analyzed rather widely. There are many works where they are defined rather comprehensively. In this paper, those works are reviewed, and the conceptual complex model defining the phenomenon of human resource evaluation and organizational climate is designed on their basis. This model consists of the following elements: evaluation methodology, organization of the evaluation, discussion on the evaluation, employee assessors, safety and/or explicitness, diligence and creativity, values and traditions, attractiveness of the work process, manager's relations with employees, employee interrelations and conflicts. Empirical research methods of this model are presented in this paper, including both empirical verification arguments of the research tool and the theoretical model the empirical validation methodology. The questionnaire (based on respondent notions and attitude) was designed by the joint authors of this paper P. Papsiene and J. Vveinhardt and was verified by the methods of factorial and reliability analysis. The designed questionnaire was used for the human resource evaluation and organizational climate interaction research. Interaction of human resource evaluation and organizational climate was analyzed and interaction models were designed using the method of multivariate linear regression. Human resource evaluation and organizational climate interaction research enabled to compose six interaction models and one complex model which is provided in the network diagram. Created models allow better understanding of human resource evaluation and organizational climate interaction as well as its forms. The research on interaction of human resource evaluation and organizational climate showed that in general those two dimensions of organizational evaluation are closely interrelated. They not only affect each other, but also form various network models that define the complexity of interaction and its general construct.","[Papsiene, Palmira] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Vaitkevicius, Sigitas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Papsiene, P (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",palmira.papsiene@gmail.com; sigitas.vaitkevicius@gmail.com,,"Papsiene, Palmira/0000-0002-6824-4250",,,,,34,2,2,1,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

At supranational level, it Is European Union (EU) that supports the elimination of differences between less and most developed Member States and regions to strengthen the cohesion and competitiveness of European territory. The effort to reduce the economic, social and territorial disparities has especially increased since the EU biggest enlargement The accession of new Member States has been associated with an increase in regional disparities that have negatively affected the EU competitiveness in global scale. The strengthening of competitiveness and convergence of economic performance with an average level of the EU have become the basic objectives for new Member States. The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, called Visegrad Four countries (V4), belong to new Member States whose economic development of the last 10 years has been strongly influenced by EU accession. Although the regional disparities have been reduced in V4 with contribution of EU Cohesion policy, negative disparities have still persisted. This paper is aimed to evaluate the regional disparities of socio-economic development in V4 in the period 2000-2010 using analytic hierarchic process (AHP) and TOPSIS method. Theoretical background of the paper outlines the concept of regional disparities in the EU and focuses on AHP and TOPSIS methodology. TOPSIS is one of the multicriteria decision-making methods that can present an alternative way of regional disparities and its evaluation. The empirical part of the paper deals with multi-criteria evaluation and comparison of differences between NUTS 2 regions in V4 based on selected economic, social and territorial indicators. At first, the weights of indicators for disparities evaluation are computed based on method of pairwise comparison In the context of AHP.

The study employed the bounds testing approach of cointegration to estimate the long-run relationship between the variables, while an error correction model was used to determine the short-run dynamics of the system. The study was limited to a few variables, including economic growth, imports, unemployment rate, external debt and consumer price index, in order to manage robust data analysis. These variables are selected because of their vital importance to an emerging economy like Pakistan. Both short and long-run results confirm that except consumer price index, all other explanatory variables are positively associated with the revenue gap in Pakistan. The results suggest that changes in price level decrease the revenue gap in the short-run which indicates the Patinkin effect but these results disappear in the short-run. The results further point out that the speed of adjustment is rather slow for equations to return to their equilibrium level, once it has been shocked. The result of Granger causality test shows that there is a bidirectional causality relationship between revenue gap and imports on one hand, and between revenue gap and underground economy on the other hand. Moreover, unidirectional causality runs from debt, unemployment and inflation towards imports. There is a bidirectional causality runs between debt and imports, between unemployment and imports and between inflation and imports in Pakistan. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The standard approach assumes that an individual invests some time in education, and then it shows up in terms of enhanced future earnings as a return, i.e. investment in education helps to increase the individuals' future earnings. How much to invest in education is one of the most important economic decisions that individuals have to face. Hundreds of studies in many different countries and time periods have confirmed that better-educated individuals earn higher wages, suffer less unemployment and work in more prestigious occupations, have other social returns like honour and status than their less-educated counterparts. This positive correlation between education (schooling) and earnings is well established in the empirical literature. Despite the fact, that the rate of return to education (human capital) has been widely studied in the world since the late 1950s and even though hundreds of papers have studied this issue in various countries at different time periods and with alternative estimation methods, studies concerning Lithuania's case remain limited. This study focuses on the evaluation of investments in human capital. Problem question raised: Once education, which plays a very important role in development and growth of a country, is treated as an investment, the immediate natural question is: what is the profitability of this investment comparing to alternatives? Therefore it is important to investigate the return to investment in education in order to evaluate effectiveness of investments in human capital in Lithuania and compare it to the other countries in the development process. The object of the research - the return to investment in human capital. The aim of the research is to estimate the private rate of return to human capital in Lithuania and to study the changes of these returns during the time (2003-2011) and compare calculated data with analogical data in other countries. In the first part of the paper the concept of human capital is defined, before estimating the returns to human capital. In order to reveal the return to investment in human capital, it was limited to investment in education overview. Further, the research methodology is presented. One of the main ways to calculate the rate of returns to investment in human capital, which is used in the empirical practice, is the full-discounting or elaborate method, which consists in calculating the internal rate of return, was employed. 2003-2011 statistical data were used for the study. The conclusions reveal that the rate of return to investment in human capital varies over time and rate of return for females is lower than for males. The rate of return of investment in human capital varies, reflecting the effect of constantly decreasing income tax, average wage and cost changes of higher increments of education (increase / decrease). After comparing Lithuania's and other countries' rate of return on investment in human capital, it is seen that private rate of return in Lithuania is similar to Denmark, Spain, Finland, Germany and USA. Compared to neighbour countries Latvia and Estonia, the return on investment in human capital is also similar to that in Lithuania.","[Tamasauskiene, Zita; Poteliene, Simona] Siauliai Univ, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Tamasauskiene, Z (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Architektu St 1, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",zita.tamasauskiene@smf.su.lt; simona.ind@gmail.com,,"Tamasauskiene, Zita/0000-0002-5363-6892",,,,,64,3,5,1,33,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Private benefits are assumed to generate costs which are passed through the organizational structure and create price distortion in the downstream product market. We prove that this may affect the profit (i.e. the market value) of the firms in a positive sense since the intensity of rivalry is curbed by the cost increase. In oligopoly, private benefits extraction may enhance the profits while still generating a welfare loss: this suggests that corporate governance cannot be divorced from competition policy in industries where managerial opportunism generates expropriation costs.","EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LARGE, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",,"Thépot, J (通讯作者)，EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LARGE, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",thepot@unistra.fr,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,7,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

The rich contributions to a better understanding of pro-poor growth need to be complemented by a similar effort to understand better the mechanisms through which poverty impacts growth and how to design a pro-growth poverty-reduction strategy. The objectives of this paper are to review and attempt to synthesise the relevant literature on, first, the growthinequalitypoverty nexus and, second, the reverse causality linking reduced poverty to more inclusive growth within the context of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The analysis of the interrelationship among growth, inequality and poverty can be undertaken at different levels of aggregation. In this paper, this interrelationship is scrutinised under three different lenses: a global one, a macro (national) one and a micro one. Under each one of these lenses, an attempt is made to identify the main mechanisms through which growth affects poverty, while emphasising the relatively novel reverse causality and the various mechanisms through which poverty reduction can encourage present and future growth. A successful national development strategy needs to be context-specific and tailored to the initial conditions of each country. The final section of the paper derives a typology distinguishing Sub-Saharan economies according to their initial conditions such as quality of governance and institutions, resource endowment, level of development, potential for agricultural growth and geographical location. Six categories of SSA countries are identified and the most relevant development policies in each instance are suggested.","Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Thorbecke, E (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",et17@cornell.edu,,,,,,,39,82,90,1,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Optimal policy rules are calculated using simulation of the model over a long time period coupled with a search for optimal Taylor rule parameters using the Newton-Raphson loss minimization algorithm. The weights in the pre-crisis loss function are then inferred from the Taylor rule parameters estimated from the period corresponding to Bank of England independence, i.e. 1997-2008. These estimates are consistent with a low weight on inflation relative to output stabilization even before the crisis. The model is therefore consistent with the hypothesis that there has been no change in Bank of England preferences and that the Bank has responded to the crisis in a way which would have been predicted on the basis of its pre-crisis behaviour.","Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Turner, P (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",p.m.turner@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper, we design a novel experiment to provide direct evidence on the role punishment plays in communicating norms. Importantly, this allows us to provide experimental evidence indicating that if people know that enforcers can benefit monetarily by punishing, they no longer view punishment as signaling a norm violation. The result is a substantial degradation of punishment's ability to influence behavior.

J,"Xu, T",,,,"Xu, Tao",,,Can Ownership Diversification Enhance Banks' Efficiency? An Analysis Based on Super Efficiency and Tobit Regression on the Chinese Listed Commercial Banks,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ownership diversification; Super efficiency; Tobit regression; Data Enveloping Analysis; Chinese listed commercial banks,,"Ownership diversification can improve the monitoring level in commercial banks and hence increase the efficiency. A good case is the Chinese commercial banks which have achieved outstanding performance in the recent years. In the past decade, many Chinese banks have been listed. Going listed has provided opportunities for the banks' ownership to be diversified. Since those banks were controlled more or less by the state before going listing, it is meaningful to study the impacts of ownership diversification on the Chinese listed commercial banks' efficiency. Our sample in this paper includes sixteen Chinese listed commercial banks with data from 2007 to 2011. Herfindahl index is the most widely used proxy to measure the degree of concentration. Hence it can reflect the degree of diversification too. In this paper, we have used Herfindhal index of the largest, the largest three, the largest five and the largest ten shareholders as the proxies for ownership structure. We include these four proxies because in the Chinese listed banks, some are owned by several largest shareholders, while others have much fewer large shareholders. There are several methods to measure the banks' efficiency. To get more precise measurement, we adopt the super efficiency method Super efficiency has the advantage of higher comparability for the sampled banks. On the other hand, we have used Tobit regression model rather than the ordinary least square (OLS) method because the dependent variable (the super efficiency) is positive. In this paper, we have measured the super efficiency with Data Enveloping Analysis (DEA) and then studied the impacts of the ownership diversification on the efficiency with Tobit regression model. The Chinese listed banks can be categorized into two groups. One is the four formerly state-owned largest commercial banks (hereinafter Big Four), the other is the group of smaller banks with less control from the government (hereafter non-Big Four). Because these two groups have different ownership structure, the ownership diversification can influence their efficiency differently. To discover the differences of the impacts from the ownership diversification, we try to compare the impacts of ownership diversification on the efficiency of the formerly state-owned larger banks (Big Four) and smaller banks (Non-Big Four). To overcome the problem of inadequate observations in Big Four sample, we first run Tobit regression with the full sample, and then run Tobit regression with non-Big Four sample. The difference in the coefficients can reveal the different impacts of ownership diversification on the efficiency. Our results indicate that ownership diversification can enhance the listed commercial banks' efficiency. But the coefficients in the non-Big Four sample are smaller than those in the full sample models, which indicate ownership diversification has greater positive impacts on the efficiency of the formerly state-owned larger banks than that of the smaller banks. Our contribution is that our paper is the first one to study the impacts of the ownership diversification on the listed commercial banks which were previously held by the state.","[Xu, Tao] Soochow Univ, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Tao] Fudan Univ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Soochow University - China; Fudan University,"Xu, T (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",tylerxu@sina.com,,,,,,,28,2,2,1,31,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The group of working terms has a double function: a descriptive one (knowledge function) and an explanatory one (understand function). As soon as we apply the terms we confirm a learning activity. Knowledge developed by scientific research in e-society is recorded in technology becoming a new version of the technological infrastructure for another scientific research. Such an approach involves a specific paradigm for the e-science concept and for the internal flow between e-science and e-education consisting of individual recursive activities based on explicit competencies which connect the fieldwork and the deskwork.

The estimated preference for quality turns out to be monotonically increasing in foreign destinations income.

Academic institutions have also changed how they allocate their resources. The percentage of faculty nationwide that is full-time has declined, and the vast majority of part-time faculty members do not have Ph.D.s. The share of institutional expenditures going to faculty salaries and benefits in both public and private institutions has fallen relative to the share going to nonfaculty uses like student services, academic support, and institutional support. There are changing modes of instruction, together with different uses of technology, as institutions reexamine the prevailing lecture/discussion format.

If agents differ regarding their labor endowment, the golden rule ceases to serve its watershed role. Except for the case where all agents' Engel-curves are linear and identically sloped lines through the origin, some agents' maximum utility is always associated with a capital intensity that exceeds (or falls short of) the golden rule level. If heterogeneity is introduced on the preference side, the golden rule is never optimal for all agents. These results stem from an intra-generational redistribution of resources which is entailed by the competitive markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We propose that this bundling of social and infrastructure goods provision with firm's core operations is a fully rational choice in an uncertain institutional environment. A unique survey data suggest that this manifests itself through more reliable infrastructure, stronger employee attachment to the firm and, most interestingly, through better relations with the authorities. Relationship with authorities is a two-way game where the firm gains from the arrangement but on the other faces sanctions if it decided to depart from it.

We build a simple small open economy model with intermediate goods trade to show that due to the intra-regional trade in intermediate goods, a devaluation of other Asian currencies does not necessarily hurt China's exports, as imported intermediate goods could become cheaper. The effect of intermediate goods costs depends critically on the share of intermediate goods used in China's export goods production and the degree of exchange rate pass-through in imported intermediate goods prices. If prices for intermediate goods are not very sticky, the effect through this channel could be large, and China's exports could even benefit. We find that these findings do not depend on China's choice of currency invoicing between the RMB and the US dollar or the choice between fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes.

We found that providing across-the-board subsidy on R&D expenditure may lead to an increase in the carbon intensity, as well as the real GDP for the Korean economy. However, when R&D subsidies are combined with a carbon tax, real GDP can grow without increasing CO2 emissions. Carbon tax on top of R&D subsidy represses the growth of carbon intensive industries compared to the case of stand-alone R&D subsidy policy. Furthermore, carbon intensive industries reduce carbon intensity by way of fuel mix change to cope with a higher carbon tax rate to meet the national CO2 reduction target. The final outcome impinges on the industry structure of the economy. Therefore, a careful study of the industry structure of the economy is warranted to maximize the effectiveness of climate change policy-mix. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Among the nonsupported countries, China, Taiwan and Malaysia did not improve efficiency (however, Hong Kong and Singapore did) after the start of the crisis, providing some evidence of a positive effect according to the with-without approach. The Thailand, Indonesia and Korean markets showed positive abnormal returns on the days or days following policy announcements in this IMF-supported program, indicating positive effects of the policy according to the event study approach.

We do this by investigating whether digit ratios (2D:4D) and menstrual cycle information are correlated with choices in ultimatum, trust, public good and dictator games. Digit ratios are thought to be a proxy for prenatal testosterone and oestrogen exposure and the menstrual cycle is a proxy for contemporary variations in a range of hormones. We find that digit ratios predict giving in all games. In our preferred specification, giving in the trust and public good games as well as reciprocity in the trust and ultimatum games vary significantly over the menstrual cycle. We discuss possible mechanisms behind these effects and conclude that biological factors play an important role in shaping social preferences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The region has trailed most other world regions over the past half century despite relatively high initial development and school attainment levels. This puzzle, however, can be resolved by considering educational achievement, a direct measure of human capital. We introduce a new, more inclusive achievement measure that comes from splicing regional achievement tests into worldwide tests. In growth regressions, the positive growth effect of educational achievement fully accounts for the poor growth performance of Latin American countries. These results are confirmed in a number of instrumental-variable specifications that exploit plausibly exogenous achievement variation stemming from historical and institutional determinants of educational achievement. Finally, a development accounting analysis finds that, once educational achievement is included, human capital can account for between half and two thirds of the income differences between Latin America and the rest of the world.

We focus on a demand-driven mechanism, the trade channel, which transmits oil shocks across economies through changes in the non-oil goods terms of trade. When the trade channel is operative we have three main consequences on the transmission of oil shocks. First, the macroeconomic impact of oil shocks may be large and asymmetric across countries. Second, the magnitude of the effects is nonlinear in the size of the oil shock. Third, terms of trade movements never ensure international risk sharing after an idiosyncratic oil supply shock.

One rationale points to market failures that have not been corrected by other policies, most notably greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on oil. Another inspiration for clean energy policy reflects economic arguments of the 1980s. It suggests strategic government investments would increase U.S. firms' market share of a growing industry and thus help American firms and workers. This paper examines the reasoning for clean energy policy and concludes that: center dot While a case can be made that subsidizing clean energy might help address market failures, the case may be narrower than some assert, and turning theory into sound practice is no simple feat. center dot An appropriate price on greenhouse gases is an essential precondition to ensuring efficient incentives to develop and deploy cost-effective emissions-abating technologies. However, efficient prices alone are unlikely to generate efficient levels of basic research and development by private firms. center dot Government investments in clean energy are unlikely to produce net increases in employment in the long run, in part because pushing home-grown technologies at taxpayers' expense offers no guarantee that the eventual products ultimately would not be manufactured somewhere else. center dot Spending on clean energy technologies is not well suited to fiscal stimulus. The authors recommend that: center dot Federal energy spending should invest in technologies with the lowest expected cost of abatement and highest probability of market penetration. center dot Funding decisions ought to be insulated - as much as possible - from rent-seeking by interest groups, purely political distortions, and the parochial preferences of legislators.

To isolate the role of search frequency, we focus on symmetric equilibria in a symmetric environment.

An analysis of litigation strategies in EC mergers,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Merger litigation; Merger remedies; Synergies; Efficiency defence,INSTRUMENT RELEVANCE,"Efficiency defence and merger remedies are key components in most merger control regimes. Although in many jurisdictions both the provision of efficiency-related evidence and remedy offers are at the merging firms' discretion, most previous works have only analysed them separately. This paper is an attempt to empirically model the system of decisions that firms face in merger litigation where they are allowed to choose what combination of efficiency claims and settlement offers to make. The main novelty of this work is the use of data from company reports on the merger-generated synergy expectations signalled to shareholders, which allows the direct empirical testing of some of the assumptions and findings from previous works. Evidence is presented that the current EC merger control regime is incapable of extracting information from firms on their efficiency expectations and the identity and experience of the legal advisor plays a key role in this; that pre-merger synergy expectations enhance the willingness to offer remedies; and finally, that the cost of delay plays a central role in designing firms' litigation strategy, especially when these costs exceed the cost of the remedy.

These results can explain the finding in Sweeting (2007, Economic Journal, 117, 654685), that dramatic fragmentation of generation capacity in the English electricity industry did not reduce price cost margins.","[Kuehn, Kai-Uwe] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,,kai-uwe.kuhn@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,29,5,5,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

This paper describes and discusses the representation of primitive societies by economists from the proto-imperialist model of Smith to the imperialist Posner's model. It maintains that (a) the economists' attempt at interpretation is highly unsatisfactory and (b) it is possible to offer a different representation of the primitive societies, one more coherent with the anthropological and ethnographical data, and able to show the inadequacy and insubstantiality of many economic categories when applied to those societies.

I estimate this impact using two sources of data on HIV incidence, one generated based on UNAIDS estimates and the other based on observed HIV mortality. These data are combined with data on export value and volume. I find a fairly consistent positive relationship between exports and new HIV infections: doubling exports leads to a 10%70% increase in new HIV infections. Consistent with theory, this relationship is larger in areas with higher baseline HIV prevalence. I interpret the result as suggesting that increased exports increase the movement of people (trucking), which increases sexual contacts. Consistent with this interpretation, the effect is larger for export growth than for income growth per se and is larger in areas with more extensive road networks.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Oster, E (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",emily.oster@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,36,56,61,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

A cognitive hierarchy comprises a set of cognitive types whose behavior ranges from random to substantively rational. Specifically, each cognitive type in the model corresponds to the number of periods in which economic agents process new information. Using experimental data, we estimate type distributions in a variety of task environments and show how estimated distributions depend on the structural properties of the environments. The estimation results identify significant levels of behavioral heterogeneity in the experimental data and overall confirm comparative static conjectures on type distributions across task environments. Surprisingly, the model replicates the aggregate patterns of the behavior in the data quite well. Finally, we found that the dominant type in the data is closely related to Bayes-rational behavior.","UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Choi, S (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",syngjoo.choi@ucl.ac.uk,,"Choi, Syngjoo/0000-0003-4006-0377",,,,,22,11,13,0,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

This presumes that corporate publications enter the pool of prior art which is relevant to judge the novelty of patent applications at the patent office and that corporate science has the power to block patent applications. This paper analyses for the first time whether the presumed mechanism behind corporate publications as a means to preempt patents works. With a focus on the semiconductor technology, our results show that scientific publications by corporations challenge the novelty of patent applications at the European Patent Office (EPO) significantly more than other pieces of prior art. Detailed information from the EPO patent examination procedure allows us to show that corporate publications threaten the novelty of patent applications if combined with other pieces of prior art like patents rather than as standalone documents. This supports the claim that corporate scientific publishing can be an effective means for firms to protect their freedom to operate if used as a complementary part of a firm's overall IP protection strategy.

Our empirical results show that there is no significant evidence to support the existence of a resource curse phenomenon in China.

Chance constraint programming is used to analyze the role of stochastic carbon sinks for national and EU-wide compliance costs. The analytical results show that the inclusion of the carbon sink option can reduce costs for low enough marginal cost and risk discount, but also that costless carbon sinks as by-products from forestry are not part of a cost-effective solution under a high reliability concern. Cost savings are reduced due to risk discounting under a reliability concern, in particular when assigning Chebyshev's inequality as compared with a normal probability distribution. It is also shown that the supply of forest sinks on the market depends on the differences in marginal abatement cost between the trading and the non-trading sectors, and in risk discounting between achievements of the ETS cap and the national commitment. Relatively low marginal abatement cost in the non-trading sector and high risk discounting of national commitment achievements increase the supply of sinks in the market and, hence, reduces the equilibrium price. The empirical application illustrates the importance of risk discounting for the magnitude of cost savings obtained from introducing forest carbon sinks in the EU ETS and national commitments.

In many multinational enterprises (MNEs), they constitute a major portion of the business's value. The intra-firm transfer pricing process for patent-related royalty payments is moreover often highly intransparent and patents thus represent a major source of profit shifting opportunities between multinational entities. For both reasons, MNEs have an incentive to locate their patents at low-tax affiliates to minimize the corporate tax burden. The purpose of our paper is to empirically test for this relationship by exploiting a unique dataset that links information on patent applications to micro panel data for European MNEs. Our results suggest that the corporate tax rate (differential to other group members) exerts a negative effect on the number of patent applications filed by a multinational affiliate. The effect is quantitatively large and robust to controlling for firm size and unobserved heterogeneity between the entities. The findings moreover prevail if we account for royalty withholding taxes and binding 'Controlled Foreign Company' rules. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Two possible regimes are considered: high volatility and low volatility. The specification accounts for deviations from normality and the existence of persistence in the evolution of the VIX index. Since the evolution of the VIX index seems to indicate that its conditional variance is not constant over time, I consider two different versions of the model. In the first one, the variance of the index is a function of the volatility regime, whereas the second version includes ARCH and GARCH specifications for the conditional variance of the index. The empirical results show that the model adjusts quite well to the volatility regimes corresponding to the VIX index. The information provided by the model may be a useful tool for investment decisions, as well as for hedging purposes regarding the volatility of a certain asset.","Univ Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"Romo, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.",,,"Marabel Romo, Jacinto/0000-0001-6843-0312",,,,,34,1,1,0,12,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

J,"Rajeev, M",,,,"Rajeev, Meenakshi",,,"Search cost, trading strategies and optimal market structure",ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Trading post; Market less trade; Steady state Nash equilibrium,MONETARY EXCHANGE; MONEY; MEDIA,"The theory of Walrasian equilibrium yields a set of prices at which the aggregate competitive demand for each commodity equals its aggregate competitive supply. However, even at equilibrium prices the theory of competitive equilibrium does not explicitly offer explanation regarding the manner in which trades are actually executed. This paper considers a model where trade takes place in a decentralized fashion and examines in a dynamic game-theoretic framework, the role of social institution of money and markets in facilitating exchange. The steady state Nash equilibrium derived in the paper demonstrates how, depending on the level of transaction costs associated with a market setup (synonymously, trading posts to exchange possible pairs of goods) appropriate monetary trade emerges, which like a hub and spoke network (Starr and Stinchcombe, 1999) makes some markets non-functioning and in equilibrium only the markets having trade through the medium of exchange continue to exist. However, despite the obvious advantages of a market setup in reducing search costs, pure random search for a complementary trading partner (as considered by Ostroy and Starr, 1974; Kiyotaki and Wright, 1989; and others) prevails in many economies, especially, in many developing economies. This paper models this feature of developing economies by introducing differences in transaction costs across agents and shows why sustainable equilibria might exist exhibiting random search for certain commodities even in the presence of established markets.

Our main finding is that if better factor substitution raises savings in the steady state, then a higher per capita income results. There are two channels by which factor substitution affects savings: the positive efficiency effect via income and the ambiguous distribution effect via factor income shares. If the efficiency effect dominates, then a higher elasticity of substitution leads to a higher level of per capita steady-state income. In transition, factor substitution affects the rate of convergence both directly and through the equilibrium profit share. The former arises from diminishing marginal productivity of capital whereas the latter reflects its relative scarcity. Depending on the interaction of these effects, the net outcomes are characterized.","[Yip, Chong K.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xue, Jianpo] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Renmin University of China,"Yip, CK (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",chongkeeyip@cuhk.edu.hk,"XUE, Jianpo/JGD-3964-2023; YIP, Chong/AAU-7049-2020","Yip, CHONG KEE/0000-0003-2950-2461; Xue, Jianpo/0000-0002-8567-5685",,,,,19,18,18,0,36,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We extend the framework of De Fraja (2002) in two directions. First, we replace his specification of the governments budget constraint, which prevents the government to use tax revenues from an older generation to subsidize the education of a younger generation, by the usual one. We show that the optimal educational policies achieve the first best, are not regressive, and can be decentralized through Pigouvian taxes and credit provision. Second, we consider utility functions that are not quasi-linear. In this case, we show that the first best can no longer be reached, education may not be monotonic in ability, and progressivities of education are locally welfare-improving.","[Gottlieb, Daniel] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Moreira, Humberto] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Grad Sch Econ, BR-22253900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",University of Pennsylvania; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Gottlieb, D (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dgott@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The implicit tax rate on further work is included as a forward looking incentive measure. A substantial change of the disability pension legislation caused exogenous variation in disability benefits in Germany in 2001 and is used to obtain estimates of individual's responses to financial incentives. Benefit levels appear to have no effect on the labour market behaviour. At the same time, there is a sizable and significant disincentive effect of implicit taxes on labour market income, indicating that alleviating such disincentives would likely increase labour force participation. Since the response to financial incentives occurs mainly among those in good health, such a policy might on the other hand imperil the aim of providing insurance against a health-induced loss of one's working capacity.

This paper examines how income taxes affect time allocation during the entire day and how these time allocation decisions interact with expenditure patterns. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics from 1975 to 2004, we analyse the response of single women's housework, labour supply, and other time to variation in tax and transfer schedules across income levels, number of children, states, and time. We find that when the economic reward to participating in the labour force increases, market work increases and housework decreases, with the decrease in housework accounting for approximately two-thirds of the increase in market work. Analysis of repeated cross sections of time diary data from 1975 to 2004 shows that home production decreases substantially when market hours of work increase in response to policy changes. Data on expenditures show some evidence that expenditures on market goods likely to substitute for housework increase in response to a greater incentive to join the labour force. The baseline estimates imply that the elasticity of substitution between consumption of home and market goods is 2 center dot 61. The results are consistent with the Becker model. Meanwhile, single men show little response to changes in tax policy, and we are able to rule out an elasticity of substitution between home and market goods for this group of more than 1 center dot 66.","[Gelber, Alexander M.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gelber, Alexander M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mitchell, Joshua W.] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; Urban Institute,"Gelber, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,60,39,46,3,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Monitors hired to minimize cheating, however, are themselves vulnerable to collusion and extortion. I focus on one such informal monitor - the fair authorities at the trade fairs at Champagne - asking why the fairs survived for centuries instead of instantly crumbling in the face of the authorities' overwhelming incentives to collude. Milgrom et al.'s (1990) seminal model of the Champagne fairs is not equipped to deal with collusion, though it does deal with extortion. I show that there is a collusion-proof equilibrium in an alternative model with a competing fair and merchant guilds/self-governed merchant communities and show how these institutions interact with the Champagne fair authorities' incentives. This is invulnerable to collusion, extortion and reverse extortion (unscrupulous clients threatening to smear a monitor's reputation unless bribed). I highlight the crucial roles of competition among monitors, the existence of a collective body to organize coordinated punishment of monitors caught colluding, and network effects among the monitor's customers that exacerbate any punishment.

J,"Hua, XY",,,,"Hua, Xinyu",,,The right of first offer,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Right of first offer; Misallocation; Rent seeking; Renegotiation,,"This paper examines the right of first offer, which requires a seller to bargain with the contracted buyer before subsequent buyers arrive. The contract also prevents the seller from selling his unique asset to subsequent buyers at a price below what he offers to the contracted buyer. The right of first offer makes the seller less aggressive in bargaining with the contracted buyer, who is privately informed about his valuation. Such a contract can reduce inter-temporal misallocation, in which a subsequent buyer gets the asset when the contracted buyer has higher valuation. But it also may cause misallocation in which the contracted buyer gets the asset when subsequent buyers have higher valuations. Overall, whether the right of first offer can increase the joint surplus for the seller and the contracted buyer, as well as social welfare, depends on the contracted buyer's renegotiation power and the distribution of the buyers' valuations. This paper also discusses the differences between the right of first offer and the most-favored-customer clause. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We perform a simulation of the exploration process using Bayesian updating. The approach enables us to isolate the information effect on the success rate and also to quantify the subjective expectation of the total resource size. The area under exploration consists of a number of regions which may differ in their oil content. Exploration is performed with the goal to maximize the expected success rate. The resulting information about the distribution of oil and the total resource size is assumed public knowledge. A number of scenarios with variations in the dimensions of the area under exploration, the oil distribution and initial beliefs are considered. The results indicate that the information effect on the success rate is significant but brief it might have a considerable impact on price but is an unlikely mechanism behind a long-term declining price trend. However, the information effect on expectations is gradual and persistent. Since exploration is performed in regions where the expected success rate is the highest, the historical success rate will not be representative of the area as a whole. An explorer will tend to overestimate the total resource size, thereby suggesting an alternative mechanism for false perceptions of decreasing scarcity, a mechanism that could be called the fallacy of early success.

As a rule, contributions in this field implicitly assume that policy should focus on the encouragement of learning and innovation. We argue that, from an individualistic perspective, this position is not easy to justify. Novelty and evolutionary change have in fact a rather complex normative dimension. In order to cope with this, the evolutionary approach to policy-making needs to be complemented with an account of welfare the background assumptions of which are compatible with an evolutionary world-view. Standard welfare economics is unsuited to the job, since the orthodox way to conceptualize welfare as the satisfaction of given and rational preferences cannot be applied in a world in which preferences tend to be variable and incoherent. We argue that, in order to deal with the specific normative issues brought up in an evolving economy, welfare should be conceptualized in a procedural way: At the individual level, it should be understood as the capacity and motivation to engage in the ongoing learning of instrumentally effective preferences. Evolutionary-naturalistic insights into the way human agents bring about, value, and respond to novelty-induced change turn out to be a valuable input into this extended concept of welfare. Finally, some implications of this concept are explored.","Max Planck Inst Econ, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Schubert, C (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",schubert@econ.mpg.de,,"Schubert, Christian/0000-0002-2578-0109",,,,,125,31,33,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

These victims of daughter aversion are India's missing girls. This paper demonstrates a novel methodology for estimating India's missing girls. Estimates were made of number and incidence of missing girls due to sex selective abortion and excess female infant mortality by age one for the time period 1950-2010. State level analysis reveals wide variations in incidence and source of missing girls. National level analysis shows that between 1950 and 2010, a total of 58.29 million girls went missing, of which 28 percent were due to sex selective abortion and 72 percent due to postnatal excess mortality. Over the time period examined, the contribution of post-natal excess mortality to the number of missing girls has reduced while the contribution of sex selective abortion has increased. Policy recommendations are discussed.","Univ Wisconsin Eau Claire, Dept Econ, Eau Claire, WI 54702 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Eau Claire,"Chaudhuri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Eau Claire, Dept Econ, 468 Schneider Social Sci Hall, Eau Claire, WI 54702 USA.",chaudhs@uwec.edu,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

To analyze the implications on growth and welfare, we develop an R&D-based growth model that features the commonly discussed crowding-out and spillover effects of defense R&D on civilian R&D. The model also captures the effects of defense technology on (a) national security resembling consumption-type public goods and (b) aggregate productivity via the spin-off effect resembling productive public goods. In this framework, economic growth is driven by market-based civilian R&D as in standard R&D-based growth models and government-financed public goods (i.e., defense R&D) as in Barro (1990). We find that defense R&D has an inverted-U effect on growth, and the growth-maximizing level of defense R&D is increasing in the spillover and spin-off effects. As for the welfare-maximizing level of defense R&D, it is increasing in the security-enhancing effect of defense technology, and there exists a critical degree of this security-enhancing effect below (above) which the welfare-maximizing level is below (above) the growth-maximizing level.","[Chu, Angus C.] Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham, England; [Chu, Angus C.] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lai, Ching-Chong] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-Chong] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-Chong] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",Durham University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chengchi University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Chu, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham, England.",angusccc@gmail.com; cclai@econ.sinica.edu.tw,"Chu, Angus/GNH-3700-2022",,,,,,39,5,5,1,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

These countries have in common another distinguishing feature: during the past century, they sent massive numbers of migrant workers into South African mines. This paper examines whether mining activities in a bordering country affect HIV infections. A job in the mines implies spending a long period away from the household of origin surrounded by an active sex industry. This creates potential incentives for multiple concurrent partnerships. Using Demographic and Health Surveys, the analysis shows that migrant miners aged 3044 are 15 percentage points more likely to be HIV positive and having a migrant miner as a partner increases the probability of infection for women by 8 percentage points. The study also shows that miners are less likely to abstain and to use condoms and that female partners of miners are more likely to engage in extra-marital sex. We interpret these results as suggesting that miners migration into South Africa has increased the spread of HIV/AIDS in the countries of origin. Consistent with this interpretation, the associations between HIV infection and being a miner or a miners wife are not statistically significant in Zimbabwe, characterised by a local mining industry.","[de Walque, Damien] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Corno, Lucia] UCL, Dept Econ, Ctr Res & Anal Migrat CReAM, London WC1E 6BT, England",The World Bank; University of London; University College London,"de Walque, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ddewalque@worldbank.org,"de Walque, Damien/K-7049-2012","de Walque, Damien/0000-0003-1592-7602",,,,,40,37,43,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Our index is able to consider the duration of the poverty spell and the social preference for equality in well-being given that, in contrast with others that have been previously proposed, it is sensitive to the level of inequality between individual complete poverty experiences over time. Moreover, other indices in the literature can be interpreted as special cases of our more general measure.

The existing literature clarifies that merging firms facing cost uncertainty decide to merge if expected efficiency gains or informational advantages are positive. We show that even in the absence of uncertain efficiency gains or losses in expected terms, as the variance of uncertainty grows, horizontal mergers generate larger expected profits than before the merger and improve consumer surplus and welfare in expected terms. Our findings suggest that increased uncertainty itself provides an incentive for firms to merge.

To answer these, we prepared a new dataset of tax incentives in over 40 Latin American, Caribbean and African countries for the period 1985-2004. Using spatial econometrics techniques for panel data to answer the first question, we find evidence for strategic interaction in tax holidays, in addition to the well-known competition over the corporate income tax (CIT) rate. We find no robust evidence, however, for competition over investment allowances and tax credits. Using dynamic panel data econometrics to answer the second question, we find evidence that lower CIT rates and longer tax holidays are effective in attracting FDI in Latin America and the Caribbean but not in Africa. None of the tax incentives is effective in boosting gross private fixed capital formation.","[Van Parys, Stefan] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Bedrijfskunde, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Klemm, Alexander] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",Ghent University; European Central Bank,"Van Parys, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Bedrijfskunde, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",alexander.klemm@ecb.europa.eu; Stefan.vanparys@ugent.be,"Klemm, Alexander/AAI-4154-2020","Klemm, Alexander/0000-0002-9892-3182",,,,,60,94,103,6,79,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Firms' payments to social insurance programs do not give further polarization of earnings, and descriptive statistics contradict the notion that women are segregated into sectors with low program participation rates. Narrower gender wage gaps are found in more labor intensive industries and in private domestic firms, suggesting that the market transition has not hurt the relative wages of female industrial workers.

The idea that an analogous phenomenon might also apply at the level of the organization took longer to emerge, but it had begun to figure prominently in military procurement and scheduling at least a decade before Wright's (1936) classic paper providing evidence that the cost of producing an airframe declined as cumulative output increased. Wright (1936) was careful not to describe his empirical results as a learning curve. Of his three proposed explanations for the relationships he observed between cost and cumulative quantity produced, only one is unambiguously a source of organizational learning; the others are consistent with organizational learning but also with standard static economies of scale. It quickly became apparent that the notion of organizational learning as a by-product of accumulated experience has important consequences for firm strategy. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) built its consulting business around the concept of what it branded the experience curve, asserting that cost reductions associated with cumulative output applied to all costs, were consistently around 20-30% each time accumulated production is doubled, [and] this decline goes on in time without limit (Henderson 1968). Today, the negative relationship between unit production costs and cumulative output is one of the best-documented empirical regularities in economics. Nonetheless, the thesis of this paper is that the conceptual transformation of the relationship between cost and cumulative production into an organizational learning curve with profound strategic implications has not been sufficiently supported with direct empirical evidence.","Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Thompson, P (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",peter.thompson@emory.edu,,,,,,,62,50,57,0,35,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Within the context of the model used in this paper, an improvement in productivity can take two alternative forms: (1) a cost saving for a given output and (2) an increase in production without a direct decrease in employment. The results presented are based on a simple model of a small open economy that includes some key features of less developed economies. It is shown that, in the presence of monetary and fiscal restraints, an improvement in productivity leads to increases in output, employment and the real wage and the effect on the balance of payments, in the short and the medium runs, is also positive. We find that whether or not improvement in productivity is import saving plays a crucial role in both comparative static and simulation exercises. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Short-run selection effects (i.e. responses to shocks) are adverse, but small in size. Also long-run effects driven by differences in, for example, preferences and risk aversion, are small.

A territory's distance to Wittenberg, the city where Martin Luther taught, is a major determinant of adoption. This finding is consistent with a theory of strategic neighbourhood interactions: introducing the Reformation was a risky enterprise for territorial lords and had higher prospects of success if powerful neighbouring states committed to the new faith.

The model is applied using data from a stated preference survey implemented in a regional theatre in England. Results allow three classes of theatregoers to be identified. The largest and 'main class' comprises mainly affluent people who show a strong preference for main theatre venues, consider reviews of the productions, whether the author is known, and like all types of shows. The second is a 'popular class', exhibiting the smallest willingness to pay and manifesting a strong preference for comedies, paying little attention to venues and disliking more sophisticated shows. The third is an 'intellectual class' of theatre goers, who exhibit the maximum willingness to pay, and show a strong interest for drama and adaptation of productions, and more independent aesthetic judgement. The study shows the usefulness of latent class models in identifying market segments, a procedure that is relevant to policy makers and theatre managers in setting prices, identifying different kinds of consumers to increase people's engagement with theatre, and undertaking social analysis of performing arts.","[Willis, Kenneth G.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Grisolia, Jose M.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Appl Econ, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, GC, Spain",Newcastle University - UK; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Willis, KG (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",Ken.Willis@ncl.ac.uk,,"Grisolia, Jose Maria/0000-0001-7147-8851",,,,,69,43,47,1,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The game ends when the buyer accepts a price offer or the selling season is over, whichever comes first. Previous research (Granot et al,, 2007) shows that there are successive markdowns in equilibrium when the buyer is commonly known to be myopic; our analysis suggests that when she is known to be strategic price offers over the entire selling season are constant. Moreover, lengthening the season increases (generally decreases) both sellers' profits when the buyer is myopic (strategic).

The productivity of drilling operations - in terms of meters drilled per day - significantly influences exploration costs. Hence it is important to understand the factors that determine drilling productivity. In this study we analyze the effect of different types of experience or learning on offshore drilling productivity. The econometric analysis employs a large data set on exploration wells from the Norwegian Continental Shelf, covering most of its 45 year drilling history. Many other industries have a steep learning curve. A central question here is if learning effects also contribute to increased productivity in petroleum exploration drilling. Furthermore, to what extent do diseconomies associated with reservoir depletion effects and limited acreage counteract learning effects on productivity? (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The need for such an analysis arises due to the following policy proposal: from time to time, the Turkish government considers increasing the lump-sum amount that drawee banks are legally responsible to pay per bad check. The purpose of this proposal is to ease out firms' liquidity needs especially during recessions. We show that banks will tend to restrict the quantity of checks as a response to such a policy action. We report that a percentage point increase in banks' obligation per bad check could lead up to a 1.7% decline in the total supply of checks on the margin. This means that such a policy change may harm the real economy rather than providing support. We establish that the extent of the monopoly distortion depends on three main factors: (i) the elasticity of demand for checks, (ii) how fast the fraction of bad checks increases with the total supply of checks, and (iii) the degree of preference heterogeneity.

The model shows that such dividend needs to be larger, the higher the BS effect, the smaller the size of the economy, the larger the cross-country difference in the standard deviation of the supply shocks, the smaller their correlation and the larger the standard deviation of real exchange rate shocks. We calibrate the model to quantify such dividend as a function of plausible ranges of the parameter values.

We measure managers' connections by the kilometer distance between the province of the bank's headquarter and the manager's province of birth. We show that top managers tend to be local in the sense that the distribution of this distance is heavily skewed towards zero. On the basis of this evidence we investigate whether connections affect the duration of the appointment at the bank, and whether connections entrench managers at the expense of the bank's performance. We find that connections generally decrease the probability of bank manager's turnover, and that the positive effect of performance on tenure is strongly attenuated once connections are taken into account. Furthermore we find that for any bank type performance does not increase with connections. On the contrary, we show that having connected managers hurts performance in Mutual, Cooperative and Rural banks. Overall these findings suggest that connections are collusion devices to share and maintain rents at the expenses of bank performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A version of the MortensenPissarides model is used for this purpose. If wages are set through Nash bargaining, workers value employment protection because it strengthens their hand in wage negotiations. Workers in high productivity matches benefit most from higher wages as they expect to stay employed for longer. By reducing turnover employment protection shifts the distribution of match-specific productivity toward lower values. Thus stringent protection in the past actually reduces support for employment protection today. Introducing involuntary separations reverses this conclusion. Now workers value employment protection because it delays involuntary dismissals. Workers in low productivity matches gain most since they face the highest risk of dismissal. The downward shift in the productivity distribution is now a shift towards supporters.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Brügemann, B (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",bjoern.bruegemann@yale.edu,,"Bruegemann, B.A./0000-0001-9331-1681",,,,,55,2,2,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The starting point was theory and recent empirical studies which indicate that absence at the workplace level is reinforced through social interaction. Hitherto, we know little about how such spiralling processes form in different organisational contexts, and we therefore decided to conduct an explorative case study. The findings are based on interviews with teachers and management. The findings support some of the proposed processes of social interaction that supposedly underlie spiralling effects of sickness absence. In the study context, the processes seem to involve concerns about fairness and social support. Interestingly, the findings do not support an assumption that stigma linked to absence reduces as the absence level increases. On the contrary, it appears that social sanctions are activated as a counter force to increasing absence. The findings have potential implications for theoretical assumptions and for design and interpretation of future quantitative economic studies of social interaction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In fact, several of the predictions on firm survival and exit stemming from this new class of models are at odds with the stylized facts. Empirically, higher productivity firms survive longer, most firm closures are young firms, higher productivity exporters are more likely to continue to export compared to less productive exporters and market exits as well as firm closures are typically preceded by periods of contracting market shares. The present paper shows that the simple inclusion of exogenous economy wide technological progress into the standard Melitz (2003) model generates a tractable dynamic framework that generates endogenous exit decisions of firms in line with the stylized facts. Furthermore, we derive the effects of faster technological progress and trade liberalization on export market exit and firm closure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model we consider is a segmented-markets duopoly with differentiated goods in which price-setting firms pool their incentive constraints across markets to sustain their most collusive outcome. We find that, when goods are very close substitutes and trade costs are sufficiently high, a marginal reduction in trade costs facilitates collusion. Exactly the opposite is true if, for any given degree of product substitutability, trade costs are sufficiently low. We also study the dependence of multimarket collusion on product differentiation.

If this is the case, perceived risk associated with a disaster in stock markets should be revealed in household portfolios. That is, the framework that solves these pricing puzzles should also generate quantities that are consistent with the observed ones. This paper estimates the perceived risk of disasters (both probability and expected size) that is consistent with observed portfolios and consumption growth between 1983 and 2004 in the United States. I find that the portfolio choices of households that have less than a college degree can be partially explained by expectations of stock market disasters only if one allows for a large probability of labor income loss at the same time. Such disaster expectations, however, are not revealed in the portfolios of educated and wealthier households: simple per-period participation costs of the stock market coupled with preference heterogeneity explain their participation and investment patterns.","[Alan, Sule] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Alan, Sule] Univ Cambridge, CFAP, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Alan, Sule] Koc Univ, Coll Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Koc University,"Alan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",sule.alan@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,10,12,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

We exploit the high frequency nature of the data to disentangle nominal rigidities from market segmentation and show that while firms seem to respond to domestic competitive pressure, there is no evidence that they react to fluctuations in the relative price of foreign competition following exchange rate mavements. In addition, we cannot identify any significant impact on sales volume stemming from variations in international relative prices.

A feature of the popular GMM estimator in this context that deserves to receive snore attention is that in small samples it will often deliver spatial parameter estimates that lie outside the invertibility region of the model. Using such illegitimate estimates to construct bootstrap samples is then problematic; the present paper finds that this practical obstacle may be removed by the use of quasi-maximum likelihood estimates that guarantee invertibility. The effects of different spatial weight patterns and sample size on the empirical significance levels and power of the tests are illustrated, and the paper demonstrates that estimation using QMLE, allied to a simple bootstrap, yields tests with reliable significance levels and reasonable power, in a majority of cases.","Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Burridge, P (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",peter.burridge@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,12,17,19,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

We examine how public statements of FOMC intentions-forward guidance-can substitute for lower rates at the zero bound. We distinguish between Odyssean forward guidance, which publicly commits the FOMC to a future action, and Delphic forward guidance, which merely forecasts macroeconomic performance and likely monetary policy actions. Others have shown how forward guidance that commits the central bank to keeping rates at zero for longer than conditions would otherwise warrant can provide monetary easing, if the public trusts it. We empirically characterize the responses of asset prices and private macroeconomic forecasts to FOMC forward guidance, both before and since the recent financial crisis. Our results show that the FOMC has extensive experience successfully telegraphing its intended adjustments to evolving conditions, so communication difficulties do not present an insurmountable barrier to Odyssean forward guidance. Using an estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, we investigate how pairing such guidance with bright-line rules for launching rate increases can mitigate risks to the Federal Reserve's price stability mandate.","[Campbell, Jeffrey R.; Evans, Charles L.; Fisher, Jonas D.

Such organizational approach of institutions makes important contributions to institutional economics in general, through its notion of a hierarchy of collective action, its threefold typology of transactions, and its holindividualist stance. Commons's genuine advances are counterbalanced by theoretical limits, which illustrate the unfinished character of his attempt to make a contribution to a 'rounded-out theory of Political economy', e.g. the ambiguous place of markets in his theory, the state understood as a model for other going concerns and, distinctly, the restricted definition of institutions as organizations. In some important respects, his theory complements or goes further than other currents of institutional economics; its weak points are sometimes the reverse side of his very contributions.","Univ Paris Diderot, LADYSS, Dept Econ, UFR GHSS, F-75013 Paris, France",Universite Paris Cite,"Chavance, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Diderot, LADYSS, Dept Econ, UFR GHSS, 59 Rue Natl, F-75013 Paris, France.",chavance@univ-paris-diderot.fr,,,,,,,38,19,22,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Our research was conducted for total electricity consumption as well as for the industrial consumption of electricity. In order to reflect the causality between GDP and electricity consumption properly we performed our investigations in a three-dimensional framework with employment chosen as an additional variable. We used reliable quarterly data from the period Q1 2000-Q4 2009. In order to check the stability of the causalities the investigations were performed on two samples: a full sample and a pre-crisis (i.e. Q1 2000-Q3 2008) subsample. We applied both traditional methods and some recently developed econometric tools. We found feedback between total electricity consumption and GDP as well as between total electricity consumption and employment. We also found unidirectional causality running from industrial electricity consumption to employment and no direct causal links between industrial electricity consumption and GDP.

The aim of this study is to understand the implications of news organizations' adoption of social media sites through (1) an examination of the relationship between news organizations' adoption of social media and their online readership and (2) a comparison of online traffic generated by social media sites with that generated by other online media institutions. Evidence suggests that newspapers' adoption of social media is positively associated with an increase in their online readership, and this association increases in the size of the newspapers' social media networks (e.g., number of Twitter followers). Evidence also suggests that the association between newspapers' social media adoption and their online traffic may differ compared to the association between other online media institutions and the online traffic they generated. A descriptive analysis shows that the online traffic generated by social media sites is less concentrated than that generated by search engines or news aggregators; this can be explained by the fact that social media sites might be less susceptible to information cascades, compared to search engines or news aggregators.

Results from our regression analysis of the labor force indicate that the wage earnings elasticity of labor supply is negative, albeit insignificant, for men and significantly positive for women, and it has a significantly positive association with educational level and a negative one with age. We also find that per capita income shows a negative relationship with the labor force in general for younger age groups and older age groups, and more capital-intensive countries have smaller female labor force. Using extrapolation, the paper predicts that the labor force will increase in all 12 countries during the first two decades of the period 2010-2030, but will eventually decline in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan.

This paper examines the empirical validities of the following two claims: 1) the multiple-cone Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model fits better than does the single-cone HO model: and 2) increases in the number of cones improve the fit of the model. One of the contributions of this paper is that it focuses simultaneously on factor endowments, production patterns, and wage disparities across economies. My empirical results support the first claim but not the second claim. The results suggest that although the multiple-cone model performs better than does the single-cone model, the increases in the number or cones do not necessarily result in better performance of the HO model.

Our estimate confirms that the Czech swap curve may be represented by three components that track its level, slope and curvature. These parameters were stable during the crises period that culminated in the autumn 2008. On contrary, the basic swap curve characteristics are showing most abnormal behaviour during periods of relative calm development. The traditional determinants of the Czech swap curve remain monetary policy, euro swap rates and risk premiums.

Our surprising results can be explained by the undemocratic colonial nature of the Government of India, a fiscal system heavily reliant on railways for revenues, and a regulatory environment under private ownership that weakened incentives to lower costs.

The authors allow for educational choice, asymmetry of countries with respect to total factor productivity, and tax base effects of migration in source and host country. As the latter may give rise to multiplicity of equilibrium, alternative belief structures of mobile high-skilled workers are carefully taken into account. The paper also looks at the consequences of bilateral policy coordination. While in line with other studies on tax competition, bilateral coordination can reduce the under-investment problem in public education spending, it also tends to hinder migration or may even reverse the direction of the migration flow that materializes under non-cooperative policy setting. As a result of its potentially adverse effects on migration patterns, bilateral coordination may therefore reduce global welfare and bring the world economy further away from the social planner's solution.","[Egger, Hartmut] Univ Bayreuth, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Egger, Hartmut] GEP, Nottingham, England; [Egger, Hartmut; Falkinger, Josef; Grossmann, Volker] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Egger, Hartmut] IW, Kiel, Germany; [Falkinger, Josef] Univ Zurich, CH-8049 Zurich, Switzerland; [Falkinger, Josef; Grossmann, Volker] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Grossmann, Volker] Univ Fribourg, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland",University of Bayreuth; University of Nottingham; Ifo Institut; University of Zurich; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Fribourg,"Egger, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",hartmut.egger@uni-bayreuth.de; josef.falkinger@econ.uzh.ch; volker.grossmann@unifr.ch,"Egger, Hartmut/A-7397-2014","Grossmann, Volker/0000-0001-8917-3503",,,,,12,5,5,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The caps for consumption are imposed exogenously due to the negative effects that the consumption may produce. The consumption rights or licenses are distributed among the agents. This fact leads to the possibility of establishing license markets. These licenses do not participate in agents' preferences, however, the individual's budgetary constraint may be modified, leading to a reassignment of resources.

We establish conditions for the commonly assumed monocentric configuration to arise as the unique and efficient equilibrium outcome. We also illustrate under what circumstances a spatial equilibrium may feature multicentric, urban-rural, or multiple (disconnected) urban areas and under what conditions each configuration is socially efficient.

Some Cross-Country Evidence,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PUBLIC DEBT; GOVERNMENT; POLITICS,A bias towards running deficits is an entrenched feature of fiscal policy making in most developed economies. Our paper examines whether this tendency is in any way associated with the personal distribution of income of a country. It takes inspiration from theoretical work according to which distributional conflicts may give rise to deficit spending or to delayed fiscal adjustment. Although these theories have been around for years the empirical literature on the determinants of fiscal performance has so far paid little or no attention to the possible role played by different degrees of income inequality. Our results suggest that this neglect was not justified. Using cross-country data we find evidence that a more unequal distribution of income can weigh on a country's fiscal performance. These findings can be relevant in the aftermath of the post-2007 global financial and economic crisis in particular when designing fiscal exit strategies. The success and sustainability of such strategies may inter alia depend on their distributional implications.,"European Commiss Directorate Gen Econ & Financial, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium",,"Larch, M (通讯作者)，European Commiss Directorate Gen Econ & Financial, Rue Loi 200, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",martin.larch@ec.europa.eu,"Larch, Martin/AAI-7587-2021",,,,,,33,8,10,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2012,65,1,,,,,53,80,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00527.x,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,882EA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299543200004,0

We use panel data for the US states to examine state-based, free market (SBFM) think tanks' relationship to eight key economic policy objectives. We find little evidence that SBFM think tanks are associated with more pro-market policies along the policy dimensions they aim to influence. However, we find stronger evidence that SBFM think tanks are associated with more pro-market citizen attitudes about the role of government vs. markets in economic policy. These results suggest that if think tanks' connection to economic policy is important at all, its importance may be long term and operate via the channel of ideas. In contrast to think tanks, we find evidence that political lobby groups are associated with current policy. This may reflect the fact that, unlike think tanks, lobby groups are legally permitted to lobby for policy changes directly. Thus they don't need to engage in a long-run battle of ideas to secure desired policy outcomes. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (1) (2012) 62-77.

The latest research confirms the necessity of investment timing strategies based on generated returns which keeps savings work more efficient. Earlier studies involved country's economical cycle and well timed investment decisions according to cycle period. But the main constraint was defined - the decision to purchase a security can be difficult since there are many attributes to consider and can include the necessary examination of these attributes, it also can be thought of as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate a created personal investment decisions model, which allows private investor to make effective investment decisions during different countries economical cycle periods. Research methods used are based on systematic literature analysis, mathematical statistics methods, logical comparative and generalization analysis. After the systemized literature studies, a model of evaluating efficiency of private investor's decisions was created and it consists of five stages: (1) investor behaviour analysis (survey), (2) the determination of the economic cycle stages (Hodrick-Prescott filter method), (3) private investor's behavioural performance assessment, (4) investment instruments selection (Data Envelopment Analysis Method - multi-criteria decision-making technique) and allocation of savings analysis, (5) the investor's behaviour in performance assessment. This model allows evaluating of efficiency of private investor's investment decisions during different country's economic cycle phases. Created model application is performed during different stages of Lithuania's economic cycle. Also there is a summary of adaptive model results, where financial return of investment was compared to effectiveness of average statistical Lithuanian's residents financial decisions (18 investment portfolios are summarized). It was found that created model could be relatively simply adapted to practice and also could empower private investor to make effective personal finance decisions on the influence of country's economic cycle. It should be noted, that studies show the amount of average Lithuanian's revenue loss on the impact of inefficient personal finance management decisions.","[Krusinskas, Rytis] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Adamauskas, S (通讯作者)，Konstitucijos Av 20A, LT-03502 Vilnius, Lithuania.",saulius@adamauskas.lt; rytis.krusinskas@ktu.lt,"Krusinskas, Rytis/ABG-9619-2020",,,,,,22,6,6,1,32,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

I investigate how the flows of knowledge transmitted through FDI affect the production of knowledge in both source and recipient countries, as well as how these flows affect productivity. Using patent citations within FDI as the measure of the degree of 'access' that one nation gains to the R&D knowledge of another, and new patents as the measure of innovation, results reveal that there are large differences in the way FDI affects innovation and productivity between countries that are technological leaders, and technological followers. Both inward and outward FDI are found to have a strong positive effect on domestic innovation and productivity in countries that are technological followers. For technological leaders, outward FDI is highly conducive to increased domestic innovation, while inward FDI seems to increase competition between domestic and foreign firms, making it more difficult to come up with new viable ideas. As for domestic productivity, inward FDI is highly beneficial for technological leaders, while outward FDI does not have a significant effect. I conclude that technological followers have much to gain from FDI-induced R&D spillovers, and therefore governments in these countries will find it worthwhile to attract foreign multinationals, while those in the more technologically advanced economies need to weigh the costs and benefits of FDI carefully.","Santa Clara Univ, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Santa Clara University,"AlAzzawi, S (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",salazzawi@scu.edu,,,,,,,45,31,34,0,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

To circumvent the constraints imposed by the traditional parametric methods, finite mixture models are estimated in order to identify the optimal number of segments within the informal employment and their respective returns to individual characteristics. In particular, it sheds light on the potential voluntary nature of informal employment by comparing the estimated probabilities of segment membership with the theoretical probabilities that would result from a competitive labour market under the hypothesis of income maximization by workers. Results show that the classical self-employed versus informal wage-workers divide is not the best split of informal employment. Furthermore, the two estimated informal employment segments are both less desirable than formal employment. Thus, the hypothesis of labour-market segmentation, even after taking informal-sector heterogeneity into account, seems to hold, supporting the traditional dualistic view of informal employment in the Turkish context.","[Bensidoun, Isabelle] Ctr Etud Emploi, Paris, France; [Ben Salem, Melika] Univ Paris Est Marne la Vallee, Paris Sch Econ, Ctr Etud Emploi, Erudite, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Paris School of Economics; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Bensidoun, I (通讯作者)，Ctr Etud Emploi, Paris, France.",isabelle.bensidoun@cee-recherche.fr,,"Ben Salem, Melika/0000-0003-2924-9558",,,,,19,5,6,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

I determine how the investor's choices of signal quality and contracting terms are affected by project primitives. I prove that equilibrium expected payoffs in this signaling game are unique and that equilibrium strategies solve simple optimal contracting problems, showing that informed investors can use equity, and that uninformed investors compete with simple debt.

The empirical investigations conducted as part of this research are based on the China Health and Nutrition Survey data from 1989 to 2006 and indicate that Chinese household income is strongly polarised. After a period of stagnation between 1989 and 1997, the degree of polarisation increased significantly between 1997 and 2006, indicating the constitution of identified groups in middle and upper income ranges. Although the level of income polarisation is higher in rural areas, the increase in polarisation is far more conspicuous in urban areas, suggesting that the risk of social tensions is more pregnant in Chinese cities. The analysis of the sources of income polarisation in rural areas shows that the increase in polarisation is closely linked to non-agricultural opportunities. In urban areas the emergence of identified groups in middle and upper income classes can be explained both by the sharp decline in subsidies and by the liberalisation of the urban labour market and state enterprises.","[Bonnefond, Celine; Clement, Matthieu] GREThA Univ Bordeaux, Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Clément, M (通讯作者)，GREThA Univ Bordeaux, Pessac, France.",matthieu.clement@u-bordeaux4.fr,"Bonnefond, Celine/AAN-3847-2020","Bonnefond, Celine/0000-0002-7554-0867",,,,,53,14,14,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24,1,,,,,15,37,,10.1080/14631377.2012.647972,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,918PH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302262100002,0

However, since large projects may be financially non-viable despite their net economic benefits for the society, host governments may choose to subsidize a portion of the initial cost to create financial feasibility for private participation so as to realize the expected net economic benefits. The private partners in a pure private-financed PPI scheme are expected to finance the original investment cost and recover it, with an acceptable return to compensate the project risk, from operating benefits under terms and conditions given in the concession agreement. The financial structure, that is, the financing mix between equity and debt, of the project determines the cost of capital and the value of the underlying project. An optimal financial structure minimizes the cost of capital and in turn, maximizes the project worth. Scientific problem - the government's role in PPI-led projects changes the traditional capital structure model in financial management, which includes only the financing mix of owners' equity and debt. It is necessary to develop a model into which the government's financial support is incorporated to identify the optimal financial structure of PPI projects. This paper develops a linear programming model based on discounted cash flow to determine the optimal financing mix of the project given governmental initial subsidy for non-financially viable PPI projects. The model takes a two-stage approach: first, a debt-free cash flow is developed to determine the government's initial subsidy; then, the optimal financing mix is determined based on the government's subsidy. We apply the proposed model to the Taiwan West Corridor High-Speed Railway project as an example. The results provide guidance for public-private negotiations. Scientific novelty - a linear programming model built on discounted cash flow is proposed to determine the optimal capital structure for non-financially viable PPI projects with government subsidy. The aim of this research - to develop a model into which the government's role in PPI projects is incorporated to determine the optimal capital structure. The results provide guidance to the public-private negotiations. The object of the research - non-financially viable PPI projects, taking Taiwan West Corridor High-Speed Railway Project as the example. The method of the research - a linear programming model built on discounted cash flow is used to find the optimal solution for multi-objective decisions.","[Chen, Borliang] Natl United Univ, Miaoli 36003, Taiwan; [Liou, Fen-May] Chihlee Inst Technol, New Taipei City 22050, Taiwan; [Huang, Chih-Pin] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan",National United University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Chen, BL (通讯作者)，Natl United Univ, 1 Lienda, Miaoli 36003, Taiwan.",blchen@nuu.edu.tw; mayliou@mail.chihlee.edu.tw; cphuang.ms96g@g2.nctu.edu.tw,"Chen, Borliang/ABD-3981-2020; Huang, C.

To investigate whether the periods of the greatest financial market turmoil in the last decade coincided with a Flight-To-Quality (FTQ; the flight from the riskier stocks to safer sovereign bonds), a simple FTQ indicator is defined and calculated. We find that the comovement between stock market returns and the dynamics of sovereign bond yields is time varying. For Germany, the correlation between stock market returns and the dynamics of sovereign bond yields is mostly positive during the observed period, whereas for the countries affected by the sovereign debt crisis, the correlation is mostly negative, especially after the start of the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. Financial crises normally coincide with higher correlations, whereas Greece's sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone led to a reduced correlation in Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The financial market crises prior to 2010 led to an increased FTQ in all investigated countries, whereas after the start of the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone, the FTQ is only observed in Germany.","Univ Maribor, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,13,20,22,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

China's contribution to these imbalances via recurrent trade and financial surpluses corresponds with a phase of deepening structural risks to China's economic growth and development. These structural challenges include: the composition of growth resulting from China's dynamic internal transformation, China's trade orientation, the trajectory of resource use and CO2 emissions, welfare problems relating to distribution and international constraints. This article develops a conceptual framework for examining the relationship between the processes of long-run structural transformation in China, its economic imbalances, and the role of institutional reform in dealing with these structural challenges. As such, economic policy should extend beyond short-term macro management to pursue an institutional reform agenda to facilitate broader structural change to mitigate constraints to future growth and to improve economic welfare.","[Deer, Luke; Song, Ligang] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, China Econ Program, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Deer, Luke] Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Australian National University; University of Sydney,"Song, LG (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, China Econ Program, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",luke.deer@sydney.edu.au; Ligang.Song@anu.edu.au,"Deer, Luke/ABF-1632-2020","Deer, Luke/0000-0002-5552-523X; Song, Ligang/0000-0002-5700-2352",,,,,36,23,24,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2012,20,1,,,SI,,1,26,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01270.x,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,899RZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300835100001,0
