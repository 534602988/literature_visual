This paper tests whether it is possible to improve volatility forecasts at monthly and quarterly horizons by conditioning on additional macroeconomic variables. I find that several variables related to macroeconomic uncertainty, time-varying expected stock returns, and credit conditions Granger cause volatility. It is more difficult to find evidence that forecasts exploiting macroeconomic variables outperform a univariate benchmark out-of-sample. The most successful approaches involve simple combinations of individual forecasts. Predictive power associated with macroeconomic variables appears to concentrate around the onset of recessions.

Using FDI outflows from a sample of East European transition economies that had virtually no outward FDI before 1995, FDI flows are observed based mainly on current investment decisions and less on the inertia of past investments. The model separates the effects of corruption on FDI location decisions and on the amount invested. A linear and negative relationship is found between host-country corruption and the likelihood of MNCs locating in that country. The relationship between home-country corruption and FDI is non-monotonic, with an inverse U shape where both high and low levels of corruption in the home country reducing the probability of outward FDI flows. If FDI is undertaken to a host country, the volume of FDI is affected by home-country but not by host-country corruption.","[Perez, M.

We argue that the relationship between aid and FDI is theoretically ambiguous: aid raises the marginal productivity of capital when used to finance complementary inputs (like public infrastructure and human capital investments), but aid may crowd out private investments when it comes in the shape of pure physical capital transfers. Empirically, we find that aid invested in complementary inputs draws in FDI, while aid invested in physical capital crowds it out.

Under strategic behavior, however, we observe the additional problem of location leakage i.e. countries invest less in species protected by others. Conservation autarky eliminates location leakage; in ecosystems with partly overlapping species compositions at country borders it even induces MPAs that are too large from a global perspective.

We find that both types of selection lead to a sample of experts: Participants perform significantly better than the general population, in the sense of fewer violations of revealed preference conditions.

When some counterparties of an agent default, the loss she experiences amounts to her total exposure to those counterparties. A possible conjecture in this context is that individual risk diversification across more numerous counterparties should make also systemic defaults less likely. We show that this view is not always true. In particular, the diversification of credit risk across many borrowers has ambiguous effects on systemic risk in the presence of mechanisms of loss amplifications such as in the presence of potential runs among the short-term lenders of the agents in the network.

More interestingly, we also observe a productivity increase among export-entrants relative to nonentrants before export entry. This might be explained by higher investments in physical capital prior to export entry. We find no evidence that the productivity gap between export-entrants and nonentrants continues to grow after export entry.

Bank-firm governance links are associated with higher loan spreads during the 2003-2006 credit boom but lower spreads during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Additionally, these links mitigate credit rationing effects during the crisis. The results are robust to several methods to correct for the endogeneity of the bank-firm governance link.

According to the resource based theory it is found that specific human capital is more important for the performance of NTBFs in relation to general. More specifically individual entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial teams with high levels of formal business education, commercial, managerial or same sector experience are found to have created better performing NTBFs.

This paper focuses on travel trends of young German adults between 18 and 29. For decades these young adults represented one of the most car oriented age groups. Until the 1990s car use increased for all age groups in Germany, including young adults. Based on a range of primary and secondary data sources this paper finds that since the turn of the millennium car use among young adults has decreased. We identify two important underlying trends. First, an increasing share of young drivers also uses alternative modes of transport, thus indicating a rise in multimodal travel behavior. Second, gender differences in car travel have largely disappeared among young Germans-mainly because young men reduced car ownership and driving more than young women. These trends have led to an overall decrease of automobile travel by young adults and contributed to an increase of travel by other modes of transport. Decreasing automobile travel by young adults helps explain the stagnation of aggregate travel demand in Germany, since declining car use among young adults offsets increases in automobile travel of older individuals.

Studies employing structural decomposition analyses treat the college premium as the relative price of skilled to unskilled workers. They find that reallocations of labor across industries and occupations cannot account for rising college premiums, and often attribute them to widely observed trade-induced increases in skills demand within the manufacturing sector. In contrast, using a reduced-form decomposition that moves beyond a binary definition of skill and allows for inter-occupation wage differentials, we show that employment shifts across occupations and industries can account for the increase in the college premium. We link the rising premium, and differences in its trajectory by gender and cohort, to the growth of specific professions that produce services, not manufactured goods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

But recent years show a rapid decline in bus and rail ridership. It appears that the consequences of the 'socialist market economy', such as the unbundling of social life and production activities, the marketization of urban land, and large-scale suburbanization leading many residents to live in locations far away from their jobs and daily services, have promoted the rapid expansion of motorized travel. Consequently, road congestion, air pollution and traffic safety have become major problems in Dalian. Many Chinese metropolises consider the possibility of leading urban growth onto a more sustainable development pathway and turn to the concept of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). However, TOD could only become a promising solution for sustainable urban transport if thorough examination is conducted at the local and regional levels on how and to what extent conditions for developing effective TOD are fulfilled. Therefore, this article makes an attempt to identify conditions for effective TOD and map them systematically. We will make a distinction between critical and important conditions. After this, the record of Dalian, a coastal city in China with over 6 million people and a good tradition in using public transport which officially embraced the TOD planning method, in meeting those conditions is examined. Conclusions are drawn as to where Dalian's strengths and weaknesses lie and what actions the Dalian government has taken with regard to each of these conditions. Finally, to transfer the TOD lessons of Dalian to other Chinese cities, we conclude that to make TOD work in China, cities should at least meet all critical conditions such as pedestrian friendly urban design, good governance and high quality transit services. Furthermore, they should at least meet some of the important conditions. Meeting the latter ones can be a gradual process given the fact that most Chinese cities are still in an early stage of their TOD learning curve. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We use the OaxacaBlinder and quantile decomposition methods to determine the wage gap between public and private sectors utilizing the 1994 Household Income Distribution and Consumption Expenditure Survey and the 2008 Household Budget Survey conducted by the Turkish Statistical Institute. The study determined that the primary difference in the average wages between sectors arises from the differences in the endowments without correction for gender. After adjusting for correction using quantile regression, we find that the difference in the endowments between sectors at lower quantiles explains the majority of the raw wage gap; whereas a substantial amount of the raw wage gap is explained by the sector effect at higher quantiles.","[San, Sayin] Sakarya Univ, Dept Financial Econometr, Sakarya, Turkey; [Polat, Ozgur] Dicle Univ, Dept Econ, Diyarbakir, Turkey",Sakarya University; Dicle University,"San, S (通讯作者)，Sakarya Univ, Dept Financial Econometr, Sakarya, Turkey.",,"Polat, Ozgur/ABC-2309-2020; San, Sayın/AAG-6787-2019","San, Sayın/0000-0003-2679-071X",,,,,14,4,5,0,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Our analysis is based on a stylised framework of waste prevention developed by Brouillat. In this framework, products are modelled as multi-characteristic technologies whose evolution depends on firms' innovation strategies and on the interactions with consumers and postconsumption activities (recycling). This stylised framework has been adapted to explore the impact of waste prevention instruments upon industrial dynamics, and more particularly upon firms' innovative strategies and upon the evolution of products' characteristics and market structure. We focus on two types of policy instruments: recycling fees and norms. For each instrument, we will consider different policy designs in order to study their effects on industrial dynamics. The main contribution of this article is to show how this type of simulation model can be used to explore the impact of waste prevention policy instruments on the technological evolution of products, on innovation strategy, and on the evolution of firms' market shares. The introduction of policy instruments in a simulation agent-based model of industrial dynamics enables us to analyse more thoroughly how different policy designs can modify the dynamics of the system and, more particularly, how the incentives and the constraints linked to the policy instruments under consideration shape market selection.","[Brouillat, Eric; Oltra, Vanessa] Bordeaux Univ, Grp Rech Econ Theor & Appl GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Brouillat, E (通讯作者)，Bordeaux Univ, Grp Rech Econ Theor & Appl GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",eric.brouillat@u-bordeaux4.fr; oltra@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,28,5,5,1,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

I overcome such shortcomings by constructing a new measure of violence. The new measure indicates whether there was a decline in violence by subtracting current-experience of violence from ever-experience. Such differencing eliminates time-invariant sources of bias. Further, sensitivity of the effect of female membership to self-selection is examined by gauging the size of self-selection based on selection on the observables. Once self-selection is addressed, the initial positive effect of membership on violence reduction disappears. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

If the fiscal authority holds constant the real value of debt at maturity under strict inflation targeting, the equilibrium dynamics are indeterminate for a wide range of parameters and steady-state fiscal stances. Flexible targeting rules that include a concern for stabilization of the output gap can restore determinacy of the equilibrium. Flexible inflation targeting appears to be more robust than flexible debt targeting to alternative parameterizations.

However, little work has been done on the issue of whether this transformation process takes place evenly across the various regions in China. This article describes the important role of regional institutions in shaping the ownership-based competitiveness of local enterprises and the migration of industries across regions. In the case of the Chinese synthetic dye industry, the passing of leadership from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to collectively owned enterprises (COEs) and then to private enterprises (PEs) was accompanied by a concurrent leadership migration from one region to another. The article contends that this simultaneous occurrence was not accidental. Four institutional constraints-the degree of central supervision, the local labor arrangements, the local social welfare provision, and the degree of ambiguity in property rights-retarded the rise of new ownership forms in the previously dominant regions. This gave other regions the opening to take over leadership positions by providing a more favorable institutional context for new ownership forms. These findings are likely to apply to all of the Chinese manufacturing industries that existed prior to 1978 and that subsequently did not experience significant technological changes and were not highly protected by the government.","[Jiang, Hong; Murmann, Johann Peter] Australian Sch Business UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Jiang, Hong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of New South Wales Sydney; Renmin University of China,"Murmann, JP (通讯作者)，Australian Sch Business UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",hong.jiang@student.unsw.edu.au; icc@professor-murmann.net,"Murmann, Johann Peter/AAM-5955-2020; Murmann, Johann Peter/B-7537-2009","Murmann, Johann Peter/0000-0003-1631-3012;",,,,,38,7,7,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Using a structural CMBX pricing model, we find little systematic mispricing relative to REIT equity and options. We do find short-term deviations from this relative pricing relationship that are statistically and economically significant. In particular, the CMBX market temporarily overreacts to news announcements. We provide evidence that this temporary mispricing is caused by price pressure due to hedging activities. Finally, an absolute pricing analysis provides no substantial evidence that CMBX contracts traded at fire sale levels during the crisis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We use data on facility participation in the 33/50 Program and emissions reported to the US EPA's toxic releases inventory (TRI) between 1991 and 1995 for a sample of facilities whose parent firms committed to the program. By focusing on participation by individual facilities we avoid the influence of firm level incentives under the program. The mandatory disclosure of emissions data to the TRI avoids the potential bias evident in voluntarily disclosed data. We find that while facilities with larger total emissions were more likely to participate, there is no evidence of greater participation by facilities that account for a higher share of a parent firm's 33/50 emissions. Although emissions of the 33/50 chemicals fell over the years, we find that participation in the program was not associated with the decline in the 33/50 releases generated by these facilities and the reductions seemed to have occurred for reasons unrelated to the program.","[Khanna, Neha] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Khanna, Neha] SUNY Binghamton, Environm Studies Program, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Vidovic, Martina] Rollins Coll, Dept Econ, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Rollins College,"Khanna, N (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, LT1004,POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",mvidovic@rollins.edu; nkhanna@binghamton.edu,,,,,,,31,19,25,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The analysis is based on simulated lifetime earnings profiles among graduates, linked to imputed information on parental incomes and institution and course choices. We find that, on average, total gross tuition fees will increase by over 15,000 pound as a result of the reforms; nevertheless, students will be significantly better off while they study due to the increased generosity of student support. The average graduate will be roughly 8,600 pound worse off over their lifetime, while universities will, on average, be better off as they are more than able to make up for the loss of substantial amounts of direct public funding through higher fees. The taxpayer is set to lose 33p of every 1 pound loaned to students (up from 25p under the current system) because of the generosity of the loan repayment terms, although the new regime is still expected to save the taxpayer around 3,000 pound per graduate overall. The reforms involve a substantial shift in the incidence of the cost of higher education away from the public sector and towards the private sector. In terms of the likely implications for social mobility, our work confirms that the new funding regime is actually more progressive than its predecessor: the poorest 29 per cent of graduates will be better off under the new system, while other graduates will be worse off. Moreover, the richest 16 per cent of graduates will pay back more than they borrow, while others will be subsidised. If prospective students from poorer backgrounds are aware of these facts, then, in theory, the new funding system should not dissuade them from applying to university and thus it would increase, rather than reduce, social mobility in the long run. However, this will require a lack of debt aversion amongst students from the poorest backgrounds, and the ability for the government and universities to provide students with clear information about the likely costs of going to university.","[Dearden, Lorraine] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Goodman, Alissa] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education; University of London; University College London,,haroon_c@ifs.org.uk; ldearden@ifs.org.uk; a.goodman@ucl.ac.uk; wenchao_j@ifs.org.uk,"Dearden, Lorraine/AAO-6720-2020; Dearden, Lorraine M/D-4926-2017","Dearden, Lorraine M/0000-0002-9529-8860; Jin, Wenchao/0000-0003-3855-6840",,,,,17,24,24,2,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We follow Pettigrew, Woodman and Cameron (2001) in their call for a deeper understanding of the link between the various elements of the organizational change process itself, and organizational performance outcomes. Our analysis is based on data from over 220 organizations, and over 22,800 of their employees in Slovenia between 2008 and 2010. Our analysis shows that the perceived levels of organizational change (OC) are the highest for marketing and HRM processes, relative to other organizational processes. Furthermore, we establish that a higher organization-to-employee relationship quality is in myriad ways linked to higher perceived levels of OC in HRM processes. However, this is true only for the initial phase of the current economic crisis (2008 and 2009), but not also for its subsequent widening (2010). On the other hand, the correlation comparison between selected marketing performance measures and perceived level of OC in marketing processes is also significantly linked also to customer loyalty. Lastly, by analyzing the correlations between perceived levels OC and corporate sustainability (as added value per employee) we can see that perceived levels of OC in marketing and production processes display high correlations in the beginning of the economic crisis (2008), but not afterward (2009 or 2010). In addition, perceived levels of OC related to HRM do not correlate with added value per employee in any of the three compared years. This shows a different nature of the relationship between specific areas of perceived OC and corporate sustainability, as measured by added value per employee.","[Raskovic, Matevz; Moerec, Barbara] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Raskovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",matevz.raskovic@ef.uni-lj.si,"Raskovic, Matevz/AFV-3565-2022; Morec, Barbara/J-1820-2017","Raskovic, Matevz/0000-0001-5311-4050; Morec, Barbara/0000-0003-4764-8122",,,,,57,3,3,1,33,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2012,14.0,32,,,,,522,536,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,964ED,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305675600016,0

In employing a unique dataset from Bangladesh, I show that rescheduling reduces the possibility of binding credit constraints and borrowing from moneylenders, and may also reduce transitory poverty. However, short-term rescheduling has insignificant effects. Indebted members with less liquid assets are more likely to be rescheduled.","Seijo Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",,"Shoji, M (通讯作者)，Seijo Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Masahiro, Shoji/AAB-9339-2020",,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730235] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,56,4,5,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We find that a two-factor fixed transition probability model adequately describes the multivariate series of mutual fund returns without the need to model time-varying transition probabilities. Mutual fund performance, as measured by a state dependent Jensen's alpha, varies with economic regimes that are defined according to the global equity market mean. Our primary two-factor fixed transition probability model shows that emerging market mutual fund alphas are often significantly positive in global bull regimes. Consideration of alternative second risk factors suggests that both the foreign exchange factor, or the recently proposed Hou.

Using a 50-state panel of tax policy information spanning the years 1989 through 2002, our analysis reveals that state tax policies generally do not appear to have quantitatively important effects on entrepreneurial activity. When we find statistically important effects, we find that higher individual income tax rates, the existence of a state-level estate, inheritance or gift tax, and a higher weight on the sales factor in the state corporate income tax apportionment formula all slightly reduce a state's share of the national entrepreneurial stock. Results also indicate that states with more progressive personal income tax structures and states that have more aggressive corporate income taxes through the imposition of a combined reporting requirement both tend to have slightly higher entrepreneurship rates. The composition of state tax portfolios is not found to be a significant determinant of state entrepreneurship.","[Deskins, John] Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Omaha, NE 68178 USA; [Bruce, Donald] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Business & Econ Res, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Bruce, Donald] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",Creighton University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Deskins, J (通讯作者)，Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA.",dbruce@utk.edu; johndeskins@creighton.edu,,,,,,,36,52,61,5,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We find that a stochastic discount factor constructed from a set of basis assets helps explain post-earnings-announcement drift (PEAD). The risk exposures on the pricing kernel increase monotonically from the lowest to highest SUE sorted portfolios. Specifically, good-news firms always have higher risk exposures than bad-news firms in both 10 SUE sorted portfolios and 25 size and SUE sorted portfolios. However, the estimated expected risk premium is too small to explain the observed magnitude of returns on the PEAD strategy. Our risk adjustment can explain only about one-fourth of the total magnitude of the average realized return to the PEAD strategy. As a result, the average risk-adjusted returns of earnings momentum strategies are mostly positive and significant. Overall, our results support the view that at least some portion of the returns to the earnings momentum strategies examined represent compensation for bearing increased risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to one-period return tests, we conduct statistical tests based on dividend growth forecasts and long-horizon return forecasts implied by one-year regressions to provide significant evidence for the predictability of aggregate Japanese stock returns. Our findings therefore strengthen the international evidence for the role of dividend yield in predicting returns. However, we find that direct long-horizon regressions are not a powerful way of testing the null hypothesis of no return predictability. Moreover, we find that current cash flow is a more important driving force than future cash flow in the stock market fluctuations, although the dominant force is attributed to expected future returns.

Still, funds of hedge funds keep on experiencing outflows. Can this phenomenon be explained by the failure of fund of hedge fund managers to deliver on their promise to add value through active management, or is it symptomatic of a move toward greater disintermediation in the hedge fund industry? We introduce a return-based attribution model allowing for a full decomposition of fund of hedge fund performance. The results of our empirical study suggest that funds of hedge funds are funds of funds like others. Strategic allocation turns out to be a crucial step in the investment process, in that it not only adds value over the long-term, but most importantly, it brings resilience precisely when investors need it the most. Fund picking, on the other hand, turns out to be a double-edged sword. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Historically, PNG captured value from tuna only by charging licensing fees to foreign fishing fleets, which relegated PNG as a source of raw material for the global tuna industry. To capture more value from tuna including much-needed jobs and infrastructure the PNG government now offers firms that invest in domestic tuna processing plants strategic, long-term fishing licences. This strategy of obligating embeddedness enables PNG to reorder the international division of labour in the canned tuna sector, but socio-economic outcomes are shaped by competition within the global tuna industry, the core business strategies of foreign firms and domestic conditions in PNG. Ultimately, a state's right to control the terms of access to tuna is not synonymous with its ability to shape the local-level consequences that emerge as firms comply. These findings reveal the peculiar nature of state sovereignty over pelagic marine resources and the complications of exploiting them to achieve domestic economic and social objectives.","[Havice, Elizabeth] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Reed, Kristin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Human Rights Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Havice, E (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, 324 Saunders Hall,Campus Box 3220, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",havice@email.unc.edu; kreed@berkeley.edu,,"Havice, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0760-2082",,,,,89,41,44,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The estimated spot variance path can be used to extend an existing high-frequency jump test statistic, to detect arrival times of jumps, and to obtain distributional characteristics of detected jumps. The effectiveness of our approach is explored through Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that sparse sampling for mitigating the impact of microstructure noise has an adverse effect on both spot variance estimation and jump detection. In our approach, we can analyze high-frequency price observations that are contaminated with microstructure noise and rounding effects without the need for sparse sampling. An empirical illustration is presented for the intraday EUR/USD exchange rates.

The main contribution of this paper is that we allow the same player to play sequentially under different environments (symmetric and asymmetric resources and different number of battlefields) against computer Consistent with the theoretical predictions, we find that most of the time players use a 'complete coverage' strategy when they have equal or more resources than the opponent and use a 'guerilla warfare 'strategy when they have fewer resources. We also find that an individual player's success is relatively high when the player has equal or more resources than the opponent.

Given an optimal risk level in the no-tax case under full liability, loss-offset restrictions reduce, and limited liability increases, the incentives for taking risk. For every degree of limited liability we find corresponding loss-offset limitations inducing the same optimal risk level as in the reference case. In our model, full liability requires symmetric taxation, and limited liability requires asymmetric taxation of profits and losses.

We construct gross worker flows data using the monthly Labor Force Survey. Our data enables us to examine the size and cyclical patterns of the flows and transition rates between employment, unemployment, and not being-in-the labor force. We find that the cyclical pattern of worker flows is similar to that found in other countries; however, worker flows in Japan are generally smaller than those in the US and European countries. We also decompose changes in unemployment into contributions from unemployment inflow and outflow rates. We find that both inflow and outflow rates significantly affect variations in unemployment. J.

In addition, we do not find robust evidence to suggest that dirtier MNEs are more likely to locate in host countries with lax environmental policy than cleaner MNEs.

Still, central bankers and the public generally question whether even a temporarily higher inflation rate could be beneficial in addressing a liquidity trap or could be consistent with price stability over the longer term. At the same time, however, the Federal Reserve's projections for high unemployment and low inflation do not seem to be consistent with the best monetary policies to address the Fed's dual mandate responsibilities.

Moreover, we modify Seligman's full life to the concept of balanced full life.

Based on a sample of 242 non-financial firms listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand at the time of the announcement of the relaxation of capital control in Thailand on January 29, 2007, we find positive and significant abnormal returns on Day-2, Day 1, and Day 3 relative to the announcement day. Our findings suggest that capital account liberalization favorably affects stock prices of firms, though the effect varies across industries. From a public policy perspective, our results suggest that liberalizing capital account by relaxing capital control measures could improve firm value in the short-term, which may, in turn, boost the level of economic growth in the long run. In addition, the results show that there is a significant fall in the mean beta in the post-liberalization period, thereby implying the lower cost of capital. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The findings show that the majority of the interviewees are satisfied with the certification system. Furthermore, the perceived benefit in terms of farm income is the most important factor determining satisfaction, suggesting a need to improve communication of other potential benefits such as market access. The perceived bureaucracy associated with organic certification negatively affects farmers' expectations, indicating that the simplification of the certification process and harmonisation of organic standards should be considered in the political debate. Surprisingly, the perceived reliability of organic certification has no significant effect on satisfaction.

In this context, management accounting constitutes an essential informational source for the firm's management, because: activities inevitably generate costs; the determination of the costs is able to explain the efficiency of the economic activity and to determine the deviations from the purpose proposed, while the information provided by the calculation of the costs is strategic information for corporate piloting.For decision making, the key word is relevance. The relevant character of the information from the cost domain allows one to know the economic activities that can influence the level, structure and subsequent evolution of the economic organization, so that every manager may receive significant information for the substantiation of his decisions within the skill and responsibility incumbent to him.During a period in which managerial calculation systems and economic applications are becoming commonplace in organizations, cost calculation using modern systems shapes the overall corporate management but also the management of each section or workshop, contributing to the increase of the responsibility of each cost-generating place.

Moreover, a Pareto improving-and thus voluntary-transfer of land from the smaller to the larger landlord may exist.","[Sekeris, Petros G.] Univ Namur, CRED, Namur, Belgium; [De Luca, Giacomo] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Louvain, Belgium",University of Namur; KU Leuven,"Sekeris, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, CRED, Namur, Belgium.",giacomo.deluca@econ.kuleuven.be; psekeris@fundp.ac.be,"Sekeris, Petros/I-2165-2019; Sekeris, Petros/IAM-7551-2023","Sekeris, Petros/0000-0003-0402-2744;",,,,,40,15,16,3,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2012,150.0,1-2,,,,,119,135,,10.1007/s11127-010-9692-8,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,858QN,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297817200006,0

We highlight the disputes and disruptions that characterize the IAASTD process and attempts to marginalize its findings. Following a brief review of the history of the Assessment and of the social construction of scientific knowledges, we consider five processes that expose the hierarchies and contestations that shape ongoing debates. We reveal how conflicts within IAASTD and between IAASTD and its sponsors cannot be dismissed as either technical or managerial, but instead showcase the fragility of claims that privilege productivity increases over other relations in agricultural practice. We conclude with a challenge to understanding agricultural change and its future that builds on social, ecological and political relations as constitutive rather than as exogenous to research and policy formation.","[Feldman, Shelley] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Feldman, S (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 391 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",rf12@cornell.edu; biggs.s@gmail.com,,,,,,,69,20,25,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Pension schemes tend to be the major source of retirement incomes, at least, in the developed world. Facing this aging problem, the Taiwanese government offered persons insured under the Labor Insurance Pension Scheme the choice of whether or not to annuitize their retirement benefits from January 1, 2009. Following the implementation of this pension program, the insured may now select the old-age one-time benefit or a monthly pension benefit when they retire. The puzzle is that very few people would choose to annuitize their wealth in practice. This is contrary to the suggestions made by the financial literature. In this study, we apply the liquidity premium and the implied longevity yield (ILY) to compare the old-age one-time benefit with the monthly pension benefit. The results demonstrate that the ILY minus the risk-free rate is greater than the liquidity premium in most scenarios and these findings encourage the insured to choose the old-age pension benefit. This result is consistent with the financial literature. Moreover, we find that those insured with the lowest insurance salary and fewer years of coverage earn the highest ILY. This shows that the program has been designed with the purpose of wealth re-distribution.","[Hwang, Yawen] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Shihchieh] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taipei, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; National Chengchi University,"Hwang, YW (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taichung, Taiwan.",ywhwang@fcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Some of the accounting activities from the public sector do not provide an insight into the real situation of assets, finances and incomes (a real and clear image). This makes it difficult to evaluate accounting systems for the wide public and politicians. The introduction of IPSAS in public accounting in Romania provides assistance through uniform standards. Public management represents the basis for effective control and monitoring processes in public administration. IPSAS helps public management to improve the quality of financial information, simplifies the internal and monitoring control of public institutions and adds value to the financial information regarding economic profitability.

In my present study, there is a comparative analysis of organizational culture state of art and changes in public institutions, as a result of the implementation of projects within national and international programs. My methodology includes surveys conducted at the headquarters of public administration institutions in Targu Mures, interviews with a few important public clerks, and library study and discussions with my PhD coordinator in this field. Results up to this moment from the surveyed locations in Romania, at least - give the picture of an organizational culture that is in between tradition and modernity. As an outcome of project implementation, it is expected that the Romanian public administration will be to a larger degree transparent and in the service of the citizen, more involved in several neuralgic areas of public life, and also have better wages for its employees, thus motivating them.

The average initial return differential between the IPOs issued in depressing and cheerful days is in the sizable order of between 5 and 10% of the offering, approaching 15-25% for the relatively less publicly exposed firms, as assessed using a database of 1,526 IPOs with average gross proceeds of $15 million.","[Kliger, Doron; Gurevich, Gregory] Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Haim, Abraham] Univ Haifa, Israeli Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Chronobiol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa; University of Haifa,"Kliger, D (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",kliger@econ.haifa.ac.il,,"Gurevich, Gregory/0000-0003-4930-8439; Kliger, Doron/0000-0001-7649-8464",,,,,35,8,8,0,5,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

We found that both priming and the subjective frequency of beliefs independently influence decision making. The results indicate that decisions are the result of an integration of influences derived from both the description (specified probability) and experience (accessibility to pre-experiment beliefs about event frequencies and temporarily activated relevant events) of risks. People's risk preferences are influenced by the accessibility of events in memory, such that increasing accessibility causes risk aversion to a potential loss to increase.

For instance, it has been discussed if index-based insurance are an alternative to classical hedging opportunities of weather risks. While science have mainly focused on the conception, pricing and hedging effectiveness of new weather risk management instruments, a research gap exists regarding the farmers' subjective perception of weather risks, the analysis of implemented on-farm measures for weather risk reduction as well as regarding the measurement of farmers' preferences for different risk management instruments. On the basis of survey data, this study investigates which meteorological events farmers perceive as very risky, which measures they already apply to reduce the risk and which costs are involved. Using a discrete choice experiment, beside the demand for weather insurance also the influence of performance defining features of different insurance on their selection probability is determined. Results show that farmers often are not able to quantify the costs of the risk management instruments applied so far. Even given high basis risks, they would, therefore, demand for yield insurance as well as index-based insurance if those are sold at a favorable price. Moreover, results show that the demand for insurance rises with increasing risk involvement of the agricultural enterprises as well as - against all expectations - with decreasing risk aversion of the decision makers.","[Liebe, Ulf; Maart, Syster Christin; Musshoff, Oliver; Stubbe, Philipp] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Liebe, Ulf] Univ Kassel, Kassel, Germany",University of Gottingen; Universitat Kassel,"Musshoff, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fak Agrarwissensch, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Arbeitsbereich Landwirtschaftliche Betriebslehre, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,39,7,7,1,23,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Under these conditions of heat and pressure, internal pores or defects within a solid body or a powder compact collapse and weld up. Encapsulated powder and sintered components densify easily and faster than due to sintering alone. Therefore HIP is today used for a lot of applications, like upgrading castings (removing shrinkage pores in interdendritic space), densifying pre-sintered components, consolidation of powders and interfacial bonding.

A number of conflicting objectives and constraints must be considered simultaneously for evaluating alternative maintenance strategies. To cope with this problem and also to consider the dependency among criteria and sub-criteria, an integration of Analytic Network Process (ANP) and fuzzy set theory has been suggested in this study.In the first step, factors which play role in selecting the best maintenance strategy have been determined by reviewing the research literature and interviewing with the experts. Considering the relations between these factors a network with 5 criteria and 12 sub-criteria have been proposedin the next step group Analytic Network Process (ANP) method was adopted to prioritize these criteria and determine the optimum strategy. In order to deal with fuzzy data and analyzing the fuzzy decision matrixes, Chang's extended analysis has been employed in this study.

The main characteristic of this process is that countries are accepted as new members of the EU once their economies have reached a suitable convergence level. Since the banking sector represents the main channel through which the economy is financed, especially in the case of the new member countries and also in the case of the candidate countries, it becomes obvious that its integration plays a key role in the overall European integration process. In another train of thoughts, the financial and economic downturn has affected almost without exception all of the EU member countries. Thus, the aim of our research is to estimate the banks efficiency from three relatively homogenous groups of countries that are having different levels of economic development and are involved in different stages of the European integration process and the impact that the financial and economic downturn had on it. In order to achieve this we have employed a Data Envelopment Analysis, using data from the Bankscope - Bureau van Dijk database. The analysed period is 2003-2010, this allowing us to underline the development prior and post the start of the crisis. The obtained results underline that, despite adverse macroeconomic conditions, the analysed countries were able to obtain positive results in the catching-up process, but still registering an efficiency gap in the banking intermediation process.","[Sargu, Alina Camelia; Roman, Angela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Doctoral Sch Econ, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,s_alina_camelia@yahoo.com; aboariu@uthc.ro,"ROMAN, Angela/G-9223-2018","ROMAN, Angela/0000-0003-0402-7641",,,,,27,0,0,0,12,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3527-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,284,305,,,,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEZ44,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318886500021,0

Their autonomies had been brought in development of the short period on science, technology and industrialization. i.e. a lot of patents or inventions. Although such technological changes had accelerated industrialization, due to socio-economical inequality conditions until the world war I,II and former Soviet, CEE had not achieved a sustainable economic growth. Todays, however reviewing as a part of the EU, this article says the difference amid the changes in CEE innovation under the small open economy through Eurobarometer since 2004. The industrial R&D investment has decreased gradually, even the survey also shows that the trends in innovation investment have been shrinking. Despite the open innovation policy of EU is keeping abreast with that of CEE for employment and R&D collaborate. By the innobarometer, there were expection gaps of conception for innovation to use the new method or introduction of it in CEE. Among cases of Czech and Poland, Hungary they each were belong to the higher level or lowest by expectation or willpower of the innovation. The R&D abilities are absolutely not leading to the economic growth and technology development, but being stimulated for growth and being needed to act as competitive edge by co-effort of local public and corporate strategy compared with Korea briefly.

When respectively using net assets per share, 0.18 times the price of tradable shares and 0.336 times the price of tradable shares as the price of non-tradable shares, the relationship of Tobin's q and ratio of tradable shares is statistically significantly positive. When using the price of tradable shares as the price of non-tradable shares, the relationship of Tobin's q and ratio of tradable shares is statistically significantly negative.

Environmental income accounts for 28% of total household income, 77% of which comes from natural forests. Environmental income shares are higher for low-income households, but differences across income quintiles are less pronounced than previously thought. The poor rely more heavily on subsistence products such as wood fuels and wild foods, and on products harvested from natural areas other than forests. In absolute terms environmental income is approximately five times higher in the highest income quintile, compared to the two lowest quintiles. (C) 2014 The Authors.

With this aim, we run a field experiment involving about 700 Italian students. According to widespread superstitions, some numbers are considered lucky while others are thought of as unlucky. In our experiment, we exploited this by randomly assigning students to numbered seats in their written exam. At the end of the examination, we asked students the grade they expected to get. We find that students tend to be overconfident about their performance at the exam and that their overconfidence is positively affected by being assigned to a lucky number. Interestingly, males and females react differently: females' overconfidence tends to be negatively affected when assigned to unlucky numbers, while they are not affected by being assigned to lucky numbers; males are not affected by being assigned to unlucky numbers but are more overconfident when assigned to lucky numbers.

We utilize insurer loss reserve errors to accurately measure the quality of accruals. This measure, as well as conventional accruals measures, is used to investigate the extent to which accruals quality is priced into both debt and equity capital. We find that accruals quality is priced into debt capital; however, we find virtually no evidence that accruals quality is priced into equity capital. Our results should be of particular interest to insurers as it affects pricing ability. Specifically, insurers who provide primary debtholders (i.e., policyholders) less information risk are able to command higher prices.

In this paper, we look back at that debate by using Hong Kong's experience during the Asian financial crisis to test the then-consensus view on monetary tightening against the revisionist view of its critics. Hong Kong provides an interesting test of the two approaches because monetary policy was tightened and the pre-crisis exchange rate survived the speculative attack intact, in contrast to other studies that have examined the effects of tighter monetary policy during attacks that led to changes in exchange-rate management. Using a model of exchange-market pressure and VAR estimation, we find that our results are generally supportive of the revisionist hypothesis.","[Harake, Wissam] Fed Reserve Board Governors, World Bank, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Meade, Ellen E.] Fed Reserve Board Governors, Div Monetary Affairs, Washington, DC 20551 USA",The World Bank; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Meade, EE (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, 20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",ellen.meade@frb.gov,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

This is a typical phenomenon in financial time series observed at high frequencies, such as cumulated trading volumes. We introduce a flexible point-mass mixture distribution and develop a semiparametric specification test explicitly tailored for such distributions. Moreover, we propose a new type of multiplicative error model based on a zero-augmented distribution, which incorporates an autoregressive binary choice component and thus captures the (potentially different) dynamics of both zero occurrences and of strictly positive realizations. Applying the proposed model to high-frequency cumulated trading volumes of both liquid and illiquid NYSE stocks, we show that the model captures the dynamic and distributional properties of the data well and is able to correctly predict future distributions.","[Hautsch, Nikolaus; Malec, Peter; Schienle, Melanie] Humboldt Univ, Inst Stat & Econometr, Berlin, Germany; [Hautsch, Nikolaus; Schienle, Melanie] Humboldt Univ, Ctr Appl Stat & Econ, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Hautsch, N (通讯作者)，Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",nikolaus.hautsch@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,"Schienle, Melanie/JCO-7980-2023; Hautsch, Nikolaus/B-5815-2017","Schienle, Melanie/0000-0001-6000-5653; Hautsch, Nikolaus/0000-0001-9702-3871",,,,,50,23,26,1,88,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Using a large panel dataset, this paper is the first to empirically examine the incidence, determinants, and consequences of share restriction changes. We find that funds with high asset liquidity and low liquidity risk are more likely to decrease share restrictions and funds with good performance are more likely to increase share restrictions. A hazard model indicates that funds who actively manage liquidity concerns live longer by adjusting share restrictions. We examine whether changes in share restrictions create an endogeneity bias in the share illiquidity premium (Aragon, 2007) and find that 18% of the premium can be explained by the dynamic nature of contract changes.

On the other side, portfolio diversification acts to mitigate these losses. Systemic risk results from correlations between individual default probabilities that cannot be considered independent. Based on the structural framework by Meston(1974), we propose a model in which these correlations arise from overlaps in banks' portfolios. Our main result is the finding of a critical level of diversification that separates two regimes: (i) a safe regime in which a properly chosen diversification strategy offsets the higher systemic risk engendered by increased leverage and (ii) a risky regime in which an inadequate diversification strategy and/or adverse market conditions, such as market size, market volatility and time horizon, cannot compensate the same increase in leverage. Our results are of relevance for financial regulators especially because the critical level of diversification may not coincide with the one that is individually optimal. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We also show that sub-Saharan Africa is different in several respects. For instance, we find no evidence that fertilizer is associated with greater agricultural productivity in the African sample. Also, while the coefficient on infrastructure is positively associated with agricultural productivity in the full sample, its quantitative effect is smaller in sub-Saharan Africa.

Moreover, the speed of information incorporated into price becomes faster and faster, while the speed of sentiment factored into price gets slower and slower over time.

Using one-step-ahead STGP models to investigate the differences in return patterns between small and large stocks we demonstrate the superiority of models developed for small-cap stocks over those developed for large-cap stocks, indicating that small stocks are more predictable.

The risk reduction is achieved without the possibility of reduced lending from a Tier 1 increase. The cap encourages diversification and reduces the need a bank has to focus on a limited number of asset classes. The cap can be used for Macroprudential Regulation to encourage banks to move resources away from wholesale banking to the retail banking sector. Such an intervention would be targeted: in 2009 a 20% reduction in remuneration would have been equivalent to more than 150 basis points of extra Tier 1 for UBS, for example. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This article brings these features into a life-cycle setting, and shows that optimal stock investment is constant or increasing in age before retirement for realistic parameter combinations. The driver of such inversion in the life-cycle profile is the resolution of uncertainty regarding social security pension, which increases the investor's risk appetite. This occurs if a small positive contemporaneous correlation between permanent labor income shocks and stock returns is matched by a realistically high degree of risk aversion. Absent this combination, the typical downward-sloping profile obtains. Overlooking differences in optimal investment profiles across heterogeneous workers results in large welfare losses, in the order of 15-30% of lifetime consumption.","[Bagliano, Fabio C.; Nicodano, Giovanna] Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy; [Bagliano, Fabio C.; Fugazza, Carolina; Nicodano, Giovanna] Coll Carlo Alberto, CeRP, Moncalieri, Italy; [Fugazza, Carolina] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Bagliano, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",,"Bagliano, Fabio C./G-1402-2013","Bagliano, Fabio C./0000-0001-8915-6519; NICODANO, Giovanna/0000-0003-2098-2331",,,,,40,15,15,2,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

This is implemented in an interacted panel VAR framework in which all coefficient parameters are allowed to change continuously with the debt-to-GDP ratio. We find that responses to government spending shocks exhibit strong nonlinear behavior. While the overall cumulative effect of a spending shock on real GDP is positive and significant at moderate debt-to-GDP ratios, this effect turns negative as the ratio increases. The total cumulative effect on the trade balance as a share of GDP is negative at first but switches sign at higher levels of debt. Consequently, depending on the degree of public indebtedness, our results accommodate long-run fiscal multipliers that are greater and smaller than one or even negative as well as twin deficit and twin divergence behavior within one sample and time period. From a policy perspective, these results lend additional support to increased prudence at high public debt ratios because the effectiveness of fiscal stimuli to boost economic activity or resolve external imbalances may not be guaranteed.","[Nickel, Christiane] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Tudyka, Andreas] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Dusseldorf, Germany",European Central Bank; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Nickel, C (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",christiane.nickel@ecb.int; andreas.tudyka@whu.edu,,,,,,,57,49,56,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We find that perquisite consumption critically impacts cash policy. Size-based compensation also matters, but less. Firms with lower blockholder and institutional ownership have higher managerial perquisite consumption, low managerial ownership is a key factor in the secular upward trend in cash holdings, and agency plays little role in small firms' substantial cash holdings.","[Nikolov, Boris; Whited, Toni M.] Univ Rochester, Simon Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Whited, Toni M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Rochester; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Nikolov, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Simon Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",,"Whited, Toni/AAQ-3341-2021","Whited, Toni/0000-0001-5998-4647",,,,,35,128,150,3,121,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

While it is well-known that price- and quantity-based regulatory instruments provide different investment levels, the effects on the choice between different technologies have received scant attention. This paper expands on the prices versus quantities literature by investigating firms' technology choice in the face of demand and supply side uncertainty. I show that the regulator can not design tradable emissions permits and an emissions tax such that the two regimes are equivalent, even in terms of expected values. Moreover, a tax encourages the most flexible abatement technology if and only if stochastic costs and the equilibrium permit price have sufficiently strong positive covariance, compared with the variance in consumer demand for the good produced. Finally, the firms' technology choices are socially optimal under tradable emissions permits, but not under an emissions tax.","Stat Norway, Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Storrosten, HB (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131 Dep, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",hbs@ssb.no,,,,,,,42,11,11,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We exploit the heterogeneity between large and small intermediaries to assess to what extent the transmission of sovereign risk differed in relation with different banks' balance-sheet characteristics and business strategies. Regarding the cost of funding, we find that changes in the BTP-Bund spread have a sizeable effect on the interest rates on term deposits and newly issued bonds but virtually no effect on overnight deposits. Furthermore, the sovereign spread significantly affects the cost of credit for firms and households and exerts a negative effect on loan growth. All these results are magnified when considering alone the five largest banks, which are typically less capitalized, have a larger funding gap and incidence of bad loans and rely more on non-traditional banking activities. Sovereign tensions also affect the main items of banks' income statement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The ability to quickly generate new capital through external issuance and dividend reductions let life insurers maintain healthy levels of equity capital. We use this experience to examine the causes and consequences of external capital issuance by U.S. life insurance companies. We show that, in general, new capital is issued both to support the growth of new business and to replace capital depleted by operating losses. This second channel is particularly important during macroeconomic recessions. Notably, we do not find any evidence that insurers had difficulty generating new capital, unlike other financial service providers that required large amounts of public support.

We consider Italian cities' cultural policies in the 1998-2008 period, a time when overall cultural expenditure shrank while cultural transfers increased.

While much research shows that the initiative process affects policy choices, almost no evidence explains how the initiative process affects policy. Initiatives might change policy directly through voters approving laws that override the legislature; or the initiative process may change policy indirectly by providing a threat that induces the legislature to change policy. This article develops an empirical strategy to measure the direct and indirect effects of the initiative based on the idea that direct effects can be inferred from states that actually pass initiatives while indirect effects can be inferred from states where the initiative is available but not used. Evidence from 50 states on nine separate issues suggests that both direct and indirect effects are important, but the direct effect is several times larger than the threat effect.","Univ So Calif, USC Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Matsusaka, JG (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, USC Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",matsusak@usc.edu,,,,,,,51,14,18,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2014,160.0,3-4,,,,,345,366,,10.1007/s11127-013-0130-6,0.0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AL7VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339344600004,0

Measures of political uncertainty are constructed and their relationship with market uncertainty, as measured by implied volatility, explored. Empirical evidence suggests that increasing (decreasing) levels of uncertainty around the election induce higher (lower) levels of market uncertainty. An increasing likelihood of the incumbent party, whose economic policies are presumably well-known, winning the election, reduces market uncertainty. This relationship is stronger when political uncertainty is highest, when the business cycle contracting, and when the level of economic risk is high. Higher levels of political uncertainty tend to be associated with declining levels of outstanding debt, and lower issuance of long-term Government debt, driven by falling demand and higher yields.

We observe that a large share of voluntary movers do not end up with higher wages but, surprisingly, do have higher job satisfaction after the change. The vast majority of voluntary movers find significantly higher time flexibility, improved relationships with stakeholders and closer conformity to educational skills in their new jobs.

The question of whether formal and informal governance mechanisms are complements or substitutes needs to be addressed within the context of effective governance as a means to economic value creation for the transacting partners. Rather than an either-or choice between the two perspectives-the substitute hypothesis and the complement hypothesis-on the relationship between formal and informal governance mechanisms, I provide evidence from the biotechnology industry that alliances characterized by high levels of exchange hazards utilizing both mechanisms, supporting the complements hypothesis, whereas those alliances with lower levels of exchange hazards utilize only one type of governance mechanism. Finding seemingly contrasting results within a single institutional setting suggests that, in addition to institution-specific characteristics, alliance-specific characteristics may also be critical for understanding how alliance partners utilize multiple governance mechanisms.","Western Washington Univ, Dept Management, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA",Western Washington University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Western Washington Univ, Dept Management, 351 Pk Hall, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",jongwook.kim@wwu.edu,,,,,,,72,10,11,1,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Using a sample of about 2,800 firms from highly innovative sectors, propensity score matching is used to create a sample group of control firms that is comparable to the group of spin-offs. The article provides evidence that the 121 research spin-offs investigated have more patent applications and more radical product innovations, on average, compared to similar firms. The results also show that research spin-offs' superior innovation performance can be explained by their high level of research cooperation and by location factors. An urban region location and proximity to the parent institution are found to be conducive to innovation productivity.

As in previous research, trusting beliefs and trust-related behaviors were greater at the start of the game for partners with trustworthy faces; and higher later in the game for partners who reciprocated. Three additional findings extended beyond the previous research. First, by measuring the discrete components of trusting beliefs rather than an umbrella trustworthiness measure, we confirmed that first impressions and experience influence judgments of competence, benevolence, and integrity. Moreover, we found suggestive evidence that perceptions of benevolence and integrity updated more quickly with experience than perceptions of competence. Second, by looking at trusting beliefs at the start of two consecutive repeated Trust Games, we found that judgments of competence, benevolence, and integrity continue to be influenced by trustworthy facial appearances, even after previous beliefs based on facial appearances were disconfirmed. Third, we found increased investment with a partner at the start of a second repeated Trust Game, even when participants expected their partners to betray them. Overall, our results clarify our understanding of how first impressions and experience influence trusting beliefs; provides evidence that changes in the repeated Trust Game represents learning about a specific partner rather than revisions of trusting dispositions; and highlights important distinctions between trusting beliefs and trust-related behaviors.

More specifically, we investigate whether monetary policy has become less effective in the wake of financial globalization. We also analyze whether there is increasing uncertainty for central banks due to globalization-driven changes in the national economic structure. A FAVAR framework is applied to identify structural shocks on a world level and their effect on other global and national variables. To estimate our macroeconomic model, we employ quarterly data from Q1 1984 to Q4 2007 for the G7 countries and the euro area. According to our results, global liquidity shocks significantly influence the world economy and also various national economies. But common shocks driven by real estate prices and GDP also turn out to be significant at a global scale. These results prove to be robust across different specifications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Guarana is managed in a number of socio-technical contexts, ranging from the fizzy drink industry to alternative agro-ecological farming systems, and is subject to a great many legal rules that determine the conditions for its use and appropriation. The paper shows how, in guarana's native region of Maues, Brazilian Amazonia, various stakeholders including the indigenous population, associations of smallholdings and multinationals use legal standards in order to gain prerogatives over the plant and/or win a share of a growing market. In spite of the fact that the plant has been domesticated by the Satere-Mawe and that traditional knowledge has been recognized in Brazil, to a certain extent history has dispossessed them of their rights to guarana. New political and economic circumstances have favoured those actors committed to strategies of agricultural modernization and industrial processing. On the other hand, the ecologization of agriculture and the increasing numbers of instruments for differentiating production (such as fair trade, organic farming and geographical indications) seem to be favouring diversification in the methods of managing guarana, as well as a certain re-appropriation of the plant by local communities.","[Filoche, Geoffroy] IRD, UMR GRED, Paris, France; [Filoche, Geoffroy] Univ Fed Goias, IESA, BR-74691300 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Pinton, Florence] AgroParisTech, UFR Sociol, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Pinton, Florence] UMR Sadapt INRA AgroParisTech, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universidade Federal de Goias; AgroParisTech; AgroParisTech; INRAE,"Filoche, G (通讯作者)，IRD, UMR GRED, Paris, France.",geoffroy.filoche@ird.fr; florence.pinton@agroparistech.fr,,"PINTON LESCURE, Florence/0000-0002-7383-6971",,,,,59,7,10,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

To minimize the pretest bias and overcome the structural changes, we adopt the bootstrap Granger causality test applied to full sample and subsamples with a fixed window size. The Johansen cointegration test with GMM-IV estimator finds a long-run positive relation between the series. The full sample results of bootstrap Granger causality test show that there is predictive power from life insurance activity to banking credit only for France and Japan, while the short-run causal relationships between nonlife insurance activity and banking credit are country-specific. However, parameter stability test results suggest that the short-run results in full sample are unreliable. The results of rolling VAR models report that the causal linkages between them are time-varying across various subsamples.

Several procedures to recover subjective probabilities have been proposed, but in order to recover the correct latent probability one must either construct elicitation mechanisms that control for risk aversion, or construct elicitation mechanisms which undertake calibrating adjustments to elicited reports. We illustrate how the joint estimation of risk attitudes and subjective probabilities can provide the calibration adjustments that theory calls for. We illustrate this approach using data from a controlled experiment with real monetary consequences to the subjects. This allows the observer to make inferences about the latent subjective probability, under virtually any well-specified model of choice under subjective risk, while still employing relatively simple elicitation mechanisms.","[Andersen, Steffen] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fountain, John] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, CEAR, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, CEAR, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Rutstroem, E.

However, the impression one gets from much of the economic literature, particularly simulations from integrated assessment models used in policy analysis, is that the potential impacts of climate change are not large enough to warrant aggressive mitigation efforts in the near term. Although these models represent an important step in the needed interdisciplinary analysis of climate change by elucidating the links between climate and economy, we argue that they grossly underestimate potential impacts and associated damages because they (and the related policy analyses) fail to adequately capture extreme conditions, catastrophic events, and tipping points that trigger irreversible changes in the climate system, as well as impacts on the natural environment that cannot be monetized. Because the most severe impacts are expected in the later years of this century and beyond, discounting is crucial, and we argue that the appropriate rate is well below market rates. Moreover, we show that in the uniquely long period relevant to climate policy, the irreversibility of climate changes and impacts is more serious than the irreversibility of proposed mitigation measures. We conclude that an aggressive mitigation policy is warranted, one that holds further increases in global mean temperature to the scientific consensus on what is required to avoid the worst impacts, and that such a policy can be achieved at a cost that is well below potential damages.","[Fisher, Anthony C.; Le, Phu V.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Fisher, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",acfisher@berkeley.edu; phu.le@berkeley.edu,,"LE, PHU/0000-0002-6971-3100",,,,,68,5,5,2,45,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

It is unclear, however, whether such expressions of anti-slavery sentiment were genuine, especially given the failure of so many slave owners to emancipate their slaves. In this paper, we show that there was a change in elite rhetoric about slavery, initiated by Whig politicians in the mid-1830s seeking a campaign issue in the South, in which anti-slavery rhetoric became linked to attempts by abolitionists to foment slave unrest, making anti-slavery an unsustainable position for the region's politicians. Before that development, we contend that some planters believed that slavery might some day be abolished. After it, those concerns largely went away. We argue that the change in slave owners' beliefs about the probability of abolition in the mid-1830s should have been reflected in slave prices at auction and test that claim using evidence from the New Orleans auction market.","[Grynaviski, Jeffrey D.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Detroit, MI USA; [Munger, Michael] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Wayne State University; Duke University,"Munger, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",grynaviski@wayne.edu; munger@duke.edu,,,,,,,52,4,7,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2014,159.0,3-4,,,,,341,361,,10.1007/s11127-013-0150-2,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AD3PD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333157200003,0

We hypothesize that they have three possible effects on consumer behaviour. The positive effects are: (1) a price effect (the less polluting option is subsidized and the polluting option is taxed); and (2) a social norm effect (the less polluting option is classified as pro-social and the polluting option as antisocial). The negative effect (3) is that they may decrease intrinsic motivation (crowding out). We provide an initial test of this tripartite model using survey data on students given a choice between taking the plane or the train between Toulouse to Paris. The first study shows that imposing a hypothetical bonus-malus tax has both a price effect (relative to a control condition where only the norm justifying the tax is presented) and a norm effect (relative to a control condition in which only the corresponding price difference is presented without mention of the tax). The second study presents a set of choices where the environmental norms and price differences are held constant, but the size of the contribution of the bonus-malus tax to the final price of each option is varied. This study confirms our prediction that a larger bonus-malus subsidy/tax reduces propensity to choose the less polluting option (i.e. the train). As the positive effects outweigh the negative effects in most of the choices studied, we conclude that bonus-malus taxes constitute a promising policy instrument. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The test is applied to detect whether asymmetric comovements exist in international stock markets.

Students who were awarded their first choice of residence hall were asked the lowest dollar amount they would be willing to accept (WTA) to give up their first choice hall whereas students who were denied their first choice were asked the highest dollar amount they would be willing to pay (WTP) to obtain their first choice. Results from the initial assessment showed the presence of the endowment effect regarding students' valuation of their first choice residence hall immediately after the housing lottery (i.e., WTA price was significantly higher than WTP price). The follow-up surveyed participants from the initial assessment who responded when contacted a second time after they had experienced two months of life in the residence hall they were awarded in the lottery. Results from the follow-up showed that the endowment effect was still present after experiencing life in the residence hall. Moreover, further analyses revealed that the endowment effect was, in fact, enhanced after the living experience. These findings demonstrate that within the context of a housing lottery, a highly-valued commodity, long-term experiences substantially increase the magnitude of the endowment effect, even when controlling for other factors that have been shown to impact this effect.

Second, it aims to understand how formal institutional development among Chinese regions affected the role of political connections. Using a two-level hierarchical dataset on Chinese private enterprises, this study finds that not only legal protection of property rights but also the development of market systems mattered for entrepreneurial performance.

We analyze the importance of agglomeration effects by including FDI inflow levels in tax havens and capture geographic spillovers by measuring proximity to the nearest tax haven. Our analysis yields several interesting findings. First, using panel data for 142 countries, we find evidence of positive spillovers from tax havens to nearby developing countries, but not to nearby developed countries. Second, restricting our panel to developing countries, we find the positive effect of tax haven FDI on developing countries to be robust. Third, we find that geographic distance matters for financial flows: developing countries which are the closest to a nearby tax haven benefit the most in terms of FDI inflows. This result is robust to accounting for spatial interdependence of FDI.","[Blanco, Luisa R.] Pepperdine Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Malibu, CA 90263 USA; [Rogers, Cynthia L.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Pepperdine University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Blanco, LR (通讯作者)，Pepperdine Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, CA 90263 USA.",lblanco@pepperdine.edu,,,,,,,32,11,11,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Despite rapid economic growth and declining consumption poverty, subjective poverty remains largely unchanged. We find that households with a history of poverty continue to perceive themselves as poor even if their material consumption improves. The relative economic position of households is a strong determinant of subjective poverty. Having some type of employment makes households less likely to perceive themselves as poor, even if they remain in objective poverty.

A counterfactual technique is developed to determine how originations during the early period would perform in a different environment, namely, the environment faced by originations of 2004,2005, and 2006. In an environment where house prices are increasing rapidly, low credit score originations do not show high rates of default as was witnessed for 2000-2002 cohorts. However, in an environment of stagnant or deteriorating home prices, low credit score originations show significantly higher rates of default than high credit score originations. With a greater proportion of low credit score originations, earlier cohorts of 2000-2002 were no less vulnerable to the environment faced by cohorts of 2004-2006. In essence, these results raise concerns about the viability of all cohorts of subprime originations because of their reliance on the appreciation of the underlying collateral rather than the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Hence, this paper investigates the relationship between the percentage of buy recommendations and probability of deciding to downgrade or drop coverage of stocks. Our findings suggest that the percentage of buy recommendations can enhance the probability of deciding to downgrade stock ratings and drop coverage of stocks. Furthermore, we find that analysts tend to revise their recommendations downward to hold instead of an unfavorable level. In addition, we find the market tends to heed downgrade decisions of analysts with a higher percentage of buy ratings. This finding is consistent with Barber, Lehavy, McNichols, and Trueman (2006) by applying data at the broker level. This study further investigates the changing dynamic in buy ratio of analysts by partitioning pre and post regulatory reform period. We show that analysts are more likely to revise their ratings to hold and less likely to revise their ratings to sell; in particular after post regulatory reform. Moreover, we observe one key coefficient in the post-Rule period with superior performance in contrast to the pre-Rule period. Compared to the results in the pre-Rule period, the results show that analysts are more likely to revise their ratings to hold and less likely to revise ratings to sell, and more likely to drop coverage of stocks in the post-Rule period. Overall, our findings suggest that the implementation of Rule 2711 will contribute to reduce analysts' optimistic stock ratings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This paper studies and qualifies the growth and accessibility of a rapid rail transit network, and characterizes the relations with urban development using a spatio-temporal modelling approach. Several measures of the network topological structure, i.e., beta index (beta), cyclomatic number (mu), alpha index (alpha) and gamma index (gamma), are selected in order to examine and quantify the overall metro network growth of the city of Guangzhou in China. The results show that the current spatial connectivity of the Guangzhou's metro network is relatively low, this stressing the need to augment the reliability of the connections between the network nodes, and to increase the number of circuits in the network. A travel-time matrix is modelled and evaluates the nodes accessibility and characterizes the spatio-temporal evolution of the metro network. The spatial interaction between the different nodes of the network, as well as nodes accessibility are analyzed and derived from a potential-based model. The extension of the metro network clearly shows a dramatic tendency of positive accessibility evolution but with regional differences. In particular, the core of the city is surrounded by areas with highest accessibility values and gradually expanding outward from the core, while the locations of transfer stations have significant influence on the variation of network time-based accessibility. Taking into account different network development scenarios, the approach reveals regional accessibility differences in the metropolitan area of the city of Guangzhou, this clearly illustrating the impact of network accessibility in urban development.

We find outside director tenure positively associated with firm acquisition/investment policy advising performance and CEO compensation monitoring performance, suggesting that advising and monitoring do not always compete for directors' time. However, tenure is not a panacea it marginally weakens financial reporting monitoring performance which is instead enhanced by outside directors' financial expertise.

Utilizing the knowledge of this mechanism and acknowledging both aspects of reflexive thought, the paper expands on three libertarian paternalistic means to foster an ethical way of impulsive consumption: strengthening willpower, reducing impulsive desires to consume, and guiding impulsive behavior in ethical directions by making salient certain self-images that favor ethical consumption.

Yet, so far this has received little attention in economics. In our research we connect a standard social psychological manipulation to activate cognitive content (a trust vs. distrust priming manipulation) to a classic paradigm from economics (a trust game). Our findings demonstrate that subliminally activating the concept of trust (vs. distrust) leads participants to judge a series of strangers as more (vs. less) trustworthy. Moreover, our research shows for the first time that such a subliminal priming manipulation shapes the subsequent sending behavior in a fictitious version of a standard economic trust game.

Small and large companies have different advantages and drawbacks with innovation, but small businesses provide the most conducive environment for entrepreneurship and innovation that are not necessarily sustained by the know-how and resources characteristic of large-scale production, but require commitment and close cooperation between company members.

The present model also provides insight into the dynamic process by which subcoalitions build up into majority coalitions and, in addition, identifies kingmakers and leaders on the natural courts.

Using data from the Community Innovation Survey on 2,087 German small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we observe significant disparities at each stage of the innovation process. Whereas family SMEs have a higher propensity to invest in innovation at all, conditional on investing in innovation, these companies do so less intensively than their non-family counterparts. Family SMEs further tend to outperform non-family SMEs in terms of process innovation outcomes when controlling for innovation investment. Given the level of product and process innovation, however, family SMEs underperform regarding labor productivity in comparison to non-family SMEs. These findings complement previous empirical research by illustrating how the presence of a dominant family relates to innovation inputs and outputs of SMEs in Europe's largest economy and its innovative SME sector.","[Classen, Nicolas; Carree, Martin; Van Gils, Anita] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Peters, Bettina] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany",Maastricht University; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Classen, N (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",n.classen@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Peters, Bettina/0000-0002-8611-2016",,,,,80,157,185,8,158,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The previous research on the effectiveness of these interventions has revealed mixed results about whether such programs can improve the relationships of lower income couples who tend to experience lower relationship quality, lower marriage rates, and higher rates of relationship dissolution. This article draws on in-depth qualitative data collected during an 18-month ethnographic study of one federally funded relationship skills program for unmarried, low-income couples expecting a new baby. Overall, though parents found the financial management lessons included in the classes only minimally useful, if at all, they found other aspects of the program particularly useful for three main reasons: (1) classes allowed parents to focus exclusively on their couple relationships in ways they rarely did otherwise; (2) program incentives helped parents make financial ends meet that month; and (3) parents learned that the challenges they personally experienced were often endemic to the romantic and co-parenting relationships of unmarried parents who have few resources and experience more challenges that tend to undermine relationship quality, such as financial stress and relational ambiguity. Engaging with other couples around shared challenges normalized couples' relationship problems and lessened the resentment and animosity that typically characterized their partner interactions. These findings have important implications for healthy marriage and relationship policy. Program developers should avoid lessons that imply low-income, unmarried parents' spending habits and family-formation decisions are deficient. Interventions should instead encourage couples to discuss their shared challenges and minimize their tendency to individualize relational and financial strain.","Calif State Univ Fresno, Fresno, CA 93740 USA",California State University System; California State University Fresno,"Randles, JM (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fresno, 5340 N Campus Dr,M-S SS97, Fresno, CA 93740 USA.",jrandles81@gmail.com,,,,,,,54,15,21,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Firstly, to investigate the integration process within the European Union retail banking sector by analysing deposit and lending rates to the household sector during the period 2003-2011. Secondly, to assess the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis on the banking integration process, an area that is yet unexplored. An important contribution of the paper is the application of the recently developed Phillips and Sul (2007a) panel convergence methodology which has not hitherto been employed in this area. This method analyses the degree as well as the speed of convergence, identifies the presence of club formation, and measures the behaviour of each country's transition path relative to the panel average. The empirical results point to the presence of convergence in all deposit and lending rates to the household sector up to 2007. In sharp contrast, the null of convergence is rejected in all deposit and credit markets after the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. These results show that the global crisis has had a detrimental effect on the banking integration process. We find some convergence in a few sub-clusters of countries but the rate of convergence is typically slow and several countries are identified as diverging altogether. In addition, we find that the credit market, in general, is far more heterogeneous than the savings market. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The theoretical literature has treated these two channels separately, with natural resources affecting growth either through human capital or corruption. In this article, we argue that education and corruption are jointly determined and depend on the endowment of natural resources. Natural resources affect the incentives to invest in education and rent seeking that in turn affect growth. Whether natural resources stimulate growth or induce a poverty-trap crucially depends on inequality in access to education and political participation, as well as on the cost of political participation. For lower inequality and higher cost of political participation, a high-growth and a poverty-trap equilibrium coexist even with abundant natural resources.","Lahore Sch Econ, Lahore, Pakistan",Lahore School of Economics,"Wadho, WA (通讯作者)，Lahore Sch Econ, Intersect Main Blvd Phase 6,DHA & Burki Rd, Lahore, Pakistan.",w.wadho@lahoreschool.edu.pk,"Wadho, Waqar/R-6487-2019","Wadho, Waqar/0000-0002-6972-5697",,,,,33,14,17,0,35,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

We used the multifactorial regression and the Wald significance test to demonstrate that organisations operating in countries characterised by low power distance, individualism, femininity, tolerance of unknown and long-term orientation pay more attention to responsible corporate behaviour towards customers. The study highlights theoretical considerations that support the influence of the national cultural framework on responsible corporate behaviour towards consumers. The methodology for calculating the index of responsible corporate behaviour towards consumers can become a basis of analysis of responsible corporate behaviour towards local consumers or other stakeholders.","[Ganescu, Cristina; Gangone, Andreea; Asandei, Mihaela] Constantin Brancoveanu Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania",Constantin Brancoveanu University,"Ganescu, C (通讯作者)，Constantin Brancoveanu Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania.",cristina_ganescu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,45,9,10,2,52,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,351,366,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300024,0

We consider different wage setting systems and compare wages, the unemployment rate, and income per capita in the long-run at firm, sector, and national (centralized) levels. The aim of this paper is to determine under which conditions, the inverted-U hypothesis between unemployment and the degree of centralization of wage bargaining, reported by Calmfors and Driffill [Economic Policy, 6, 14-61, 1988], is confirmed. Our analysis shows that a high degree of market power normally produces the inverted-U shape for unemployment. Moreover, we also illustrate that this inverted-U shape can be reversed when the ability of trade unions to internalize the provision of social services is great enough at sector level.","[Garcia, Jose Ramon] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Sorolla, Valeri] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",University of Valencia; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"García, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",,"Sorolla, Valeri/K-1169-2017; Garcia-Martinez, Jose Ramon/L-5755-2014","Sorolla, Valeri/0000-0002-2197-5232; Garcia-Martinez, Jose Ramon/0000-0002-1228-0228",,,,,47,0,0,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

One can say that it is not yet well understood how privacy concerns and trust influence social interactions between consumers within social networking sites. That is why, this article presents an exploratory study of perceptions of trust and privacy concern, along with willingness to share information and develop new relationships within two of the most popular social networking sites in Romania, Facebook and LinkedIn. The research shows that organizations must assume greater responsibility in ensuring consumers' safety who sometime neglect protecting their personal information, otherwise confidential. In this respect, the application of ISO 26000 standard recommendations by organizations would allow them to pass from just good intentions towards consumers to good actions, so that they are truly protected. The information was gathered with the help of an online questionnaire, administered to people over 18 years old. It is a very useful and needed tool for Romanian companies, as it presents the users' point of view, allowing them to find the best and most ethical way to do social data mining or use consumers' private information, disclosed on such sites. It is our strong belief that sometimes companies have to play an active part in helping users protect themselves from actually disclosing too much personal information on social networking sites. The paper begins with a summary of relevant research related to social networking sites. Then, the online survey methodology is described and the results presented, followed by limitations and conclusions.","[Ionescu, Andreea; Anghel, Laurentiu-Dan; Jinga, Gheorghe] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Anghel, LD (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",langhel@ase.ro,"Anghel, Laurentiu Dan V/E-6918-2013; Anghel, Laurentiu-Dan V/P-1592-2016; Ionescu, Andreea S.I./B-6068-2016; Pachitanu, Andreea/U-4385-2017",,,,,,33,3,3,0,41,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,273,288,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300019,0

We find that an increase of labor wage and a decrease of capital cost are associated with an improvement in technical efficiency. The levy rates of air pollution improve technical efficiency but pollution quantity control targets have no statistically significant effect on technical efficiency. On the other hand, technical efficiency, the effective levy rates, pollution quantity control targets and capital cost have a negative effect but wage has a positive effect on pollution intensity.

However, prevailing models of travel choice and travel behaviour tend to overemphasise the impact and importance of information and the individualistic perspective. The issue of choice and travel planning in everyday life situations, and how information is used and acted on in these processes, was examined in a qualitative study in Stockholm, Sweden. Practice Theory was used as the theoretical framework for the study. Interviews were supplemented with an explorative diary and photo assignment to bring unreflected choices and actions of planning travel to the conscious level. The results showed that travel planning involves the immediate situation where planning and decisions are made, but also aspirations, cognitive/time/material limitations, social norms and social relations that extend widely in time and space. Definitions of travel planning and travel information based on the situated practices of planning are suggested. In the muddle of everyday life, travel planning takes place in the brief moments where circumstances at different levels - time, place, the social realm - interact and are considered or directly acted upon. In the development of new ICT-based travel information services, the role of technology in changing normal practices should be considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It finds that individuals pursue poverty motives but act selfishly if not restrained. Egalitarianism and favoritism are not as pronounced as critics suggest. Even if individual and group allocations vary considerably, this does not result in individuals' dissatisfaction.

Dhaka is a rapidly urbanising megacity in one of the world's most densely populated and poorest countries. Almost 30% of its more than 14 million population lives in slums characterised by tenure insecurity and evictions, and controlled by ganglords who charge exorbitant rates for basic services. Such a situation deters investments for improving living conditions. Poor quality housing is typical and basic public are non-existent or very limited. A combination of human and natural factors results in various urban hazards with serious impacts on the poor. Flooding and water-logging due to poor drainage are widespread; windstorms and urban fires cause havoc in slums because of the weak construction of houses; unplanned urbanisation and sub-standard building practices pose great risk in the event of a major earthquake; Bangladesh is severely threatened by climate change and erratic weather, increased flooding and temperature rise are evident. Bangladesh has a large number of development agencies, but most do not engage in cities. The Urban Partnerships for Poverty Reduction (UPPR) program is unique and is a very large program targeted for 3 million slum dwellers in 30 cities including Dhaka; WaterAid Bangladesh addresses water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) in slums; the Coalition for the Urban Poor (CUP) is a network of more than 40 NGOs and advocates for the rights of slum dwellers, and supports community-based organisations in slum settlements. The challenges of building resilience in slums are many, but there are also opportunities. Particularly recent government policies on urban development and climate change, as well as an emerging interest among agencies to address urban issues, offer potential for advocacy for building resilience in urban slums.

Methodology - Given the nature of our dataset, the methodology is based on dynamic panel time-series analysis. Findings - The results suggest that income growth has played a progressive role in reducing inequality during the period. Moreover, the results suggest that this negative relationship is stronger in the 1990s and early 2000s, a period in which the continent achieved macroeconomic stabilization, political consolidation, and much improved economic performance. On the contrary, during the 1980s (the so-called lost decade), the negative income growth experienced by the continent at the time has hit the poor the hardest (the poor usually are the ones to lose their jobs first in recessions), which has consequently led to an increase in inequality. Practical implications - All in all, we suggest that consistent growth, and all that it encompasses, is an important equalizer that affects the poorer progressively and it should not be discarded as a plausible option by policy makers interested in a more equal income distribution.","Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Bittencourt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",manoel.bittencourt@up.ac.za,"Bittencourt, Manoel/Y-7530-2019","Bittencourt, Manoel/0000-0001-7460-8842",,,,,38,0,0,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78350-756-6; 978-1-78350-755-9,INT SYMP EC,,,2014,23.0,,,,,,37,58,,10.1108/S1571-038620140000023002,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358526100002,0

Based on this research the authors draw a number of conclusions regarding the chances of conclusion of free trade area agreements and the impact of each of these three areas on the competitivity of European Union in the world economy. At the same time the authors conclude that the current trend towards free trade agreements does not imply a reorientation from multilateralism to bilateralism in the regulation of international trade but an operational solution to the new context determined by the cumulated effects of the failure of Doha Round negotiations and the economic crisis.

This study was conducted by collecting primary data through interviews of academics in four Australian universities. The findings reveal that academics are not in favour of making tacit knowledge mandatory and also indicated an aversion towards the inclusion of tacit knowledge transfer as a key performance indicator especially because it can be difficult to measure. Based on the findings, it is recommended universities focus on buttressing encouragement and motivation, developing mentoring programs, providing recognition and collaboration opportunities to entice academics to share tacit knowledge without necessarily making it a key performance indicator.

The general system of social and economic indicators is designed and established in the initial phase from a specific sub-sector approach and includes subtypes of indicators such as: national accounts and finance, population and social conditions, industry, trade and services, agriculture, forestry and fishing; international trade, transport, environment and energy, science and technology, etc. Although this system of indicators can be accessed as such, its use in practice faces a number of difficulties, from at least two points of view: too many indicators and data are available at very different periods (terms). As a result, efforts were focused on the creation and development of (sub) integrated systems consisting of a limited number of indicators, in order to evaluate and monitor different areas and specific policies, ensuring their consistency, coherence and connection. Thus, by grouping and regrouping sector indicators there are obtained functional integrated categories of interconnected indicators, able to provide a clear picture on the economy, on the entire society, and to provide a reliable and flexible tool for the evaluation, analysis and the monitoring of the registered developments.

Specifically in the comparative approach procedure were included diagnostic procedures based on statistical approach, mainly because of the type of good that is significantly heterogeneous and inclusion of vector calculus. Main task is to improve the process of selecting the basic sample data into sample set, ie qualitative analysis. It is very necessary, because in the event of poor performance of this step arises incorrect assumption when processing the sample data. This step should be improved by including cluster analysis (CLU), where each entity in the calculation with their variables, ie as a cross-sectional data. Values of each variable and their combination for one observing will indicate the degree of heterogeneity of the observing. Another way could be to use Hotelling T-2 control chart.

The two villages are on different development paths: one based on agricultural diversification and local non-agricultural employment, the other dependent on migration to distant labour markets. They therefore connect with India's overall growth in different ways. Neither development model delivers clearly superior outcomes in terms of incomes, nor are they exhausted, but the long-term sustainability of a migration-led model remains debatable.","[Datta, Amrita; Rodgers, Gerry; Rodgers, Janine; Singh, B.

Our results show that farmers certified in producer-managed groups derive significant benefits from certification.

Regarding the determinants of continued compliance, we find that support from exporters and the scale of the farming operation are the most important factors influencing the renewal of the GlobalGAP certificate.","[Holzapfel, Sarah; Wollni, Meike] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Holzapfel, S (通讯作者)，Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit DIE, German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",Sarah.Holzapfel@die-gdi.de,,"Wollni, Meike/0000-0002-8460-7840",,,,,44,33,35,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In the paper the macro level cross country data characterizing labour market in 2007 and 2012 are used. The cluster analysis is applied to obtain groups of countries with similar labour market indicators. In the following step the labour taxation is compared within those groups. To represent labour taxation four indicators are used - implicit tax rate and ratio of personal taxation to GDP as possibilities how to measure wage taxation; ratio of social security contribution to GDP to measure non-wage labour burden; and one alternative indicator - unemployment trap - is presented. The results suggest that labour markets characterised by similar labour market performance did not have alike taxation in 2007 and in the case of the most indicators the groups are more heterogeneous than EU member countries as a whole.

The technique of segmenting a market also reveals profit opportunities and strategic matter for new competitors to challenge established market leaders. As a market develops, new segments open up and older ones tend to decline. So, achieving a reliable and valid approach to segment the market for any activity-based markets is necessary. This study aims to understand a good approach to segment the market namely benefit segmentation based on customer lifetime value. Benefit segmentation is an approach to market segmentation whereby it is possible to identify market segments by causal factors rather than descriptive factors. On the other hand a valuable tool for measuring the real values of customers is customer lifetime value or CLV. The more a marketing paradigm evolves, the more long-term relationship with customers gains its importance. CLV aims to measure a just real value of customers of special part of market. Thus CLV is a basic valuable tool to understanding the benefits segmentation strategy. This paper aims to propose a framework to measure the value of each segment of customers based on the CLV calculation with focus on banking sector. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In particular, instead of relying on a single static measure of long memory, we explored time-varying long memory features over time to assess changes in market efficiency by analyzing the returns and volatility of the markets. Furthermore, considering a time-varying rolling approach, we estimated values of the Hurst exponent for time windows with 1,000 observations (about 4 years of data) in each window. The estimation results indicated that both the returns and the volatility series possessed strong long memory features and that the degree of the long memory features changed over time. Additionally, the Hurst exponent showed an upward trend during the 1997 Asian currency crisis and 2008 global financial crisis, indicating that exchange rate markets became inefficient and predictable during the financial crisis.

However, these groups both cover e.g. a part of government spending on R&D, which may significantly distort results and conclusions of the analyses. Therefore we suggest distinguishing rather between spending on collective and individual services in empirical analyses.

Therefore it's complex regal regulation is very important for the unambiguous definition of the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. By the contract for work, the contractor undertakes to perform certain work and the employer undertakes to pay the price for its performance. Work as defined by the law manufacture specified products (provided the manufacture does not fall under the notion of a purchase contract), the maintenance, repair or modification of certain items or the result of other activities. Fabrication, repair or modification of buildings or parts thereof shall be always covered by contracts for work. The new legislation, given by the Civil Code, Law No. 89/2012 Coll. and effective from 1 January 2014, replaced the regulation of the contract for work, as contained in the abolished Civil Code of 1964, as well as the in the Czech Commercial Code of 1991 that was also cancelled by the new Civil Code of 2012. The paper describes the most important provisions of the new shape the of contract for work. The basis for the draft new legislation was taken from the former regulation of this contract by the Commercial Code and having taken regard to certain legal regulations by other countries, because the concept of contract work as contained in the former Civil Code was strongly influenced by its original design from 1964 and the by patterns of the Civil Code of 1950. In some respect certain provisions of former Code of International Trade were also take into account, the normative structure of which was borrowed by the later Commercial Code. The new Civil Code regulation, however, should be more precise and clearer than the previous arrangements. In the interest of clarity, the draft legislation is structured so that the introductory rules cover contracts for work in general and thereafter follow rules for deviation from the price of the work according to the agreed budget, for the work carried out on real estate and works concerning intangible assets.

The role of non-bank financial intermediaries also known as shadow banking system is presented.

It makes it possible to express the effect of change in the quantity of inputs as well as the effect of the productivity of inputs (i.e. technological changes) on the change of GDP for all possible typologies of input/output changes. Unlike the growth accounting, this method is universal and also accurate; it may be applied not only to small growth rates. Dynamic parameters of intensity and extensity could be delivered as the output of the method. The first one captures the effect of change in the summary productivity of factors, while the latter captures changes in the input quantity. The dynamic parameters were calculated for the development of GDP in the United States and China for a period of fifty years (1960-2011). In case of the United States, it was also calculated how the development of labor and the development of capital contribute to the change in inputs. The calculated values verify that the method can reliably capture significant changes that took place in the given countries in individual years. The growth rate of the summary productivity of factors calculated on the basis of our method only differs slightly from the growth rate of the summary productivity of factors calculated on the basis of growth accounting. For all the aforementioned reasons, the method appears to be a suitable instrument for analyzing the GDP development.","[Mihola, Jiri; Wawrosz, Petr] Univ Finance & Adm, Fac Econ Sci, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Mihola, J (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Fac Econ Sci, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic.",jiri.mihola@quick.cz; wawrosz@mail.vsfs.cz,"Wawrosz, Petr/GSN-1037-2022","Wawrosz, Petr/0000-0001-8283-4428",,,,,41,8,8,0,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Fulfilling the culture functions depends on the local actors' ability to manage the negative effects of globalisation and world economic crisis on urban development, as well as the existing tensions in towns and cities. Also, culture territorialisation takes place along with territory resizing - local entities are stimulated to set vanguard cultural policies and assume the construction, the development, the maintenance and the management of cultural facilities. The territory reform is one aspect of urban regeneration, which implies a set of strategies aiming at: renewing the economic base of towns and cities, redefining their image, rehabilitating city equipment, achieving the reconversion of deserted areas, raising the quality of urban dwellers' life, ensuring their integration into a multifunctional context. The paper clarifies these aspects by research and a case study in the national domain. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Secondly, households are motivated by increase of living standards, by an afford to do so and by an increase of the real wage. Thirdly, there were other motivations for increase of indebtedness such as a shift to owner-occupied housing, effective marketing of financial intermediaries and easy availability of money. The focus is on insufficient awareness of the rational strategies of households' financial management and the idea of rational re-education of people.

It is a new item of small steps adopted by European leaders over the last quarter's towards making Political Union. Immediate implications of this instrument of economic policy in the European Union are obvious: European states will have to implement a series of structural reforms in order to reduce structural component of the deficit below the level specified in the new Treaty. Such measures will certainly target areas where significant structural imbalances persist, of which I mention social state.

If the information asymmetry between the firm and the investors is very high, all investors are largely uninformed, so information asymmetry between investors should be low. At the other extreme, if all investors are fully informed about the firm, again the information asymmetry between investors should be low.

The main reason for this is due to Grid resources are geographically distributed across the world through a wide area network under various virtual organizations. To address the issue, a significant amount of effort has been made by proposing various decentralized overlay algorithms with semantic solutions. Current Grid literature reveals that when semantic features are added into discovery services, the probability of finding resources is enhanced. However, most of the existing decentralized resource discovery models utilize a domain-based semantic ontology with First Come First Serve (FCFS) basis scheduling for allocating of Grid resources that can cause job-rejection at run time. To overcome these issues and enhance the application performance, we propose an UPSARS (Unification of Proximity and Semantic similarity for Appropriate Resource Selection) algorithm in a decentralized resource discovery model by using a sub-domain ontology structure for Grid computing environments. The purpose of this unification is to get optimized resources for user jobs so that Grid brokers could select optimum resources in terms of proximity with high semantic relevancy. The proposed algorithm considers both semantic and proximity criteria and selects the nearby nodes resources. We design and implement the model using the GridSim and the FreePastry simulation & modeling toolkits. The experimental results provide promising outcomes to enhance resource allocation performance.","[Shaikh, Abdul Khalique] Artificial Intelligence Lab MIMOS Berhad TPM Mala, Bukit Jalil, Malaysia; [Alhashmi, Saadat M.] Abu Dhabi Univ, Coll Engn & Comp Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Parthiban, Rajendran] Monash Univ, Sch Engn, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia",MIMOS Berhad; Abu Dhabi University; Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Shaikh, AK (通讯作者)，Artificial Intelligence Lab MIMOS Berhad TPM Mala, Bukit Jalil, Malaysia.",shaikhned@yahoo.com; saadat.alhashmi@adu.ac.ae; rajendran.parthiban@monash.edu,"Khalique, Dr Shaikh/AAV-1208-2021; Parthiban, R/A-4999-2008","Parthiban, R/0000-0003-0983-9796; Alhashmi, Saadat M./0000-0003-4044-9315",,,,,22,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1400,1412,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300144,0

Improperly designed and applied motivation programs can have a negative impact on employees, who are not motivated to achieve maximum performance. The paper will also deal with the problems of employee motivation and the motivation programs in a selected industrial company. The motivation structure analysis will be based on the general knowledge of the theory of motivation, together with the analysis of the employees' motivation profiles. The fundamental tool used in this process is a cluster analysis and its usage in the creation of motivation programs. The analysis of motivation factors and their order will be made according to the level of importance they have for the employees, which will be assessed by the Questionnaire Method. The Cluster Analysis will be used due to the possibility of creating various types of motivation programs. The result will be a proposal for the creation of methodological unified motivation programs by using multi-factor statistical analysis (cluster analysis). On the basis of the results obtained from our analysis, we will be able to determine if it is possible to develop a unified motivation program for employees within a selected industrial company.

We argue and provide evidence that the results the authors ascribe to SAB 102 are primarily explained by consumer loan charge-offs dominating banks' loan charge-offs and, thus, allowances for loan losses in the post-SAB 102/pre-financial crisis period. This period coincided with a real estate and general macroeconomic boom in which other loan types experienced very low charge-offs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using data obtained from a recent large-scale survey conducted in 36 countries, we find that individuals who like situations in which they compete with others are more likely to have a preference for being self-employed (latent entrepreneurs) and are also more likely to take steps to start new businesses (nascent entrepreneurs). Moreover, our results suggest that women are less competitively inclined than men in almost all countries in our sample and are also less willing to take risks. The results of a decomposition analysis suggest that gender differences in competitiveness and risk taking contribute significantly to the gender gap in latent and nascent entrepreneurship. Gender differences in competitiveness seem to be relevant, especially for the gender gap in nascent entrepreneurship.","[Boente, Werner; Piegeler, Monika] Univ Wuppertal, Jackstadt Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat Res, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany; [Boente, Werner] Univ Wuppertal, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany",University of Wuppertal; University of Wuppertal,"Bönte, W (通讯作者)，Univ Wuppertal, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Gaussstr 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany.",boente@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de,,"Bonte, Werner/0000-0002-2923-5423",,,,,113,93,115,13,118,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In accordance with the Pavitt-Miozzo-Soete taxonomy, we consider eight industry categories, which reflect the characteristics of firms' innovation patterns and, ultimately, the knowledge inputs that firms require. Using data on new firm creation in Italian provinces (i.e., at the NUTS3 level), we estimate negative binomial regression models separately for each industry category to relate new firm creation to the scientific specialization in basic sciences, applied sciences and engineering, and social sciences and humanities of neighboring universities. We find that universities specialized in applied sciences and engineering have a broad positive effect on new firm creation in a given province, this effect being especially strong in service industries. Conversely, the positive effect of university specialization in basic sciences is confined to new firm creation in science-based manufacturing industries, even if this effect is of large magnitude. Universities specialized in social sciences and humanities have no effect on new firm creation at the local level whatever industry category is considered.","[Bonaccorsi, Andrea] Natl Agcy Evaluat Univ & Res Inst, Pisa, Italy; [Colombo, Massimo G.; Rossi-Lamastra, Cristina] Politecn Milan, DIG, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Guerini, Massimiliano] Univ Pisa, DESTEC, Pisa, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Pisa,"Guerini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, DESTEC, Pisa, Italy.",a.bonaccorsi@gmail.com; massimo.colombo@polimi.it; massimiliano.guerini@polimi.it; cristina1.rossi@polimi.it,"Guerini, Massimiliano/E-9361-2017","Guerini, Massimiliano/0000-0003-2812-0779; Colombo, Massimo G./0000-0003-0373-1565",,,,,82,71,74,2,65,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Size effects of volatility spillovers for firm performance and exchange rates in tourism,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Tourism; Size effects; Small-firm effects; Financial performance; Spillover effects; MGARCH; VARMA; BERK,ASYMPTOTIC THEORY,"This paper examines the size effects of volatility spillovers for firm performance and exchange rates with asymmetry in the Taiwan tourism industry. The analysis is based on two conditional multivariate models, BEKK-AGARCH and VARMA-AGARCH, in the volatility specification. Daily data from 1 July 2008 to 29 June 2012 for 999 firms are used, which covers the Global Financial Crisis. The empirical findings indicate that there are size effects on volatility spillovers from the exchange rate to firm performance. Specifically, the risk for firm size has different effects from the three leading tourism sources to Taiwan, namely USA, Japan, and China. Furthermore, all the return series reveal quite high volatility spillovers (at over 60%) with a one-period lag. The empirical results show a negative correlation between exchange rate returns and stock returns. However, the asymmetric effect of the shock is ambiguous, owing to conflicts in the significance and signs of the asymmetry effect in the two estimated multivariate GARCH models. The empirical findings provide financial managers with a better understanding of how firm size is related to financial performance, risk and portfolio management strategies that can be used in practice.

Low-cost travel, especially resulting from transportation improvements since the nineteenth century, has resulted in long-distance travel and urban sprawl, bringing along negative aspects such as traffic congestion and air pollution, but also reductions in biodiversity and public health. In order to try to partly reverse this process, the supply of infrastructure and public transportation can no longer follow the demand of transportation; the supply has to steer the demand. Infrastructure and high-quality public transportation should be clustered in and between large and regional cities. Increasing travel costs for car use (e.g., road pricing) can positively affect travel distances and travel mode choice, but also long-term decisions such as the residential location choice, stimulating compact, mixed-use developments. In this paper, we focus on Flanders, Belgium, a region where mobility policies stimulated long-distance travel and limited land use regulations did not hinder urban sprawl. Increasing travel costs combined with a more active spatial planning policy and a stronger cooperation between mobility policy and spatial planning can help to decrease car use and urban sprawl, but also change the way in which people perceive travel.

This paper uses data from more than 2600 firms across 25 countries to study whether the control rights of the banks' controlling owners are associated with whether firms need special connections with banks in order to obtain loans. I find that the control rights of the controlling owners increase the need for special connections. I also find that supervisory power raises the need for special connections and intensifies the adverse effect induced by concentrated control. No evidence is found that shareholder rights protection reduces the need for special connections, nor that bank officials become less corrupted as the control rights of the controlling owners increase. The results thus indicate that an increase in the control rights of the banks' controlling owners only reduces the integrity of bank lending. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These features include the presence of sidewalks, buffers between the road and the sidewalk, street lighting, number of travel lanes and the presence of medians, traffic controls at intersections, and posted speed limits. The analysis focuses on how these features affect the severity of a pedestrian casualty once it has occurred. Other controls used in the analysis include the age of the victim, ambient lighting conditions, and whether the vehicle driver was intoxicated. Results suggest that severity of pedestrian casualties is associated with the lack of sidewalks and buffers, high-speed roads, roads with six or more lanes and a median, and lack of traffic lighting when it is dark. Speed is a critical factor in determining the severity of crash outcomes, and most road characteristics affect crash outcomes to the extent that they moderate or facilitate high speeds. Casualties are more severe when it is dark than when it is daylight. Older pedestrians tend to have more severe casualties. A key contribution of this work is the use of Google Street View imagery; however, a limitation is that the analysis cannot examine the probability of a pedestrian casualty. Implications for road safety are consistent with national efforts to make streets safer via Complete Streets policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, there is evidence in the literature of fiscal consolidation episodes producing (non-Keynesian) expansionary effects in the short run. We replicate this result for a panel of OECD countries under exogeneity of the fiscal consolidation. However, we provide some evidence that output growth might affect the fiscal tightening process so that fiscal consolidations are not exogenous to economic growth. Once we allow for feedback effects from economic growth to fiscal adjustments, we find that expansionary effects disappear and recover the typical Keynesian effect of fiscal adjustments. This finding points to the need to take these short-term negative implications into account in the design of fiscal consolidations.","[Hernandez de Cos, Pablo; Moral-Benito, Enrique] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana,"de Cos, PH (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain.",pablo.hernandez_de_cos@bde.es; enrique.moral@gmail.com,,,ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,33,20,22,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Data for 59 developing countries over 1971-2003 are analysed to explore the trade-off and highlight the heterogeneous nature of the relationship between aid and output. We show that output, aid and investment comprise a cointegrated relation, and derive country specific estimates of the long run association between aid and output. These aid-output coefficients are, on average, negative but smaller than the positive investment-output coefficients. Insofar as aid is used to finance investment, the overall effect on output may therefore be positive. We also show that cross-country differences in the estimated long run aid-output coefficients can be explained mainly by cross-country differences in law and order, religious tensions and government size.","[Herzer, Dierk] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Hamburg, Germany; [Morrissey, Oliver] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Helmut Schmidt University; University of Nottingham,"Morrissey, O (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",oliver.morrissey@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Herzer, Dierk/0000-0002-5310-0385",,,,,32,24,25,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

As an alternative to randomized respondent-based sampling, choice-based onsite sampling can provide information on actual choices made by a subset of the population where participation has a low incidence. While the literature has shown that under specific restrictions the estimation of choice models from onsite sampling data yields unbiased fixed parameter estimates for the conditional logit model, this result does not carry over to estimation of the random parameter logit model. We propose an estimator for the unbiased estimation of the random parameter model using choice-based data; our estimator uses weights based on information about the level of sampling effort. An empirical application of the standard and weighted discrete choice RUM models to onsite sample data on recreational fishing illustrates the advantages of the proposed estimator. The estimation results indicate the compensating variation associated with an decrease, or increase, of 50 % in expected catch rates for a recreational shoreline sportfishing trip to a man-made structure in southern California is or per trip, respectively.","[Kuriyama, Koichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Div Nat Resource Econ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Hilger, James] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Resource Div, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hanemann, Michael] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Kyoto University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Hilger, J (通讯作者)，Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Resource Div, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",james.hilger@noaa.gov,"Kuriyama, Koichi/AAQ-2599-2021","Kuriyama, Koichi/0000-0003-2905-1621; Hilger, James/0000-0002-9495-3229",,,,,19,7,9,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Deficits in their knowledge prevent them from both producing correct responses and recognizing that the responses they produce are inferior to those produced by others. Krag and Ortmann (2008) offered a different account, suggesting instead that poor performers make performance estimates with no more error than top performers. Floor effects, coupled with the assumption of a backwards-J performance distribution, force their self-evaluations errors to be frequently positive in nature. Kraft' and Ortmann, however, offered no empirical data to test their signal extraction account. In three studies, we assessed their theoretical model by examining whether (1) the data producing the Dunning Kruger effect fit the statistical assumptions considered by KrajE and Ortmann necessary to produce it, and (2) to see if their framework reproduced Dunning Kruger errors in a data set that fit their statistical assumptions. We found that the KrajE Ortmann framework failed to anticipate self-evaluative misperceptions on the part of poor performers, but that it does much better at accounting for misperceptions among top performers. Paradoxically, the model suggests that Kruger and Dunning (1999) may have underestimated the accuracy of top performers, even though their account asserts such accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we examine volatility using the following factors: (i) lagged returns; (ii) lagged absolute returns; (iii) own trading volume; (iv) U.S. factors; (v) European factors; and (vi) regional (Asian) factors. Points (i) and (iii) are by and large significant, while (ii) is not. Controlling for (i), (ii) and (iii), we find evidence that the volatility of European markets has spillovers on to both the Taiwan and Tokyo markets, mild evidence that the volatility of the U.S. market has spillovers on to the Hong Kong market, but there are no spillovers from the European or U.S. markets on to the Shanghai market.

This study examines the effect of time framing on respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) for car safety. We explore how WTP per unit risk reduction depends on the time period over which respondents pay and face reduced risk in a theoretical model and by using data from a Swedish contingent valuation survey. Our theoretical model predicts the effect to be nontrivial in many scenarios used in empirical applications. In our empirical analysis we examine the sensitivity of WTP to an annual and a monthly scenario. Our theoretical model predicts the effect from the time framing to be negligible, but the empirical estimates from the annual scenario are about 70 % higher than estimates from the monthly scenario.","[Andersson, Henrik] CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, UT1C, LERNA, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Hammitt, James K.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Risk Anal, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hammitt, James K.] INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ, LERNA, F-31931 Toulouse, France; [Lindberg, Gunnar] VTI, Dept Transport Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sundstrom, Kristian] AgriFood Econ Ctr, Lund, Sweden",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Harvard University; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Andersson, H (通讯作者)，CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, UT1C, LERNA, 21 All Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France.",henrik.andersson@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,74,14,14,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In the first step, we explore the pair-wise Granger-causal relationship between yields, both for the whole sample and for changing subsamples of the data, in order to capture the possible time-varying causal relationship. This approach allows us to detect episodes of significant increase in Granger-causality between yields on bonds issued by different countries. In the second step, we study the determinants of these episodes, analyzing the role played by different factors, paying special attention to instruments that capture the total national debt (domestic and foreign) in each country.

In contrast to the standard risk-seeking intuition, even with a constant-return-to-scale alpha-generating strategy, a risk-neutral manager becomes endogenously risk-averse and decreases leverage following poor performance to increase the fund's survival likelihood. Our calibration suggests that management fees are the majority of the total compensation. Money flows, managerial restart options, and management ownership increase the importance of high-water-mark-based incentive fees but management fees remain the majority. Investors' valuation of fees are highly sensitive to their assessments of the manager's skill. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The implementation error is the difference between the nowcast, published toward the end of the year of budget implementation, and the planned budget, while the revision error is the difference between the final figure and the nowcast. The split takes account of differences in reporting incentives at the different budgeting stages. The predictive content of fiscal plans is important, because it determines the reliability of the budget, while that of the nowcasts is important also because these figures are an input for the next budget and may contain important signals about the fiscal stance. Implementation and revision errors may arise for political and strategic reasons. Our results suggest that an improvement in the quality of institutions, whether measured by the tightness of national fiscal rules, the medium-term budgetary framework or budgetary transparency, increases the quality of budgetary reporting at both the planning and the nowcast stage. This supports the recently adopted requirements on national fiscal frameworks. It also strengthens the case for a close monitoring by the European Commission of national budgeting.

In this context, we discuss which is the most suitable risk measurement for the affiliates to the pension system. Different life-cycle investment strategies are evaluated under this measure for different types of workers. We point out the importance of designing well-suited default investment options in light of the economic behavior of members, characterized by low financial knowledge, inertia and myopia in decision-making. We calibrate a pension risk model for the Chilean economy, including measures of life-cycle income, human capital risk, investment and annuitization risks. Our results suggest that affiliates can gain (loss) around 0.85 percentage points in terms of average replacement rates in return for an increase (decrease) of 1 percentage point in risk, measured as standard deviation of replacement rates. Using a stochastic dominance analysis, we find that there are no dominated strategies when subsidies from the Solidarity Pillar are excluded. When the Solidarity Pillar is considered, the most appropriate investment strategies for affiliates that receive these subsidies are concentrated on the riskier funds. However, this also means that there could be increased pressure on Government spending in order to grant additional benefits to affiliates. Our model has a wide range of practical applications that go from informing affiliates about the degree of uncertainty associated to their expected replacement rate to a guide to evaluate how different investment strategies affect the expected values of affiliates' pensions and their associated risk.","[Villatoro, Felix] Adolfo Ibanez Univ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,,sberstein@spensiones.cl; ofuentes@spensiones.cl; felix.villatoro@uai.cl,,,,,,,18,14,15,1,37,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

We study the existence of interdependencies between boundary decisions using a unique database that includes detailed organizational information on 59% of the construction projects undertaken in the Chilean housing sector between the years 2005 and 2009. Specifically, we show that integration between design and construction activities increases the likelihood of integration between ownership/development and construction activities (and vice versa). This result is of a large magnitude, supporting the view that boundary choices need to be studied in relation to each other. A careful identification strategy also allows us to shed light on the mechanisms that likely drive this interdependency: a coordination effect, a transaction hazard effect, and a production effect. The latter is shown to be the most important mechanism at work, suggesting that boundary choice complementarity is primarily motivated by the need to align investment incentives for the joint development of capabilities.","[Brahm, Francisco; Tarzijan, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Tarziján, J (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",fbrahm@uc.cl; jtarzija@uc.cl,"Brahm, Francisco/GSI-5397-2022",,,,,,117,6,6,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

When we use data from the Current Population Survey for 1995-2008 and add the value of employer- and government-provided health insurance coverage, not only does it increase the upward trend in the level of resources controlled by Americans, but also reduces the level of inequality in these resources and its upward trend. We then provide a highly stylized example of this broader income measure's value in capturing the impact of two key provisions of the Affordable Care Act of 2010an expansion in Medicaid and the provision of subsidies to lower-income families for purchasing private coverage on state-run exchanges. Even though these incremental expansions build on existing systems of government-provided health insurance, we find that the vast majority of the benefits would still accrue to the bottom three deciles of the income distribution when we include the value of employer- and government-provided health insurance in our expanded yearly income measure.

The use of the latter as the basis of integration analysis means that we test market participants' expectations and not the actual price fluctuations. The empirical analysis, which includes all publicly available implied volatility indices, employs the dynamic conditional correlation model of Engle (2002) and its findings suggest that there is significant integration of investors' expectations about future uncertainty. Furthermore, by accounting for the dynamic volatility of implied volatility inter-dependencies, we are able to reveal possible shifts in conditional correlations of market expectations over time. More specifically, our findings show a slight increase in the conditional correlations for all the volatility indices under review over the years and prove that in periods of turbulence in the financial markets the conditional correlations across implied volatility indices increase.","[Siriopoulos, Costas] Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm, Rion 26500, Greece; [Fassas, Athanasios] Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece",University of Patras; University of Macedonia,"Fassas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, 156 Egnatia St, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",siriopoulos@upatras.gr; afassas@uom.gr,"Fassas, Athanasios P./AAS-8514-2020","Fassas, Athanasios P./0000-0002-4566-2257",,,,,44,12,13,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

However, from a marketing perspective these attractive opportunities might have a negative side effect, as they decrease subsequent sales to the consumers who missed them. In this review article we discuss how the inability to regulate the pain of missed opportunities might lead to this so-called inaction inertia effect. We argue that deficiencies in self-regulation may be explained on the basis of a combination of contextual and personality factors. We present literature on contextual factors that facilitate regulation (decoupling factors), and action orientation, an individual characteristic that enhances regulation. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of these results for the marketing and consumer behavior literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we show that this relationship is sensitive to the methodology through which central bank independence indices are constructed. We stress the importance of employing dynamic central bank independence indices in two ways. First, we perform unit root tests with structural breaks to verify if the implementation of central bank reforms represents a structural break for the inflation rate dynamics. Second, we implement a panel data analysis. We find evidence that legislative reforms that modify the degree of independence of a central bank have a strong impact on the inflation rate dynamics. Moreover, underlying the importance of employing dynamic central bank independence indices, we confirm the negative relationship between the latter and inflation for a sample of 10 OECD countries.

For typical yield curves and macro-variables studied in this literature, the estimated joint distribution within a canonical MTSM is nearly identical to the estimate from an economic-model-free factor vector-autoregression (factor-VAR), even when measurement errors are large. It follows that a canonical MTSM offers no new insights into economic questions regarding the historical distribution of the macro risk factors and yields, over and above what is learned from a factor-VAR These results are rotation-invariant and, therefore, apply to many of the specifications in the literature.

A survey of recent covered bond market developments and research,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Covered bond; Cover pool; Securitization product; Bond finance; Yield spread,,"This article is a survey of the covered bond market with a focus on recent developments in the U.S. Covered bonds are debt obligations secured by a pool of assets, usually consisting of residential mortgages or other public debt. The covered bond asset pool is ring-fenced, dynamically managed, and remains on the balance sheet of the issuer. The issuer replaces non-performing assets and maintains a minimum overcollateralization level. U.S. lawmakers, regulators, and financial institutions are currently working toward jump-starting a market for U.S. issued covered bonds. Recent academic research has focused on the determinants of covered bond spreads and whether these instruments can become an alternative source of mortgage financing in the U.S. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A cross-country analysis,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bank regulation; Internal governance; Board independence,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; DIRECTORS; DETERMINANTS; SIZE; OWNERSHIP; MARKET; COMPENSATION; SHAREHOLDERS; INFORMATION,"Based on the hand-collected board structure data of 277 listed banks across 55 countries, and the bank regulation and supervision database compiled by the World Bank, this paper provides the first cross-country assessment of the impacts of bank regulations on board independence of banks. In line with Beck et al. (2006), we examine the effects of two types of regulation policies, the first involving the empowerment of supervisory agencies to monitor and discipline banks directly, and the second focusing on encouraging private monitoring of banks through requiring disclosure of more accurate and complete information. We find that empowering official supervisory agencies to discipline banks directly reduces board independence, but encouraging private sector monitoring of banks increases it. The findings suggest that the first type of regulations tends to crowd out the internal governance of banks, while the second crowds in it. We also find that the legal system with better investor rights protection and better contracts enforcement not only increases board independence but also enhances the crowding in effect of promoting private monitoring and decreases the crowding out effect of direct official supervision on board independence.

By analyzing data on current and potential catch and computing the potential catch losses from the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of SIDS, we find that, collectively, SIDS have currently overfished their waters to the extent that their current catch is just under 50 per cent of the maximum catch potential. This catch loss results in direct and indirect food security impacts in terms of losses in healthy, varied and nutrient-rich food, revenues, incomes and economic impacts in SIDS. Our results also demonstrate that capacity-enhancing subsidies contribute to overfishing while the effect of good subsidies is unclear and needs further analysis.","[Sumaila, U.

Since each stresses the resource base, albeit in different ways, we argue that limits on tourist pressure will be as important as limits on allowable fish catches in the future.

We hypothesize that SMEs with a large proportion of long-term debt maturing at the start of the crisis had difficulties to renew their loans due to the negative credit supply shock, and hence could invest less. We find a substantial variation in the maturity structure of long-term debt. Firms which at the start of the crisis had a larger part of their long-term debt maturing within the next year experienced a significantly larger drop in investments in 2009. This effect is driven by firms which are ex ante more likely to be financially constrained. Consistent with a causal effect of a credit supply shock to corporate investments, we find no effect in placebo periods without a negative credit supply shock.","[Vermoesen, Veronique; Deloof, Marc; Laveren, Eddy] Univ Antwerp, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Laveren, Eddy] Antwerp Management Sch, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp,"Deloof, M (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",marc.deloof@ua.ac.be,"Laveren, Eddy/HGE-7884-2022","Deloof, Marc/0000-0002-6314-5528",,,,,37,106,125,2,94,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We argue this to be due to the failure to focus an actual central bank independence and to take the degree of conservatism of the government and the central bank into account. In this paper, we propose a new methodology of measuring the joint degree of central bank independence and conservatism from observed central bank behaviour. After applying the method to 13 OECD countries, we find our indicator to be negatively correlated with a legal index of central bank independence, but positively correlated with the turnover rate. As the latter exclusively focuses on factual central bank independence, the remaining difference might be attributed to conservatism.","[Berlemann, Michael; Hielscher, Kai] Helmut Schmidt Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",,"Berlemann, M (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,58,3,3,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Our identification strategy exploits the fact that 33 states mandate collective bargaining while 5 states prohibited it. In states that mandate collective bargaining, we find that beginning salaries and the premium paid to experienced teachers increase with district size while the teacher-pupil ratio declines with district size. In contrast, in states that prohibit collective bargaining we find a negative relationship between district size and the premium paid to experienced teachers. District size also has a stronger positive effect on beginning salaries and a weaker negative effect on teacher-pupil ratios in states that prohibit collective bargaining. Collectively, our results suggest that more powerful unions bargain for more generous returns to teacher seniority at the expense of staffing ratios and base salaries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although the provision of information via energy audits is frequently asserted to be an effective means for governments to encourage the implementation of efficiency-enhancing renovations, empirical support for this assertion is tenuous at best. Apart from endogeneity issues with respect to receiving an audit, two other factors have complicated attempts to measure their effect: First, the nature of the information provided by the audit is typically unobserved, and, second, the response to this information may vary over households. Using household data from Germany, we address both sources of heterogeneity by estimating a random-parameter model of four retrofitting alternatives. In addition to confirming the importance of costs and savings as determinants of renovation choices, our results suggest that the effects of consultancy vary substantially across households, with some households responding negatively to the provision of information.","[Frondel, Manuel; Vance, Colin] Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Frondel, Manuel] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Vance, Colin] Univ Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ruhr University Bochum; University of Bremen,"Vance, C (通讯作者)，Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",frondel@rwi-essen.de; vance@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,14,26,29,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Around stock splits, retail trading correlations (RTCs) decrease with stocks in the presplit price range and increase with stocks in the post-split price range. These shifts in RTCs induce changes in return comovements. In the cross section, return comovements among low-priced stocks are amplified when retail trades are more correlated and when aggregate uncertainty amplifies behavioral biases. We find similar patterns among local stocks and when firms change their corporate headquarters. In contrast to retail trading, institutional trading attenuates return comovements.","[Kumar, Alok] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Page, Jeremy K.] Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Spalt, Oliver G.] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Miami; Brigham Young University; Tilburg University,"Kumar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",,"KUMAR, ALOK/HTT-4735-2023","Kumar, Alok/0000-0002-7350-1397",,,,,36,56,62,3,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Several recent studies in the fragmentation/distance literatures provide theoretical justification for both positive (continuity) and negative (synchronization) effects of increased time zone differences on global export flows. This paper explicitly tests for the presence of both effects using bilateral manufacturing and service trade for 20 countries and 56 partner countries from 2000 to 2008. Results consistent with the theoretical expectations are found using a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator. The general time zone difference effect on total exports is negative, suggesting the synchronization effect dominates. However, for services trade, the positive continuity effect is noted, indicating that time zones affect manufacturing and service trades differently. These results are robust to changes in the time zone, distance, and language measures, as well as alternate estimation techniques.","Marshall Univ, Coll Business, Div Finance & Econ, Huntington, WV USA",Marshall University,"Tomasik, R (通讯作者)，Marshall Univ, Coll Business, Div Finance & Econ, 1 John Marshall Dr, Huntington, WV USA.",tomasik@marshall.edu,,,,,,,19,10,10,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Meanwhile, the ex post difference, or the variance swap payoff reflecting the reward for bearing volatility risk, displays far less persistent dynamics. Using intraday data for the Standard & Poor's 500 and the volatility index (VIX), coupled with frequency domain methods, we separate the series into various components. We find that the coherence between volatility and the volatility-risk reward is the strongest at long-run frequencies. Our results are consistent with generalized long-run risk models and help explain why classical efforts of establishing a naive return-volatility relation fail. We also estimate a fractionally cointegrated vector autoregression (CFVAR). The model-implied long-run equilibrium relation between the two variance variables results in nontrivial return predictability over interdaily and monthly horizons, supporting the idea that the cointegrating relation between the two variance measures proxies for the economic uncertainty rewarded by the market.

We examine the role of Japan's main banks in this process and find that the likelihood of a material weakness is higher for firms with stronger links with their main banks. We also show that the financial health of the main banks themselves-proxied for by the banks' BIS ratios and bad loan ratios increases the likelihood of a material weakness in affiliated firms.

Using a detailed panel dataset spanning 1994-2006, we estimate the impact of Wal-Mart on firm outcomes and market structure, controlling for persistent local trends and systematic differences across markets by exploiting the detailed spatial structure of our store-level census. We find that Wal-Mart's impact is highly localized, affecting firms only within a tight, two-mile radius of its location. Within this radius, the bulk of the impact falls on declining firms and mostly on the intensive margin. Entry of new firms is essentially unaffected. Moreover, the stores most damaged by Wal-Mart's entry are the outlets of larger chains. This suggests that Wal-Mart's expansion into groceries is quite distinct from its earlier experience in the discount industry, where the primary casualties were small chains and sole proprietorships that were forced to exit the market. This contrast sheds light on the role density economies play in shaping both equilibrium market structure and economic geography. In the case of grocery competition, high travel costs and the perishable nature of groceries appear to impart horizontal differentiation between firms. This differentiation in demand appears to reduce impact of scale economies advantages that Wal-Mart exploited to the detriment of far-flung competitors in the discount store industry.

Assuming that the ecology is initially located on the upper (high pollution) branch of the isocline, a simple time-invariant temporary abatement policy can be used to steer the environment from the high- to the low-pollution equilibrium. In all models considered in this paper, a cold turkey abatement policy is optimal within the class of stepwise policies, i.e. the largest feasible shock should be administered for the shortest possible amount of time. The cold-turkey result is robust to alternative models for the economic system, although there is a capital feedback effect that either helps or hinders the speed of transition to the low-pollution equilibrium.","[Heijdra, Ben J.; Heijnen, Pim] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Heijdra, Ben J.] IHS, Vienna, Austria; [Heijdra, Ben J.] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Heijdra, Ben J.] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Groningen; Tilburg University; Ifo Institut,"Heijdra, BJ (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",b.j.heijdra@rug.nl; p.heijnen@rug.nl,,"Heijdra, Ben/0000-0001-9261-7283",,,,,23,16,16,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

It ties in with the legacy of Brian Hoyle's work on port cities and discusses the general mechanisms and trajectories of urban development in the context of transport networks, particularly the tension between the concentration and dispersal of flows and their impact on places. Thus, the relationship between places and flows is considered both fundamental and delicate: that is, it is not only immanent to both, it also causes tensions and conflict. This is discussed in more detail in relation to two distinct cases: ports and airports. In response to related conflicts, the integration of flows in urban areas is pursued as a policy and planning strategy. However, the cases reveal that integration is difficult to achieve, due to complex systems' dynamics and the individual logic of each sector, where integration is often accompanied by disintegration. Some light is also shed on a constructivist view of the subject matter. Finally, some ramifications for research and planning practices will be presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents results from a survey of unemployed job seekers in the county of Dalarna, Sweden and analyzes the differences in willingness towards long-distance commuting between individuals with different socioeconomic situations and experiences of unemployment. The analysis is conducted through a linear probability model complemented with a logistic regression model. Conclusions are drawn on the socio-economic factors that influence the probability of an individual's willingness to commute longer than 40 min. The analysis also takes interaction between different factors into account. The study concludes that the factors influencing the willingness to commute are gender, level of education, and the presence of children in the household. Furthermore, the interactions between age and length of unemployment, age and educational level, and age and gender are shown to be significant in the willingness to commute long distances.

This paper evaluates household income and income inequality in Indonesia, assessing both market and non-market income to reach a more accurate measure of how actual income affects living standards. We find that if household income considers non-market income, income distribution is significantly more balanced, the coefficient of income inequality falls from 0.41 to 0.21 and the income share of the population's poorest deciles increases more than fivefold.

In The rise and decline of nations (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982), Mancur Olson proposed that less-encompassing groups-i.e., those whose constituents collectively represent a relatively narrow range of interests-have a greater interest in seeking the types of subsidies, tariffs, tax loopholes, and competition-limiting regulations that, while benefiting their members, impose costs on the rest of society. By drawing on a unique pair of surveys-one targeted to managers of Russian regional lobbies, and the other addressed to managers of Russian industrial enterprises-we provide what we believe to be the most direct test of this hypothesis to date. The pattern of responses is striking. Managers of both the less encompassing lobbies and the enterprises belonging to those types of organizations display stronger preferences for narrowly targeted policy interventions. Our results, that is, strongly support Olson's hypothesis.","[Pyle, William] Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; [Solanko, Laura] Bank Finland Inst Econ Transit, Helsinki, Finland",,"Pyle, W (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",wpyle@middlebury.edu,,,,,,,57,3,3,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2013,155.0,1-2,,,,,19,41,,10.1007/s11127-011-9823-x,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,095RS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315352800002,0

While we find a statistically and economically significant inverse relation between pre-announcement short activity and announcement period returns, when we control for the non-announcement ability of short sellers to predict future returns documented by Diether et al.

Microdata from the Current Population Survey (CPS) is used to show that this increase in relative volatility is predominantly due to increases in the relative volatility of hourly wages across different groups of workers. Compositional changes of the workforce, by contrast, account for only a small fraction of the increase in relative wage volatility. Simulations with a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model illustrate that the observed increase in relative wage volatility is unlikely to come from changes outside of the labor market (e.g. smaller exogenous shocks or more aggressive monetary policy). By contrast, greater flexibility in wage setting due to deunionization and a shift towards performance-pay contracts as experienced by the U.S. labor market is capable of accounting for a substantial fraction of the observed increase in relative wage volatility. Greater wage flexibility also decreases the magnitude of business cycle fluctuations, suggesting an interesting new explanation for the Great Moderation.

We use data on imports and exports at the firm and product level for Slovenian manufacturing firms in the period 1994-2008, to show that, on average, 70 % of all exporting firms engage in POT. This corresponds to more than 50 % of all exported products. Thus, imported products that are exported again by the same firm is a statistical regularity of trade of Slovenian manufacturing firms. We document that the use of POT is increasing in firm size, product diversification, multinational status as well as firm productivity and profitability. We offer and explore empirically a number of explanations for POT.

We analyze this question using a unique diary survey in which both participants with a Dutch and a foreign background documented their daily purchases. We present several pieces of evidence suggesting that foreign backgrounds still influence the choice between payment instruments after migration to the Netherlands. For instance, we find that first-generation migrants from a number of countries that can be seen as cash-oriented are more likely to use cash in the Netherlands. At the same time, second-generation migrants have similar payment habits as individuals with a Dutch background. This finding suggests that payment behavior is not passed on between generations, but affected by host country payment habits.

For his estimates, Hanusch moreover uses data that do not appear to exist, at least in the claimed sources. I update my estimates to address issues that Hanusch raises.

Yet, many studies have not distinguished accurately between offshoring, domestic outsourcing, and supplier changes. The present study provides stylized facts on offshoring in Europe between 1995 and 2008 taking into account this distinction. This study shows that service activities have been systematically offshored and outsourced domestically during this period, whereas manufacturing activities have been systematically offshored or moved from domestic to foreign suppliers. Overall the share of internal production has gone down by 4.5 percentage points, which raises the question whether firms have achieved productivity gains through this specialisation effort. Combining industry-level data on offshoring and domestic outsourcing with a firm panel, this study finds that service offshoring and offshoring of non-core manufacturing activities have contributed to an increase in productivity, whereas no statistically significant link is found for offshoring of core manufacturing activities and domestic outsourcing. The estimated productivity gains are found to be driven in particular by the gains of multinational firms.","Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Schwörer, T (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",tillmann.schwoerer@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,28,37,45,0,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We obtained estimates of efficiency, productivity growth and efficiency growth using a Bayesian stochastic frontier approach and focused on accounting for Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) for use in our model. Specifically, we introduce NPLs as a bad output in an input distance function, and estimate a system of non-linear equations subject to endogeneity. We confirm that the productivity growth of Turkish banks was positive over the period of this study, which was mainly due to the improvement in technology, while efficiency growth continued to be negative over the same period. Methodologically, we also prove that not accounting for NPLs in estimating the frontier model might seriously distort the efficiency and productivity results. The study also provides measures of shadow prices for NPL and discusses the results in terms of several interesting trends in Turkish banking.

To this end, one of the most strategic port assets is the port-city interface - waterfront zones in which the geography of the port and its city meet each other. In this paper, we explore the relationship between the institutions and governance processes behind spatial projects currently taking place in the interface of four European port cities: Marseille, Barcelona, Hamburg, and Rotterdam. Results show that laws and regulations dominate the spatial outcomes of governance processes between city and port, and that these tend to frustrate experimental efforts towards truly sustainable results. In addition, development orientations that foresee an on-going port migration process away from the urban core are still common among urban planning and policy makers, which impedes on the joint governance processes needed for building renewed, sustainable port-city relations and spatial projects. Contours of such a joint governance process have only been found in the Rotterdam case. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Although women's organizations do not exclude even the poorest women, traders in remote areas were unable to access credit due to particularly harsh standards of joint liability and adverse relations with donors, lenders, and elite women. Meanwhile, the peer monitoring function of group microcredit schemes is challenged by the fact that traders are strikingly uncritical of defaulting borrowers.

A cost attribute is typically included in a CE questionnaire to enable the estimation of monetary values for changes in the non-market attributes presented. Notwithstanding the central importance of the cost attribute, relatively little research has been undertaken on the impacts of varying cost attribute levels on value estimates, or on individual heterogeneity. In this paper, I present results from mixed logit and generalised mixed logit models that account for unobserved idiosyncratic preference and scale heterogeneity. Respondents are found to anchor their choices on the relative cost levels presented in the survey with results suggesting that people are more sensitive to relative rather than absolute cost vectors. However, the higher cost levels do not lead to significantly higher value estimates, partly because of observed preference heterogeneity towards the environmental attributes. An important observation is that scale heterogeneity is important: accounting for scale- as well as preference-heterogeneity in the generalised mixed logit model leads to significantly improved model fit. The results indicate significant unobserved error variance across respondents, unrelated to whether a high or low cost vector is used.","Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Kragt, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, M089-35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",marit.kragt@uwa.edu.au,"Kragt, Marit E./D-3185-2011","Kragt, Marit E./0000-0001-6847-4817",,,,,61,22,23,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We examine naive expectations for the strength of the visceral influence; naive expectations lead the agent to exaggerate the expected utility of resisting temptation and so mistakenly forego pre-commitment.

For this, I complement detailed corporate governance information for Germany with data from other countries. The results for the German bank-based financial system contradict prior findings for other institutional environments. According to these results, family firms in Germany rely less heavily on debt than non-family firms. Less surprisingly, the opposite holds true for the international dataset. Different empirical tests indicate that this puzzling result can be explained by control considerations. Founders and their families use the capital structure to optimize their control over the firm. However, whether family firms rely more or less on debt depends on the level of creditor monitoring in an institutional environment. These findings emphasize that control considerations of major shareholders are important-although often overlooked-determinants of the capital structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Different factors that can help avoid the tragedy of the commons are studied in four experimental settings: separation of a larger commons into smaller commons (two harbors), knowledge/experience available to appropriators, communication within appropriator groups and the possibility of formal and informal sanctioning of group members. Subject populations include undergraduate students as well as professionals working in the Maine lobster and groundfish industries. This design enables a behavioral comparison between students and professionals, as well as a comparison between professionals in these two mutually exclusive fisheries. Results show that group size, communication, geographic separation and subjects' ability to solve the coordination game caused by this separation all contribute to appropriation efficiency on the commons.","[Zhosan, Dmytro] Ripon Coll, Dept Econ, Ripon, WI 54971 USA; [Gardner, Roy] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Zhosan, D (通讯作者)，Ripon Coll, Dept Econ, POB 248, Ripon, WI 54971 USA.",zhosand@ripon.edu,,,,,,,16,0,0,1,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We find that a two-country model of international business cycles with an inventory management decision can generate trade flows and wedges consistent with the data. Moreover, matching trade flows alters the international transmission of business cycles. Specifically, real net exports become countercyclical and consumption is less correlated across countries than in standard models.

In fact, this may lead to the false impression that these are mutually exclusive (Trott and Hartmann, 2009).

However, open innovation research is a more recently developed stream that matches new practices and is an effort to address novel outward and inward sophistications.

If there are no perfect substitutes for equity finance, payout taxes may therefore have an effect on the investment of firms. High taxes will favor investment by firms who can finance internally. Using an international panel with many changes in payout taxes, we show that this prediction holds well. Payout taxes have a large impact on the dynamics of corporate investment and growth. Investment is locked in in profitable firms when payout is heavily taxed. Thus, apart from any level effects, payout taxes change the allocation of capital. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The academic bachelor degrees that give direct access to the Master curriculum without additional compulsory courses are the Bachelor in Geography (Universite de Liege) and the Bachelor in Geography and Geomatics, Main subject: Surveying (Ghent University). At academic universities, the geomatics/surveying degree is related to geographical sciences and located in the Faculties of Sciences. On the opposite, University Colleges (also called Technical Universities) offer mostly professional Bachelor degrees and, in the Flemish part only till 2013, some Master degrees, while academic universities only offer academic degrees. Typically at University Colleges, the studies in Surveying were not organised as an independent type of degree. They are seen as a continuation of the academic Bachelor in Applied Engineering Sciences in Construction option Surveying, resulting in a Master in Applied Engineering Sciences in Land Surveying. In 2013, Ghent University is introducing an enhanced Bachelor, Master and PhD program.

Based on interviews, it finds that EVA as a concept has been widely known at the senior management level, but less known at the divisional level. While divisional managers and employees are less interested in the EVA adoption as they do not see much benefits of employing EVA-based measures, senior managers view the adoption as a good opportunity to demonstrate the success of their leadership and discharge their accountability to the state.

However, the probability of the MP being re-elected was not affected by the amount of reported funds spent, but by how the CDF was spent and by residents' ethnicity.

The results found show that the postmodern consumer seems to lose its internal control. He admits consequently the external control exercised by the chance and the destiny.

Most cities obey a lognormal; but the upper tail and therefore most of the population obeys a Pareto law.

To find an explanation for this state, this paper reviews the reasons why DSGE models fail to perform. For this purpose, first we present the opinions of leading American economists on DSGE models before the Committee on Science and Technology, U.S. House of Representatives in 2010. According to many experts in the USA, DSGE models are considered to be one of the main culprits of the recent economic crisis. Then we provide our own analysis where we point to some relevant drawbacks in the models' construction that may lead to their failure. They are the continuum notion, log-linearization issue and natural production concept. Finally, we suggest the return to the endogenous cycle macroeconomic modeling approach as an alternative solution to DSGE models. In our opinion, this approach may better capture the more complex nature of economic processes with the existence of non-periodic oscillation and chaos. With respect to the current state of macroeconomic modeling, we consider both microeconomic and macroeconomic approaches at least as two equivalent alternatives.","[Kodera, Jan; Quang Van Tran] Univ Econ Prague, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kodera, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",kodera@vse.cz; tran@vse.cz,"Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022",,,,,,28,1,1,0,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We investigate a comprehensive sample of delisting firms from 1998-2012 that restated annual earnings. We find that firms restating earnings have high market expectations for future earnings growth and have higher levels of outstanding debt. We also find that a primary motivation for the earnings manipulation is the desire to attract external financing at a lower cost. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that restating firms have been attempting to maintain a string of consecutive positive earnings growth and consecutive positive quarterly earnings surprises. Together, our evidence is consistent with capital market pressures acting as a Motivating factor for companies to adopt aggressive accounting policies. Finally, we document that information in accruals, specifically, operating and investing accruals, are key indicators of the earnings manipulation that lead to the restatement. Collectively, the evidence suggests that market participants can gain substantial value from a careful consideration of information in financial statements.","[Liu Bo; Wu Xianbin] Bank Beijing Postdoctoral Res Stn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,9,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-063-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,788,793,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BGR19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323863400140,0

The next improvement opportunity lies in the productivity of external supplier networks. A number of management issues result from differences between external and internal supplier networks. This paper relates primarily to two of these issues. Firstly, the composition of external supplier networks (multiple independent organisations) results in overall proximities of the network being substantially lower, i.e., the external networks are more heterogeneous. Secondly, the strategic goals of the organisations that form the network are unlikely to be aligned to the same extent as internal supplier networks. These issues link to a capability-based view of strategy, one which concerns itself with the dynamic processes operating within a firm and the way these are configured to offer 'superior' combinations that deliver competitive advantage which competitors cannot easily copy.

This evidence is consistent with a mispricing channel, where firms issue and invest the proceeds to take advantage of low cost of capital, or with a cost channel, where liquidity is associated with lower issuance costs. Also, it is less related with an informational channel, where a liquid market helps a manager to take more efficient decisions, since this channel does not necessarily predict an increase in investment, but only more efficient investment.

Current estimates in Nigeria reveals an annual solid waste generation of 25 million tones with an urban growth exceeding 6.5% per annum. The generation rate of municipal solid wastes in Ota metropolis, Ogun State, Nigeria, have increased at a disturbing rate over the years with lack of efficient and modern technology for the management of the wastes. This paper presents the current state of solid waste management adopted in Ota and its associated challenges. Four locations where the waste bins are located were selected. A representative sample of 280 kg was used for the waste characterization and the result shows that about 64% of the wastes are recyclable with lots of organic waste that comprises of food and agricultural waste which can be used as compost. The study revealed that there is presently no investment made to the existing development plan to introduce a modern waste management system and the community lacks awareness on the effect of sanitation practice. The study suggests new approach that could be used by institutions and government agencies to achieve sustainable and effective sanitation and possible wealth generation potentials that could be harnessed from the waste stream.","[Olukanni, David O.; Ede, Anthony N.; Akinwumi, Isaac.

Exact definition of rurality represents an unsolved problem not only in the Czech Republic (CR). Scholars usually use one or more criteria to describe significant features of rurality. This article focuses on the definition of rural areas in the CR for EU's subsidies policy as a new need to redefine the rurality emerged with next programming period 2014-2020. The main aim is to set the eligible areas for support and to compare number of inhabitants, number of villages and acreage among a range of definitions. Various determination of rurality has the impact on received subsidies per capita in rural areas. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly state the main goal of the grant policy. If it is to support as many inhabitants as possible, than all regions with exception of Prague should be considered. Also wide amount of population is covered if the eligible areas include stabilized and peripheral regions defined according to the methodology of Ministry for Rural Development. However, the fewest villages are able to gain the support in this case. As the most of municipalities in the CR are smaller than 3,000 inhabitants, this enables to support 94 % of them and cover around 30 % of population on almost 80 % of area. In terms of the area, the population density criterion (less than 150 inhabitants per km(2)) makes possible to support 80 % of the area of the CR.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Pechrová, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",pechrova@pef.czu.cz,"Pechrová, Marie Šimpachová/X-8982-2018",,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,303,314,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300027,0

Predictions were made from year 2004 until present each month up to three months ahead. Several statistical tests and descriptive statistics are applied on results of the two approaches. Results show that the auto-regressive method provides much more accurate predictions than those provided by the analysis of price transmission, which are even worse than a naive prediction (the price will stay the same in the next month), but on the other hand make use of some relations between agricultural commodities. The first method, which predicts better than the naive method, is tested for efficiency, and it is found that it is not efficient, which means that it is not optimal. Moreover, in the case of prediction three months ahead it is biased. For the second method, it was found that the best predictor from those that are considered are producers' prices of feed mixture. For producers' prices of feed mixture and other explained variables, a weighted average of farming prices of wheat and maize is a better predictor than farming prices of wheat.","[Pokorny, Jiri; Fronek, Pavel; Abrahamova, Miluse] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague 12056 2, Vinohrady, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Pokorny, J (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 1453-75, Prague 12056 2, Vinohrady, Czech Republic.",pokorny.jiri@uzei.cz; fronek.pavel@uzei.cz; abrahamova.miluse@uzei.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,70,77,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300006,0

A correct definition of externalities say that they are: costs and benefits that appear when socio-economic activities of a group of persons have an impact on another group and the first group fail in claiming complete responsible to its impact. We usually meet externalities in any area of economic activity, it also can be defined as third-effects (or spillover) arising from the production and/or consumption of goods and services for which is not paid an appropriate compensation. When prices mechanism does not take into account the full social costs and social benefits of production and consumption, externalities may cause market failure, actual market prices do not reflect the full costs or benefits of producing or consuming an one product or one service. Thus, an externality is a cost or a benefit undelivered through prices, incurred by a part who has not agreed to the action which causing this cost or benefit. In this case, the benefit is called a positive externality or external benefit, while a cost is called a negative externality or external cost. These external costs and benefits are opposed of classics costs and benefits as operating costs or revenues from the sale of energy (called internal or financial costs - nature of these costs is that they are paid at a price determined by the market and this price reflects all actual costs of the goods or services). In the process of economic evaluation of externalities generated by projects financed from structural funds, in particular the investments made to stimulate regional development and growth, innovation and increasing of production, environmental sectors, transportation and infrastructure efficiency, the methodology used is based on replacement cost method. Economic evaluation of externalities is a difficult process done in the following stages: identifying its many effects, effects quantification in physical terms and effects evaluation in economic terms. Many of these projects effects are represented by externalities (intangible effects) which has no prices as a result of not existing market for them. The term externality refers to the fact that this effect is outside of the market. In this context, cost-benefit analysis is a technique for assessing monetary social costs and benefits of a capital investment project along a given period of time [1]. This paper attempts to identify the most important types of externalities that should be considered when developing a project, taking into account that the quantification of externalities (both positive and negative) is a comprehensive approach which involving the use of econometric tools and many key variables. The objectives of this paper are to identify and propose, a minimum set of positive and negative externalities that should be considered when developing cost-benefit analysis for a project, by type of investment framework, whether they are measurable and monetized or not.","[Suster, Gabriel Adrian; Sirb, Nicoleta Mateoc; Iancu, Tiberiu; Manescu, Camelia] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",Banat University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine; University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,,,"Iancu, Tiberiu/AAX-4855-2020; MATEOC-SÎRB, Nicoleta/AAO-7110-2021; Suster, Gabriel/AAP-6345-2020; MATEOC-SÎRB, Nicoleta/AAB-9355-2021; Manescu, Camelia/ABC-4532-2021","MATEOC-SÎRB, Nicoleta/0000-0002-6023-9668; Tiberiu, Iancu/0000-0002-1645-5064; Manescu, Camelia/0000-0002-9470-8987",,,,,1,1,1,0,9,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,155,160,,,,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400021,0

Unsuccessful implementation of MCMS and computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) has been widely reported in the literature. There is, however, a lack of research on the requirements for successful implementation. Several specialised computerise maintenance systems have been invested by engineering asset organisations to enhance their asset management and maintenance systems. Nevertheless, there is no common ground among engineering asset organisations about what sorts of collaborative maintenance are required for adoption/implementation.

That is, the more media exposure a listed company has, the higher level of conservatism it has in accounting. As is illustrated in this paper, mass media plays a role in effective accounting supervision and thus promotes accounting conservatism of listed companies, especially for those private ones.

The paper uses a novel and rich database with information on corruption scandals that affected Spanish local governments during the period 1996-2009. The database includes information about press coverage of each scandal and also about the intervention of the judiciary as published by the press. This allows us to analyze whether voters react to the amount of information (e.g., number of news) and to information regarding the seriousness of the case (e.g., judicial charges). We find that the incumbent's vote loss after a corruption scandal can rise to 14% when we consider cases in which the incumbent has been charged with corruption and press coverage has been extensive. However, we find no vote loss at all in cases dismissed or with reports to the courts which did not lead to further judicial intervention. The results suggest that information provided by the press modifies voters' beliefs regarding the prevalence of corrupt activities and helps them disentangle cases of founded vs. unfounded corruption.

Employing the identification through heteroskedasticity approach as an identification strategy and using a panel of 105 countries over the period 19602007, we find a two-way interaction between inflation and its variability. In particular, higher inflation increases inflation volatility, which is in line with the Friedman-Ball Hypothesis. Consistent with the Cukierman-Meltzer arguments, moreover, greater inflation volatility fuels inflation.

The present study hypothesized that the role of a common feature in consumer choice depends on its quantity as well as its quality. Experiments 1 and 2 tested this hypothesis and the equate-to-differentiate account by varying the quality and the quantity of common features. Experiment 3 examined the cognitive process that was proposed to serve as the mechanism for the common feature effect using eye-tracking methodology. This study provided further insight into conditions when the cancellation-and-focus model applies.

This study aims to take stock of this literature by means of a meta-analysis. We identify how the size of the equity premium depends on the way it is measured, along with its evolution over time and its variation across regions in the world. We find that the equity premium is significantly lower if measured by ex ante methods rather than ex post, in more recent periods, and for more developed countries. In addition, looking at the underlying fundamentals, we find that larger volatility in GDP growth tends to raise the equity premium while a higher nominal interest rate has a negative impact on the equity premium.

Growth type is persistent; growth-type-sorted cross-sections of corporate fundamental variables (such as tangible versus intangible investment style) are also meaningfully persistent. As economic and market conditions improve, low growth type firms are keener to issue new debt than equity, whereas high growth type firms are least likely to issue debt and keenest to issue equity. These findings demonstrate that firms rationally invest and seek financing in a manner compatible with their growth types. Consistent with a generalized Myers-Majluf framework, growth type compatibility enables distinct growth types and hence specifications of market imperfection or informational environments to persist.

In this work we investigate the underlying firm-level dynamics of enterprises on the basis of a database developed by the Italian Statistical Office (ISTAT) covering the period 1989-2004 and containing information on more than 100,000 firms. Over this period not only have the indicators of the central tendency of the distribution of labor productivity not significantly changed, but also the whole sectoral distributions have remained relatively stable over time, with their support at least not shrinking, or even possibly widening, over time. This is even more surprising if one takes into consideration the Euro shock that occurred during the period investigated. On the contrary, we observe that inter-decile differences in productivity have been increasing. Further, heterogeneous firms' characteristics (i.e. export activity and innovation) seem to have contributed to boosting such intra-industry differences. Given such wide heterogeneities we resort to quantile regressions to identify the impact of a set of regressors at different levels of the conditional distribution of labor productivity. One phenomenon that we observe is what we call a tendency toward neo-dualism involving the co-existence of a small group of dynamic firms with a bigger ensemble of much less technologically progressive ones.","[Dosi, Giovanni; Grazzi, Marco; Tomasi, Chiara] Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Tomasi, Chiara] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Trento, Italy; [Zeli, Alessandro] ISTAT, Rome, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Trento,"Grazzi, M (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",marco.grazzi@sssup.it,"Grazzi, Marco/A-6195-2012; DOSI, GIOVANNI/B-9587-2014","Grazzi, Marco/0000-0002-4196-6122; DOSI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-0126-9349; Tomasi, Chiara/0000-0002-1962-7351",,,,,45,43,43,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The evidence suggests that firms with staggered boards attract significantly larger analyst following. We also document that firms with staggered boards experience less information asymmetry. Staggered boards insulate managers from the discipline of the takeover market. Entrenched managers are well-protected by the staggered board and have fewer incentives to conceal information, resulting in less information asymmetry. The more transparent information environment facilitates the analyst's job. As a consequence, more analysts are attracted to firms with staggered boards. We also document the beneficial role of analyst coverage in improving firm value. Our results confirm the notion that analysts, as information intermediaries, provide oversight over management and thus help alleviate agency conflicts. The positive effect of analyst coverage, however, is severely reduced when the firm has a staggered board in place. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Multivariate regression analysis is applied to a dataset extracted from the 2006 Census of Canada master file. The results indicate that significant socioeconomic and land use determinants of normal commute distance are also applicable to extreme commute distance. However, land use factors are more instrumental when explaining extreme commute distance. The results suggest that sex, age, occupation type, mode of transportation, migration, employment status, mixed land uses, and job concentration at the place of residence of the worker all explain commute distance. The results from the mixed land use variables shed some light on the importance of smart growth in limiting long commutes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end we focus on the previous number of borrowing/lending relationships between individual borrowers and lenders and the duration of these interactions. Using this new, direct and explicit measure on a sample of 5867 syndicated loan transactions between 1993 and 2006, we find that when participant banks have information inferiority in the syndicate, they require higher loan spreads to compensate for this asymmetry. This is amplified when the borrowers are more opaque. We thus show how junior participant banks with repeat relationships with the same borrower graduate from uniformed to informed lenders (the spread goes down as asymmetry diminishes) and how they rely both on the arranger's reputation and their own repeat experience with the borrower.

Third, if the data were generated by the rare events distribution needed to rationalize the equity premium puzzle, the puzzle itself would be unlikely to arise.

The analysis reveals that access to foreign capital gets easier after being upgraded to investment level through both portfolio and credit channels; however, a particular trend cannot be depicted for foreign direct investment. While the cost of external debt decreases after the upgrade, the average maturity of new debt does not portray a significant change. As external financing conditions improve, the formerly decreasing external debt follows an upward trend and current account worsens. The surge in foreign credit reflects on domestic credit market, as domestic credit to private sector accelerates and cost of domestic lending falls.

In particular, the non-parametric estimator of these densities, which is based on fitting implied volatility curves, is applied to estimate intraday expectations of 3-month EURIBOR 3 months ahead. Estimates of the noise impact on the statistical moments of the densities enhance the interpretation. In addition, the paper assesses the impact of the ECB communication during Governing Council days. The results show that the whole density may react to the communication and that such repositioning of market participants' expectations will contain information beyond that of changes in the consensus view already observed in forward rates.

Further, the paper also resolves the Novy-Marx (2011) concern about whether return autocorrelation is really momentum by demonstrating that the superior performance of intermediate-term momentum is due to strong January seasonality in the cross-section of returns. The implications are that long-term contrarian must be considered largely illusory, and intermediate-term momentum must take account of annual seasonalities in returns. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Istanbul has recently developed its 42 km BRT network with further extensions currently being constructed. The Istanbul BRT system (Metrobus) consists of three main sections. The first section (2007) was initially built on the European side of the city through a high demand arterial and its extension as the section was completed in 2008. It received criticism for having been preferred over rail alternatives. The third section (2009) runs over one of the two Istanbul Strait (Bosporus Strait) Bridges connecting Asia and Europe, by which Metrobus has uniquely acquired the distinction of crossing a major water barrier and connecting two continents. Istanbul Strait is a major transportation bottleneck and source of congestion and Metrobus is the only transit system for crossings. Shortly after the opening of the bridge section, the whole system has recorded a directional capacity of 24,000 passengers/h and patronage of 620,000 daily ridership. The number of passengers attracted from car users and intermediate forms of public transportation is also notable.

Firstly, the host country has to determine whether or not the firm has to file for income taxation at source. Secondly, the income has to be split between the two jurisdictions for tax purposes. These two decisions determine the extent of source- and residence-based taxation. We build a two-country model with costs of tax administration and compliance in order to analyze these two decision margins. We show that the globally optimal solution may imply a mix of source-based and residence-based taxation.

Results show that removing conditions and restrictions set by the PSO would result in higher fares and reduced fare stability. There are also likely to be traffic mix substitution effects with a greater proportion of inbound tourists at the expense of the Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFRs) market. Liberalisation is also expected to lead to higher load factors and reduced seating capacity in the summer months while lower load factors and reduced capacity/frequency would be expected in-winter. These observations would be especially marked on routes between the Mainland and the Northern Sardinian airports of Olbia and Alghero. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To the extent that affirmative action programs also apply to traditional labor markets, however, they may alter the opportunity cost of starting a business. We utilize the elimination of affirmative action in California and Washington States through voter initiatives to identify the effect of affirmative action on minority and female self-employment rates. In our base specifications, we find evidence of modest increases in self-employment among minorities and women in both California and Washington after elimination of affirmative action, consistent with the hypothesis that the opportunity cost of starting a business fell due to restricting opportunities in the traditional labor markets. The sign of the estimated effect, however, is not uniformly positive when considering specific race/gender groups, and the statistical significance of the main results is somewhat sensitive to the choice of control states.","[Fairlie, Robert; Marion, Justin] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Fairlie, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rfairlie@ucsc.edu; marion@ucsc.edu,,,,,,,34,12,31,0,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Among others, one advantage of the framework is the ability to model a large collection of time-varying parameters simultaneously. When we apply the framework to estimate the cost of equity we find economically significant effects of state uncertainty. A state-independent pricing model overestimates the cost of equity by about 4% per annum for a utility firm and by as much as 3% for industries. We also observe that the expected return, volatility, risk loading, and pricing error all display state-dependent dynamics that coincide with the business cycle. More interestingly, the forecasted market and Fama-French factor risk premiums can predict the future real GDP growth rate even though the model does not use any macroeconomic variables, which suggests that the proposed Bayesian framework captures the state-dependent dynamics well.

The main thrust is concerned with the identification of geographic patterning of commuting distance and flow (i.e. the number of people travelling from region i to region j) coupled with the changes in these patterns over the decade to 2006. GIS-based methods are employed to first calculate the average commuting distance and second to map the degree of self-containment (i.e. people living and working within the same area) at a fine spatial scale. Through a quantitative analysis of JTW patterns over the two census datasets, the results are linked to current planning debates regarding urban spatial policies that seek to reduce commuting distances. Specific attention is given to address: (1) spatial variation in changes in commuting distance across the study region between 1996 and 2006; and (2) whether jobs-housing balanced development reduced commuting distances over the decade. Results indicate that the spatial patterns of commuting have changed little over the 10 year period and the change in commuting distance presented strong relationships to the change in jobs-housing ratio (JHR) at local areas. Implications for urban policy include the need for improved industry-occupation matching and consideration of planned employment decentralisation. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These different design options provide broadly similar economic incentives for clean energy deployment and yield similar overall welfare impacts, but they exhibit different distributional outcomes. The most inclusive CES crediting approach favors producers over consumers in competitive electricity markets as well as regions with larger initial endowments of clean energy On the other hand, the most restrictive crediting approach favors consumers over producers and reduces preferences for regions with larger initial endowments of clean energy. While specific technology outcomes vary across the four models used in this study, key insights about cost-effectiveness and economic incidence are largely robust to the underlying modeling platform.

But recent research on Latin America finds a trade-off between corruption and inequality and suggests this is due to the large informal sector in the region. Using data on a large sample of countries we find that the informal sector impacts the link between corruption and inequality.

We explore how this multi-task agency problem shapes loan officers' compensation, banks' use of soft information in credit approval, and their lending standards. When competition intensifies, prospecting for loans becomes more important and banks' internal agency problems worsen. In response to more competition, banks lower lending standards, may choose to disregard soft and use only hard information in their credit approval, and in that case reduce loan officers to salespeople with steep, volume-based compensation.

The paper analyzes how counterparty risk should be allocated, whether traders should be fully insured against that risk, and how moral hazard affects the optimal allocation of risk. The main advantage of centralized clearing, as opposed to no or decentralized clearing, is the mutualization of risk. While mutualization fully insures idiosyncratic risk, it cannot provide insurance against aggregate risk. When the latter is significant, it is efficient that protection buyers exert effort to find robust counterparties, whose low default risk makes it possible for the clearing system to withstand aggregate shocks. When this effort is unobservable, incentive compatibility requires that protection buyers retain some exposure to counterparty risk even with centralized clearing.

This paper aims to estimate the changes in consumer welfare due to the changes in food prices which occur as a result of harmonization with the European Union during the accession process and after full membership. The Slutsky compensating variation is calculated for rural, urban and overall Turkish households for every quintile ordered by expenditure. Share of the food products used in tins application in total food consumption expenditures is 20% approximately. Results of the calculations suggest that on average (for overall Turkish households) the welfare loss per capita is 6.3%. The welfare loss for rural households and urban households are 8.6% and 5.7% respectively. Additionally, food price increases cause a higher welfare loss for low-income quintiles. Assuming that socio-economic situation of Turkey is the same as in 2008, the total losses in consumer welfare for rural, urban and overall Turkish households are approximately 6.5 billion TL, 15.6 billion TL and 22 billion TL respectively.","[Sahinoz, Ahmet] Hacettepe Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Yeni, Onur] Hacettepe Univ, Ingilizce Iktisat Bolumu, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University; Hacettepe University,"Sahinöz, A (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Beytepe Kampusu, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",asahinoz@hacettepe.edu.tr; oyeni@hacettepe.edu.tr,"Yeni, Onur/I-8729-2013; Yeni, Onur/JBJ-1858-2023","Yeni, Onur/0000-0002-4369-1919;",,,,,23,0,0,2,8,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We posit that (1) foreign affiliates of business group firms have a greater propensity to import capital goods from the home country, increasing home country exports; (2) if the establishment of overseas affiliates by business group firms attracts foreign direct investment by their capital goods suppliers, business group ties are localized and the 'trade creating' impact of business group ties may disappear or even be reversed. Empirical analysis of capital goods imports by 1790 manufacturing affiliates operated abroad by Japanese multinational firms, combined with information on linkages with machinery suppliers within horizontal and vertical business groups, provides broad support for these predictions. Our findings suggest that it may be incorrect to infer from the absence of a simple relationship between business group ties and trade that such ties are unimportant; instead, intra-group ties may be replicated abroad through foreign direct investment.

Our results show that the extent of diversification is not driven by risk pooling considerations; insurers operating in more volatile business lines do not diversify more. Diversification can rather be explained by the benefits of internal capital markets and barriers to business growth like market size and concentration. In our analysis, we distinguish between related and unrelated diversification. Using a measure of unrelated line-of-business diversification we find the first support for the diversification prediction of the managerial discretion hypothesis that mutual insurers should be less diversified than stock insurers. While mutual insurers tend to exhibit higher levels of total diversification, they engage in significantly less unrelated diversification than do stock insurers.","[Berry-Stoelzle, Thomas R.] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Liebenberg, Andre P.] Univ Mississippi, Sch Business Adm, University, MS 38677 USA; [Ruhland, Joseph S.] Georgia So Univ, Coll Business Adm, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Mississippi; University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University,"Berry-Stölzle, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",aliebenberg@bus.olemiss.edu,,"Liebenberg, Andre/0000-0001-5688-0033",,,,,69,45,57,0,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between these expenditures and downstream pharmaceutical innovation. In particular, although recent analyses have shown a clear contribution of federally funded research to drug development, there exists little evidence to suggest that increasing targeted public research funding for any specific disease will result in increased development of drugs to treat that disease. This paper evaluates the impact of changes in the allocation of U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) extramural research grant funding across diseases on the number of drugs entering clinical testing to treat those diseases, using new longitudinal data on NIH extramural research grants awarded by disease for years 1975 through 2006. Results from a variety of distributed lag models indicate that a sustained 10 percent increase in targeted, disease-specific NIH funding yields approximately a 4.5 percent increase in the number of related drugs entering clinical testing (phase I trials) after a lag of up to 12 years, reflecting the continuing influence of NIH funding on discovery and testing of new molecular entities. In contrast, we do not see evidence that increases in NIH extramural grant funding for research focused on specific diseases will increase the number of related treatments investigated in the more expensive, late-stage (phase III) trials.

We evaluate the impact of the policy on the level of U.S. hESC research, the U.S. position at the knowledge frontier, and the strategic response of U.S. scientists. Consistent with recent research on the science of science and innovation policy, we employ a difference-in-differences approach using bibliometric data with the aim of analyzing the causal impact of the policy on cumulative research. Our estimates suggest that in the aftermath of the 2001 policy, U.S. production of hESC research lagged 35 to 40 percent behind anticipated levels. However, this relative decline was largely concentrated in the years 2001 to 2003 and ameliorated over time. The rebound in U.S. hESC research after 2003 was driven by contributions by researchers at elite U.S. institutions and U.S. researchers who collaborated with international partners. The results suggest that scientists respond strategically to research funding restrictions and that modest science policy shifts can have a significant influence on the within-country composition of research and the pattern of global research collaboration.

Financial intermediaries cater to these preferences and beliefs by engineering securities perceived to be safe but exposed to neglected risks. Because the risks are neglected, security issuance is excessive.

It also investigates whether being audited by a big auditor would lead to lower agency costs and lower cost of equity. The study focuses on emerging common-law South Africa and code-law Brazil, and seeks to identify whether there are material differences given their dissimilar institutional characteristics. The study reports that even though firms may be audited by high quality auditors, their institutional differences influence significantly firms' earnings conservatism, agency costs and cost of equity. Client firms of big auditors in both common-law South Africa and code-law Brazil exhibit lower discretionary accruals. The study has found evidence of more conservative earnings for South Africa but insufficient levels for Brazil. For common-law South Africa, the presence of effective corporate governance mechanisms reduces agency costs. For code-law Brazil, the corporate governance mechanisms generally display an insignificant impact on reducing agency costs. For common-law South Africa, firm-level performance, growth and market determinants tend to lead to a lower cost of equity. For code-law Brazil, it is found that significant discretionary accruals, market beta and analyst forecast dispersion would result in higher uncertainty and would consequently raise the cost of equity.

In this paper, we use personality variables to understand the underlying motives of women (and men) to enter a competition or avoid it. We use the Big Five personality factors, where especially neuroticism has been related to performance in achievement settings. We first test whether scores on the Big Five are related to performance in our experiment, and second how this is related to incentives. We can show that the sex difference in the willingness to enter a competition is mediated by neuroticism and further that neuroticism is negatively related to performance in competiton. This raises the possibility that those women who do not choose competitive incentives know that they should not. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

By examining the Securities and Exchange Commission's filings of all U.S. nonfinancial firms from 1996 through 2008, we document that, in any given year, between 10% and 20% of firms report being in violation of a financial covenant in a credit agreement. We show that violations are followed immediately by a decline in acquisitions and capital expenditures, a sharp reduction in leverage and shareholder payouts, and an increase in CEO turnover. The changes in the investment and financing behavior of violating firms coincide with amended credit agreements that contain stronger restrictions on firm decision-making; changes in the management of violating firms suggest that creditors also exert informal influence on corporate governance. Finally, we show that firm operating and stock price performance improve post-violation.

It is argued that soft paternalism should not be understood as an efficiency-enhancing, but as a redistributive concept. The relationship between soft paternalism and social norms is discussed in detail. In particular, it is argued that soft paternalism increases the stability of given social norms, which in turn need not be efficient, nor in the material self-interest of a majority of individuals. Soft paternalism is argued to be an essentially conservative concept of policy-making in the sense that it tends to increase the longevity of status quo social norms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper considers whether environmental or other Pigouvian taxes should be precautionary Should environmental taxes be set higher than otherwise if the harm from pollution is uncertain and irreversible and where we are likely to learn more about the nature of the harm in the future? It concludes that environmental taxes should be set equal to the expected marginal harm from pollution given the currently available information and should be neither raised or lowered because of the prospect of learning or irreversible harm. The reason is that taxes equal to expected marginal harm decentralize decisions to market participants who will, facing these taxes, make appropriate choices about the timing of pollution. Taxes act similarly to property rights in a complete market where market participants produce Pareto outcomes. There are a number of caveats to this conclusion including the possibility of endogenous learning, in which our understanding of the environmental effects of pollution or the available mitigation technologies depends on the level of taxation.","[Weisbach, David A.] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Weisbach, David A.] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Weisbach, David A.] Argonne Natl Lab, Lemont, IL USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory,"Weisbach, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",d-weisbach@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,41,2,3,0,11,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The social issue is to draw a demarcation line between the field of property and the area of the community. Two principles, universal and permanent, are introduced: the need to assign to the State, the ownership of the land; the order to devote the rent of land to public expenditure. It's on behalf of reason and justice that should be found ways to justify the rights of society. The question of tax underlines the difficulty of establishing a demarcation line between private property and collective property. On the one hand, tax is used to finance public expenditure relevant to the community. On the other hand, the way to apply it goes against the respect for private property.","Univ Blaise Pascal, MCF, CERDI Clermont Ferrand, TRIANGLE, Lyon, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Institut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Securite (INRETS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Paris-VIII; Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Diemer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Blaise Pascal, MCF, CERDI Clermont Ferrand, TRIANGLE, Lyon, France.",diemera@aol.com,,,,,,,82,1,1,0,8,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

By using unique, hand-collected data from the credit-pricing models of 15 Swiss regional banks, we provide new empirical evidence that operational costs are a key factor in explaining differences in lending rates between small and large enterprises. Furthermore, we also found that the lack of negotiation power of small enterprises-expressed in the profit margin amount of the bank-has significant explanatory power.","Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Inst Financial Serv IFZ, CH-6304 Zug, Switzerland",,"Dietrich, A (通讯作者)，Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Inst Financial Serv IFZ, Grafenauweg 10, CH-6304 Zug, Switzerland.",andreas.dietrich@hslu.ch,,,,,,,31,14,19,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a strategic-tactical decision support model to assist managers in evaluating the impact of environmental issues, related to transportation emissions, on the transport geography of a region. Specifically we provide a model that addresses: (i) supply chain network design, including port of entry and transportation mode, and (ii) decisions on using dedicated versus shared warehouses and transportation. The applicability of the proposed methodology is examined through the development of a sustainable supply chain network in the South-Eastern Europe region. The results indicate that in most cases using shared warehouses from Third Party Logistics operators improves both the cost and the environmental performance of a company. In all cases shared use of transportation operations minimizes the amount of CO2 and PM emissions generated, while dedicated use minimizes costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These two experiments estimate willingness to pay for tropical biodiversity amongst distant beneficiaries and for reductions in water supply risks, respectively. The entreaties in both contexts, in essence, entailed an additional text to 'talk people out of their protests' using, respectively, a split sample test and a within sample test. Results indicate that, in both cases, these scripts were effective in significantly reducing protest zeros, with one experiment reducing protests at the payment principle stage of the valuation scenario and the other reducing protests at the payment elicitation stage. Using entreaties in this way tentatively may be a useful contribution to the existing CV literature where protests rates are high and, moreover, appear to 'defy' efforts to address the issue through best practice in the design and testing of survey instruments. However, while protests were reduced by about a third in both cases, the entreaties clearly did not eliminate a majority of protest zeros. Moreover, as we discuss, there are good reasons why the responses of 'reclaimed' protestors remain open to scrutiny.","[Atkinson, Giles; Mourato, Susana] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Atkinson, Giles; Mourato, Susana] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Morse-Jones, Sian] Fauna & Flora Int, Ecosyst Serv & Environm Markets, Cambridge CBI 2JD, England; [Provins, Allan] Econ Environm Consulting Eftec Ltd, London W1W 7SQ, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Atkinson, G (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",g.atkinson@lse.ac.uk,"Atkinson, Giles/H-3009-2013","Atkinson, Giles/0000-0001-6736-3074",,,,,39,20,22,0,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In response to the anti-dumping charges launched by American manufacturers against Taiwanese SRAM firms, Taiwan Securities and Futures Commission issues a new directive on January 30, 2003 which requires the listed companies to disclose pro forma EPS after deducting employee bonuses and director/supervisor compensations, that is, implicitly recognizing employee bonus as an expense item in annual reports. This study examines the valuation implication of mandatory disclosure of employee bonus related information after the issuance of the new directive by examining whether stock price movements can reflect such institutional changes. The empirical findings are in conformity with the expectation: Before the issuance of Directive No. 457, the market tends to overestimate the incentive effect arising from the employee bonuses; after the issuance of Directive No. 457, the market reacts negatively once employee bonuses are recognized implicitly as operating expenses. This study implements several diagnostic checks and demonstrates that our empirical results are robust to various specifications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Daily high (low) prices are almost always buy (sell) trades. Hence, the highlow ratio reflects both the stock's variance and its bid-ask spread. Although the variance component of the highlow ratio is proportional to the return interval, the spread component is not. This allows us to derive a spread estimator as a function of highlow ratios over 1-day and 2-day intervals. The estimator is easy to calculate, can be applied in a variety of research areas, and generally outperforms other low-frequency estimators.","[Corwin, Shane A.; Schultz, Paul] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Corwin, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",,,,,,,,37,468,540,5,103,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

There is much theoretical debate on the impact of IPRs in the South on the incentives of Northern firms to innovate and transfer technologies to the South. While empirical research exists on the effects of Southern IPRs on Northern technology transfers, empirical evidence on the effects of Southern IPRs on Northern innovation is absent. This paper seeks to fill that gap. Using a comprehensive micro-database of US multinational firms and their foreign affiliates in developed countries, this study finds that patent protection in the South has statistically insignificant effects on the research and development of these firms. Rather, the patent regimes of developed countries matter significantly to the R&D of these firms. Developing countries constitute a relatively small share of the world market so that variations in the patent rights of developing economies have contributed marginally to Northern incentives for R&D.","American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Park, WG (通讯作者)，American Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",wgp@american.edu,,,,,,,44,9,9,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Using a panel of developed and emerging economies from 1970 to 2007, it shows that a large capital inflow episode increases substantially the probability of having a banking or a currency crisis in the two following years. The effect is especially large for the case of balance-of-payment crises. The paper also finds that the effect of large capital inflows is different depending on the type of flows characterizing the episode.

The empirical estimations show that the response of prices to demand shocks is substantially slower than that of sales. The estimated reactions of sales substantially differ from those reported in the earlier literature.

We find little evidence of an immediate change in consumption at retirement, on average, in Japan. However, we find a decrease in consumption at retirement for low income households that is concentrated in food and work-related consumption. The availability of substantial retirement bonuses to a large share of Japanese retirees may help smooth consumption at retirement. We find that those households that are more likely to receive such bonuses experience a short-run consumption increase at retirement. However, among households that are less likely to receive a retirement bonus, we find that consumption decreases at retirement. J. Japanese Int. Economies 26 (1) (2012) 62-83.

In the first utility formulation, which is consistent with particular interpretations of disappointment, prospect theory and regret theory, individuals receive negative utility from outcomes that were worse than expected. This directly implies that expectations themselves enter utility negatively. The second utility formulation incorporates anticipatory savoring, where positive expectations about the future directly lead to more utility today. We test which of these formulations best explains actual connections between health and welfare over time, using data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. Estimated coefficients from fixed-effects ordered logit models support a strong positive utility impact of positive expectations: expecting good health in the future increases happiness now. Our results are one argument for benevolent health care providers to allow individuals to maintain unrealistically positive expectations about the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using two-timed longitudinal data (N = 748) collected both prior to and during the economic crisis, we tested and confirmed a psychological process model (i.e., financial attitude -> behavioral intention -> actual behavior -> well-being), one that included parental norms, perceived behavioral control and financial planning horizon as antecedent factors. Our findings indicate that the more positive a young adult's attitude toward financial behaviors, and the greater his/her perception of parental expectations, then the stronger will be this young adult's intention to perform such behaviors. We found that behavioral intention at Time 1 contributed to actual financial behaviors at Time 2, which in turn was positively related to a young adult's present sense of well-being. We also found that perceived behavioral control and financial planning horizon influenced both behavioral intention and actual behavior. Although perceived impact of the economic crisis moderated the link between past and present well-being, it did not affect the hierarchical flow of the model. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our study pertaining to consumer financial education. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Aggregate fluctuations and propagation mechanisms under increasing financial openness are investigated in a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium framework in the case of positive technology shocks. The imperfections in the economy in the form of informational asymmetries among the agents and uncertainty in the production process necessitate financial intermediation and collateralized borrowing in the economy. The reason to abstract from money in the setup of the framework is to be able to concentrate on the real implications of increasing financial openness for the effect of technology shocks, business cycle implications of which have long been discussed in the literature. It is shown that increasing financial openness amplifies the impact of positive, temporary technology shocks on output, investment, consumption, labor supply and net exports. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Their dramatic increase is being led by changes in land use patterns, deforestation, land clearing, agriculture, and other human activities UNWTO, 2003, inducing one of the main challenges humankind is facing nowadays, i.e. climate change. The concentration of GHG in the atmosphere has been growing at an unprecedented rate and magnitude. They have increased since the beginning of the industrial era and accelerated worldwide, particularly since 1945. Global emissions of GHG grew 70% from 1970 to 2004 IPPC, 2008. Countries most contributing to this are the developed nations and, more recently, the BRIC countries, which are going through a rapid economic growth process. Solely, the United States accounts for around one fourth of the world's GHG emissions. This paper will investigate the impact of changes in the final demand for tourism sector on the carbon dioxide CO2 emissions, using the environmental input-output IO approach. The empirical analysis is developed for Romania, using economic and environmental data. The shocks in tourism final demand will reveal the environmental burdens transmitted throughout the economy of an initial percentage change. The second finding of this paper concerns the decrease in CO2 emissions as a result of changes in CO2 intensity of various productive sectors. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, the probabilities of loans for economic sectors to migrate down into lower levels are estimated by loan transition matrices. Finally, credit stress testing was applied to each bank respectively using the parameters found in previous analyses. To mention some results: bigger banks' nonperforming loans are related to GDP in negative ways but mid-sized and smaller banks have positive relationship between their nonperforming loan and GDP.

A linked development was the emergence of a few dominant Southeast Asian urban centres, typically primate and always ports. Drawing on historical census data, this article uses rank-size distributions and transition matrices to investigate the influence of commodity specialisation and exports on urban systems development in the region. It is argued that different commodities produced different spread effects, resulting in variation in degrees of urban concentration in the region. However, geography, path dependence and infrastructure also shaped urban systems development. The main cities that emerged during this period became the 'gateways' that connected frontier Southeast Asia to the global economy. Cities dominant in 1939 retain this status in today's Southeast Asia.","Univ Oxford, Pembroke Coll, Oxford OX1 1DW, England",University of Oxford,"Huff, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Pembroke Coll, Oxford OX1 1DW, England.",gregg.huff@pmb.ox.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/G005389/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005389/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,74,8,8,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

However, several studies suggest that the underestimation of future intangible value may explain the high return associated with the share repurchase. To better understand the actual information content of repurchases, I decompose the BIM ratio into past tangible information and future intangible information and find that repurchase signals an undervaluation of the intangible return. In addition, I investigate several potential proxies for intangible information R&D expenses, intangible assets, and future operating performance.

Meanwhile, utilities and customer groups in the US. and Canada have developed methods of negotiating and settling regulatory issues that more directly reflect the interests of customers, often embody incentive price caps as in the UK, and avoid unduly burdensome regulatory processes. There is now scope for UK regulators to learn from overseas. This paper summarises these developments. It then examines how three UK utility regulators of airports, water and energy are responding to them by developing new forms of customer engagement. The CAA has moved firmly in this direction for airports, while Ofwat and Ofgem have nominally rejected it for water and energy, but seek to secure many of the benefits of the approach via less committed processes. There is scope for governments to encourage a regulatory approach that offers the prospect of better outcomes for customers and a less onerous process for all concerned.","[Littlechild, Stephen] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Littlechild, Stephen] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",University of Birmingham; University of Cambridge,"Littlechild, S (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",sclittlechild@tanworth.mercianet.co.uk,,,,,,,46,9,9,1,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

To generate the size of term premium corresponding to the one found in actual data the DSGE model's have to be calibrated in a way compromising the models' ability to fit key macroeconomic variables. The crucial element shaping the term structure of interest rate in DSGE models is consumption dynamics. For this reason, the existing research on bond premium puzzle builds on different utility formulations and shock persistence.

A dynamic cost frontier model using the shadow cost approach is formulated to decompose cost efficiency into allocative and technical efficiencies. The dynamic cost efficiency model is developed into a more general context with a multiple quasi-fixed factor case. The model is implemented empirically using a panel data set of 1,143 Polish farms over the period 2004 to 2007. Due to the regional disparities and a wide variety of farm specialization, farms are categorized into two regions and five types of farm production specialization. The estimation results confirm our observation that adjustment is rather sluggish implying that adjustment cost are considerably high. It takes up to 30 years until Polish farmers reach their optimal level of capital and land input. Allocative and technical efficiency differ widely across regions. Moreover, efficiency is rather stable over time and among farm specialisations. However, their results indicate that the regions characterized by the larger farms perform slightly better.","[Rungsuriyawiboon, Supawat] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok 10200, Thailand; [Hockmann, Heinrich] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Germany",Thammasat University; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Rungsuriyawiboon, S (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok 10200, Thailand.",supawat@econ.tu.ac.th; hockmann@iamo.de,,,Thailand Research Fund (TRF); Commission on Higher Education (CHE); Ministry of Education (Thailand); Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe (IAMO),Thailand Research Fund (TRF)(Thailand Research Fund (TRF)); Commission on Higher Education (CHE)(Office of Higher Education Commission (OHEC)); Ministry of Education (Thailand); Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe (IAMO),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support by the Thailand Research Fund (TRF), the Commission on Higher Education (CHE), Ministry of Education (Thailand) and the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe (IAMO).

These relations were tested on the basis of structural equation modeling using 444 questionnaires completed by large-scale pig farmers in the Netherlands. Previous studies on the relation between network structure and innovativeness retained the absorptive capacity 'black box' by using proxies for absorption of knowledge. The present study addresses this shortcoming by studying absorptive capacity in terms of organizational capacities (routines and processes) of farmers to use their networks and absorb external knowledge. The findings show that frequency of contact in a specific network range affects innovativeness positively, but also indirectly through acquisition and assimilation capacity. Assimilation capacity turns out to be the most important dimension of absorptive capacity for the innovativeness of pig farmers.","[Tepic, M.; Trienekens, Jacques H.] Wageningen Univ, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hoste, R.] Agr Econ Res Inst WUR LEI, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Omta, S.

In this paper, we develop simulation-based Bayesian inference for these measures. While the literature reports that the time-varying extensions substantially reduce pricing errors of classic models on the standard test assets, our analysis shows that the reduction is much smaller based on the second measure. Those time-varying models have large pricing errors on the contingent claims of the test assets because their stochastic discount factors are often negative and admit arbitrage opportunities.

Our general approach is to first produce interarea price indices for a single year 2000 and then use BLS time-series price indices to create the panel. Our geographic housing price index for 2000 is based on a large data set with detailed information about the characteristics of rented dwelling units and their neighborhoods throughout the United States that enables us to overcome many shortcomings of existing interarea housing price indices. For most areas, our price index for all goods other than housing is calculated from the price indices for categories of nonhousing goods produced each quarter by the Council for Community and Economic Research, formerly the American Chambers of Commerce Researchers Association. In order to produce a nonhousing price index for areas of the United States not covered by their index, we estimate a theoretically-based regression model explaining differences in the composite price index for nonhousing goods for areas where it is available and use it to predict a price index for these goods for the uncovered areas. The overall consumer price index for all areas is based on the preceding estimates of the price of housing and other goods. Electronic versions of the price indices are available online.

We build on Tyers' application of methods to international trade employing a numerical general equilibrium model of the EU.

This paper introduces in an otherwise standard real business cycle model a more general and data-coherent class of production functions, namely, a constant elasticity of substitution production function. We show that the degree of substitutability between production factors is a key ingredient to understanding the (de)stabilizing properties of a BBR. Then we calibrate the model consistently with the empirical evidence; that is, we set the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital below unity.

Following the launch of the London bicycle sharing system (LBSS) in 2010, women and residents of deprived areas were under-represented among initial users. This paper examines how the profile of users has changed across the scheme's first 3 years, using total-population registration and usage data. We find that women still make fewer than 20% of all 'registered-use' LBSS trips, although evidence from elsewhere suggests that the introduction of 'casual' use has encouraged a higher overall female share of trips. The proportion of trips by registered users from 'highly-deprived areas' (in the top tenth nationally for income deprivation) rose from 6% to 12%. This was due not only to the 2012 LBSS extension to some of London's poorest areas, but also to a steadily increasing share of trips by residents of highly-deprived areas in the original LBSS zone. Indirect evidence suggests, however, that the twofold increase in LBSS prices in January 2013 has disproportionately discouraged casual-use trips among residents of poorer areas. We conclude that residents in deprived areas can and do use bicycle sharing systems if these are built in their local areas, and may do so progressively more over time, but only if the schemes remain affordable relative to other modes.

The present paper aims to fill this gap by estimating a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model augmented with a financial accelerator mechanism and associated financial shocks. Our estimation results show that even in the presence of the financial shocks an adverse neutral technology shock mainly induced the Great Stagnation and that the rate of neutral technological change is strongly correlated with all enterprises' financial position in the Tankan. Based on these findings, the paper argues that the Great Stagnation was caused by an adverse neutral technology shock that is likely to represent a tightening of firms' financing, which induced reduction of R&D investment and misallocation of resources as indicated in previous literature.

Bikesharing has been found to decrease driving and increase bicycling. But shifts in public transit have been mixed. The authors evaluate survey data from two U.S. cities to explore who is shifting toward and away from public transit as a result of bikesharing. The authors explore this question by mapping geocoded home and work locations of respondents within Washington DC and Minneapolis. Respondents were mapped by their modal shift toward or away from bus and rail transit. The results show that in Washington DC, those shifting toward bus and rail transit live on the urban periphery, whereas those living in the urban core tend to use public transit less. In Minneapolis, the shift toward rail extends to the urban core, while the modal shift for bus transit is more dispersed. The authors analyze sociodemographics associated with modal shift through cross-tabulations and four ordinal regression models. Common attributes associated with shifting toward public transit include increased age, being male, living in lower density areas, and longer commute distances. The authors conclude with a discussion of the final results in the context of bikesharing's impacts on other cities throughout North America. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Many of these studies have excluded aviation since the association between urban structure and air travel is not as intuitive as it is the case of ground travel. However, several recent studies have concluded that air travel is a significant contributor to the GHGs from passenger transport. Furthermore, even air travel habits depend heavily on lifestyles and socio-economic factors that are related to the urban form. Here we analyse the interactions between urban structure and different transportation modes and their GHG impacts in Finland. The study utilises the data from the Finnish Transportation Agency's passenger traffic survey from May 2010 to May 2011, which includes over 12 000 people and over 35 000 trips. The survey is based on one-day travel diaries and also includes additional data on long-distance trips from a longer period. Methodologically, the study takes a traveller's perspective to assess the GHG emissions from passenger transport. We found that (1) air travel breaks the pattern where GHG emissions decrease with increasing density of urban structures, and (2) in the metropolitan region there is a clear trade-off between car-ownership and air travel in the middle income class. The main policy implication of our study is that air travel must be included in GHG assessments and mitigation strategies targeting travel behaviour. In dense urban regions, the emissions of air travel have the potential to offset the gain from reduced private driving. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Our analysis encompasses two large-scale earthquakes that occurred in two different Italian regions in 1976 and 1980. We show that the short-term effects are negligible in both regions, though they become negative if we simulate the GDP that would have been observed in absence of financial aid. In the long-term, our findings indicate a positive effect in one case and a negative effect in the other, largely reflecting divergent patterns of the TFP. Consistent with these findings, we offer further evidence suggesting that a quake and related financial aid might either increase technical efficiency via a disruptive creation mechanism or reduce it by stimulating corruption, distorting the markets and deteriorating social capital. Finally, we show that the bad outcome is more likely to occur in regions with lower pre-quake institutional quality. As a result, our evidence suggests that unanticipated local shocks are likely to change long run growth rates, exacerbating territorial disparities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Through a variety of channels the presence of MNEs is expected to reduce the costs faced by indigenous firms in breaking into international markets and in turn boost their export prospects. In this paper we use an extensive Polish firm-level dataset for the period 2000-2008 to verify whether MNEs have positively contributed to the export performance of indigenous firms. We track not only sectoral and geographical spillovers stemming from the activity of MNEs but also control for firm-specific characteristics that affect indigenous firms' decisions to export including their absorptive capacity. Our empirical results support the existence of positive spillovers (related to MNE export activity) at the sectoral level but not at the regional level.

Using a comprehensive database of corporate bonds from 2001 to 2012, we find that firm liquidity, measured by standardized Lambda, has a negative statistical and economic impact on the inclusion of all categories and sub-categories of restrictive bond covenants. Developed from financial statement information by Emery and Lyons (1991), Lambda is designed as a coverage ratio that, under certain distribution assumptions, maps into the probability of a firm being unable to pay its short-term bills. The strongest solvency proxy is the 10-year credit default swap (CDS) spread which is significant across the categories and sub-categories for investment and payment covenants, weakly significant for the subordinated debt sub-category of the subsequent financing covenant, but strongly significant for the control poison put sub-category of event covenants. This evidence supports a model that uses SLambda as a proxy for liquidity risk and the 10-year CDS spread as a proxy for solvency risk. The liquidity/covenant relationship is dampened when firms have access to commercial paper funding or bank loans. However, during the recent financial crisis liquidity event this liquidity/covenant relationship was enhanced especially for firms which were dependent on commercial paper during this time when the commercial paper market was deteriorating.

The programme had two main components: providing non-refundable financial assistance, by stimulating regional economic growth and development and, at the same time, it was directed at implementing certain management systems that matched the development policies of the EU. The effects triggered by the implementation of the SAPARD Programme in Romanian tourism were assessed in the past years from various quantitative perspectives (number of projects, value of the granted funding), but the regional economic impact generated strictly by this programme hasn't yet been explicitly and unequivocally pointed out. From this standpoint, the previous research has been mainly focused on pre/post implementation comparisons of the GDP and of the unemployment rate. On a national level, the Suceava county stands out in terms of the large number of SAPARD projects funded through the Measure 3.4 -The development and diversification of economic activities to generate multiple activities and alternative income, thus leading to an increasing number of boarding houses in rural areas and, at the same time, fostering the qualitative development of the tourism supply in the area. From our point of view, an analytical approach of the multiplying effect generated by the SAPARD Programme would start from the thorough measurement of the economic changes that have occurred locally, in relation to the weight of the absorbed grants. The preliminary results arrived at in less than 5 years since the suspension of this funding source pinpoint a rather insignificant contribution of these funds to the local economy. The lack of experience of the parties involved in the system, bureaucracy and the migration of the non-refundable money are the most probable causes of the selection and implementation of projects that were rather unsustainable and inadequate in terms of quality.","[Hapenciuc, Cristian-Valentin; Stanciu, Pavel; Morosan, Andrei-Alexandru; Arionesei (Gaube), Gabriela] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Hapenciuc, CV (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",valentinh@seap.usv.ro,"Alves, Juliano/GQO-7605-2022; Stanciu, Pavel/HZI-0751-2023","Stanciu, Pavel/0000-0002-5339-4328",,,,,24,3,3,0,26,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1327,1339,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900022,0

The research also aims to identify how they perceive the impact of the crisis on the business environment and the behavior of competitors. The findings suggest that, at first, travel agencies followed an informal strategic planning process, with a high emphasis on the short-term objectives given the turbulence of the environment affected by the economic crisis.

To this end, we rely on the Delta CoVaR systemic risk measure introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). In order to provide a formal ranking of the financial sectors with respect to their contribution to systemic risk, the original Delta CoVaR approach is extended here to include the Kolmogorov-Smimov test developed by Abadie (2002), based on bootstrapping. Our empirical results reveal that in the Eurozone, for the period ranging from 2004 to 2012, the other financial services sector contributes relatively the most to systemic risk at times of distress affecting this sector. In turn, the banking sector appears to contribute more to systemic risk than the insurance sector. By contrast, the insurance industry is the systemically riskiest financial sector in the United States for the same period, while the banking sector contributes the least to systemic risk in this area. Beyond this ranking, the three financial sectors of interest are found to contribute significantly to systemic risk, both in the Eurozone and in the United States. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper analyses the impact of the evolving HSR network on the accessibility by HSR and conventional ground transport of 333 prefecture-level cities and 4 municipalities. This paper employs three indicators of accessibility, and analyses three Scenarios. It shows that the HSR network will bring about substantial improvement in accessibility, and lead to national time-space convergence, but will also increase the inequality of nodal accessibility between eastern, central, and western regions, between cities with different sizes of population (excluding the case of the daily accessibility indicator) and between cities that differ in the shortest distance to HSR stations. The HSR network enlarges internal disparities in each of the regions and the five types of cities. The internal inequality of nodal accessibility in all three Scenarios generally increases from the eastern region via the central region to the western region, as well as from very large cities to small cities, varying inversely with the level of economic development and population size. Spatially, accessibility increases generally conform to the distance decay rule but with minor fluctuations. The 50 cities with the largest increases in accessibility are mostly located 50 km or less away from HSR stations and have populations of over 3 million, with the smaller ones located along HSR lines or around large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. As time progresses, the planned HSR network will result in more balanced development, but regional disparities in accessibility will still be greater than before the construction of the HSR.

It finds that entrants after the crisis were larger or less dependent on credit than their predecessors, suggesting that they were more resilient to economic shocks. Yet entrants after the crisis exported relatively less than their predecessors. Meanwhile, productivity levels were the same before and after the crisis, indicating that entrants were able to match the productivity level of incumbents. Contrary to the concerns about deindustrialisation, these characteristics may simply reflect a dynamic that resulted in better or more resilient firms entering the industry after the crisis.","Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia",Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia,"Narjoko, D (通讯作者)，Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,39,5,5,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

By using a sample of six major European economies, we find that sovereign and bank CDS spreads are cointegrated variables at the country level.

By decomposing the noise and speed of adjustment components of the price discovery, we find that both variables have an important price discovery role in the period 2004-2013. Most developed countries (Germany, Sweden) show a clear leading role for bank CDS spreads throughout the sample period, whereas most distressed European economies (Portugal and Spain) are governed by a leading role for their sovereign CDS spreads during both the sub-prime crisis and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis.

When deciding whether to purchase a food, consumers must now consider how they feel about the technology used to produce it. Despite this trend, our understanding of consumers' neural and behavioral responses to food technologies and price remains limited. In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine a large sample of adult consumers' (n = 50) neural responses to food attributes, specifically a food's price and the technology used to produce it. Results suggest the more attributes presented to consumers, the greater the neural activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain region associated with working memory and uncertainty. Further, neural activation in regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is significantly associated with a personality measure of openness and a fear of new food technologies.","[Bruce, Amanda S.; Cherry, J.

This paper contributes to this debate by testing two explanations, which are that (i) immigration tends to reduce redistribution due to people's higher levels of xenophobia, and that (ii) immigration affects redistribution because immigrants do not have the right to vote. Since the demand for redistribution depends on the (expected) gap between median voter income and mean income, immigrants affect the demand for redistribution because, as non-citizens, they do not change the median voter's income, but, as economic stakeholders, they do affect the mean income. Four empirical consequences of (i) and (ii) are tested at the individual level. Evidence from the European Values Survey in 45 countries confirms (ii), showing that immigrants' expected competitiveness on the labor market affects preferences for redistribution and that it is amplified when the perceived number of immigrants is high. In contrast, (i) is globally rejected since the impact of the citizens' declared level of solidarity with immigrants tends to be weak and depends on the type of measurement or specification used.","Grenoble Univ, Dept Polit Sci, PACTE, Sci Po Grenoble, Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Magni-Berton, R (通讯作者)，Grenoble Univ, Dept Polit Sci, PACTE, Sci Po Grenoble, Grenoble, France.",raul.magni-berton@iep-grenoble.fr,,,,,,,53,8,9,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2014,160.0,3-4,,,,,391,409,,10.1007/s11127-013-0094-6,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AL7VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339344600006,0

In addition to the regime-dependent effects of the output gap, this study controls for the regime-invariant influences arising from changes in wages, oil prices and the nominal effective exchange rate. An interesting finding of this paper relates to the positive but varying impact of the output gap on inflation. Two significantly different regimes are identified whereby the probability of switching to regime 2 (represented by a relatively high output gap coefficient) peaks markedly and consistently across all three countries only when quarterly changes in inflation become noticeably large and volatile. The cross-country results provide compelling evidence that the coefficient assigned to the output gap rises significantly when the economy experiences sizable perturbations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Periodic evaluation is the premise of improving and modernizing educational services, and students, as the primary beneficiaries of education, are the first to be included in this process. Therefore, the goal of this research is to identify the perceptions of students specializing in the financial management of European funds regarding the quality of teaching staff and the teaching process. This study takes a quantitative approach using a survey method and a questionnaire as a data collection instrument. The questionnaire includes a set of 11 specific items that are considered to be most relevant to the quality of higher education services and two related to overall perceptions of quality. Data were collected from a sample of more than 1,500 students enrolled in a new master's program on the axis specified above. Analyses showed that three factors have a significant influence not only on the assessment of teacher performance during courses and seminars but also on the quality of the teacher involved in the process: the use of modern teaching techniques, the degree to which master's students are trained and actively participate in teaching activities, and the presentation of quality and coherent information. A teacher's performance is influenced to a lesser extent, but still a significant one, by other two items included in this study: delivering materials on time and efficiently using the time allocated to the discipline. However, professor performance is also negatively correlated with the relevance of the information offered to students and the difficulty of the assessment. This study offers a valuable perspective on the quality of the educational process as perceived by Romanian university students. It identifies the most relevant factors in ensuring the quality of a master's program focused on providing practical skills and training international specialists in the area of international funds management.","[Drule, Alexandra-Maria; Popa, Irimie Emil; Nistor, Razvan; Chis, Alexandru] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Drule, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",alexandra@drule.ro,"Drule, Alexandra Maria/GXF-5035-2022; CHIS, Alexandru/B-3242-2017; Nistor, Răzvan Liviu/AAZ-7656-2020","CHIS, Alexandru/0000-0003-4026-1988; Nistor, Razvan Liviu/0000-0002-3897-3946",,,,,74,7,9,2,42,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,827,840,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400010,0

In many cases, however, the costs to landholders of making the transition are too large for them to do so. At the same time, the large intermediaries appear to have little economic incentive to introduce certification because the market does not adequately value the environmental benefits. Instead, NGOs and other aid and development agencies who would like to see small producers benefit from the change in production practices have typically stepped in to provide financial support for certification. This paper shows how voluntary price discrimination (in the form of donations) by the consumers that most highly value certification can be used to finance a switch to environmentally sustainable practices and thus address a market failure. This analysis shows that an NGO's optimal intervention depends on the size of its budget, the elasticity of supply of the product, and the elasticity of participation by producers. NGOs with smaller budgets rely more heavily on lump sum transfers to the intermediary and less heavily on volume and participation-dependent subsidies. Volume and participation dependent subsidies are inversely related to the elasticity of supply and the elasticity of participation in a standard Lerner relationship.","[Fulton, Murray] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada; [Vercammen, James] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; University of British Columbia,"Vercammen, J (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",Murrray.Fulton@usask.ca; james.vercammen@ubc.ca,,"Fulton, Murray/0000-0002-0351-5531",,,,,24,5,5,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

When firms produce asymmetrically differentiated goods, it is found that a change in the number of foreign competitors may alter the sign of the optimal unilateral investment subsidy.

To establish the empirical validation, separate one-year default prediction models are developed using dynamic logistic regression technique that encapsulates significant financial information over an analysis period of 2000 to 2009. Almost an identical set of explanatory variables affect the default probability of domestic and international SMEs, which contradicts the need for separate default risk models. However, the lower predictive accuracy measures of the model developed for international SMEs motivate us to compare the weights of regression coefficients of the models developed for domestic and international firms. Test results confirm that four out of the nine common predictors display significant statistical differences in their weights. However, these differences do not contribute to the discriminatory performance of the default prediction models, given that we report very little difference in each model's classification performance.

Using a unique dataset with detailed information on non-interest income, our findings show that, conversely to studies on Western economies, a shift toward non-interest activities increases bank profits and risk-adjusted profits particularly when banks are more involved in trading in government securities. Our results also indicate that foreign banks benefit more from such a shift than their domestic counterparts. Moreover, we account for the institutional and regulatory environment advocating loans to SMEs and find that higher involvement in non-interest activities is only beneficial for banks with low exposures to SMEs. Our findings have important policy implications in terms of achieving optimal diversification and lower risk exposure, which might conflict with policies aiming to promote SME lending.

We also argue that the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks on the U.S. enhanced ABC program importance rather than impeded system development, and we challenge the post-9/11 view, encapsulated by the then U.S. Ambassador to Canada, (the late) Paul Cellucci, that 'security trumps trade'. Based on interviews with airlines, airports, government agencies, and other influential actors, the analysis contributes to understanding the multi-decade symbiotic relationships between the public and private sectors that overcame political, business and technical challenges to support a 'Trade with Security' strategy.

One of the main findings is that, even though it performs better in sorting out the most efficient subjects, the fee and subsidy scheme is not more profitable than tradable quotas.","[Ambec, Stefan; Reynaud, Arnaud] INRA, LERNA, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31931 Toulouse, France; [Ambec, Stefan] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Garapin, Alexis; Muller, Laurent; Sebi, Carine] Univ Grenoble 2, INRA, GAEL, UMR 1215, F-38040 Grenoble, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE; University of Gothenburg; INRAE; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Ambec, S (通讯作者)，INRA, LERNA, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31931 Toulouse, France.",sambec@toulouse.inra.fr; alexis.garapin@upmf-grenoble.fr; laurent.muller@grenoble.inra.fr; areynaud@toulouse.inra.fr; carine.sebi@enerdata.net,,,,,,,31,4,4,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In this type of service, users share access to a fleet of vehicles, thereby giving them most of the advantages of automobile use, such as its temporal and spatial flexibility, without many of the constraints of ownership. This study analyzes the geographical and socio-economic factors that favour membership of a carsharing service in Quebec City. We combined Cervero's and Kockelman's 5D model (density, diversity, design, distance to transit, and destination accessibility) with Hagerstrand's concept of innovation diffusion so as to analyze the evolution of potential car-sharing membership. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression was used to model the spatial diffusion of the number of car-sharing members in Quebec City from 1996 (two years after its inauguration) to 2008 at the local scale, with an annual time step. Results indicate that the carsharing distribution did, indeed, follow Hagerstrand's innovation diffusion model and that, even though some of the 5D model significantly influenced membership, it was socio-economic factors (education, non-motorization, and family structure) that most greatly affected the membership rate in the service area. The model is used to assess and discuss market coverage potential in Quebec City. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Starting with the observation that innovation clusters spatially across a broad spectrum of industries, my work seeks to understand the mechanisms and institutions that promote the creation of useful knowledge. In my conceptualization, entrepreneurs, as the agents who recognize opportunity, mobilize resources, and create value, are key to the creation of institutions and the building of capacity that will sustain regional economic development. Entrepreneurs benefit from location. But entrepreneurs are also pivotal as agents of change that can transform local communities. The initial event or entrepreneurial spark that gives rise to prosperous regions is not deterministic nor do they automatically set in motion path dependencies that automatically yield successful places. What matters most is human agency-the building of institutions and the myriad public and private decisions that determine what I call the character of place-a spirit of authenticity, engagement, and common purpose.","Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 28403 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Feldman, MP (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 28403 USA.",maryann.feldman@unc.edu,,,,,,,32,170,193,4,108,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

I use a new panel-data set to measure tax autonomy and the stringency of fiscal rules for EU15 regional and local government sectors over the period 1995 to 2008. I apply an instrumental variables approach to obtain an unbiased estimate of the impact of fiscal rules on deficits. I use political variables describing the central governments characteristics as instruments for fiscal rules at the sub-national level. The results show that the effectiveness of fiscal rules and tax autonomy depends on the constitutional structure. Fiscal rules decrease deficits only in unitary countries. Deficits of sub-national sectors in federations can be avoided through tax autonomy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These limitations may be overcome when an SME belongs to a business group. Empirical studies have shown that firms belonging to business groups have a higher propensity to engage in R&D. We demonstrate that this higher propensity depends on the ownership of controlled companies, besides the presence of coordination mechanisms. We develop a model, and we empirically test its predictions using a data set of Italian SMEs operating in the manufacturing sector. From the model we derive three main implications: (1) there is no difference in R&D propensity between standalone firms and firms at the bottom of groups; (2) head and intermediate firms have a higher R&D propensity than standalone firms and firms at the bottom of the group; (3) the intensity of R&D depends on the ownership of controlled firms and on their size.

Using a dynamic panel model to study the development of public deficits, we test several personal characteristics of the finance ministers that could influence budgetary performance in the German states between 1960 and 2009. Her professional background, i.e., her field experience, seems to affect budget deficits but neither her individual preferences nor her education does.

We also find that private equity alliances involved more profitable target firms when compared to sole-sponsored private equity deals. Finally, we find that the significantly lower abnormal returns for target firms in private equity alliance deals are eliminated once we control for differences in the types of target firms acquired by private equity alliances and single private equity bidders.

If no evidence is found that voters reelect mayors comparing their performance with those of neighboring jurisdictions, strategic interactions among municipalities cannot be properly interpreted as yardstick competition. We innovate on the literature by looking at different indicators of popularity and several specifications of inter-jurisdictional comparisons. The dataset includes all Italian municipalities for the entire period when mayors could set the property tax rate, e.g., 1995-2004, considering all interjurisdictional comparisons and relaxing the implicit hypothesis of cross section analysis that observed phenomena are on their steady state equilibrium. The estimates confirm the presence of electoral concerns of the incumbents and a significant spatial correlation of the tax rates, especially among neighboring nonterm limited mayors. Given these results, strategic interactions among Italian municipalities appear consistent with the predictions of yardstick competition theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This trend has particularly affected low-income families. At the same time, owners of thousands of privately owned, publicly subsidized rental housing units have left, or opted out, of subsidy programs across the country. The efforts of local governments to preserve these properties as affordable housing are handicapped by a lack of understanding of the underlying factors that drive owners' decisions to opt out. This paper employs a unique dataset on subsidized properties in New York City and uses hazard models to explore why property owners in the Mitchell-Lama program, a New York State affordable housing program, choose to opt out. Our results suggest that properties located in neighborhoods with high property value growth, those with for-profit owners, and those past the affordability restrictions on all subsidies, are more likely to opt out. While our study focuses on Mitchell-Lama properties, the findings have broader implications for properties around the country that receive supply-side rental subsidies.

Results of the exercise help rationalize what is called the bronze coin puzzle, which is the massive amount of minted coins seemingly incommensurate with price levels. It is shown that the velocity of money was increasing and comparable to pre-industrial England levels. This paper argues that the driving forces of the short supply of money are greater than usual hoarding by the state treasury and coin outflows to Song's trading partners via smuggling. Since velocity of money is an indicator of economic development in ancient societies, this paper provides a realistic validation of the premise of the Needham puzzle.","[Dong, Baomin] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng 475000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Gong, Jiong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Henan University; University of International Business & Economics,"Gong, J (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",baomindon@gmail.com; johngong@gmail.com,"Dong, Baomin/AAV-7741-2021","Dong, Baomin/0000-0002-4787-021X",,,,,36,3,3,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In particular, we are interested in examining how foreign banks solve the information asymmetries that characterize lending relationships and whether those relationships have changed since the financial crisis of 2008. Foreign banks are likely to limit their lending activity to larger firms or more transparent firms because they are at an informational disadvantage relative to domestic banks. We find that foreign banks focus on relationships with foreign, listed, and larger firms. In addition, their portfolio is more heavily weighted towards firms in less competitive industries and exporting firms. Comparing outcomes for 2006 and 2009, we find that banks are more concerned with leverage in 2009 and have reduced the number of firms in their portfolio post-crisis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Fisman and Love, in their paper entitled Financial development and intersectoral allocation: A new approach, argue that growth opportunities are unobservable and propose a new methodology to test the capital allocation hypothesis. The methodology is based on correlations in the patterns of intra-industry growth between two countries and similarities in the level of financial development and income. This paper extends their methodology by proposing direct and forward-looking measures of local and global growth opportunities, obtained by interacting the country's patterns of industrial specialization with industry-level price-earnings ratios, as in the paper Global growth opportunities and market integration by Bekaert et al. The results, obtained in a cross-section framework including 37 developed and developing countries over the period 1992-2006, confirm the relevance of financial development to promote economic growth and to help industries in taking advantage of global and local growth opportunities. They also show that the methodology developed by Fisman and Love can be extended to include direct measures of growth opportunities.","Univ Molise, Dipartimento Econ Gest Soc & Ist, I-86100 Campobasso, Italy",University of Molise,"Pietrovito, F (通讯作者)，Univ Molise, Dipartimento Econ Gest Soc & Ist, 2 Edificio Polifunz,Via F de Sanctis, I-86100 Campobasso, Italy.",filomena.pietrovito@unimol.it,"Pietrovito, Filomena/ABI-2485-2020","Pietrovito, Filomena/0000-0002-3768-9791",,,,,30,2,2,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Using this network topology, we find that stronger product market connections lead to a greater incidence of cross-industry mergers. Furthermore, mergers propagate in waves across the network through customer-supplier links. Merger activity transmits to close industries quickly and to distant industries with a delay. Finally, economy-wide merger waves are driven by merger activity in industries that are centrally located in the product market network. Overall, we show that the network of real economic transactions helps to explain the formation and propagation of merger waves.","[Ahern, Kenneth R.] Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Harford, Jarrad] Univ Washington, Foster Sch Business, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Southern California; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Ahern, KR (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,"Harford, Jarrad/AAC-8542-2020; Ahern, Kenneth R./B-4504-2015","Harford, Jarrad/0000-0001-5515-8751",,,,,67,182,224,10,183,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Why? What are the origins of these disparities? This paper conceptualizes contributions as a type of attachment between the donor and the state legislative candidate. To model the formation of these attachments, this paper proposes a variant of the Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model. The theoretical model is tested with data on over one million contributions to state legislative candidates in 2008. The paper also derives implications for macro-level inequities across candidates which are tested by comparing the observed inequities to simulations of the preferential attachment model. The results provide strong support for the hypotheses and show that the preferential attachment model provides a parsimonious representation of contributions to state legislative candidates.","Univ Missouri, Dept Polit Sci, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Vonnahme, G (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Polit Sci, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",vonnahmeg@umkc.edu,,,,,,,43,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2014,159.0,1-2,,,,,235,249,,10.1007/s11127-012-0041-y,0.0,,,15,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AD3OX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333156600015,0

However, the present understanding of inland ports appears to be limited to network-based views with a maritime port focus (Outside-In), in which inland ports play second fiddle. We argue that inland ports as independent structures (Inside-Out) deserve equal consideration and that in addition to the transport dimension, the spatial, economic and institutional dimensions of inland ports are vital and should not be neglected. The goal of this paper is to apply the concept of port-city challenges to inland ports. The results of an institutional analysis of Dutch case study evidence show that challenges facing inland ports and cities take many forms but that all share a commonality in the trade-offs between positive and negative externalities. We observe different governance strategies in coping with these trade-offs and find that a proactive stance towards zoning contributes to efficiently accommodating mutually exclusive dimensions of inland port development.

In addition, an independent sample t-test produces a mean score of 73% for the items on CSR reports as regulated by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is reported. Moreover, a factor analysis is used to identify four dimensional factors (namely, company resources, regulations and international environment, knowledge of CSR and capital variables) as the effective predictors.

In a theoretical model where extensive margins in both tradable and non-tradable sectors are endogenously determined, it is shown that the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson (HBS) effect is amplified. Following an HBS productivity shock, when countries expand their extensive margins rather than the scale of production, wages appreciate further. Therefore, the expansion in extensive margins leads to a stronger appreciation in the price of non-traded goods. Furthermore, when traded and non-traded goods are complements, the number of firms in the non-traded sector increases despite the appreciation of non-traded goods prices. J. Japanese Int.

Based on a review of frictions that hinder financial contracting, this paper concludes that the common justifications for government guarantees-i.e., principal-agent frictions or un-internalized externalities in an environment of risk neutrality-are flawed. Even where risk is purely idiosyncratic-and thus diversifiable in principle-government guarantees (typically granted via development banks/agencies) can be justified if private lenders are risk averse and because of the state's comparative advantage over markets in resolving the collective action frictions that hinder risk spreading. To exploit this advantage while keeping moral hazard in check, however, development banks/agencies have to price their guarantees fairly, crowd in the private sector, and reduce their excessive risk aversion. The latter requires overcoming agency frictions between managers and owner (the state), which would likely entail a significant reshaping of development banks mandates, governance, and risk management systems.

Using household-level survey data for El Salvador, we examine whether remittances affect households' use of savings and credit instruments from formal financial institutions. We find that although remittances have a positive impact on financial inclusion by promoting the use of deposit accounts, they do not have a significant and robust effect on the demand for and use of credit from formal institutions. If anything, by relaxing credit constraints, remittances might reduce the need for external financing from financial institutions, while at the same time increasing the demand for savings instruments.

The paper discusses the well-known puzzle that fundamental variables such as money supply and interest rate, provide help in predicting changes in floating rates. It also tests the theoretical result of Engel and West (2005) that in a rational expectations present-value model, the asset price manifests near-random walk behaviour if the fundamentals are 1(1) and the factor for discounting future fundamentals is near one. The study explores the direction and nature of causal interdependencies among the most widely traded currencies in the world, their country-specific fundamentals and their US-differentials. A new VAR/VECM-GARCH multivariate filtering approach is implemented, whilst linear and nonlinear non-causality is tested and validated on simulated and empirical data. The evidence implies that there is no indication of a prevailing causal behaviour and when nonlinear effects are accounted for, the pattern of leads and lags changes over time. The variations in this linkage can be attributed to parameter instability in structural models, which may have little effect on FX forecastability over short horizons, yet it is significant for long-run cointegrating relationships. While it is difficult to reconcile these findings with the Rational Expectations hypothesis, the theory of Consistent Expectations or Bounded Rationality matches simulation and empirical findings more efficiently. Overall, fundamentals may be important determinants of FX rates, however there may be some other unobservable variables driving the currency rates that current asset-pricing models have not yet captured.

We build a simple model of adverse selection and quality screening which captures this feature. The model predicts that diversification happens by bouts, or temporary episodes, during which OECD buyers search for high-quality suppliers. Each diversification episode is followed by a phase of re-concentration on the best performers, until those fail (which happens stochastically), triggering new search phases. The model also shows that concentration across origin is highly volatile, especially for goods with high-quality heterogeneity. Finally, as the set of suppliers expands and buyers continue sampling, the overall trend is an increased diversification across time. We empirical explore these conjectures using OECD imports over time (1963-2006) and measuring their concentration across 250 origin countries at the product level (1,300 products). We provide strong empirical evidence corroborating the model predictions.","[Cadot, Olivier] HEC Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Cadot, Olivier] CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Cadot, Olivier] CEPR, London, England; [Cadot, Olivier] CEPREMAP, Paris, France; [Carrere, Celine] Univ Geneva, Global Studies Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Carrere, Celine] FERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Strauss-Kahn, Vanessa] ESCP Europe, Paris, France; [Strauss-Kahn, Vanessa] CEPII, Paris, France",Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Geneva; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Strauss-Kahn, V (通讯作者)，ESCP Europe, Paris, France.",vstrauss-kahn@escpeurope.eu,,,,,,,46,11,11,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Developed countries are largely responsible for global warming, but the brunt of the fallout will be borne by developing countries in forms such as lower agricultural output, poorer health, and more frequent natural disasters. Although carbon emissions per capita have leveled off in developed countries, they are projected to rise rapidly in developing countries because of economic growth and population growth. Unfortunately, the latter will rise most notably in the poorest countries, combining with climate change to slow poverty reduction. These countries have many incentives to lower fertility. Previous studies indicate that in high fertility settings, fertility decline facilitates economic growth and poverty reduction. It also reduces the pressure on livelihoods and frees resources that can be used to cope with climate change. Moreover, slowing population growth helps avert some of the projected global warming, which will benefit the poorest countries far more than it will benefit developed countries that lie at higher latitudes and/or have more resources to cope with climate change. Natural experiments indicate that family-planning programs are effective and highly pro-poor in their impact. While the rest of the world wrestles with the complexities of reducing emissions, the poorest countries will benefit from simple programs to lower fertility.

We explain this phenomenon in the context of equilibrium indeterminacy in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. We first analytically show that a model under indeterminacy exhibits richer dynamics that can improve forecastability. Then, using a sticky-price DSGE model, we numerically demonstrate that indeterminacy arising from passive monetary policy generates persistent dynamics that lead to superior forecastability. We also point out the possibility that forecastability under indeterminacy deteriorates when the degree of uncertainty about sunspot fluctuations is large.","[Fujiwara, Ippei] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hirose, Yasuo] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo 108, Japan",Australian National University; Keio University,"Fujiwara, I (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",ippei.fujiwara@anu.edu.au; yhirose@econ.keio.ac.jp,,"Fujiwara, Ippei/0000-0003-3078-6588",,,,,26,7,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

My results suggest that a significant portion of the effect on turn-of-the-year returns that prior studies attribute to window-dressing is actually attributable to tax-loss-selling by institutional investors. Among small capitalization stocks, I find that institutional investors with strong tax incentives and weak window-dressing incentives realize significantly more losses in the fourth quarter than in the first three quarters of the calendar year, and that their fourth quarter realized losses have a significant impact on turn-of-the-year returns. A one percentage point change in these institutional investors' fourth quarter realized losses scaled by a firm's market capitalization results in an increase of 47 basis points in the firm's average daily return over the first three trading days of January, which represents a 46 percent change for the mean firm.

Using manufacturing industry-level data for 1992-2003, the results confirm the hypothesis that trade increases informality in industries that experience sudden foreign competition. This explains about a third of the increase in informality. Sectors with higher investment ratios are able to neutralise and reverse this effect.","[Acosta, Pablo] World Bank, Dept Human Dev Latin Amer & Caribbean Reg, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Montes-Rojas, Gabriel] City Univ London, Dept Econ, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Montes-Rojas, Gabriel] Univ San Andres, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",The World Bank; City University London; Universidad de San Andres Argentina; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Montes-Rojas, G (通讯作者)，City Univ London, 10 Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",Gabriel.Montes-Rojas.1@city.ac.uk,"Acosta, Pablo Ariel/AAD-1178-2022; Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/M-4750-2015","Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/0000-0002-8447-4929",,,,,32,8,10,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The findings from 32 interviewees suggest that mobile phones can assist the government of Bangladesh in achieving vision2020 by providing a distribution channel for good governance, poverty alleviation, health, education, human resource and empowerment programs. The opportunities to use mobile phone for rural SMEs sustainability, as a platform for collaborative learning, as a tool for lifelong development for SMEs, are rarely addressed in prior studies. Since most of the prior studies approach mobile phones use for socioeconomic development from the consumer standpoint, this is one of the few papers that collected data from the SMEs to understand their obstacles and also from the service providers, such as government officers, NGOs experts, university teachers, doctors and banker, to provide more insights on the development mechanisms using mobile phones.

Our decision problem is the optimal combination of risky asset and certain asset by maximizing the utility function under the VaR constraint that is limited by a loss proportional to current return. The empirical results show that the VaR constraint decreases the amount invested in risky asset gradually over time. We also note that volatility has a significant impact on the optimal solution. Furthermore, this approach is more appropriate when the investor sets a confidence level high enough and low holding period. In addition, this model allows us to better understand the form of the distribution and offers the advantage to the investor to take account of asymmetric and leptokurtic distributions of stock market returns.

It is believed that the negative result of the austerity measures that were imposed to the countries which have been hit by the sovereign debt crisis create a decisive European issue. The size of the shadow economy in Greece is debateable although there is research that estimates it between 28%-30%. Also, the majority of people in Greece during the current economic crisis are trying to balance the lost part of their income through their participation in the shadow economy. In the previous years, Eurostat had expressed its reservations on the credibility of the quality of the Greek debt and deficit figures. Specifically, Eurostat had publicly expressed doubts on the debt and deficit figures transmitted by the Greek authorities since 2002 by the way of footnotes or specific comments in the press releases where these figures are published. Also, Eurostat continued to express its reservations on the data presented at the notification of March 2004. Because of the present Greek sovereign debt crisis, the authors of this paper present their opinion that part of the shadow economy must be adopted in the Greek GDP and become part of the official economy.

Even if modern Europe offers unprecedented opportunities for young people, they face challenges (aggravated by the economic crisis) related to the education and training systems and to labor market access. Youth unemployment is very high, 22.1% in 2012, while the rate of NEET young people reached 13.1% in the same year. Recently, youth labor markets in Europe recorded an increased number of fixed-term employment or temporary contracts and the tendency to change jobs several times during active life. These phenomena weaken the relationship between employers and employees. The concept of employment vulnerability can be used to describe these relationships. This paper presents a brief characterization of the European Union labor market and an analysis of the features of youth labor market in Romania. It analyzes the structure, education and gender composition of NEET groups before the crisis and its impact, and it estimates, for the NEET population, the economic costs of non-integration in the labor market or in the education system supported by various European countries.

Correct pricing of water helps to improve services for water distribution and also contributes to its preservation. Therefore, the aim of this paper is the presentation of the methods of calculating the environmental and resource cost, their application in a particular study area ( Water Districts of Central and Western Macedonia, Greece) and the conclusions following from the estimations. After extensive literature review it was found that there is not a perfectly acceptable method of calculating the environmental and resource cost of water. What is more, the pricing of water use is necessary because water use requires actions having a direct economic cost, as well as 'external' costs to society such as the environmental and resource cost. Prices in a justified pricing model should reflect the recovery of full cost aiming at maximizing social welfare, preventing the exploitation of resources and securing access to water to the socially vulnerable members of society.

This study tries to understand the situations in which an application of goal setting theory might lead to unethical behaviour. Literature has shown that one of the possible factors influencing the relationship between goal setting and unethical behaviour is the way in which goals are set. Interviews with staff directly involved with the goal setting process in a large Maltese bank indicated that a lack of employee participation in the goal setting process and the way in which rewards were tied to goal achievement could lead to unethical behaviour when promoting financial products. Personality was also suggested as a factor influencing the possibility of engaging in unethical behaviour in this context. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We test the random walk hypothesis first using unit root tests and variance ratio test and secondly by looking at autocorrelation of returns. A GARCH analysis is perform to test the autocorrelation, while rolling window estimation tests the stability of coefficients over time. We expect that the market is efficient when we use daily data. When we use intra-day data the results are in line with daily data only in random walk approach.

It is a popular view to see the state as a political entrepreneur who introduces a certain environmental policy instrument, e.g. feed-in tariffs for renewable energies, and thus becomes the world market leader or the lead market for the respective technology. Against this background, this paper wants to find out if the idea of first mover advantages can be justified by theories and empirical evidence from the relevant literature on business administration, innovation, environmental and development economics. A review of theoretical and empirical studies at the firm level shows that first mover advantages are not confirmed by empirical evidence. The successful innovator is not necessarily the first but very often one of the early movers within the competition of different innovation designs. Studies carried out at the national level give however only anecdotical evidence on the existence of lead market patterns. However, with regard to emerging countries, there is as well anecdotical evidence on successful latecomers, i.e. states that follow a strategy of environmental leapfrogging. The question under which conditions a country may switch from a second mover to a first mover strategy can't be answered by the existing literature. This paper argues that it seems to be more reasonable to complement a lead market strategy by a lead supplier position. The lead supplier strategy corrects for the problem that the domestic industry may not participate sufficiently from the growth of the national market due to the demand advantage. It considers also goals from industrial policy, which play an important role also within latecomer strategies in emerging countries.","[Cleff, Thomas] Pforzheim Univ, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Cleff, Thomas; Rennings, Klaus] Mannheim Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),,thomas.cleff@hs-pforzheim.de; rennings@zew.de,,,,,,,59,2,2,0,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,164,189,,,,,,26,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000012,0

Econometric analysis of these processes, utilising specialised methods and models, facilitates deeper understanding of the spatial distribution of the indicators under study, and often allows discovering new, previously unseen dimensions of regional demographic and socio-economic development problems and opportunities.

As people have many opportunities to express their opinions using various on-line channels (e. g., discussions, microblogs, social networks), the question is whether such data might be used for this purpose. Information hidden in the data includes the reasons why people perceive products or services as good or bad, what are the reasons of clients' satisfaction or dissatisfaction, or what affects their sentiment. However, having the needed large amounts of data, it is hardly possible to process it manually. This paper presents a method that aims at automatic discovery of sources of human feelings hidden in textual messages that clients produce. For a demonstration, messages having a form of freely written reviews containing subjective evaluation of medical services were used. During analysis of the data, clusters representing groups of the whole reviews (or individual sentences) with a certain requested degree of similarity were created in an unsupervised manner. Then, a decision tree classifier was trained in order to find attributes (words) of the reviews that were significant for assigning the reviews to the clusters.

In classical models, blockholders exert governance through direct intervention in a firm's operations, otherwise known as voice. These theories have motivated empirical research on the determinants and consequences of activism. More recent models show that blockholders can govern through an alternative mechanism known as exit-selling their shares if the manager underperforms. These theories give rise to new empirical studies on the two-way relationship between blockholders and financial markets, linking corporate finance with asset pricing. Blockholders may also worsen governance by extracting private benefits of control or pursuing objectives other than firm value maximization. I highlight the empirical challenges in identifying causal effects of and on blockholders as well as the typical strategies attempted to achieve identification.

Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical background of the paper relies on the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) hypothesis, while the econometric methodology is mainly based on a nonlinear two-regime Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) unit root test. Findings - The main finding is that China's price competitiveness was not constantly following a disequilibrium process. The two-regime threshold model shows that PPP equilibrium was confirmed in periods of relatively high - compared to the estimated threshold - rate of real yuan appreciation. Moreover, it is implied that the fixed exchange rate regime cannot ensure external balance since it can neither establish equilibrium in the foreign exchange market, nor confirm that China's international competitiveness adjustment follows an equilibrium process. Practical implications - The results do not imply that China acts as a currency manipulator. However, a main policy implication of the paper is that China should continue appreciating the yuan to establish external balance. Originality/value - This paper is the first which accounts for a nonlinear two-regime process toward a threshold, which is defined to be the rate of change in China's international competitiveness. Consequently, the paper draws attention to the role of China's international competiveness in accepting the PPP hypothesis.","[Giannellis, Nikolaos] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon, Greece; [Kouretas, Georgios P.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",University of Crete; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Giannellis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon, Greece.",giannellis@uoc.gr,"Kouretas, Georgios/AAM-7045-2021; Giannellis, Nikolaos/AAE-5084-2021","Kouretas, Georgios/0000-0001-5459-7824;",,,,,38,2,2,0,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78350-756-6; 978-1-78350-755-9,INT SYMP EC,,,2014,23.0,,,,,,153,183,,10.1108/S1571-038620140000023006,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358526100006,0

This paper analyses data collected from: (i) financial statements of 37 Vietnam's commercial bank; and (ii) responses to the questionaires surveyed for the reality of deposits-loan maturity mismatch for the period from 2007 to 2012. The survey questionaires are developed on the ground of a maturity mismatch management which is embedded in the liquidity risk management introduced via 17 principles of Basel's liquidity risk management. The results indicate that 37 Vietnam's commercial banks have heavily relied on short-term deposits to finance long-term loans. As a consequence, loan-deposits maturity mismatch for the banks is unavoidable. The paper also provides a summary of typical financial indicators adopted in academic studies in relation to a maturity mismatch, including loan-to deposit ratio (LDR); deposit-in-interbank market ratio; short-term deposit; and medium-to-long term loan ratio. It is argued that the causes of the maturity mismatch come from interest rate; macroeconomic environment; and the banks themselves.

The objective of the buying organization is to ensure corn sweeteners are purchased so as to minimize the total operational cost. To do so, the purchasing department compared the conventional method of a sealed-bid auction to, first, a reverse auction with single-item bids and, then, to a reverse auction with bundled bids. The senior author-as director of corporate purchasing-researched, proposed and executed the combinatorial auction to source corn sweeteners for a large, processed-meat manufacturer who uses large quantities of four corn sweeteners at its eight processing plants located across the United States. Two buying techniques were - electronic reverse auctions and combinatorial reverse electronic auctions. First, we present the difficulties of using a reverse combinatorial auction and describe the method used to obtain the least cost combination of bids that satisfies buyer's RFQ. Second, we show the progression of the bidding rounds and estimate the savings from this combinatorial auction as compared to what the company did with either a manual or a reverse single item auction. Finally, we address the diminishing marginal returns of repeated usage of CeRA, and describe how this food company advanced from the auction setting to a risk-management-based procurement process.","[Harris, Keith D.; Biere, Arlo W.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Harris, KD (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 311J Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",kdharris@ksu.edu; biere@ksu.edu,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,4,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

As with the changing international interpretation of food security over the past four decades, South African food security determinants have been interpreted differently by different ruling authorities and governments over three centuries. The Natives Land Act of 1913 played a significant role in determining the food security context of the country in terms of the character, composition and contribution of the agricultural sector, shaped consumption patterns and determined rural livelihoods. While food security is expressed as a national objective in a plethora of strategies and programmes, no formal evaluation has been carried out of the food security impact of these programmes, and there is a dire lack of coordination and no enforceable policy to ensure food security. Any national food security policy will need a framework of enforceable legislative measures and statutory coordination and reporting. This article explores the current national and household food security and nutrition situation in South Africa, and it offers recommendations for a comprehensive food security policy.","[Hendriks, Sheryl] Univ Pretoria, Inst Food Nutr & Well Being, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Hendriks, Sheryl] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Hendriks, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Inst Food Nutr & Well Being, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",sheryl.hendriks@up.ac.za,"Hendriks, Sheryl L/E-6537-2010","Hendriks, Sheryl L/0000-0002-1487-4302",,,,,56,39,48,5,36,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2014,53.0,2,,,,,1,24,,10.1080/03031853.2014.915468,0.0,,,24,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AS5HJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344302100001,0

The objective was to highlight good practices, identify gaps and useful recommendations (within an up-to-date and comprehensive context) to achieve disaster resilient governance. The EWS components; Infrastructure, Risk Knowledge (i.e. Hazard, Vulnerability and Risk Assessment), Preparedness and Early Warning Dissemination, Disaster Response and Coordination were scrutinised. These components were compared against the exemplary structure of a people-centred EWS to assess its efficacy in achieving disaster resilience. Since the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami was the first contemporary large-scale disaster faced by Sri Lanka, it lacked the legislative framework and institutional capacity to respond and only thereafter the integration of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) was observed. The importance of training was demonstrated within risk knowledge, preparedness and early warning dissemination, and disaster response and coordination. Thereby training is considered crucial in achieving a progressive, people-centred EWS. However it can be consolidated through joint resource utilisation (particularly personnel) between organisations and creating a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) certification system. There has been considerable progress in integrating DRR into development at all levels, which is a key measure in achieving disaster resilience. It was notably observed in achieving disaster resilient development, climate change adaptation and DRR was integrated despite a general tendency to be polarised in other areas. Despite some existing projects there is a need for greater government and private sector engagement in ecosystem-based DRR. Finally to achieve a disaster resilient Sri Lankan EWS, risk transfer measures require further evaluation. The emergence of some disaster risk financing and insurance is observed but issues, such as assuring applicability to a local context and scientific, evidence-based underpinning, need to be addressed.

We report evidence of significant spatial variations in education employment shares and in the college wage premium for US states and MSAs, and show that the pattern of shifts through time has resulted in increased spatial inequality. Because relative supply of college versus high school educated workers has risen faster at the spatial level in places with higher initial supply levels, we also report a strong persistence and increased inequality of spatial relative demand. Bigger relative demand increases are observed in more technologically advanced states that have experienced faster increases in R&D and computer usage, and in states where union decline has been fastest. Finally, we show the increased concentration of more educated workers into particular spatial locations and rising spatial wage inequality are important features of labour market polarization, as they have resulted in faster employment growth in high skill occupations, but also in a higher demand for low wage workers in low skill occupations. Overall, our spatial analysis complements research findings from labour economics on wage inequality trends and from urban economics on agglomeration effects connected to education and technology.

Many studies have been conducted to examine the benefits and impacts of hubbing from an economic perspective. However, its impact on CO2 emissions, especially across different air spaces, is not well understood. This paper explores the impact of hubbing activities in air transport from an environmental perspective. With a detailed methodology and data from the Greek and Hong Kong/Sanya flight information regions (FIRS), three levels of CO2 emissions are estimated: airport-based, airspace-based and flight-based. After contrasting the CO2 emission efficiencies of Athens International Airport (ALA) and the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), aircraft type and flight distance are examined to explain their emission efficiency differences. It is found that HKIA is associated with poorer CO2 emission efficiency at the airport and airspace levels because of the larger aircraft and longer flight distance. However, when CO2 emission efficiency at the flight level is considered, HKIA, with a higher passenger load factor, performs better. Major international hub airports should implement additional environmental measures to minimize the impact of hubbing activities on CO2 emissions at the airport and airspace levels.

Based on earlier theoretical work for the monetary transmission mechanism one can argue that changes in monetary policy should produce differentiated effects on firms and stocks with different characteristics. By using different portfolio sorts the results show that the impact of monthly changes in the Federal funds rate is greater for the returns of more financially constrained stocks (e.g., small and value stocks) than on the returns of stocks with a more favorable financial position (e.g., large and growth stocks). By using a VAR methodology, the results indicate that the negative effect of Fed funds rate shocks on stock returns comes from a corresponding negative effect on future expected cash flows (cash-flow news), which is stronger than the impact on future equity risk premia (discount rate news). Thus, cash-flow news is the main return component affected by changes in the Fed funds rate. These results are reasonably robust to different VAR specifications. Moreover, the dispersion in return responses to monetary shocks across stocks is explained by a similar dispersion in the effects into cash-flow news, which outweighs the dispersion in discount rate news betas. These results represent new evidence on the effect of monetary policy on stock prices and on the monetary transmission mechanism.","Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki, Finland",Hanken School of Economics,"Maio, P (通讯作者)，Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki, Finland.",,"Maio, Paulo/E-5124-2013",,,,,,83,43,50,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

For labour proponents, this is an exciting prospect. This article argues that despite its promise for expanding workers' capabilities, certain ambiguities potentially impede the approach's utility, particularly in developing countries.

Our results show that the current account deficits had an income convergence effect in the area, more specifically they contributed to a higher economic growth in the countries with lower levels of initial GDP per capita. As a consequence, compliance with the indicative thresholds established by the European Commission through the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure - according to which the current account balances should be maintained within the range (-4% GDP, +6% GDP) - would be equivalent to a maximum value of the convergence parameter of -1.833. However, exceeding the lower limit of the interval (of -4% GDP), through the increase in the current account deficits, would lead to gains on the income convergence side within the European Union. The implications are important for the Central and Eastern European economies. Our results suggest that a more appropriate approach of net capital flows, and thus of current account imbalances, would be their regulation in order to avoid overheating and to limit the adverse impact of volatility, rather than their direct limitation.

It is without doubt that evaluating the efficiency of cohesion funding is going to be one of the key elements of the Cohesion Policy implementation in near future. However, to perform proper evaluation and use modern methods it is necessary to have a robust and complex database which allows researchers and policy makers to utilize modern data-demanding methods.

A cointegration technique is largely used in macroeconomic modelling. This technique simply provides an effective formal framework used for estimating, testing and modelling long-run relationships from time series data. Particularly, described in this paper is the estimation procedures of the techniques which have received more attention in the recent applied literature. This paper explores the use of a Vector autoregressive model, augmented by an error correction term to model the gross domestic product - agricultural production nexus. Time series data spanning 1990 QI to 2014 Q4 sourced from the South African Reserve Bank and the Department of Agriculture are used. Exhibited by the model is an insignificant model showing a long run relationship between the variables over the past 13 years. The ECM confirms that for the system to go back to equilibrium, about 80% of adjustment may be effected per year. No causal relationship between the variables has been reported. Due to the findings urgent attention must be paid to agricultural sector, lest we find ourselves with no food in the country. The government is urged to farmers with farming resources to ensure the viability of this sector. Emerging farmers must also be equipped with proper farming skills. Not only will this boost the economy of the country, this may also help eradicate rather high unemployment and poverty levels in the country.

Initially, mobile applications were intended mostly for entertainment and were simple applications for personal use. Over time, they have evolved into sophisticated business-world functions, thus becoming an unavoidable trend in marketing activities. It is estimated there are 800,000 mobile applications on the market, with an incredible range of content.

The first cluster analysis provided a strong separation of the sample in three clusters labelled as weak, fair and strong group with respect to self-assessed IT competencies. The second cluster analysis produced also three distinct clusters that are labelled as skeptic, average and enthusiast group with regard to the importance of IT competencies for HR managers. Cross-tabulation of the two sets of 3-cluster solutions reveals interesting patterns. First, four group out of six, the strong group and the enthusiast group as well as the fair group and the average group exhibit a stronger constancy over the level of IT competencies and the perceived importance of IT competencies for HR managers. Of those with strong or fair level of IT competencies, 50% are enthusiasts or averages with regard to the importance of IT for HR managers.

Especially for higher education institutions, this is the optimum time to respond to market demands by accepting the call for innovation in their curricula. In the new economic background, higher education institutions are now in the position of becoming one of the drivers of business competitiveness and economic growth.

It is based on panel data for the period from 2003 to 2012. Data Envelopment Analysis has become a popular approach in measuring the efficiency of banking industry. We use the DEA window analysis based on an input oriented model to measure banking efficiency. In the analysed period, the average efficiency under constant return to scale reached 70-78 % and average efficiency under variable return to scale reached 84-89 %. The most efficient bank was GE Money Bank and the lowest efficient bank was Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka. The group of large bank (Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, Ceska sporitelna and Komercni banka) was lower efficient than other banks in the banking industry. The reasons of the inefficiency of the group of large banks were the excess of deposits in balance sheet and inappropriate size of operation.

Bigger food manufacturers and retailers, although cautious, are more capable than smaller size enterprises in implementing relevant investment strategies. All food system actors, from agribusinesses to consumers and policymakers, need to play a role in furthering the initiative.","[Samoggia, Antonella; Bertazzoli, Aldo] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Arvola, Anne] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, FI-02044 Espoo, Finland; [Gurinovic, Mirjana] Univ Belgrade, Ctr Res Excellence Nutr & Metab, Inst Med Res, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Hendrixson, Vaiva] Vilnius Univ, Fac Med, Dept Physiol Biochem Microbiol & Lab Med, LT-03101 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Rivaroli, Sergio; Ruggeri, Arianna] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci, I-40127 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; VTT Technical Research Center Finland; University of Belgrade; Vilnius University; University of Bologna,"Samoggia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci, Viale Fanin 50, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",antonella.samoggia@unibo.it; anne.arvola@vtt.fi; aldo.bertazzoli@unibo.it; arianna.ruggeri3@unibo.it; mirjana.gurinovic@gmail.com; vaiva.hendrixson@mf.vu.lt; sergio.rivaroli@unibo.it,"ruggeri, arianna/U-3285-2019; ruggeri, arianna/Q-5101-2018; Rivaroli, Sergio/C-5570-2016; Samoggia, Antonella/AAU-1052-2020","ruggeri, arianna/0000-0002-2078-2703; Rivaroli, Sergio/0000-0002-7220-223X; Samoggia, Antonella/0000-0003-3930-6173; Gurinovic, Mirjana/0000-0002-8649-6267",EC FP7,EC FP7(European Union (EU)),"This investigation was carried out within the framework of the EC FP7 funded project 'CHANCE - Low cost technologies and traditional ingredients for the production of affordable, nutritionally correct foods improving health in population groups at-risk-of-poverty' (www.chancefood.eu).",,52,8,8,1,22,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Consumption research in general, and consumer behavior research in particular are based on the assumption that consumption is more than just functional problem solving and products and brands have significant meaning, therefore they can be utilized as symbols in the cultural ecosystem. However the meaning of a specific brand can be confusing because it would presume a shared knowledge among customers about the brand as a symbol. In our paper we review the contradicting findings in the literature about the symbolic meaning of a brand, and we suppose a new reference point in order to dissolve the above mentioned conflict. According to our understanding the symbolic meaning of a brand shall be examined specifically at brand communities and not in general. In our paper we examine several brands that are surrounded with significant communities (Harley Davidson, Apple, BMW, etc). Based on these practical examples we identify the nature and structure of brand communities. Our aim is to sum up our findings in a theoretical model that distinguishes the different type of brand communities according to their main cohesive force. In the model at one end we find image based brand communities where the brand image is the main cohesive force, while at the other end we find the brand-subcultures (or brand-cults) where the members are more committed to each other than towards the brand. Peculiar symbolic brand-meanings can be identified among these brand communities, which makes them appropriate fields for symbolic consumer research, that leads to several managerial implications concerning brand loyalty and brand community building.","[Szabolcs, Pronay] Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, 1 Kalvaria Av, Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Szabolcs, P (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, 1 Kalvaria Av, Szeged, Hungary.",pronay.szabolcs@eco.u-szeged.hu,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,9,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,603,+,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200044,0

Numerous companies have known a significant drop of their running costs due to the efficient coping with distribution networks. Therefore, several studies in operational research area are interested in modeling and solving transportation problems, especially vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Due to the NP-Hardness of VRPs, various state-of-the-art metaheuristics were developed to generate near-optimal solutions in a reasonable computational time. Against this background, we study in this paper the capacitated vehicle routing problem with distance constraints (DCVRP) consisting in deriving the most favorable vehicle pathways that minimize the vehicles traveled distances subject to system requirements. The set of vehicles, based on a central depot, has a maximum weight capacity and can travel up to an allowed maximum distance. To tackle the DCVRP, we formulate it as an integer-programming problem and propose a hybrid swarm-based metaheuristic, named PSO-VNS, which integrates a variable neighborhood search within the particle swarm optimization. Results conducted on benchmark instances show that the proposed PSO-VNS approach is highly competitive, compared to existing solution approaches, and converges to promising solutions.

This field of research is still young, with no more than two decades of more intensive empirical research, which has confirmed the relevance of intangible-based elements on achieving a competitive edge in virtually every industry. Taxonomy and classifications of intangible elements have been built from either deductive or inductive methods. And also practitioners are more concerned and convinced that intangible elements are a key in the today's competition, more than ever before. However, a categorization of approaches followed by scholars is still missed. The categorization proposed in this article will allow a more in-depth understanding of how intangible elements may help to achieve a competitive advantage, either from a theoretical or an empirical perspective. In addition, it will provide further information on how the different intertwined approaches relate to each other and, hence, it will help scholars and practitioners to gain a further understanding of how to implement intangible-based strategies more successfully. With these goals in mind, a search on the main databases was conducted (namely, ISI-Web of Knowledge and Scopus). Up to 4,308 different articles dealing somehow with intangible assets were found. In this paper, the title and keywords are analyzed and the content is categorized in six different themes: Knowledge Management refers to IA and its consequences in the Knowledge cycle; Intellectual Capital refers to IAs as mainly the knowledge-based economic value, divided into Human Capital, Relational Capital and Structural Capital; Human Resource Development refers to IAs as organizational learning; Economics deals with the micro and macroeconomic consequences of IAs and with the market of IAs; by Social Policy we mean IAs investment considered as a commodity which have social benefits and which are managed by social operators; and finally the Management and Accountability, where the quite old fashioned view is addressed according to which IAs are strategic resources that must be accounted for and valued for money. This article is part of a wider research in order to finally obtain an assessment of each facet by organizations. In this current stage, the six facets are theoretically justified from extant literature, prior to undertake a survey among organizations in a near future. Being each of the six approaches equally relevant, we will check whether a discrepancy exists between the theoretical relevance of each perspective and the relevance given by organizations in practice. We believe this paper addresses a new and decisive area in the field of intangible analysis, and of course in KM. The managerial contribution of this investigation relates with a better understanding on how intangibles should be managed strategically to compete successfully in the ever changing competitive landscape. Scholars will benefit from a more clear taxonomy and mapping of concepts related with intangibles to find research avenues in order to integrate empirical results after two decades of intensive evolving research on intangibles.","[Tome, Eduardo] Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gonzalez-Loureiro, Miguel] Univ Vigo, Vigo 36310, Spain",Universidade Europeia; Universidade de Vigo,"Tomé, E (通讯作者)，Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal.",eduardo.tome@clix.pt; mloureiro@uvigo.es,"González-Loureiro, Miguel/F-5027-2010; Tomé, Eduardo LCS/F-2308-2011","González-Loureiro, Miguel/0000-0002-4299-1995;",,,,,33,0,0,0,11,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,255,263,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000032,0

Due to the social nature of entrepreneurial activities, previous research studies have also highlighted the importance of emotional intelligence in the prediction of networking behaviour. To verify this statement, an online survey was conducted to obtain further evidence of the relation between emotional intelligence and proactive networking.

So far, empirical studies have mainly examined the influence of knowledge management ( KM) on innovation and have identified KM success factors. The underlying assumption is that more KM leads to more innovation and an improved corporate success. Therefore, a thorough KM application is recommended. Little attention has been paid to the question which level of KM application is effective and efficient for a company. This paper tries to close this gap using the concept of KM maturity. It investigates if different KM maturity levels can be identified in corporate practice and in how far they are influenced by specific factors, e.g. company size. To answer the research questions, exploratory case studies were conducted through semi-structured qualitative interviews with representatives from ten northern German companies. The results show that the practical applicability of KM maturity models is still limited. None of the companies can be categorized to have a high KM maturity level despite their multiple use of KM tools. As influence factors the size of a company and an externally certified quality management were identified. Other factors like the industry, R&D spending, and the kind of products or services offered do not reveal a clear impact. The paper contributes to the understanding of KM maturity and its influence factors and thus provides the foundation for further empirical research. Moreover, the findings help organisations to position their KM efforts.","[Vanini, Ute; Bochert, Saskia] Univ Appl Sci Kiel, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Vanini, U (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",ute.vanini@fh-kiel.de; saskia.bochert@fh-kiel.de,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,293,301,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000036,0

A risk is the potential to cause crisis, an emergency, a disaster and/or a catastrophe. The definition of risk acceptability is not technical but value driven. This definition is determined at two levels: at the individual level and at the state level. Every citizen decides what kind of risk he is willing to take in his daily life (his choice of transportation, his choice to smoke or to drink alcohol, etc.). The government, on the other side, is setting risk acceptability limits on a societal level (example: speed limits, laws regulating construction areas and density, etc.). The historical experience of a society will affect the way that it view risks and crisis. This article deals with seismic risk perception and communication in Portugal. A survey carried out resourcing to a questionnaire was developed to assess the knowledge on seismic risk perception and awareness in the Algarve region. Two questionnaires were developed: i) General Public, ii) Professional and Technical (engineers and architects). Results were treated statistically and thoroughly analysed and commented. Risk communication can influence communities to become aware of risks and it has a powerful influence on people's risk decision-making and behaviour. Risk communication has several objectives. It has the role to prevent risks, to reduce them and to make communities aware of the risks in order to develop their capacities, enhance communication and resilience to respond to crisis events.

To assess the effectiveness of clawback provisions, we examine their impact from debtholders' point of view. We find that banks use more financial covenants and performance pricing provisions in the loan contracts and decrease interest rates after firms initiate clawbacks. Moreover, we also find that loan maturity increases and loan collateral decreases subsequent to clawback adoption. Taken together, our findings indicate that firm-initiated clawback provisions enhance financial reporting quality, thereby reducing the information uncertainty that financing providers face.

Both under- and overvalued stocks identified by this misvaluation measure exhibit greater valuation uncertainty and arbitrage difficulty, and the misvaluation measure strongly predicts stock returns incremental to size, book-to-market ratio, past returns, and various return anomalies. Based on the misvaluation measure, we form a misvaluation factor and find that stock return covariances with this factor possess significant and robust return predictive power. We further show that the misvaluation factor predicts future economic conditions, providing additional insight into the real effect of systematic misvaluation in the stock market.

We estimate both a cost and an alternative profit frontier on an unbalanced panel of UK commercial banks over the period 2001-2012. The intensity of competition through product innovation is proxied by the trademark intensity (i.e. the ratio between the number of trademarks registered in a given year by all the commercial banks - net of the trademarks registered by the bank under observation - and the employment in the sector) in the commercial banking sector. Our results show that the (lagged) trademark intensity in the commercial banking sector does affect negatively the mean cost and profit efficiency in the sector but there is evidence that as trademark intensity increases in the sector, commercial banks react by improving their cost and profit efficiency.

J,"Kim, J",,,,"Kim, Jinwon",,,Financial repression and housing investment: An analysis of the Korean chonsei,JOURNAL OF HOUSING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Chonsei; Korean housing market; Financial repression; Household saving; Tenure choice,TENURE; WEALTH,"South Korea has a unique kind of rental contract, called chonsei. The tenant pays an upfront deposit, typically from 40% to 70% of the property value, to the landlord, and the landlord repays the deposit to the tenant upon contract termination. The tenant is not required to make any periodic monthly rental payments. The main goal of this paper is to show why such a unique rental contract exists and has been popular in Korea. The model shows that chonsei is an ingenious market response in the era of financial repression in Korea (Renaud, 1989), allowing landlords to accumulate sufficient funds for housing investment without major reliance on a mortgage. The model also shows that the tenant, who suffers from insufficient mortgage borrowings, can access cheaper rental housing via chonsei than when only monthly rental housing is available. The model predicts that the chonsei system should fade out when arbitrage gains from housing investment disappear. An implication of the model is that the chonsei renter may save while the landlord and the owner-occupier put all their assets into housing and thus have no financial savings. This hypothesis is empirically tested and confirmed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In instances with a sufficiently large settlement bonus, truthful revelation emerges as the dominant strategy. However previous work (Parco 8.2 Rapoport, 2004) has experimentally tested this Bonus Effect and found that although the presence of a settlement bonus improves efficiency, behavior falls drastically short of the normative predictions. This finding illustrates the persistent tendency of decision makers to bid strategically, i.e. shading their bids, even when truthful revelation is a strictly dominant strategy. Herein we investigate the influence of the framing of information and look for ways to nudge decision makers toward making better choices in these strategic environments. Additional results from an adaptive reinforcement-based learning model are discussed as they relate to a potential innate bias for strategic misrepresentation even when contrary to self-interest and collective-interest.

The emergence of a wide array of global terminal operators has led to a differentiation in entry strategies driven by their respective objectives and by factors exogenous to the firm. This paper looks at antecedent factors that play a role in a company's entry strategy in a public-private partnership (PPP) setting by performing binomial logistic regression on a large sample of container terminal deals over the period 2002-2010. More specifically, it analyses to what extent firm-specific, external, project and cross-cultural factors play a decisive role in the choice between direct PPPs (i.e. stepping into a new PPP arrangement such as a new concession agreement) and indirect PPPs (i.e. stepping into an existing PPP arrangement through acquisitions). The empirical findings demonstrate the pivotal role of some firm specific characteristics (market experience and business model), external factors (host country development and market openness, government effectiveness, market concentration degree, and market saturation) and project-related factors (project size, number of partners involved, and equity joint venture with the Port Authority), also unveiling some preliminary results in relation to cross-cultural variables.

(J Bioecon 9(1):39-51, 2007) was the first comprehensive database that presents average annual ex-vessel prices for all commercially exploited marine fish stocks by nationality of the fishing fleet. It contained over 30,000 reported price items, covering the period from 1950 to the present, and supplemented missing prices with estimates based on prices from a different year, species group or fleet nationality. This paper describes a revised missing price estimation approach, focused on the computation of annual average international prices for each species group, adjusted to domestic prices using the real exchange rate based on national purchasing power parity. Key advantages of the new approach are that it allows a larger number of reported prices to be used in the price estimation, and accounts for relative price level differences that exist between countries. Our new approach should improve the estimates in regions where reported prices are scarce or non-existent by linking domestic prices to the trends in international prices. Our analysis, based on the revised ex-vessel price estimates (in real 2005 USD), shows that the global marine fisheries landings have generated total value of USD 4.2 trillion since 1950, including USD 100 billion in 2005.","[Swartz, Wilf; Sumaila, Rashid; Watson, Reg] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Swartz, W (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",w.swartz@fisheries.ubc.ca; r.sumaila@fisheries.ubc.ca; r.watson@fisheries.ubc.ca,"Sumaila, U.

This theory implies a negative relationship between the extent of direct democracy and the size of the country's shadow economy. We also theorize that direct democracy has a greater effect in reducing the informal sector when the former is at low or intermediate values and when the electoral system is characterized by a larger district magnitude.

It presents estimates of a model of banking behaviour that encompasses switching costs as well as cross-selling of loans and off-balance sheet transactions. The evidence from panel estimation of the model indicates that the consumer faced high switching costs in the loan market in the latter part of the sample period, as a result of weaker competitiveness in the loan market. Additionally, the weaker competitiveness in the loan market appears to facilitate the cross-selling behaviour of British banks, which helps explain the rapid growth of non-interest income during the last two decades.

Shift-share analysis is used to show that changes in value added per hour worked in these countries appear to be mainly due to positive developments (rising productivity) within single industries and only to a lower extent result from a shift towards higher productivity activities. Trade is found to be an important positive determinant of intra-industry productivity growth in European countries.

The empirical findings reveal that the regime-switching combination forecasts of excess returns deliver consistent out-of-sample forecasting gains relative to the historical average and the Rapach et al. (2010) combination forecasts. The findings also reveal that two regimes are related to the business cycle. Based on the business cycle explanation of regimes, excess returns are found to be more predictable during economic contractions than during expansions.

Consistent with existing literature, results indicate that a set of portfolios obtain levels of performance during certain months, especially December, that are significantly different from the rest of the months. However, when the relationship between seasonal patterns and previous performance is analyzed, results suggest that top performers during the year experience a penalization in the performance of December. This finding can be explained for different reasons such as window dressing practices and a negative influence of high investment inflows during this month. Nevertheless, the observed decrease in the volatility level at the end of the year seems to suggest that managers follow their benchmarks more closely when they have to report their portfolio returns.","[Andreu, Laura; Ortiz, Cristina; Luis Sarto, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Andreu, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza, Spain.",landreu@unizar.es,"Ortiz, Cristina/AAP-7537-2020; , LAURA/K-5620-2017","Ortiz, Cristina/0000-0003-3275-5814; , LAURA/0000-0003-3661-5448",,,,,18,2,4,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

In addition, this study shows that YICs can be differentiated from New Technology-Based Firms and small, young firms in terms of growth, pointing to the importance of combining the individual properties characterizing YICs, that is being young (< 6 years), small (< 250 employees), and R&D intensive (R&D intensity > 15%).

This finding is contrary to much of the literature about the risk premium. We demonstrate that for a range of plausible stochastic tax burdens, the coefficient of relative risk aversion for REIT shareholders is likely to fall within the interval of 4.3-6.3, values significantly lower than those previously reported for real estate and other asset markets.","[Edelstein, Robert H.; Magin, Konstantin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Edelstein, RH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",edelstei@haas.berkeley.edu; magin@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,27,5,5,1,14,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

The implied liquidity X of any financial instrument is determined such that both model prices fit as well as possible the bid and ask market quotes. It reflects the liquidity of the financial instrument: the lower the X, the higher the liquidity. The aim of this paper is to study the evolution of the implied liquidity pre- and post-crisis under a wide range of models and to study implied liquidity time series which could give an insight for future stochastic liquidity modeling. In particular, we perform a maximum likelihood estimation of the CIR, Vasicek and CEV mean-reverting processes applied to liquidity and volatility time series. The results show that implied liquidity is far less persistent than implied volatility as the liquidity process reverts much faster to its long-run mean. Moreover, a comparison of the parameter estimates between the pre- and post-credit crisis periods indicates that liquidity tends to decrease and increase for long and short term options, respectively, during troubled periods.

We use a static model on financial institutions' risk-taking behavior to quantify the systemic risk in the cross-sectional dimension in both regulated and unregulated systems. Although imposing a capital requirement can lower individual risk, it simultaneously enhances systemic linkage within the system. By using a proper systemic risk measure combining both individual risk and systemic linkage, we show that systemic risk in a regulated system can be higher than that in an unregulated system. In addition, we analyze a sufficient condition under which the systemic risk in a regulated system is always lower. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Increases in producers' hedging demand or speculators' capital constraints increase hedging costs via price-pressure on futures. These in turn affect producers' equilibrium hedging and supply decision inducing a link between a financial friction in the futures market and the commodity spot prices. Consistent with the model, measures of producers' propensity to hedge forecasts futures returns and spot prices in oil and gas market data from 1979 to 2010. The component of the commodity futures risk premium associated with producer hedging demand rises when speculative activity reduces.

Using data that is more comprehensive in coverage than that used in the existing research the stylized facts of the capital structure literature for large and listed firms is confirmed, but contrasting evidence is obtained for smaller companies. First, the country of incorporation carries much more information for small firms, supporting the idea that small firms are more financially constrained and face non-firm-specific hurdles in their capital structure choice.

But does easier access to public equity really translate into superior real performance? We explore this issue by focusing on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), a junior segment of the London Stock Exchange that has experienced long-lasting growth in capitalization. The ability of AIM to nurture the growth of its listed companies is assessed by comparing the growth rates of AIM-listed and private manufacturing companies between 1997 and 2009. We use econometric methods that allow the treatment effect of being listed on AIM, related to fund raising and supervision by Nominated Advisers (Nomads), to be disentangled from selection effects. After controlling for endogeneity of the listing choice, the results show that AIM selects companies with superior performance in terms of operating revenues and total assets growth, and that it is able to nurture the growth of employees of its listed companies. Yet we detect a negative treatment effect of AIM on productivity, suggesting that growth in employees is not matched by superior growth in value added. We conjecture that financialization lies behind this result; hence, if the goal of policy-makers is to achieve successful industrial performance, their endorsement of lightly regulated stock markets may be misplaced.","[Revest, Valerie] Univ Lyon 2, TRIANGLE, CNRS UMR 5206, ISH, F-69363 Lyon, France; [Sapio, Alessandro] Univ Napoli Parthenope, DISAE, I-80132 Naples, Italy; [Sapio, Alessandro] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, LEM, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Institut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Securite (INRETS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Paris-VIII; Universite Paul-Valery; Parthenope University Naples; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Sapio, A (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Parthenope, DISAE, Via Gen Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",valerie.revest@univ-lyon2.fr; alessandro.sapio@uniparthenope.it,,"REVEST, Valerie/0000-0002-0083-0106",,,,,74,13,14,0,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The results suggest that the inequality of gross regional domestic product per capita, as indicated by the Williamson index of regional inequality, may increase slightly in times of insignificant estimated speeds of convergence - especially because of the growth of Jakarta. In contrast, changes in the Human Development Index numbers for Indonesia indicate that regional convergence is taking place, although its speed is decreasing.

This effect cannot be explained by borrower or loan officer selection or differences in screening, work load, and experience. However, while the performance gap always exists for female borrowers, female loan officers only gain a performance advantage with male borrowers with experience and do not have an advantage with borrowers that are legal entities.

We use a sample of more than 2500 industrial firms in 18 developed and developing countries that experienced 19 systemic banking crises between 1989 and 2007. The results indicate that banking crises negatively affect firms' intangible investments, which intensifies the economic downturn.

Our main analytical prediction is that misreporting leads to a negative second-order autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression of current earnings on lagged earnings. We also propose a stylized dynamic model of earnings manipulation and demonstrate that both earnings smoothing and target-beating considerations result in the same predictions of negative second-order autocorrelations. Empirically, we find that the distribution of this measure is asymmetric around zero with 27% of the firms having significantly negative estimates. Using this measure, we specify a methodology to estimate the intensity of misreporting and to create estimates of unmanipulated earnings. Our estimates of unmanipulated earnings are more correlated with contemporaneous returns and have higher volatility than reported earnings. With respect to economic magnitude, we find that, in absolute terms, median misreporting is 0.7% of total assets. Moreover, firms in our sample subject to SEC AAERs have significantly higher estimates of manipulation intensity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In 2010, the state of Wisconsin implemented a law that banned smoking in all public places. Using a panel of county-level employment data, I examine the relationship between the implementation of smoking bans in Wisconsin and the subsequent changes in bar and restaurant employment. Using variation in the timing of bans that occurred as a result of four counties that implemented local bans prior to the July 2010 statewide ban, I conduct a difference-in-differences analysis to measure the average treatment effect of implementing a smoking ban in Wisconsin. I find that restaurant employment is not affected and that bar employment is significantly reduced as a result of the smoking ban. I also find that counties with higher levels of smoking prevalence see greater reductions in bar employment when a smoking ban is enacted. Back-of-the-envelope estimates suggest that even though there are employment losses, the benefits of the smoking ban outweigh the costs.

This article aims to shed light on the determinants of central bank communication on fiscal policy by analysing the intensity of central banks' fiscal communication for five central banks (the Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and the Swedish Riksbank) over the period 1999-2011. The ECB communicates intensively on fiscal policies, in a normative way. The other central banks emphasise foreign fiscal developments, fiscal policy as input to forecasts, or the use of government debt instruments in monetary policy operations. The empirical analysis indicates that the financial crisis has overall increased the intensity of central bank communication on fiscal policy. The evolution of the government deficit ratio is a driver of the intensity of fiscal communication in the euro area, the US and Japan, and for Sweden since the start of the crisis, while in the UK its intensity is related to government debt developments as of the start of the crisis.

First, since October 2007 any investor that short sells a firm's stock is prohibited from purchasing shares in the firm's seasoned equity offering (SEO) if the short occurred in the five days prior to the offering (pursuant to an amendment to Rule 105). Previously Rule 105 only disallowed investors from covering a pre-issue short sale with shares purchased in the offering. We hypothesize that the amended rule has the unintended consequence of greater discounting for overnight offers, which are not announced in advance, because the rule excludes some potential buyers and thereby forces underwriters to set lower offer prices to fully distribute the offer. The evidence supports this hypothesis. Second, we examine the impact of the SEC's 2008 Emergency Order that greatly curtails naked short selling on all stocks under its jurisdiction. We find that the Emergency Order is associated with large increases in discounting for offers announced in advance, suggesting that the removal of naked short sellers is associated with reduced pre-SEO pricing efficiency. Taken together, the results imply that recent restrictions on short selling have significant unintended effects on the capital raising process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We are particularly interested in the roles of country-level liquidity and transparency in cross-border acquisitions. Our results show that a typical acquisition deal of a private target is smaller in size, uses cash less frequently for payment, and involves more high-tech firms than that of a public target. Most importantly, we find that acquiring firms are more likely to buy private targets in lower-transparency countries, but the level of market liquidity in the target firm countries has little effect on the target selection. Furthermore, after accounting for the endogeneity bias associated with target selection, country liquidity is no longer a key determinant of acquirer returns in cross-border acquisitions.

Much of this analysis has been carried out within the framework of the economic and social effects of migrants, to both host and home countries. This paper looks at the impact of Lebanese emigrants' homeland relations on air travel demand in a security volatile market. The emphasis is on two particular features: first, the principal impact of liberal air transport policies in facilitating emigrants' home visits; and second, the sensitivity of passenger-GDP relation. The paper pulls together data and other cases on the Lebanese emigration evolution and explains its impacts on the economy as well as on the air transport market in Lebanon. The study findings suggest that in Lebanon and due to the presence of interrelated factors, the variation and the strength of the relationship between traffic levels and GDP are neither consistent nor static. The considerably huge expatriate communities, which are three times greater than the Lebanese residents, are said to defy the negative impact of security instability on the air passenger growth through frequently visiting expats.

While these policies have proven to be highly popular among citizens, initial evaluations of access to these programs indicated they led to a multitude of undesirable child developmental, health, and family outcomes. These research findings ignited substantial controversy and criticism. In this study, we show the robustness of the initial analyses to 1) concerns over whether negative outcomes would vanish over time as suppliers gained experience providing child-care; 2) concerns regarding multiple testing; and 3) concerns that the original estimates measured the causal impact of child-care availability and not child-care attendance. A notable exception is that despite estimated effects stemming from the policy indicating declines in motor-social development scores in Quebec relative to the rest of Canada, our analyses imply that on average attending child-care in Canada leads to a significant increase in this test score. However, our analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in program impacts that occur in response to the Quebec policies and indicates that most of the negative impacts reported in earlier research are driven by children from families who only attended child-care in response to the implementation of this policy.","[Kottelenberg, Michael J.] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kottelenberg, MJ (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",,,,,,,,38,30,31,0,21,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

For the most constrained firms leasing (debt) is negatively (positively) related to internal funds and for the less constrained firms the results are just the opposite. Our findings support the hypothesis that constrained firms tend to choose leasing over debt financing.

Our empirical analysis reveals that the attitudes of enterprise unions toward downsizing have changed since 1997. Before 1997, firms with strong unions, i.e., those affiliated with the federation, were likely to maintain employment until firms experienced two consecutive years of losses/deficits. However, after 1997, these firms tended to implement downsizing actions before they suffered deficits. These results suggest that the changes in the stances of the unions brought about changes in employment adjustment behaviors. The change in unions' attitudes after 1997 is interpreted as being caused by the no-layoff policy, which was strongly associated with priority on job security over profitability. Moreover, downsizing was implemented with the consent of union members,, and the cooperative relationship between unions and the management was maintained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

LDB implies that a country can increase its productivity-increasing skill level by competitive devaluation, which happens at the expense of the neighbour if the Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied. If measured by the cumulative change in output after 12 quarters, LBD increases the harmful effect of competitive devaluation on foreign output by 85-125%.

Our main finding is that of a non-convergence between the two sectors. Confronted with organisational changes, civil servants express a declining involvement whereas in the private sector these changes are associated with the development or at least the maintenance of work involvement. Furthermore, private sector employees report that their feeling of fair work recognition decreases with the intensity of computer changes and deteriorates when changes in management tools reach a high level, but these effects are weakened by the joint presence of changes in both areas. It is almost the opposite that is observed in the public sector, with a negative effect of managerial changes that is lessened when their intensity grows and a combination of changes in both areas that strengthens most of the time the perception of an effort-reward imbalance. These results hold if we take into account both the voluntary selection of employees in each sector and the labour force turnover observed in the private sector. We finally show that the implementation of performance pay during the period of changes is not the source of the observed differences between the two sectors.","[Bigi, Maelezig; Greenan, Nathalie; Hamon-Cholet, Sylvie; Lanfranchi, Joseph] CEE, F-93166 Noisy Le Grand, France; [Bigi, Maelezig] LISE CNAM CNRS, Paris, France; [Greenan, Nathalie; Hamon-Cholet, Sylvie] TEPP CNRS, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bigi, M (通讯作者)，CEE, 19 Promenade Michel Simon, F-93166 Noisy Le Grand, France.",maelezig.bigi@cee.recherche.fr; nathalie.greenan@cee-recherche.fr; sylvie.hamon-cholet@cee-recherche.fr; joseph.lanfranchi@cee-recherche.fr,"Greenan, Nathalie/J-8067-2012","Greenan, Nathalie/0000-0001-5028-1267",,,,,24,0,0,0,21,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The focal explanation is top management teams, including several studies that address when and how top management teams are likely to influence entrepreneurial firm performance. There are several insights. First, large and diverse teams with a history of working together are more likely to succeed. This effect is particularly large when they launch in growth markets. Second, teams are effective in making strategic decisions when they are fast, highly conflictual, and still get along. Third, they are also effective when they rely on simple rules heuristics to perform significant activities like new product development and internationalization that nonetheless happens often. A further insight is that these simple rules can become the strategy of their firms. Fourth, more effective teams continuously organize the structures of their firms at the edge of chaos. Overall, top management teams emerge as central to the success (or lack thereof) of entrepreneurial firms.","Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Eisenhardt, KM (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kme@stanford.edu,,,,,,,43,63,78,2,134,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The few studies linking social fragmentation and environmental performance have been confined to using ethnic fractionalisation as the only measure of social heterogeneity. In this paper, we contribute to the literature in a twofold manner. First, we bring into the analysis alternative measures of social fragmentation (i.e. religious fractionalisation, ethnic/religious polarisation), that have received considerable attention in development economics in recent years. Second, this is the first study to our knowledge that makes use of a large panel dataset of several environmental indicators to explore links between ethnic/religious diversity and the environment. We find that all indices of social fragmentation are negatively linked to measures of environmental quality, although for some of them the size of the effect is larger in the case of polarisation.","[Papyrakis, Elissaios] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Papyrakis, Elissaios] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of East Anglia,"Papyrakis, E (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",e.papyrakis@vu.nl,"Papyrakis, Elissaios/M-9120-2013",,,,,,69,16,18,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Accounting for ecosystems and their services leads to adjusting net domestic product (NDP) for the direct benefits provided by the current stock of ecosystems but not for their indirect contributions in terms of protecting or supporting economic activity, property and human lives. When ecosystems are irreversibly converted for economic development, NDP must be further modified to reflect any capital revaluation that occurs with the current conversion of ecological capital to other land uses. The risk of collapse also requires adjustments to NDP, as any capital revaluation associated with ecosystem conversion must be adjusted for this risk, and the discounted minimum value of ecosystems associated with collapse must be subtracted from NDP. These various contributions of ecological capital to wealth accounts are illustrated with the example of mangroves in Thailand over the period 1970-2009.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Barbier, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",ebarbier@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,76,37,45,2,83,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We contrast the competitive effects from cross-border bank takeovers with those of cross-border lending by banks located overseas, which in most cases reduces markups and interest rates. Although both types of liberalization can increase the cost-efficiency of lending in the liberalizing country, the distinction arises because opening toward cross-border lending increases competitive pressures (contestability) in the credit market, while takeovers do not. Both policies can increase aggregate output and generate permanent current account imbalances. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

First, the commodification of plants will be conceptualized. Second, the proposal for open licensing for varieties of crops will be discussed. Third, examples of the introduction of open licensing in the life sciences will be examined in relation to the potential to reformulate the definition of openness' to support those who wish to live and work with plants on their own terms.","Univ Paris 13, IFRIS, CEPN, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",Universite Paris 13,"Deibel, E (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, IFRIS, CEPN, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",eric.deibel@univ-paris13.fr,,"Deibel, Eric/0009-0005-6626-2470",,,,,92,27,35,0,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

This paper analyzes ITCs among USPTO patents' inventors in eleven emerging economies and seven advanced countries (1990 2004) and a novel database on companies' country of origin. Technological proximity and sharing a common language are key drivers of ITCs. When the applicant's ownership is in the emerging country ITCs depend positively upon transport and communication costs (geographical distance and longitude) and negatively upon the strength of intellectual property rights (IPRs). Stronger IPRs positively affect ITCs from subsidiaries of multinational firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This new form of hybrid venture melds the social purpose traditionally associated with non-profit organizations with the economic purpose and market-based methods traditionally associated with for-profit firms. This exploratory research inductively explores the process by which social businesses are designed. The result suggests that clear intentionality around social purpose drives the design of these ventures and their associated missions and business models such that they can creatively synthesize competing paradigms (economic and social purpose) within one venture. The tight coupling of mission, method, and operationalization allows for the multi-stakeholder promise of the business model to be fulfilled.","[Wilson, Fiona] Univ New Hampshire, Whittemore Sch Business & Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Post, James E.] Boston Univ, Sch Management, Boston, MA 02215 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Boston University,"Wilson, F (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Whittemore Sch Business & Econ, McConnell Hall,15 Acad Way, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",fiona.wilson@unh.edu; jepost@bu.edu,,,,,,,69,202,240,14,354,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Empirical evidence demonstrates that once the regime intercept is included, the asymmetric effects of global sentiment on oil & gas, financials, and health care industry returns become less under optimism, as compared with under pessimism. More critically, the positive (negative) impact of global sentiment above (under) the threshold turns significant, indicating that global optimism leads industry returns to be overvalued, while pessimism leads them to be undervalued. For local market sentiment, our results support that higher local sentiment enhances the returns of basic materials, telecommunications, and utilities industries. The empirical results confirm that the nexus of industry returns and investor sentiments is subject to change between different sentimental intervals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze two VEPs in Mexico, the global standard ISO 14001 and the local standard Clean Industry. These two VEPs differ in the stringency of the standards and in their ability to sanction noncompliant facilities. These differences ensure that firms adopting the local standard are less likely to shirk their responsibilities and enhance potential spillover effects on untargeted environmental emissions.

We posit that a likely link between increased openness and public spending is the use of the latter to offset changes in the distribution of income that result from increased openness. To explore this potential link, we study time series data from Spain in 1960-2000, a period of major changes in political organization as well as in both fiscal and trade policy. We find evidence that democracy reinforced the causal relation from increased openness to greater public expenditure. Thus, the paper contributes to the literature that emphasizes that changes in political regimes are potentially important determinants of the observed international patterns of openness and government size.","[Saenz, Estela] Univ Zaragoza, Sch Business & Publ Management, Dept Appl Econ, Huesca 22001, Spain; [Sabate, Marcela; Dolores Gadea, M.] Univ Zaragoza, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Sáenz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Sch Business & Publ Management, Dept Appl Econ, Plaza Constituc S-N, Huesca 22001, Spain.",essaenz@unizar.es,"Gadea Rivas, Maria Dolores/K-1547-2014; Sabate Sort, Marcela/H-2206-2015","Gadea Rivas, Maria Dolores/0000-0001-6609-4247; Sabate Sort, Marcela/0000-0002-9047-4853",,,,,78,11,11,0,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2013,154.0,3-4,,,,,173,195,,10.1007/s11127-011-9841-8,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,084II,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314531800002,0

Consistent with prior research, we find that in the pre-crisis period more illiquid funds generate a share illiquidity premium compensating investors for limited liquidity. In the crisis period, this share illiquidity premium turns into an illiquidity discount. Hedge funds with more stringent share restrictions invest more heavily in illiquid assets. While share restrictions enable funds to manage illiquid assets effectively in the pre-crisis period, they seem insufficient to ensure effective management of illiquid portfolios in the crisis. In a crisis period, funds holding illiquid portfolios experience lower returns and alphas, also when share restrictions are controlled for. Funds with an asset-liability mismatch perform particularly poorly and experience the strongest outflows. Share restrictions are also a proxy for incentives as investors cannot immediately withdraw their money after poor performance. We show that higher incentive fees can offset the share illiquidity discount in the crisis period. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To this aim, we set up equity style indices and derive risk factors, which nest the established Fama and French (1992) and Carhart (1997) factors. We add two additional risk factors, namely idiosyncratic risk and Amihud (2002) liquidity. Our sample contains 528 actively managed mutual funds with European stock market focus during 2002 to 2009. Model estimation reveals that-while market excess return and size appear significant for the cross-section of all funds-the remainder factors explain the performance of subsets of funds. About one third of the funds exhibit significant factor sensitivities not only with respect to valuation or momentum, but also with respect to liquidity or idiosyncratic risk. No single risk factor is dominated and hence our six factor model may serve as a valid performance benchmark. In a four factor model setting, the Carhart model and a model with valuation replaced by liquidity perform best. Our results remain stable under various robustness checks. We further document that managers on average prefer liquid stocks, show no aggregate idiosyncratic risk preference and deliver results that are consistent with equilibrium models of fund performance.

However, this willingness to pay estimate is virtually non-existent for most developing countries. In the absence of local estimates, two major benefit transfer approaches lend themselves to the estimation of the value of statistical life: the value transfer method and the meta-regression analysis. Using Nigeria as a sample country, we find that the latter method is better tailored than the former for incorporating many characteristics that vary between study sites and policy sites into its benefit transfer application. It is therefore likely to provide more accurate value of statistical life predictions for very low-income countries. Employing the meta-regression method, we find Nigeria's value of statistical life estimate to be $489,000. Combining this estimate with dose response functions from the epidemiological literature, it follows that if Nigeria had mitigated its 2006 particulate air pollution to the World Health Organisation standards, it could have avoided at least 58,000 premature deaths and recorded an avoided mortality related welfare loss of about $28 billion or 19 % of the nation's GDP for that year.","[Yaduma, Natina; Wossink, Ada] Univ Manchester, Econ Disclipline Area, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Kortelainen, Mika] Govt Inst Econ Res VATT, Helsinki 00101, Finland",University of Manchester; VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Yaduma, N (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Econ Disclipline Area, Sch Social Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",natina.yaduma@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk; mika.kortelainen@vatt.fi; ada.wossink@manchester.ac.uk,"Wossink, G.

Moreover, we find a direct relationship between the size of the trades and the level of information asymmetry. The intraday pattern of price impacts is similar to patterns documented in other markets, namely an inverse J-shaped pattern.

As drivers of self-selection, the literature mainly focuses on measures of productivity; however, other variables, such as preferences, beliefs and personality, also play a role. With this paper, we contribute to the literature on drivers of self-selection by analyzing the role of perceived wage risks as potential influences on the sorting decision. To this end, we study a sorting decision between two variable compensation systems, where both options carry wage risks. Specifically, we look at sorting between individual piece rates and team piece rates. Using experimental data, we find evidence for both risk diversification considerations and free-riding concerns (i.e., risk of teaming-up with low-productive teammates) as drivers of self-selection. However, our data does not support the concern of our experimental subjects that others actually reduce their effort when working under team compensation, as compared to individual-based compensation.

In our experiment, participants are divided at random in two treatments. Individuals in both treatments are provided with true yet diverging information regarding the approval rates observed in previous experimental sessions. Our results show that the voting behavior differs across treatments in a way that is consistent with bandwagon voting. They also confirm the importance of instrumental motives and - unlike the majority of previous experiments - find support for expressive voting motives. Finally, we assess the impact of the false-consensus effect from a theoretical perspective.

The analysis proposes a setup that allows testing for structural shifts in the bank lending equation, and employs a novel dataset covering large international banks headquartered in 14 major advanced economies for the period 1995-2010. While stronger capitalisation sustains loan growth in normal times, banks during a crisis can turn additional capital into greater lending only once their capitalisation exceeds a critical threshold. This suggests that recapitalisations may not translate into greater credit supply until bank balance sheets are sufficiently strengthened. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a two-step approach to handle both problems. First, in a VAR setting, we extract a reliable measure of the term premium by means of averaging estimator techniques aiming at optimally solving prediction problems when highly persistent processes are present and, thus, providing a so called Near-Cointegrated VAR(p) approach. Second, we analyze the dynamic response of GDP to shocks to the term premium by using the New Information Response Function concept. As far as the first problem is concerned, we find that the NCVAR-based term premium measure is rather stable and counter-cyclical, as suggested by interest rates survey-based estimation of yield curve models and by its risk compensation role. Regarding the second problem, we find that an increase in the long-term spread caused by the term premium induces two effects on future economic activity: the impact is negative for short horizons (less than 1 year), whereas it is positive for longer ones.
