We employ both economic and engineering approaches to assess these costs. Among other calculations, we provide estimates of the value of lost load by economic sector and the hourly value of electricity by season and type of day. The results of two economic methods employed to assess welfare losses differ largely, indicating that the assessment of outage costs is associated with many uncertainties. Our calculations show that the emergency actions taken by national energy authorities in response to that accident, though not necessarily optimal, have generally been appropriate and in line with international best practices: the additional costs incurred due to these measures are lower than the economic losses avoided thanks to these actions. Preferential treatment of specific consumer types in the case of repeated power outages remains an open policy question. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of cost reductions for CCS depends on how carbon taxes are set. If there is no carbon tax in period 1, but an optimally set carbon tax in period 2, a CCS cost reduction may reduce early emissions. Such an innovation may therefore be more desirable than comparable cost cuts related to renewable energy. The finding rests on the incentives fossil fuel owners face. If future profitability is reduced, they speed up extraction (the 'green paradox'), and vice versa. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This carries the risk of grid instabilities causing damage to electronic devices and power outages, which eventually lead to deadweight losses. In principle, the problems arising from fluctuating feed-in can be solved by increasing demand elasticity or decoupling generation and consumption: for the first, an advanced metering infrastructure and, for the second, decentralized electricity storage are considered core enablers. However, to date, the diffusion of these future smart grids' core components is low. The present study provides new insights for understanding and overcoming diffusion barriers. For this purpose, a qualitative research approach was chosen. The most important stakeholders as well as related private costs and benefits are identified. The findings show that both of these smart grid components are widely considered beneficial to society by experts. However, because the numerous private benefits are widely distributed among distinct players, socially desired investments are hampered by positive externalities. The importance of well-designed and consistent regulatory and legal frameworks that provide economic incentives to involved stakeholders is highlighted in the results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Just as whole industries have grown, so too have unit sizes or capacities. Analysed in combination, these unit level and industry level growth patterns reveal some consistencies across very different energy technologies. First, the up- scaling or increase in unit size of an energy technology comes after an often prolonged period of experimentation with many smaller-scale units. Second, the peak growth phase of an industry can lag these increases in unit size by up to 20 years. Third, the rate and timing of up-scaling at the unit level is subject to countervailing influences of scale economies and heterogeneous market demand. These observed patterns have important implications for experience curve analyses based on time series data covering the up-scaling phases of energy technologies, as these are likely to conflate industry level learning effects with unit level scale effects. The historical diffusion of energy technologies also suggests that low carbon technology policies pushing for significant jumps in unit size before a 'formative phase' of experimentation with smaller-scale units are risky.

It should therefore include (1) expanding electricity access and (2) enable new consumers to increase their electricity consumption. In this paper we ask how Brazil's recent rural electrification efforts have managed to reach these objectives. A new method to measure energy and income equity is presented which uses estimations of non-parametric density curves for the analysis of energy and income distributional trends following electrification. By applying our method to a panel data set from two Brazilian states situated in the country's poor northeast region we find that (1) rural consumers take up electricity consumption after electrification, and that (2) low consumption levels give way to higher electricity consumption levels after only a few years. This indicates immediate social benefits for households through consumption of electricity services. However, our analysis cannot verify a direct link between electricity use and rural income generation in the short term. The results emphasize the need for government and other actors to integrate rural electrification into broader rural development strategies in order to enable long-term welfare increases through electricity use.

Based on archive material, this paper gives the evidential basis for the WHO guidance. It then reports on evidence that some groups may be more susceptible to high or low indoor temperatures than others. It examines different methods for measuring thermal comfort, such as air temperature measurement, assessing residents' perception, and predicting satisfaction. Resident's perception was used effectively in the WHO LARES project, showing that self-reported poor health was significantly associated with poor thermal comfort. Tools to inform strategies directed at dealing with cold homes and fuel poverty are considered, including Energy Performance Certificates, Fuel Poverty Indicators, and the English Housing Health and Safety Rating System. Conclusions from a WHO Workshop on Housing, Energy and Thermal Comfort are also summarised. The WHO view of thermal comfort, which is driven by protecting health from both high and low indoor temperatures, should be recognised in energy efficiency, fuel poverty and climate change strategies. While this is a major challenge, it could provide both health gains for individuals, and economic benefits for society. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Since crude oil resources are predominately located in the OPEC Middle East, these countries are expected to have significant leverage in the world crude oil markets by taking into account a range of uncertainties. In this study, we develop a scenario for crude oil export and production using the ACEGES model considering uncertainties in the resource limits, demand growth, production growth, and peak/decline point. The results indicate that the country-specific peak of both crude oil export and production comes in the early this century in the OPEC Middle East countries. On the other hand, they occupy most of the world export and production before and after the peak points. Consequently, these countries are expected to be the key group in the world crude oil markets. We also find that the gap between the world crude oil demand and production broadens over time, meaning that the acceleration of the development of ultra-deep-water oil, oil sands, and extra-heavy oil will be required if the world continuous to heavily rely on oil products.

Photovoltaic cells are the most disruptive energy technology as they allow consumers of all sizes to produce power by themselves-new actors in the power market can begin operating with a new bottom-up control logic. Unsubsidised PV markets may start to take off in 2013, fuelling substantial growth where PV power is getting cheaper than grid or diesel backup electricity for commercial consumers. Managing loads and achieving a good match between power consumption and weather-dependent power production will likely become a key issue. This consumption-production balance may trigger massive innovation and investment in energy management technologies involving different kinds of storage and controls. Increasing autonomy and flexibility of consumers challenges the top-down control logic of traditional power supply and pushes for a more decentralised and multi-layered system. How rapidly and smoothly this transformation occurs depends to a large extent on the adaptation speed of the regulatory framework and on the ability of market players to develop appropriate business models. The paper discusses conflicts of interest; hurdles and drivers; opportunities; and traps for this perspective. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

There is currently little legislation present for the regulation of end-of-life waste management for the wind energy industry in Europe. However, a review of European waste management policy has shown that landfill bans effectively divert waste from landfill and drive towards energy recovery.

The geographical distributions of household energy use are evaluated at the Enumeration Districts (ED) level based on the building thermal balance model. Moreover, it estimates the impact of possible factors on the household space heating consumption. Results illustrate that the distribution profile of dwellings is a significant factor related to overall heating energy demand and individual dwelling energy consumption for space heating. Residents living in compact dwellings with small floor areas consume less energy for space heating than residents living in dwellings with big floor areas. Moreover, domestic heating energy demand per household was also estimated for two extreme urban development scenarios: the compact city scenario and the dispersed scenario. The results illustrate that the compact city scenario is likely to decrease the domestic heating energy consumption per household by 16.2% compared with the dispersed city scenario. Correspondingly, the energy-related CO2 emissions could be significantly decreased by compact city scenario compared with the dispersed city scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This holds, among others, for direct support of clean energy, voluntary energy conservation, technical standards on a limited set of products, unilateral stringent carbon pricing, and awaiting peak oil as a climate strategy. All of these suffer from escape routes that indirectly increase CO2 emissions and thus make the original strategy ineffective. On the other hand, environmental regulation alone may lead to a myopia-bias, stimulating early dominance of cost-effective technologies and a focus on incremental innovations associated with such technologies rather than on radical innovations. Although adopting a partial viewpoint keeps the analysis simple, we urgently need a more inclusive systems perspective on climate solutions. This will allow the formulation of an effective climate policy package that addresses the various escape routes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[van den Bergh, Jeroen C. J.

The paper points out that long term development strategies and large programmes with significant financial resources are essential to achieving substantial results in terms of energy access. The paper argues that building up the energy infrastructure (power plants, grid interconnections and small-scale decentralized energy options in rural areas.) is a pre-condition for economic growth and ultimately for energy access. It underlines that historically there is a trend towards more efficient, convenient and cost effective forms of energy. Low carbon path and above all renewable will therefore play an increasing role in the energy mix in the next couple of decades.

For all the scenarios, the quantitative impacts in terms of output potential loss are calculated and compared. Due to less output potential loss for all the allocation alternatives, the sector regulation strategy is shown to be more effective than the province regulation strategy. It is also demonstrated that, among all the scenarios considered, the sector regulation based on the intensity share principle and the province regulation based on the absolute share principle are the two optimal.

Using the LMDI decomposition analysis method, this paper aims to identify and analyse the driving forces of CO2 emissions in eleven final energy consuming sectors. This multi-sectoral analysis is based on four economic sectors, the residential sector and gives a detailed representation of transport in keeping with UNFCCC recommendations. Scale, structure and intensity effects are explored and substantial heterogeneity in sectoral performance is observed. Scale growth in economic and transport activity was considerable. Some improvements in energy intensity were recorded in the economic sectors. In transport, increases in intensity contributed to a significant increase in emissions, while energy intensity decreased in the residential sector. The declining emissions coefficient of electricity was important in limiting emissions but renewable energy has been slow to penetrate the demand side. The results have relevance in considering development paths and can aid in identifying policy measures required to address the key driving forces of emissions in the sectors. The rapid increase in transport emissions in particular raises concerns of future lock-in to a higher emissions trajectory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, the inventory of green office space in the United States has increased dramatically since the introduction of rating schemes that attest to the energy efficiency or sustainability of commercial buildings. In some metropolitan areas, the supply of certified office buildings has more than doubled in the last decade, and there are a few metropolitan areas where green office space now accounts for more than a quarter of the total office stock. In this paper, we analyze the diffusion of buildings certified for energy efficiency across US property markets. Using a panel of 48 metropolitan areas observed over the last fifteen years, we trace the diffusion of green building practices across the country. We then model the geographic patterns and dynamics of building certification, relating industry composition, changes in economic conditions, characteristics of the local commercial property market, and the presence of human capital, to the cross-sectional variation in energy-efficient building technologies and the diffusion of those technologies over time. Understanding the determinants and the rate at which energy-efficient building practices diffuse over space and time is important for designing policies to affect resource consumption in the built environment.","[McGraw, Marquise; Quigley, John M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, 549 Evans Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kok, Nils] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Finance, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Maastricht University,"Quigley, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, 549 Evans Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",n.kok@maastrichtuniversity.nl; mmcgraw@econ.berkeley.edu; quigley@econ.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,34,17,22,0,46,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This paper first gives a short review of the literature about ETR. An Appendix briefly describes the model used for a modelling exercise to explore, through scenarios with low and high international energy prices, the implications of a large-scale ETR in the European Union, sufficient to reach the EU's emission reduction targets for 2020. The paper then reports the results of the exercise. The ETR results in increased carbon and materials, but reduced labour, productivity, with the emission reductions distributed across all sectors as a reduction in the demand for all fossil fuels. There are also small GDP increases for most, but not all, EU countries for all the scenarios, and for the EU as a whole. Both the environmental and macroeconomic outcomes are better with low than with high energy prices, because the former both increases the scale of the ETR required to reach the targets, and reduces the outflow of foreign exchange to pay for energy imports. ETR emerges from the exercise as an attractive and cost-effective policy for environmental improvement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This is important for deriving effective policy portfolios consisting of fuel taxes and technical standards such as fuel intensity mandates or specific CO2 emission limits. To extract these impacts, we apply cointegration analyses to six European countries and their aggregate over the period 1970-2007. We consider the impact of fuel prices, household income and fuel intensity on fuel consumption. Furthermore, we investigate how changes in fuel prices and fuel intensity interact, analyzing the rebound effect due to lower fuel intensity and due to the switch to diesel. Because we find a high rebound effect with 44% more km driven if fuel intensity is improved 100%, the major conclusion of our analysis for policy makers is that technical standards as the only policy instrument will have limited success. Rather we recommend increased fuel taxes along with fuel intensity standards so that the taxes compensate for the rebound due to the standards. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper considers the context of these cost increases, and describes a disaggregated levelised cost model used by the authors to explore the effect of different assumptions about the direction and scale of the major cost drivers. The paper identifies the competing upward and downward pressures on costs in the medium term, and discusses the range of future costs that emerges from the analysis. The paper goes on to analyse the implications of these cost projections for the policy support levels that offshore wind may require. The paper suggests that there are good reasons why it is reasonable to expect a gradual fall in costs in the period to the mid-2020s, although it is unlikely that costs will fall as rapidly as they have risen, or that it will be a smooth downward trajectory. A key challenge is to reconcile the scale and pace of development desired for UK offshore wind with the potential growth rate that the supply chain can sustain without creating upward pressure on costs.

For this reason, the China central government has enforced and implemented a series of policies to promote BEE. Based on the analysis of main characteristics of BEE development in China and developmental routes of BEE, this paper systematically explored six fiscal incentive policies. Meanwhile, four specific programs involving new building, existing residential building, government office building and large-scale public building, and applications of renewable energy in building were investigated. Besides, the key factors of BEE development and BEE developmental stages were analyzed. The research revealed the present progress of implementation on BEE policies, and identified the drawbacks of the present BEE mechanism. Moreover, four proposals were recommended to enhance the development of BEE in the next Five-Year Plan period. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

One way of achieving government carbon policy goals may be the creation of an independent body to advise on, or set, monitor policy. This paper critically assesses the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which was created in 2008 as an independent body to help move the UK towards a low-carbon economy. We look at the motivation for its creation. In particular we consider its ability to overcome a time-inconsistency problem by comparing it to another independent body, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. In practice the CCC appears to be the inverse of the Monetary Policy Committee, in that it advises on what the policy goal should be rather than being held responsible for achieving it. The CCC incorporates both advisory and monitoring functions to inform government and achieve a credible carbon policy over a long time frame. This is a similar framework to that adopted by Stern (2006), but the CCC operates on a continuing basis and also incorporates a unique climate change monitoring function. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental innovation and sustainability transitions in regional studies, Regional Studies. Sustainable development and environmental innovations have received increasing attention in regional studies and the related literature. In how far sustainability concerns might also lead to fundamental transformations in technologies, industries and lifestyles (so-called sustainability transitions) has, however, found much less resonance. Sustainability transitions have been in the focus of scholars from the field of innovation studies. However, until recently, these approaches mostly disregarded spatial aspects. This paper therefore maps out a field of future research - the geography of sustainability transitions - that might be beneficially laboured by both traditions.

Some national and local Chinese building energy efficiency standards credit or recommend, but do not require, cool roofs or walls. EnergyPlus simulations of standard-compliant Chinese office and residential building prototypes in seven Chinese cities (Harbin, Changchun, Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou) showed that substituting an aged white roof (albedo 0.6) for an aged gray roof (albedo 0.2) yields positive annual load, energy, energy cost, CO2, NO., and SO2 savings in all hot-summer cities (Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou). Measurements in an office building in Chongqing in August 2012 found that a white coating lowered roof surface temperature by about 20 degrees C, and reduced daily air conditioning energy use by about 9%. Measurements in a naturally ventilated factory in Guangdong Province in August 2011 showed that a white coating decreased roof surface temperature by about 17 degrees C, lowered room air temperature by 1-3 degrees C, and reduced daily roof heat flux by 66%. Simulation and experimental results suggest that cool roofs should be credited or prescribed in building energy efficiency standards for both hot summer/warm winter and hot summer/cold winter climates in China.

Those costs are to some extent offset by the tax receipts and other revenue streams generated as a result of the activities promoted under the programme. In this paper we analyse the budgetary effects of energy efficiency programmes focusing on the example of solid wall insulation in the UK. Three distinct subsidy options have been defined and modelled for the purpose of this research including two policies with varying degrees of direct subsidy and a low interest loan scheme. Our analysis shows that a significant amount of the cost of a scheme funding solid wall insulation would be offset by increased revenues and savings. A loan scheme, due to the high leverage, achieves not only budget neutrality but generates additional revenue for the Exchequer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that, with or without row-normalization of the social adjacency matrix, the network model has different equilibrium implications, needs different identification conditions, and requires different estimation strategies. When the adjacency matrix is not row-normalized, the variation in the Bonacich centrality across nodes in a network can be used as an IV to identify social interaction effects and improve estimation efficiency. The number of such IVs depends on the number of networks. When there are many networks in the data, the proposed estimators may have an asymptotic bias due to the presence of many IVs. We propose a bias-correction procedure for the many-instrument bias. Simulation experiments show that the bias-corrected estimators perform well in finite samples. We also provide an empirical example to illustrate the proposed estimation procedure.","Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Liu, XD (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",xiaodong.liu@colorado.edu,,,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"The author is thankful to the Editor, the Associate Editor, an anonymous referee, as well as the seminar participants at American University, SHUFE, Syracuse University, University of Maryland, the IZA workshop on Social Networks, and the VII World Conference of the Spatial Econometrics Association for helpful comments and suggestions.

In this study, we analyze the impact of social values and norms on preferences towards climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. In a sample of 58 international studies, we found that mitigation actions were preferred over adaptation actions, and that preferences towards climate change policies are affected by attitudes towards time and social norms. In particular, societies with a long-term orientation display greater support towards climate change policies. These results therefore reveal the role of social factors as being crucial in order to understand the acceptability of climate change policies at a worldwide level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These home energy visits intended to encourage reductions in household carbon emissions and water consumption through the installation of small energy saving measures (such as radiator panels, in-home energy displays and low-flow shower heads), further significant energy saving measures (loft and cavity wall insulation) and behaviour change advice. The environmental impact of the programme was estimated in terms of carbon emissions abated and on average, for each household in the study, a visit led to an average carbon abatement of 146 kgCO(2). The majority of this was achieved through the installation of small energy saving measures. The impact of the visits on the installation of significant measures was negligible, as was the impact on behaviour change. Therefore, these visits did not overcome the barriers required to generate behaviour change or the barriers to the installation of more significant energy saving measures. Given this, a number of recommendations are proposed in this paper, which could increase the efficacy of these home energy visits. (C) 2014 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

I used a dataset that makes it possible to trace entry geographically as well as in what industry it occurs down to the 5-digit NACE level. Results suggest that the conditions influencing regular entry were similar to those influencing surviving entry. Political variables, e.g., municipal tax rate and the ideology of local rule, were of limited importance. Meanwhile, municipalities with industries with high minimum efficient scale of production or high market concentration rates were considerably less likely to see new firm formation. Substantially, more entry occurred in municipalities with high-income and a well-educated population. The importance of the level of education appears stronger for surviving entrants than for regular entrants, pointing to the importance of human capital.","Ratio Inst, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Elert, N (通讯作者)，Ratio Inst, POB 3203, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden.",niklas.elert@ratio.se,,,,,,,270,11,12,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Issues to be considered usually include the number of facilities to locate, where to site those facilities and how demand is to be served. Given the geographic nature of location problems, a key issue is how to represent facilities and demand in geographic space. Traditionally, spatial abstraction as discrete demand is assumed as it simplifies model formulation and reduces computational complexity. However, errors in derived solutions are likely not negligible, especially when demand varies continuously across a region. This paper discusses a single facility location problem that considers demand to be continuously distributed and allows a facility to be located anywhere in space, the continuous Weber problem. An approach for dealing with continuous demand is proposed that is integrated through geographical information system (GIS) functionality. Empirical results highlight the advantages of the developed approach and the importance of solution integration with GIS.","[Yao, Jing; Murray, Alan T.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, GeoDa Ctr Geospatial Anal & Computat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Yao, J (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, GeoDa Ctr Geospatial Anal & Computat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",jingyao@asu.edu; atmurray@asu.edu,"Murray, Alan T/B-2993-2012","Murray, Alan T/0000-0003-2674-6110",,,,,64,9,12,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Achieving reductions of this magnitude in the transportation sector is a challenge and requires a multitude of policies and technology options. The research presented here analyzes three scenarios: changes in the perceived price of travel, land use intensification, and increases in transit. Elasticity estimates are derived using an activity-based travel model for the state of California and broadly representative of the US. The VISION model is used to forecast changes in technology and fuel options that are currently forecast to occur in the US for the period 2000-2040, providing a life-cycle GHG forecast for the road transportation sector. Results suggest that aggressive policy action is required, especially pricing policies, but also more on the technology side, especially increases in the carbon efficiency of medium and heavy-duty vehicles.

The goal of the study is to evaluate the influence of interventions required by the new Slovenian legislation and to propose general site planning guidelines. Special emphasis is devoted to the existing building stock, which is due for refurbishment. The study is carried out on the basis of seven typical urban layouts, which are assessed according to the shape of layout, density, building orientation and design. The calculations are carried out with the program SHADING. The study showed that the existing layouts are not as problematic as had been expected and that form and orientation of buildings present a major challenge. Nevertheless, the quality and the duration of insolation are highly dependent on the specifics of each case. The study showed that by respecting the basic rules of good practice in conjunction with the existing requirements no major changes in the existing design principles are needed.

The results reveal that although the restructuring had different effects on the individual power plants, the overall growth in the eco-efficiency of the sector was mainly due to advances in pure technology. We also assess the correlation between efficiency and eco-efficiency of the power plants, which indicates a close relationship between these two steps, thus lending support to the incorporation of environmental factors in efficiency analysis.

Geographical mobility of workers within countries can be a means of equilibrating regional economic disparities. Within this context, a relevant topic is the mobility of foreign workers in the destination country. The Spanish case is interesting, because Spain has one of Europe's fastest-growing immigration rates. This paper is aimed, first, at studying the determinants of interregional geographical mobility of immigrants in Spain and, second, at obtaining consistent estimates of an individual's opportunity wage as a mover or a stayer. Findings show that an expected wage gain exerts a positive influence on mobility and leads to a better allocation of resources.","Univ Malaga, Dept Stat & Econometr, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Ruiz, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Stat & Econometr, Calle El Ejido 6, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",antonio@uma.es,"Ruiz, Antonio Caparrós/K-4245-2014",,,,,,38,3,3,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper explores the reasons for this phenomenon, analysing the job characteristics of rural workers in detail. The data set consists of 900 jobs. The results show that public jobs are over-represented in rural-remote regions, driving up the mean wage of this type of region. When considering private sector employment only, spatial wage and income differentials do exist, showing that workers in remote areas are economically more disadvantaged than workers in peri-urban areas.","[Lohmann, Carsten] Chamber Commerce & Ind Frankfurt Main, D-60313 Frankfurt, Germany; [Liefner, Ingo] Univ Giessen, Dept Econ Geog, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Lohmann, C (通讯作者)，Chamber Commerce & Ind Frankfurt Main, Boersenpl 4, D-60313 Frankfurt, Germany.",c.lohmann@frankfurt-main.ihk.de; ingo.liefner@geogr.uni-giessen.de,,"Liefner, Ingo/0000-0003-1828-5836",,,,,59,1,1,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Such a quick and large growth is due to a series of feed-in tariff schemes that have been uncapped until 2012. As a matter of fact, any size or any number of PV power plants could be installed during a period of three years. Since the feed-in tariffs are not paid by national taxes but are charged on the electricity bills, Italian energy users are now due to pay each year a surcharge of 9 billion euros on their energy bills. This paper aims at discussing this development by highlighting the benefits but also some significant drawbacks that the application of uncontrolled feed-in tariffs has produced.

The present research investigated what residents living within deprived communities in Yorkshire and the Humber (United Kingdom) thought about a number of household energy efficiency interventions proposed as part of a project known as The BIG Energy Upgrade. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was used as a framework for investigating residents' beliefs. Residents generally felt positive about the proposed interventions and expected that they would lead to financial savings, improve the appearance and warmth of their homes, and sense of pride in the local community. However, while residents intended to adopt energy efficiency interventions if offered them, they were less willing to personally invest in them. Home ownership and the belief in humans' ability to tackle climate change were found to predict willingness to invest. These findings help to understand responses to initiatives that seek to improve the energy efficiency of hard-to-treat homes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To avoid this problem, while still taking care of the environment, a country may impose a carbon tariff that adjusts for the differences between its own carbon tax and the other country's tax. We consider two countries with a representative firm in each one, and characterize and Contrast the equilibrium strategies and outcomes in three scenarios. In the first (benchmark) scenario, in a first stage the regulators in the two countries determine the carbon taxes noncooperatively, and in a second stage, the firms compete a la Cournot. In the second scenario, the regulators cooperate in determining the carbon taxes, while the firms still play a noncooperative Cournot game. In the third scenario, we add another player, e.g., the World Trade Organization, which announced a border tax in a prior stage; the game is then played as in the first scenario. Our two major results are (i) a border-tax adjustment (BTA) mimics quite well the cooperative solution in setting the carbon taxes as in scenario two. This means that a BTA may be a way around the lack of enthusiasm for an LEA.

There are twenty KSFs considered in this study which were chosen from literature review. The success of ERP implementation can be measured through five indicators, namely: system quality (SQ), information quality (IQ), service quality (SEQ), tactical impact (TAI) and strategical impact (STI).There are 248 respondents who represent 37 companies and 10 industrial sectors that responded to the questionnaire. The respondents are staff at management level, IT staff and users involved in the development and use of the ERP system. Based on hypothetical validation, the ERP implementation can be success when all of independent variables (X-L...X-2D) have value of S (satisfied) or when any of (K-L...K-2D) have value of NS or S. If any of (K-L...X-2D) have value of NS, then the other factors that have a significant influenced to ERP system implementation success must have value of S in order to gain a successful of ERP system implementation. The ERP implementation is absolutely failed, when all of independent variables have value of NS (not satisfied). There are several limitations in this study, where the degree of ERP implementation for each company is not the same in terms of the number of module implemented, ERP system product used, and so forth. Further, the companies involved in this study have different numbers of years in using ERP system. This study is expected to improve knowledge in ERP implementation, especially the validation of the relationship between key success factors and ERP implementation success.","[Dantes, Gede Rasben] Ganesha Univ Educ, Bali, Indonesia; [Hasibuan, Zainal Arifin] Univ Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia",Ganesha University of Education; University of Indonesia,"Dantes, GR (通讯作者)，Ganesha Univ Educ, Bali, Indonesia.",rasben.dantes@pasca.undiksha.ac.id; zhasibua@cs.ui.ac.id,"Dantes, Gede Rasben/M-8672-2017; Dantes, Gede Rasben/AAL-9656-2020","Dantes, Gede Rasben/0000-0001-7234-8506; Dantes, Gede Rasben/0000-0001-7234-8506",Directorate General of Higher Education of Indonesia [821SP2H/PP/DP2M/VI/2010],Directorate General of Higher Education of Indonesia(Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEK)),This research was supported by the Directorate General of Higher Education of Indonesia under Grant No. 4821SP2H/PP/DP2M/VI/2010.

Using a two-period sequential decision making model, we analytically derive optimal rates for the two control variables, abatement and sequestration rates. Uncertainty is assumed to affect the desired future stabilization level of the CO2 stock but is resolved prior to the decision on how much to control the stock in the second period. Contrary to recent numerical studies, we find that uncertainty can make it optimal to use carbon sequestration either earlier or later depending on the relative rates of change in both marginal cost curves and on the amount of land that can be converted to forest. Comparative statics suggest that an increase in the discount factor could either increase or decrease the optimal rate of sequestration in the first period depending on the expected rate of change of the marginal cost of sequestration in the second period and on future benefits of current sequestration.

Every existing task in any project is, to a higher or lower extent, determined by the effect of the human agent, which commonly takes the Student's syndrome form. The inefficiency of a number of projects in practice is largely caused by an unsuccessful realization of partial tasks. The effect of the human agent is in this respect fundamental. The human agent, as an allocated resource in the task, is liable to a number of non-specified impacts and stimuli, and as such s/he is rather versatile in his/her behaviour. The versatility of the human agent in projects can be described by the Student Syndrome phenomenon. If the Student Syndrome phenomenon could be completely expressed by means of a mathematical model, it would be possible to improve the prediction of its impact on project tasks, and therefore to exploit the resources allocated in the project more efficiently and prevent project crises. We can not expect that the Student Syndrome phenomenon can be expressed in a trivial way and using only one mathematical function. This paper proposes several functions for this representation. The proposed functions are compared in terms of their course and the possibility of work schedule resources parameterization. We can regard this original viewpoint as suggestive for the area of human resources management in projects.

Using a simple hybrid model which considers expected utility and spatial equilibrium, this paper analyzes the roles as self-insurance and self-protection played by building codes for regulating land development in a disaster-prone area. Positive externalities of self-insurance and self-protection justify the implementation of mandatory building codes. The net benefits of building codes are capitalized into land rents which, in turn, require responses in the design of optimal codes. Through impacting land market, community-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the area such as population, wage, and land area share of the risky region are found to have effects on the optimal levels of expenditure on self-insurance and self-protection. It is shown that consumer preferences and production functions for self-insurance and self-protection determine the signs of such effects which are reinforced or offset by competition for locations in the land market. Effects from changes in productivity levels and risk structure are also described. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These are obligations on energy suppliers and energy end-users. Supplier obligations have been introduced in North America, Europe and Australia. Under supplier obligations energy suppliers have to comply with mandatory energy saving targets and thus they implement (directly or via third parties) energy efficiency projects on their clients' premises, or they decide to trade certified project savings if this option is envisaged by their obligation scheme. In several emerging schemes such as the UK Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme, the Tokyo Emission Trading Scheme or the Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme in India, the obligation to reduce energy consumption is placed on large end-users directly and end-users are allowed to trade emissions allowances or energy saving certificates. The paper starts with presenting these two conceptually different ways for introducing energy saving obligations. Then it analyses advantages and disadvantages of end-users obligations compared to suppliers obligations. The preliminary conclusion of the paper is that supplier obligations seem to be well-suited for the residential sector, but end-user saving obligations may offer advantages when it comes to the industrial and commercial sectors.

This paper further investigates the effects of industry characteristics on the energy-saving target by applying the four-stage DEA proposed by Fried et al. (1999). We also calculate the pre-adjusted and environment-adjusted total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE) scores in these service sectors. There are three inputs (labor, capital stock, and energy consumption) and a single output (real GDP) in the DEA model. The most energy efficient service sector is finance, insurance and real estate, which has an average TFEE of 0.994 and an environment-adjusted TFEE (EATFEE) of 0.807. The study utilizes the panel-data, random-effects Tobit regression model with the energy-saving target (EST) as the dependent variable. Those service industries with a larger GDP output have greater excess use of energy. The capital-labor ratio has a significantly positive effect while the time trend variable has a significantly negative impact on the EST, suggesting that future new capital investment should also be accompanied with energy-saving technology in the service sectors.

A 34% increase in CO2 emissions from private cars in Ireland over the period 2000-2008 prompted a change in private car taxation in 2008 to incentivise the purchase of lower CO2 emitting cars. The impact has been successful and the measure has accelerated the dieselisation of the car fleet. This however, raises an important question, namely how does the dieselisation of the car fleet affect NOx emissions? This paper combines two models to address this question, a car stock model to generate activity data (future composition and activity of Ireland's car stock) and the COPERT model to quantify the NOx emissions generated in the period 2008-2020. Previous analysis shows that the CO2 taxation policy measure is anticipated to deliver a 7% reduction in private car related CO2 emissions in 2020 compared with a baseline pre-tax scenario. The results here show that NOx emissions decrease in all scenarios, but a lesser degree of reduction is achieved due to dieselisation, with NOx emissions in the post-tax scenario 28% higher than the pre-tax scenario in 2020.

The levels, structure and determinants of energy requirements of household consumption therefore constitute an important avenue of research. Incorporating the full upstream requirements into the analysis helps to avoid simplistic conclusions which would actually only imply shifts between consumption categories without taking the economy wide effects into account. This paper presents the investigation of the direct and indirect primary energy requirements of Australian households, contrasting urban, suburban and rural consumption patterns as well as inter- and intra-regional levels of inequality, in energy requirements. Furthermore the spatial and socio-economic drivers of energy consumption for different categories of energy requirements are identified and quantified. Conclusions regarding the relationships between energy requirements, household characteristics, urban form and urbanization processes are drawn and the respective policy implications are explored.

How do dominant firms receive such a large share of emissions allowances without bidding up the market price? This paper provides a Monte Carlo simulation analysis based on a contemporary regional greenhouse gas market in the United States. It introduces a C# simulation software environment, Oligopsony 1.0 that simulates uniform-price emissions auctions in repeated iterations. The results of these simulations indicate that there can be significant non-linearities between profit and market power as exercised through strategic demand reduction. This analysis finds the optimum point of strategic demand reduction that enables firms to exploit these non-linearities. The use of auctions to distribute tradeable pollution rights to firms in heavily concentrated markets can have significant unintended consequences, as it can exacerbate the problems of market power that exist within those markets.

Traditional solid biomass plays a significant role in meeting the primary energy demand in the country, which represents about 87% of the total primary energy mix. Till date, only 50% of the population has access to electricity, and disparity between the urban and rural areas in terms of access to energy is prevalent. In order to improve the energy situation in rural areas, the Government of Nepal initiated the promotion and development of renewable energy technologies (RETs) through subsidies. Nepal has the potential to generate energy through renewable sources like mini/microhydro schemes, solar power, biogas and wind. It is estimated that more than 50 MW of electricity can be generated from the micro hydro schemes, 2100 MW from solar and 3000 MW from wind. Moreover, the country has the capacity to develop about 1.1 million domestic biogas plants. RETs may provide ample opportunity to improve the vulnerable rural energy system in Nepal if the available renewable resources are optimally utilized. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyses and contrasts the theory and practice of international benchmarking of electricity transmission by regulators. We examine the literature relevant to electricity transmission benchmarking and discuss the results of a survey of 25 national electricity regulators. While new panel data techniques aimed at dealing with unobserved heterogeneity and the validity of the comparator group look intellectually promising, our survey suggests that they are in their infancy for regulatory purposes. In electricity transmission, relative to electricity distribution, choosing variables is particularly difficult, because of the large number of potential variables to choose from. Failure to apply benchmarking appropriately may negatively affect investors' willingness to invest in the future. While few of our surveyed regulators acknowledge that regulatory risk is currently an issue in transmission benchmarking, many more concede it might be. In the meantime new regulatory approaches such as those based on tendering, negotiated settlements, a wider range of outputs or longer term grid planning are emerging and will necessarily involve a reduced role for benchmarking.

Indeed, we found outreach materials for low-income consumers to require relatively high levels of reading comprehension. We therefore improved the Flesch-Kincaid readability statistics for two outreach brochures, by using shorter words and shorter sentences to describe their content. We examined the effect of that simplification on low-income consumers' responses. Participants from low-income communities in the greater Pittsburgh area, who varied in literacy, were randomly assigned to either original communications about energy conservation programs or our simplified versions. Our findings suggest that lowering readability statistics successfully simplified only the more straightforward brochure in our set of two, likely because its content lent itself better to simplification. Findings for this brochure showed that simplification improved understanding of its content among both low-literacy and high-literacy recipients, without adversely affecting their evaluation of the materials, or their intention to enroll in the advertised programs. We discuss strategies for improving communication materials that aim to reach out to low-income populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A questionnaire measuring seven dimensions (including low-carbon knowledge, low-carbon value, low-carbon attitude, private low-carbon behavior, public low-carbon behavior, barrier and motivator) was distributed to the residents of Tianjin, yielding 354 valid responses. The results indicated that there was a low-carbon awareness-behavior gap. In particular, the level of behavior was higher than awareness because the motivators were stronger than the barriers. Second, in exploring the affects of motivators versus barriers on the residents' private and public low-carbon behaviors, we found that motivators promoted both private and public low-carbon behaviors while barriers significantly inhibited public low-carbon behaviors. Third, Chinese social and cultural factors are discussed to inform our exploration of the mechanisms forming the residents' awareness-behavior gap.

We investigated a successful case of an Austrian farmers' association that set up a community power plant concept and a society for facilitating PV adoption among farmers. We found that PV adoption decisions are driven by economic and environmental considerations and that while ethical considerations are relatively strong among farmers, they cannot be used as predictors in the decision making process. Results furthermore suggest that while adoption of PV increases belief in technological progress as a solution to environmental problems, it may simultaneously lead to a weakening in the belief that underlying lifestyle changes are necessary. Our conclusions address crucial aspects of PV adoption in agriculture, and implications for policy measures related to respective community initiatives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimation and application of random utility maximization and random regret minimization discrete choice models shows that while the two models achieve almost identical fit with the data and differ only marginally in terms of predictive ability, they generate rather different choice probability-simulations and policy implications. The most eye-catching difference between the two models is that the random regret minimization model accommodates a compromise-effect, as it assigns relatively high choice probabilities to alternative fuel vehicles that perform reasonably well on each dimension instead of having a strong performance on some dimensions and a poor performance on others.

Altogether 12 private users, 21 organisation individuals and 32 organisation pool vehicles were tracked over two successive six month trial periods. It was found that recharging profiles varied between the different user types and locations. Private users peak demand was in the evening at home recharging points. Organisation individual vehicles were recharged primarily upon arrival at work. Organisation pool users recharged at work and public recharging points throughout the working day. It is recommended that pay-as-you-go recharging be implemented at all public recharging locations, and smart meters be used to delay recharging at home and work locations until after 23:00 h to reduce peak demand on local power grids and reduce carbon emissions associated with EV recharging.

We therefore present new empirical evidence from the first independent UK-wide survey of community energy projects. Our survey investigates the objectives, origins and development of these groups across the UK, their activities and their networking activities as a sector. We also examine the strengths and weaknesses of these groups, along with the opportunities and threats presented by wider socioeconomic and political contexts, in order to improve understanding of the sectors potential and the challenges it faces. We highlight several key issues concerning the further development of the sector. First, this highly diverse sector is not reducible to a single entity; its multiple objectives need joined-up thinking among government departments. Second, its civil society basis is fundamental to its success at engaging local communities, and makes the sector quite distinct from the large energy companies these community groups are aiming to work alongside. There are inherent tensions and vulnerabilities in such a model, and limits to how much these groups can achieve on their own: consistent policy support is essential. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This could facilitate a significant amount of energy saving for the maximum number of homeowners. But empirical studies show that achieved savings in electricity consumption from in-house displays range approximately from 0 to 20%. In order to qualitatively explore the factors underlying such variation in the achieved saving, this paper studies how a small sample of householders interacted with the feedback from an energy consumption display. Following a heuristic model based on prior energy-related behavioral research, we explore the effects of the in-home display on household electricity. Results indicate that saving might be moderated by the level of users engagement with the display, preceded by user's motivation to save energy, prior attitudes and, importantly, the level of involvement generated by the intervention.

Following the roll-out of smart electricity meters, in 2008 the Italian regulator designed an ambitious deployment program also for smart gas meters, that was recently modified in both scope and timing. This paper assesses Italy's original and current deployment plans, with a specific focus on the results of its cost-benefit analysis. In light of the evidence derived from the literature, we observe that the case for the roll-out of smart gas meters in Italy was not supported by a strong emphasis on energy savings but rather focused on increasing efficiency of the Italian gas market; in this respect, we argue that options other than smart gas metering should also be considered. Moreover the Italian cost-benefit analysis, which mostly dealt with the potential cost savings for distributors and suppliers, led to ambiguous results in terms of net present values; thus, we believe that an updated assessment would be extremely useful. Finally, in terms of technological choices, our analysis positively evaluates the regulator's recent proposal to consider a dual-fuel solution for the mass market deployment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The corporation bears the initial investment and earns as a return a share of the profits. The host country provides access and guarantees conditions of operation. Since the investment is totally sunk, the corporation must account in its plan not only for uncertainty in market conditions but also for the threat of nationalization. In a real options framework, where the government holds an American call option on nationalization, we show under which conditions a Nash bargaining leads to a profit distribution maximizing the joint venture surplus. We find that the threat of nationalization does not affect the investment threshold but only the Nash bargaining solution set. Finally, we show that the optimal sharing rule results from the way the two parties may differently trade off rents with option values. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies of decarbonisation pathways using the UK MARKAL energy system model have concluded that the low-pressure gas networks should be mostly abandoned by 2050, yet most of the iron pipes near buildings are currently being replaced early for safety reasons. Our study suggests that this programme will not lock-in the use of gas in the long-term. We examine potential future uses of the gas network in the UK energy system using an improved version of UK MARKAL that introduces a number of decarbonisation options for the gas network including bio-methane, hydrogen injection to the natural gas and conversion of the network to deliver hydrogen. We conclude that hydrogen conversion is the only gas decarbonisation option that might enable the gas networks to continue supplying energy to most buildings in the long-term, from a cost-optimal perspective.

In particular, PEVs will be the controllable demand that can mitigate the intermittency in wind generation and improve the capacity factors of the non-renewable generation assets on the grid. Optimization problems are formulated to minimize the costs of electricity generation, and two approaches are proposed to address the grid CO2 emission in the optimization. The first approach directly penalizes CO2 in the objective function, and the second approach adopts a carbon disincentive policy to alter the dispatch order of power plants, so that expensive low-CO2 plants can replace cheap high-CO2 plants. These two approaches result in very different outcomes: the first approach affects only the PEV charging demand on the grid and does not result in significant CO2 reduction, whereas the second approach controls both the generation and load, and CO2 can be reduced substantially. In addition, the carbon disincentive policy, unlike a carbon tax, does not collect any revenue; therefore, the increase in electricity cost is minimal. The effect of the proposed algorithms on the grid electricity cost and carbon emission is analyzed in details and reported. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For some of the GCC countries, the option to meet future power demands through alternative sources of energy such as nuclear power was deemed an attractive proposition. Furthermore, real investments and plans to use other alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, hydrogen and geothermal are also gaining momentum in the region. However, relatively recent developments in the technology used for extracting gas and oil from shale rock formations places a big question mark on the GCC countries' energy plans including those relating to alternative and renewable sources of energy. This article examines the GCC's new energy drive and explores the economic and political motivations behind it. Furthermore, the article also examines the potential impact of shale gas and oil extraction on this region's abundant fossil-based resources and the ramifications of such impact (if it materialises) for the GCC countries' alternative energy plans, future wealth and their political stability.

In this paper we use environmental input output analysis to construct CO2 production and consumption accounting inventories for Xiamen, a rapidly developing coastal city in southeast China. We found that, in 2007, total emissions embodied in production were 21.8 Mt CO2, of which 17.1 Mt CO2 were embodied in exports and 4.7 Mt CO2 resulted from local demand on local production. If the large amounts of emissions embodied in the Xiamen reprocessing trade are excluded from the analysis, total imported emissions were 12.2 Mt CO2, consumption emissions were 16.9 Mt CO2, and Xiamen was a net exporter of 4.9 Mt CO2. Although Xiamen's rapid economic growth is dependent on large-scale flows of embodied emissions, most of these emissions are not produced or consumed within the city system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, only few studies assess tourism's share in national emissions. This paper compares and analyses existing inventories of national emissions from tourism. Studies are difficult to compare, because they use different system boundaries and allocation principles, omitting or including lifecycle emissions and GHG other than CO2. By outlining and analysing these differences, the paper estimates the contribution made by tourism to national emissions, and its greenhouse gas intensity in comparison to other economic sectors. Results indicate that while emissions from tourism are significant in all countries studied, they may, in some countries, exceed 'official' emissions as calculated on the basis of guidelines for national emission inventories under the Kyoto Protocol. This is a result of the fact that bunker fuels are not considered in national GHG inventories, leading to underestimates of the energy- and GHG intensity of tourism economies. While further growth in tourism emissions can be expected in all countries studied, energy-related vulnerabilities are already considerable in many of these. Climate policy for tourism, on the other hand, is largely non-existent, calling for immediate action to consider this sector in national legislation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As biofuels trade increased, the European Union introduced sustainability regulations in an attempt to reduce the risks associated with biofuels. Producers were then confronted with costs of sustainability certification, in order to access the EU market. Hopes were that sustainably-produced biofuels would be rewarded with higher prices in the EU. Based on a review of recent literature, interviews with traders and price data from Platts, this paper explores whether sustainability premiums emerged and if so, did they represent an attracting feature in the market for sustainable biofuels. This article finds that premiums for ethanol and biodiesel evolved differently between 2011 and 2012, but have been in general very small or inexistent, with certified fuels becoming the new norm in the market. For different reasons, there has been an apparent convergence between biofuel policies in the EU and the US. As market operators perceive a long-term trend for full certification in the biofuels market, producers in developing countries are likely to face additional challenges in terms of finance and capacity to cope with the sustainability requirements.

Could life cycle assessment (LCA) of petroleum oil products provide inputs to crude oil sourcing and domestic oil pricing policies to address the two concerns? This paper presents a baseline study on LCA of petroleum products in India from Well to Storage depending on the oil source, type of refinery, product and the selected destinations. The LCA based GHG emissions are found to be higher by 4-12 per cent than GHG emissions from direct fuel consumption alone for LPG, 7-10 per cent for Gasoline, 3-9 per cent for Diesel and 4-10 per cent for Kerosene based on various supply chain routes supplying oil to six largest cities in India. Overall the energy used in oil exploration, refinery and transportation in the LCA have a share of 72-77 per cent, 11-15 per cent and 6-8 per cent, respectively.

The wage curve is an empirical regularity describing a negative relationship between regional unemployment rates and individuals' real wages. While this relationship has been well documented for a number of countries including Turkey, less attention has focused on how this relationship differs for informal versus formal employment. This is of utmost importance for less developed countries where informal employment plays a significant role in the economy. Using the Turkish Household Labour Force Survey observed over 26 NUTS 2 regions, we find that real hourly wages of informal workers in Turkey are more sensitive to variations in regional unemployment rates than wages of formal workers. This is true for all workers as well as for different gender and age groups.","[Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Baskaya, Yusuf Soner; Hulagu, Timur] Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Syracuse University; Syracuse University; Prime Ministry Turkey; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Baltagi, BH (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",bbaltagi@maxwell.syr.edu; soner.baskaya@tcmb.gov.tr; timur.hulagu@tcmb.gov.tr,"Hülagü, Timur/H-3681-2013; Baskaya, Yusuf Soner/Y-9380-2019","Baltagi, Badi/0000-0003-0469-4479; Baskaya, Yusuf Soner/0000-0003-4416-4907",,,,,25,9,11,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

City governments within these countries have been implementing policies to help reduce emissions and control the impacts of climate change. Vancouver, Melbourne and New York City governments have been policy activists in this area for a considerable period. Policy research on climate change argues that effective climate change action in federal systems requires collaboration and coordination between all levels of government. This article outlines a typology that identifies current thinking on the factors that shape the capacity of city governments in federal systems to establish effective climate change policies. Findings suggest a policy gap continues to impede effective policy implementation with city government being severely limited without the support of other levels of government. The conclusions provide a number of refinements to the typology as a result of the experiences of the three city governments.","Univ Queensland, Sch Business, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Jones, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Business, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",s.jones@business.uq.edu.au,"Jones, Stephen/AAW-1012-2020","Jones, Stephen/0000-0002-3510-8017",,,,,88,20,22,3,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

While many cities have adopted ambitious long-term emission reduction goals, few have articulated how to reach them. This paper presents one of the first long-term scenarios of deep greenhouse gas abatement for a major U.S. city. Using a detailed, bottom-up scenario analysis, we investigate how Seattle might achieve its recently stated goal of carbon neutrality by the year 2050. The analysis demonstrates that a series of ambitious strategies could achieve per capita GHG reductions of 34% in 2020, and 91% in 2050 in Seattle's core emissions from the buildings, transportation, and waste sectors. We examine the pros and cons of options to get to, or beyond, net zero emissions in these sectors. We also discuss methodological innovations for community-scale emissions accounting frameworks, including a core emissions focus that excludes industrial activity and a consumption perspective that expands the emissions footprint and scope of policy solutions. As in Seattle, other communities may find the mitigation strategies and analytical approaches presented here are useful for crafting policies to achieve deep GHG-reduction goals.

To see whether such a shutdown would reduce the risks for health and environment, the external costs of nuclear electricity are compared with alternatives that could replace it. The frequency of catastrophic nuclear accidents is based on the historical record, about one in 25 years for the plants built to date, an order of magnitude higher than the safety goals of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Impacts similar to Chernobyl and Fukushima are assumed to estimate the cost. A detailed comparison is presented with wind as alternative with the lowest external cost. The variability of wind necessitates augmentation by other sources, primarily fossil fuels, because storage at the required scale is in most regions too expensive. The external costs of natural gas combined cycle are taken as 0.6 epsilon cent/kWh due to health effects of air pollution and 1.25 epsilon cent/kWh due to greenhouse gases (at 25 epsilon/tco(2)eq) for the central estimate, but a wide range of different parameters is also considered, both for nuclear and for the alternatives. Although the central estimate of external costs of the wind-based alternative is higher than that of nuclear, the uncertainty ranges overlap. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis concludes that historical energy consumption increases were driven by more than just income levels, with the lowest-income consumers in the US using more energy in 2002 than they did in 1987 despite significant energy use efficiency gains and despite declining average incomes in this category. Further, direct use of energy in households increased for all income categories over this time period. These results point to rebound as being the culprit, not income effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the participation of stakeholders from the government, businesses, academia, and non-government organizations, prioritized needs and practices were identified using SSN, and gap analyses were conducted for comparison to global benchmarks. According to the results, the top needs were mainly focused on improving government efficiency and implementation, maintaining healthy indoor environments and obtaining adequate funds; priority practices were mainly focused on governmental action, renewable energy development and pollutant source reduction. The gap analysis indicated that the government efficiency and performance had the largest gap to the benchmark. By using a simple interactive tool to bring different stakeholders into policy making process, this study produces all-around information for decision makers.

Consequently, atmospheric emissions are greater than necessary. Government funded schemes have been introduced to incentivise the uptake of thermal retrofit measures in the domestic Irish market. A study of Ireland's housing highlights the dominance of detached houses (43%), 72% of which are rurally located and are predominantly heated with fuel oil. This paper investigates the economic and carbon case for thermal retrofit measures to the existing detached, oil centrally heated, rural housing stock. The study found the case for energy efficiency measures to be categorical and supports the Irish Government's focus on energy efficiency policy measures. Thermal retrofit measures in the detached housing stock have the potential to realise an averaged 65% theoretical reduction in heating costs and CO2 emissions for houses constructed prior to 1979 (coinciding with the introduction of building regulations) and around 26% for newer homes, thus offering a significant contribution (44%) to Ireland's residential carbon abatement projections and hence in meeting the EU's directives on energy and carbon. The greatest savings (36%) of Ireland's carbon abatement projections result from improving the energy efficiency of the pre 1979 stock. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The multiple criteria evaluation (MCE) prototype system is intended for regional planning but also for promoting group decision making that could involve participants with different interests in the development of decision alternatives. The framework integrates environmental and economic criteria and builds a hierarchy for wind farm siting using weighted linear combination (WLC) techniques and GIS functionality. The SDSS allows the multiple participants to interact and develop an understanding of the spatial data for assigning importance values to each factor. The WLC technique is used to combine the assigned values with map layers, which are standardized using fuzzy set theory, to produce individual suitability maps. The maps created by personal preferences from the participants are aggregated for producing a group solution using the Borda method. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the group solution to examine how small changes in the factor weights affect the calculated suitability scores. The results from the sensitivity analysis are intended to aid understanding of compromised solutions through changes in the input data from the participant's perspective. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To circumvent the problem of comparing plants with different size we normalized the construction time to plants with 1 GW. We restricted the analysis to 201 PWRs which suffered less from external factors that were beyond the control of the management from 1965 to 2010. The results showed that the normalized construction time did not increase over the years and nor with the plants' gross power level. The learning rate of the industry regarding normalized construction times showed a reduction with 95% confidence level of about 0.56 +/- 0.07 months for each 10 GW of installed capacity. Over the years the normalized construction time decreased and became more predictable. The data showed that countries with more centralized regulatory, construction and operation environments were able to build PWRs in shorter times. Countries less experienced with the nuclear technology built PWRs in longer times. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Moreira, Joao M.

We establish the stage of development of each country, their short- and long-term degree of compliance and the trends of international investors favouring one market or another. EU countries employ four major types of programs to encourage PV use: (1) feed in tariffs (FIT), (2) green certificates with a quota system, (3) investment and tax incentives, and (4) bids on the quota system. The FIT is the most widely used program to create incentives for the use of PV systems. During the past two years, PV tariffs have been reduced in many European countries. Investments in PV are still attractive, in some cases even overly generous with respect to the financial landscape in the world. This paper shows, for each country, the type of incentive and the trends in and forecast for installed capacity and calculates the internal rate of return (IRR) for investment in grid-connected PV systems.

A number of panel unit root and cointegration tests are applied. Time series data on public policies and exports are integrated and cointegrated. The dynamic OLS results indicate that in the long run, a 1% increase in government R&D expenditures (RAD) increases exports (EX) by 0.819%. EX and RAD variables respond to deviations from the long-run equilibrium in the previous period. Additionally, the Blundell-Bond system generalized methods of moments (GMM) is employed to conduct a panel causality test in a vector error-correction mechanism (VECM) setting. Evidence of a bidirectional and short-run, and strong causal relationship between EX and the contribution of renewable energy to the total energy supply (CRES) is uncovered. CRES has a negative effect on EX, whereas EX has a positive effect on CRES. We suggest some policy implications based on the results of this study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Several measures have been implemented in order to mitigate electricity shortage. The focus has been on raising the installed capacity of electricity generation and transmission. The present policy results in expensive thermal electricity generation mostly using expensive and environmentally hazardous furnace oil and inability of utilities to recover their cost of supply although there is unprecedented rise in electricity tariffs. This study concentrates on the electricity demand and traces the relationship between electricity shortfalls, tariff rate and electricity theft in the background of recent electricity crisis using the data for the period 1985-2010. We employed the Granger causality test through error correction model and out-of-sample causality through variance decomposition method. Empirical evidence shows that electricity theft greatly influences electricity shortfalls through lowering investment and inefficient use of electricity. The study concludes that electricity crisis cannot be handled without combating rampant electricity theft in the country. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

With rising energy demand, frequent energy shortages, and increasing pollution, it is essential for Jiangsu to put more emphasis on improving its energy efficiency and utilizing its renewable resources in the future. This paper presents the integrated energy pathway for Jiangsu during its social and economic transformation until 2050. EnergyPLAN is the chosen energy system analysis tool, since it accounts for all sectors of the energy system that needs to be considered when integrating large-scale renewable energy. A current policy scenario (CPS) based on current energy policies and an ambitious policy scenario (APS) based on large-scale integration of renewable energy and ambitious measures of energy efficiency improvement are proposed. The two energy pathways are modeled and compared in terms of technology combination, non-fossil fuel shares of primary energy supply, socioeconomic costs, and CO2 emissions. The insights from these pathways can provide valuable input for Jiangsu's future energy policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This phenomenon is generally attributable to manufacturing efficiency gained with cumulative experience producing a certain good, and is modeled by an empirical experience curve. The technical analyses conducted in support of U.S. energy conservation standards for residential appliances and commercial equipment have, until recently, assumed that manufacturing costs and retail prices remain constant during the projected 30-year analysis period. This assumption does not reflect real market price dynamics. Using price data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we present U.S. experience curves for room air conditioners, clothes dryers, central air conditioners, furnaces, and refrigerators and freezers. These experience curves were incorporated into recent energy conservation standards analyses for these products. Including experience curves increases the national consumer net present value of potential standard levels. In some cases a potential standard level exhibits a net benefit when considering experience, whereas without experience it exhibits a net cost. These results highlight the importance of modeling more representative market prices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As described in other papers in this special issue, we are exploring and analysing a set of core transition pathways, based on alternative governance patterns in which the 'logics' of market actors, government actors and civil society actors, respectively dominate. This core pathway analysis is enhanced by analyses of branching points within and across the pathways, which informs how competition between different logics plays out at key decision points. Branching points are defined as key decision points at which choices made by actors, in response to internal or external stresses or triggers, determine whether and in what ways the pathway is followed. A set of initial branching points for our three core transition pathways is identified through project and stakeholder workshops, and drawing on analysis of actors' choices and responses at past branching points in energy system transitions. The potential responses of the actors are identified at these branching points, and risk mitigation strategies are formulated for the dominant actors to reinforce that pathway, as well as opportunities for actors to move away from the pathway.

We assess the cost-effectiveness of increased battery capacity vs. nondomestic charging infrastructure installation for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as alternate methods to reduce gasoline consumption for cars, trucks, and SUVs in the US. We find across a wide range of scenarios that the least-cost solution is for more drivers to switch to low-capacity plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (short electric range with gasoline backup for long trips) or gasoline-powered hybrid electric vehicles. If more gasoline savings are needed per vehicle, nondomestic charging infrastructure installation is substantially more expensive than increased battery capacity per gallon saved, and both approaches have higher costs than US oil premium estimates. Cost effectiveness of all subsidies are lower under a binding fuel economy standard. Comparison of results to the structure of current federal subsidies shows that policy is not aligned with fuel savings potential, and we discuss issues and alternatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We found an inverted-U shape relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP in both short and long-run, thus supporting the EKC hypothesis.

We propose a new approach that is aimed at extracting both currency components and energy- and commodity-price components from observed exchange rates and prices. We first analyze the separate influence of commodity prices on the Canadian and the U.S. currency components. We then estimate the separate impact of the two currency components on the shares of manufacturing employment in Canada. We show that between 33 and 39 per cent of the manufacturing employment loss that was due to exchange rate developments between 2002 and 2007 is related to the Dutch disease phenomenon.

From a policy perspective, this poses the question why this value should not be realised within existing market structures. Opinion among stakeholders is divided. Some believe that storage deployment constitutes a 'special case' in need of policy support. Others insist that markets can provide the necessary platform to negotiate contracts, which reward storage operators for the range of services they could provide. This paper seeks to inform this debate with a process of stakeholder engagement using a perspective informed by socio-technical transition literatures. This approach allows the identification of tensions among actors in the electricity system and of possibilities for co-evolution in the deployment of storage technologies during a transition towards a low carbon electricity system. It also draws attention to policy-related challenges of technology lock-in and path dependency resulting from poor alignment of incumbent regimes with the requirements for distributed electricity storage.

These end-uses, commonly referred to as appliances and lighting, are a rapidly increasing part of residential energy demand. This paper proposes a model that can be verified using aggregated data of electricity meters in small areas and census data on housing. Secondly, any differences that open up between major collections of housing could potentially be resolved by using data from frequently updated expenditure surveys. For the year 2008, the model overestimated domestic non-heating energy use at the national scale by 1.5%. This model was then used on the residential sector with various area classifications, which found that rural and suburban areas were generally underestimated by up to 3.3% and urban areas overestimated by up to 5.2% with the notable exception of professional city life classifications.

This policy requires such businesses to hold predetermined numbers of tradable credits called Packaging waste Recovery Notes (PRNs). This article provides insights into the economic implications of such a policy through a simple analytical model of a recyclable product and the PRN markets. Our analysis yields two particularly interesting results. First, an increase in the required recycling rate dampens the output and landfill waste levels, while the effect on the level of recycling activities is ambiguous. Second, an increase in the landfill tax always leads to an increase in the landfill waste. We also discuss how the socially optimal landfill tax in the presence of the PRN market should be chosen.

We examine factors that influence the shift in aspirations in five slum settlements using data from 500 interviews conducted in serviced and non-serviced slums from the state of Gujarat in India. The non-serviced slums did not have access to basic services namely water, sanitation, energy, roads, solid waste and rainwater management. We find empirical evidence which suggests that when basic infrastructure provisions are met, slum dwellers shift their focus from lower order aspirations to the higher order aspirations like health, education, housing and land ownership. We argue that energy provision enhances productivity and enables slum dwellers to shift their aspirations upwards. Furthermore, we test the effect of work days lost due to illness on the relationship between higher order aspirations and aspirations for energy provision. When provision of energy is low, higher work day loss dampens higher order aspirations. For policy makers, this study highlights the critical link between the infrastructure services preferred by slum dwellers and their social aspirations for growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Family age-composition patterns are found to have a distinct impact on household energy use behavior. Households with young children are more likely to adopt energy-efficient technologies and energy conservation practices and place primary importance on energy savings for environmental reasons. By contrast, households with a high share of elderly members place more importance on financial savings, and have lower levels of technology adoption, energy conservation practice use, and knowledge about household energy use. Education levels also matter, with higher levels associated with energy-efficient technology adoption and energy conservation practice use. Similarly, university education increases the stated importance of energy savings for greenhouse gas reductions and decreases the stated importance for financial reasons. Education impacts also vary greatly across survey countries and there is some evidence of an Eastern-Western European divide with respect to attitudes towards energy savings. These cross-country differences highlight the need to balance a common EU energy-efficiency policy framework with flexibility for country specific policies to address unique constraints to energy-efficient technology and conservation practice adoption.

To deploy offshore wind parks in a rational way, the overall OWE potential has to be realistically determined. This has to be done on an international, cross-border level and by taking into account the existing man-made and nature-related uses of the North Sea. As spatial conflicts will arise between existing uses and the new OWE uses, a Decision Support System (DSS) based on a Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed. Based on data of existing sea uses and calculation rules for spatial prioritisation analysis, the DSS helps in identifying areas that are (1) generally suitable for offshore wind power, (2) strictly excluded or (3) negotiable with respect to other existing sea uses. The combination of this conflict analysis together with cost assumptions for offshore wind farms and their expected electricity yield leads to identification of favourable areas for OWE deployment in the North Sea. This approach helps to reduce the conflict between offshore wind deployment and existing sea uses in the North Sea for future planning. The results can assist decision makers in developing transnational roadmaps for OWE. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The coal market is of special relevance as coal is available in many countries and often the first choice to meet energy demand. In this paper we assess possible interactions between climate policies and the global steam coal market. Possible market adjustments between demand regions through market effects are investigated with a numerical model of the global steam coal market: the COALMOD-World model. This equilibrium model computes future trade flows, infrastructure investments and prices until 2030. We investigate three specific designs of climate policy: a unilateral European climate policy, an Indonesian export-limiting policy and a fast-roll out of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the broader context of climate policy and market constraints. We find that market adjustment effects in the coal market can have significant positive and negative impacts on the effectiveness of climate policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim is to analyse the factors influencing this development as well as the strategies used by involved parties to prevent stagnation. Using large technical system theory, I analyse internal and external factors potentially causing stagnation. The most obvious external factors are: an increase in the number of energy-efficient buildings, in response to stricter energy policies, which reduces the future potential for district heating in new and existing buildings; climate change; competition from other heating systems; and market saturation in the key sector, multi-dwelling buildings. The main internal factor is changed business strategies following electricity market deregulation, when energy companies were supposed to be run on businesslike terms. I also argue that stagnation can be defined as occurring when the key measure feature of a system, in this case, heat load is starting to stagnate or decline, even though the trend is positive in other areas. The strategies for avoiding stagnation are various forms of broadening scope, primarily by focusing more on electricity production by building combined heat and power plants, or using the alternative value of the technical system for new applications.

The long lifecycles of the building stock, the impacts of climate change and the requirements for low carbon development underline the need for long-term thinking from the early design stages. 'Future-proofing' is an emerging research agenda with currently no widely accepted definition amongst scholars and building professionals. In this paper, it refers to design processes that accommodate explicitly full lifecycle perspectives and energy trends and drivers by at least 2050, when selecting energy efficient measures and low carbon technologies. A knowledge map is introduced, which explores the key axes (or attributes) for achieving a 'future-proofed' energy design: namely, coverage of sustainability issues, lifecycle thinking, and accommodating risks and uncertainties that affect the energy consumption. It is concluded that further research is needed so that established building energy assessment methods are refined to better incorporate future-proofing. The study follows an interdisciplinary approach and is targeted at design teams with aspirations to achieve resilient and flexible low-energy buildings over the long-term. (C). 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Various financial incentive programs have been developed to promote the adoption of these products. However, their effectiveness in attracting consumers is not very well understood. In this study, we investigated impacts of financial incentives on homeowner's decision making towards six EERE products. Two forms of incentives, tax credits and interest-free loans, were examined through a household mailing survey in Florida, the United States. Results showed that, although half of the respondents were interested in EERE products, the high investment cost was a major concern that hindered their purchase activities. Homeowners were attracted to financial incentives and valued tax credits much higher than interest-free loans. The current federal home energy tax credit levels were found to attract only 2-12 percent of homeowners to buy EERE products. The willingness of participation was especially low for the costly products (such as solar panels). The participation rate was also very low for lower income (i.e., annual household income below $50,000) families living in older residences. This study contributes to the understanding of economic and social aspects of consumer decision making on energy efficiency and alternative energy.

The main goal of this study was to validate a causal trust-acceptability model for electricity generation sources. In the model, social acceptance of an energy source is directly caused by perceived risk and benefit and also by social trust in regulatory agencies (both directly and indirectly, through perceived risk and benefit). Results from a web-based survey of Chilean university students demonstrated that data for energy sources that are controversial in Chilean society (fossil fuels, hydro, and nuclear power) fit the hypothesized model, whereas data for non conventional renewable energy sources (solar, wind, geothermal and tidal) did not.

We examine energy and emissions regulations for older petroleum powered vehicles and newer plug-in electric vehicles. Until now, vehicle regulations across the world have ignored energy consumption and emissions upstream of the vehicle (at refineries, pipelines, etc), largely because of the convenient fact that upstream emissions and energy use are nearly uniform across petroleum-fueled vehicles and play a relatively minor role in total lifecycle emissions. Including upstream impacts would greatly complicate the regulations. But because the vast majority of emissions and energy consumption for electric vehicles (and hydrogen and, to a lesser extent, biofuels) are upstream, the old regulatory design is no longer valid. The pressing regulatory question is whether to assign upstream GHG emissions to electric vehicles, or not, and if so, how. We find that assigning zero upstream emissions-as a way of incentivizing the production and sale of PEVs-would eventually lead to an erosion of 20% of the GHG emission benefits from new vehicles, assuming fixed vehicle standards. We suggest alternative policy mechanisms and strategies to account for upstream emissions and energy use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The technical simulations are based on electricity billing, consumption monitoring, an energy audit data, combined with 15 min interval load and PV system performance for commercially available technologies and balance of system components, using long-term meteorological input data. The economic modelling uses 2010 market prices for capital costs, operational costs, electricity tariffs, subsidies, and is based on discounted cash flow analyses which generate a final net present value (NPV) for each system against network electricity costs (in Australian dollars, AUD) over a 15 year investment horizon. The results suggest that current market prices generate a negative NPV (a net private loss), even with the current government subsidies, which lead to higher home electricity costs than conventional network electricity use. Additionally, the private costs of carbon emission mitigation (AUD tCO(2)-e(-1)) for the grid-connected PV system simulations and models were around AUD 600-700 tCO(2)-e(-1), a particularly expensive option when compared to existing large-scale renewable energy mitigation activities.

There are government subsidies available for people to improve the energy efficiency of their homes but uptake has been relatively low among owners of rental properties. This paper presents the results of a choice experiment used to investigate the preferences of home owners and tenants for insulation and heating upgrades. The responses indicate that landlords may underestimate how cold their rental properties are in winter, considering the level of discomfort reported by tenants. Median willingness-to-pay (WTP) for improved insulation by landlords is only 50-70% of owner-occupier values. Landlords are willing to pay more for a heating appliance than any other retrofit option. In contrast, tenants have a low WTP for the heating appliance and would prefer under-floor insulation. Tenants express a willingness to pay higher rent in exchange for improved energy efficiency, at a rate that would appear to make such upgrades economic for the landlord. Information asymmetry and lack of appropriate market signals may be a large part of the reason why many landlords are not willing to pay market prices for energy efficiency upgrades.

This paper argues that there are four possible answers to the question what will Fukushima change: everything because the nuclear industry cannot survive another Chernobyl: the impact will vary according to location; it is too early to determine the impact; and the nuclear industry was facing serious problems that Fukushima will do no more than exacerbate. We focus on the last answer, arguing that the new designs that were expected to be so attractive as to power a 'Nuclear Renaissance' were already failing. The promises that they would be safer, but simpler, therefore cheaper and more buildable were unachievable and the Renaissance in the West had already failed. If the nuclear industry is to have a future, it might be through a shift in locus from North America and Western Europe to China, Russia and India. However, it is not clear that these countries can avoid the techno-economic issues that have derailed the nuclear industry in the West. The prospect that the nuclear industry can be saved by a radical new generation of designs is a long way off and still a remote possibility. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We show the effects of grid extensions for fundamental properties of the power system as a function of the penetration and mix of wind and solar energy. Backup capacity requirements and overproduction are reduced with a powerful overlay transmission grid. We determine the costs of the grid extensions in dependence of the VRE penetration and mix and find that the grid integration costs remain below 25% of the VRE investment costs for all conceivable VRE configurations. Furthermore, robust design features of future power systems in terms of grid geometry and flexibility requirements for backup technologies are identified.

Adoption could be encouraged by making cogeneration more economically attractive, either by increasing the expected returns or decreasing the risks of such investments. We evaluate the expected returns from demand response, capacity markets, regulation markets, accelerated depreciation, pricing CO2 emissions, and net metering. We find that (1) there is an incentive to overcommit in the capacity market due to lenient non-response penalties, (2) there is significant revenue potential in the regulation market, though demand-side resources are yet to participate, (3) a price on CO2 emissions will make cogeneration more attractive relative to conventional, utility-supplied energy, and (4) accelerated depreciation is an easy and effective mechanism for improving the economics of cogeneration. We go on to argue that uncertainty in fuel and electricity prices present a significant risk to cogeneration projects, and we evaluate the effectiveness of feed-in tariffs at mitigating these risks. We find that guaranteeing a fixed electricity payment is not effective. A two-part feed-in tariff, with an annual capacity payment and an energy payment that adjusts with fuel costs, can eliminate energy-price risks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are indications that the average performance of the UPS equipment available in the Brazilian market requires some improvement. Information about the energy-related behaviour of UPS units is scarce. In this paper, we estimate and analyse the installed capacity of UPS units and assess their power consumption, losses and impact on the power quality in the electrical system. The analysis is performed through energy efficiency and power quality measurements performed on UPS units that are commonly available in Brazil. We estimate the energy conservation potential of the UPS. The results of assessments strongly support the need for public policies for energy efficiency and power quality improvements, particularly the labelling of UPS units and the introduction of minimum performance standards for UPS devices.

Total factor productivity, intangible assets and spatial dependence in the European regions, Regional Studies. The aim of this paper is to analyse the determinants of the efficiency levels across the European regions. Firstly, a regression-based measure of regional total factor productivity is derived by estimating a spatial Cobb-Douglas production function. Secondly, the role played by intangible factors (human capital, social capital and technological capital) on total factor productivity levels is investigated by applying the spatial two-stage least-squares (2SLS) method and the spatial heteroskedasticy and correlation consistent (SHAC) estimator to account for both heteroskedasticity and spatial autocorrelation. It turns out that a large part of total factor productivity differences across the European regions is explained by disparities in the endowments of these intangible assets.","[Dettori, Barbara; Marrocu, Emanuela; Paci, Raffaele] Univ Cagliari, Ctr Ric Econ NS CRENoS, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Dettori, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Ctr Ric Econ NS CRENoS, Via San Giorgio 12, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.",paci@unica.it,"; Marrocu, Emanuela/E-2903-2017","PACI, RAFFAELE/0000-0003-0301-438X; Marrocu, Emanuela/0000-0002-7436-0055",,,,,65,104,106,4,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Political instability and increasing electricity demand are two major complicating factors in power sector reform of small systems such as that of Nepal. Lessons from international experience suggest that measures such as cost-reflecting pricing, restructuring and independent regulation are important for the success of reforms. In small systems, the creation of an independent regulatory authority is more important than unbundling of the sector. In the present context of Nepal accounting separation of the main activities may be a pragmatic restructuring approach given the present political and market condition. As the systems gradually grow larger. vertical separation of the system and horizontal splitting of the generation segment and competition in organised wholesale market followed by privatisation remains an option in the long run.

Accordingly, the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) will be implemented from 2015 onwards. As ETS performance substantially depends on the structural design, it is critically important to examine the details of Korean ETS for the achievement of cost effectiveness and concurrent development of an active emission trading market. This paper addresses several policy design issues for this purpose. After providing an overview on the current framework of Korean ETS, we propose ways to achieve flexibility, consistency and market efficiency of the program in consideration of the preexisting policies. Issues in policy design are discussed by focusing on allowance allocation, market stabilization measures and price mechanism in the emission and energy markets in Korea. This paper will serve as a practical guideline for establishing sustainable and market-efficient Korean ETS that can be compatible with the international standards as in the EU ETS.

Its underlying assumption is that correct retrofit technology is developed by experts and comes down through supply chains to households, who apply it as designed to their properties. However, this model is challenged by the insight from socio-technical systems studies (STST) that technology and society mutually form and influence each other at every level of society. Using this conceptual framework, this study investigated whether innovations are happening among retrofitting households, and what support these have for diffusion upwards into supply chains and outwards to other households. Qualitative data was gathered through semi-structured interviews among homeowner-retrofitters plus building professionals and citizens' initiatives which support these, in Cambridge, UK. Local innovation was found in the development of new retrofit technology and novel reconfiguring of existing solutions. Much of this was triggered by clashes between standard retrofit solutions and heritage or aesthetic values, economic necessity, or building professionals' lack of knowledge or experience. The findings suggest that instead of treating homeowners as passive recipients, UK thermal retrofit policy should broaden to identify useful innovations developed by homeowners and support them where appropriate.

How should China fill the SPR in a cost-effective manner in the short-run? How might this affect world oil prices? Using a dynamic programming model to answer these questions, the objective of this paper is to minimize the stockpiling costs, including consumer surplus as well as crude acquisition and holding costs. The crude oil acquisition price in the model is determined by global equilibrium between supply and demand. Demand, in turn, depends on world market conditions including China's stockpile filling rate. Our empirical study under different market conditions shows that China's optimal stockpile acquisition rate varies from 9 to 19 million barrels per month, and the optimal stockpiling drives up the world oil price by 3-7%. The endogenous price increase accounts for 52% of total stockpiling costs in the base case. When the market is tighter or the demand function is more inelastic, the stockpiling affects the market more significantly and pushes prices even higher. Alternatively, in a disruption, drawdown from the stockpile can effectively dampen soaring prices, though the shortage is likely to leave the price higher than before the disruption.

J,"Stram, BN",,,,"Stram, Bruce Nels",,,A new strategic plan for a carbon tax,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon tax strategy; Energy research and development; Alternative energy sources,,"This paper proposes a new Green House Gas policy building upon general consensus in scientific, political and economic communities including: 1. Concern too little progress is being made toward an integrated global approach to controlling CO2 emissions. 2. Recommendation of a carbon tax. 3. Need for increased R&D for alternative energy sources. 4. Substantially increased research and development expenditures are relatively inexpensive. Here,these elements are woven into a coherent strategy that should be farmore politically acceptable by global governments than currentalternatives. Here are its elements: 1. A small carbon tax whose proceeds are tied exclusively to energy research and development in a dedicated trust fund. 2. Deployment of the fund to demonstrate benefits of the approach and its incentives for other countries to join. 3. The establishment of a commonality of interest among participating nations. 4. Clear incentives for additional nations to participate. The ultimate goal, energy services at lower cost than today with fossil fuels, is appropriately ambitious. The proposed approach is functional, timely and will produce benefits going well beyond simply stemming global warming.

Special attention was given to the problem of sample selection bias in assessing the impact of subsidies on biogas energy use because biogas subsidies often change the propensity for installing biogas digesters. Using data from a large-scale household survey, the results indicate that biogas subsidies did promote the construction of biogas digesters. The results suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in subsidy-cost ratio would lead to a 3% increase in digester installations. We also found that biogas subsidies correlated negatively with average time of digester use. A 10 percentage point increase in the subsidy-cost ratio would result in a 4.3% reduction in the average working time of digesters. These results suggest that the net effect of the current subsidy policy on rural household biogas use was near-negligible. Indeed, a 10 percentage point increase in the subsidy-cost ratio resulted in a mere 1.15% increase in biogas use. These findings indicate that biogas subsidies have possibly not been targeted effectively at households that would actually prefer to use biogas energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this communication, we outline the fundamental reasons why deep borehole disposal should receive more detailed investigation, alongside traditional shallow mined repositories. This potential solution is supported by advancing drilling technologies and an improving understanding of extremely long fluid residence times in deep bedrock. Radionuclide isolation is supported by verifiable and stable geologic barriers such as long transport distances to aquifers, low permeability, and reducing chemical conditions. The modular nature of implementing deep borehole disposal could offer unique programmatic and economic advantages. Experience with a pilot borehole program will be required to confirm the feasibility of drilling and emplacement operations, and key chemical and hydraulic conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We assume that the decision to switch is based on the unanimity of, tau past opinions. The resulting model offers a hypothetical, yet plausible explanation of why there is such a big discrepancy between consumer opinions, as measured by market surveys, and the actual participation in pilot programs and the adoption of dynamic tariffs. We argue that due to the high indifference level in today's retail electricity markets, customer opinions are very unstable and change frequently. The conducted simulation study shows that reducing the indifference level can result in narrowing the intention-behavior gap. A similar effect can be achieved by decreasing the decision time that a consumer takes to make a decision. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantifying the rebound effect in energy efficient lighting,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rebound; Lighting; Energy efficiency,CENTURIES,"This paper quantifies the direct rebound effects associated with the switch from incandescent lamps (ILs) or halogen bulbs to more energy efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) or light emitting diodes (LEDs) using a large nationally representative survey of German households. The direct rebound effect is measured as the elasticity of energy demand for lighting with respect to changes in energy efficient lamps. In particular, the rebound effect is decomposed into changes in lamp luminosity and burn time. For the average bulb, the associated total direct rebound effect is estimated at about 6%. The larger part (around 60%) of this rebound effect results from increases in bulb luminosity. For the most frequent (modal) bulb switch, i.e. the replacement of the main bulb in the living or dining room, the total direct rebound effect is just below 3%, with around 60% attributable to an increase in burn time. Average and modal bulb differences suggest that the magnitude of the rebound effect may decrease with intensity of initial bulb use. The magnitude of the direct rebound and the relative contributions of changes in luminosity and burn time also differ by initial bulb type and by replacement bulb type. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, this paper empirically investigates the role of China's crude oil net imports in Brent price changes from October 2005 to November 2013 based on an econometric analysis. The results indicate that, during the sample period, China's crude oil imports do not significantly affect Brent price changes, no matter in the long run or short run. Therefore, the blame for China's crude oil imports to cause the dramatic fluctuations of international oil price has no solid evidence. Also, there exists significant uni-directional causality running from the Brent price to China's crude oil imports at the 5% level. Besides, the response of the Brent price to China's crude oil imports is found positive but slight, and the Brent price responds more significantly to US dollar exchange rate and OECD commercial inventory than to China's crude oil imports in the short run. Finally, the contribution of China's crude oil imports to Brent price movement is about 10%, which is less than that of US dollar exchange rate but larger than that of Indian crude oil imports or OECD commercial inventory.

The results suggest that certain government-backed energy policies impede renewable energy investments, thus implying significant failures in policy design. These policies may be failing mainly because of uncertainty and the likelihood of discontinuity. Weak voluntary approaches are introduced in order to satisfy public demand for more sustainable investments and programmes; we find that these may have negative influences on the growth of renewables as well.

The objective of this article is to contribute to the improvement of corporate sustainability valuations by investigating if reserves profiles can affect the environmental risk exposure of an Oil & Gas (O&G) corporation. Data on reserves from 2009 to 2012 of 24 listed O&G companies were used to test six hypotheses, addressing how these profiles could relate to the four material environmental risks: climate change, accidents, sensitive area/access, water. The frequency with which companies reported these risks was evaluated using key word in context (KWIC) content analysis. Analysis of variance (Anova) and Student's t tests were applied to each of the hypotheses. This study shows environmental risks are embedded with the oil and gas reserves. We found the following relationships: (1) companies with heavy oil reserves report more exposure to climate change risks, particularly emissions control; (2) water is more of an issue with companies with higher bitumen and natural gas reserves; and (3) there is significant regional bias in the reporting of the environmental risk factors. These findings have broad implications for the financial industry, governments, investors and lenders alike. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We present ethical and legal analyses of the current stalemate on bioenergy governance in the EU using two illustrative cases: liquid biofuels for transport and solid biomass-based bioenergy. The two cases disclose some similarities between these two factors, but the remaining differences may partly explain, or justify, contrasting forms of governance. While there seems to be no easy way in which the EU and national governments can deal with the multiple sustainability issues raised by bioenergy, it is argued that failure to deal explicitly with the underlying value disagreements, or to make apparent the regulatory complexity, clouds the issue of how to move forward with governance of bioenergy. We suggest that governance should be shaped with greater focus on the role of value disagreements and regulatory complexity. There is a need for more openness and transparency about such factors, and about the inherent trade-offs in bioenergy governance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We distinguish between ten different search methods. For most search methods, including methods that rely on social networks and temporary help agencies, we find that sequential search cannot be rejected. However, when firms use advertising or public/private employment agencies, sequential search is rejected. Hence, we find that both forms of search are relevant for our understanding of the labour market.

The estimates on a unique sample of more than 500 Italian municipalities highlight that the refuse collection technology exhibits constant returns to scale as well as scope economies between disposal and recycling. As far as the size of the municipality increases, scope economies rise up to 20%, but they are accompanied by overall diseconomies of scale. The findings suggest that, on the one hand, joint management of disposal and recycling should be encouraged and, on the other hand, that strategies aimed at increasing the share of waste sent for recycling would not imply a considerable increase in total costs.","[Abrate, Graziano; Erbetta, Fabrizio; Fraquelli, Giovanni] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Fac Econ, I-28100 Novara, Italy; [Abrate, Graziano; Erbetta, Fabrizio] HERMES, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy; [Fraquelli, Giovanni] Ceris CNR, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy; [Vannoni, Davide] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, I-10128 Turin, Italy; [Vannoni, Davide] Coll Carlo Alberto, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Abrate, G (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Fac Econ, Via Perrone 18, I-28100 Novara, Italy.",graziano.abrate@eco.unipmn.it; fabrizio.erbetta@eco.unipmn.it; g.fraquelli@ceris.cnr.it; vannoni@econ.unito.it,"Abrate, Graziano/ABH-8455-2020","Abrate, Graziano/0000-0002-1003-7523; Erbetta, Fabrizio/0000-0001-5100-718X; vannoni, davide/0000-0002-5145-8156",,,,,28,27,28,0,99,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Different balancing rules are applied to wind power among the countries; for instance, to what extent wind power producers (WPPs) are responsible for the energy imbalances and how those imbalances are penalized. This paper discusses those different rules and evaluates their effects on WPP bidding strategies. To do so, a quantitative analysis is presented for an offshore wind farm, considering the differences in the balancing rules and prices of Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. The quantitative approach consists of a stochastic optimization model that maximizes the profits of a WPP by trading in different markets (day-ahead and intraday) and computes the final energy delivered. The model considers uncertainties of most important parameters such as wind energy forecasts and prices at different time frames. The results show that the imbalance pricing design and the allocation of balance responsibility significantly affect WPP' revenues. Additionally, WPPs deviate differently from the expected energy depending on the balancing rules, which can impact the system. Furthermore, these balancing rules should be considered with other market regulations, such as the design of support schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Chaves-Avila, J.

The implications of this new law lend some uncertainty to Panama's electricity development pathway. This paper quantitatively analyzes the current status of power generation in Panama, and explores various potential future scenarios and the associated impacts on the system marginal cost, global warming potential, and resource diversity index. To this end, this study applies the scenario development methodology developed by Schwartz in the context of the energy-economic modeling platform 'Long-range Energy Alternative Planning' (LEAP). Four scenarios are developed and analyzed. The Business as Usual scenario extrapolates the electricity generation trend that has been observed over the last decade; it is compared to three alternative scenarios which have more specific objectives. Scenario 1 encourages climate mitigation without incorporating new technologies in the generation mix, Scenario 2 maximizes resource diversity, and Scenario 3 minimizes global warming potential. For each scenario, the composition of the electricity generation profile, system marginal cost, global warming potential, and resource diversity is predicted quantitatively. These scenarios to not attempt to forecast likely developments, but rather illuminate the tradeoffs that different development pathways entail. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Within an international trend to ETIS rebuilding, UK experience has been distinctive: from a low starting base in the early-2000s, to system remaking under a strong decarbonisation policy imperative in the late-2000s, to multiple and contested drivers in the early-2010s. Public funding levels have been erratic, with a rapid increase and a more recent decline. The private business sector has played a leading role in this remaking, and as this influence has grown, the role and style of energy innovation has shifted from long term niches to the shorter term mainstream. The UK ETIS suffers from persistent problems: fragmentation, low transparency and weak links to the research evidence base. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Vented kiln dryers were preferred by larger firms and heat pump kiln dryers were used by smaller firms. Although few firms could specify all their costs, we found no significant,differences in the average operating costs, drying costs or commercial success of the larger and smaller firms. We found that socio-technical barriers create energy cultures at the level of both the firm and the sector, supporting the dominance of vented kiln dryers. The prevailing technologies, practices and norms at the sector level strongly support vented kilns, the status quo being embedded in the socio-technical context, hindering technological learning, improved energy efficiency and innovation. Influential stakeholders in the industry were thus part of, and locked into, the industry-wide energy culture, and were not in a position to effect change. We conclude that actors external to the prevailing industry energy culture need to leverage change in the industry norms, practices and/or technologies in order to reap the advantages of energy-efficient drying technology, assist its continued evolution and avoid the risks of path-dependency.

Consequently, the determination of office yields is based not on the intrinsic investment characteristics of regional markets, but on a core market benchmark combined with a regional premium. This results in very long-term mispricing patterns with implications not just for the office property investment market, but also for the regions, especially those outside the core.","[Henneberry, John] Univ Sheffield, Dept Town & Reg Planning, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Mouzakis, Fotis] Frynon Consulting, GR-1632 Athens, Greece",University of Sheffield,"Henneberry, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Town & Reg Planning, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",j.henneberry@sheffield.ac.uk; f.mouzakis@frynon.com,,"Henneberry, John/0000-0002-3563-4957",,,,,52,16,20,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

How current objectives for emission reduction can be reached in the future and what the future power system will look like is, however, not fully clear. In particular, power plant investments in the long run and power plant dispatch in the short run are subject to considerable uncertainty. Therefore an approach is presented which allows electricity market development to be assessed in the presence of stochastic power feed-in and endogenous investments in power plants and renewable energies. To illustrate the range of possible future developments, five scenarios for the European electricity system up to 2050 are investigated. Both generation investments and dispatch as well as utilization of transmission lines are optimized for these scenarios and additional sensitivity analyses are carried out. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The determinants of economic growth in European regions, Regional Studies. This paper uses Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to find robust determinants of economic growth between 1995 and 2005 in a new data set of 255 European regions. It finds that income convergence between countries is dominated by the catching-up of regions in new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, whereas convergence within countries is driven by regions in old European Union member states. Regions containing capital cities are growing faster, particularly in Central and Eastern European countries, as do regions with a large share of workers with a higher education. The results are robust when allowing for spatial spillovers among European regions.","[Cuaresma, Jesus Crespo] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Dept Econ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Cuaresma, Jesus Crespo] IIASA, World Populat Program, Laxenberg, Austria; [Cuaresma, Jesus Crespo] Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital WIC, Vienna, Austria; [Cuaresma, Jesus Crespo] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria; [Doppelhofer, Gernot] Norwegian Sch Econ NHH, Dept Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Feldkircher, Martin] Oesterreich Natl Bank, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Cuaresma, JC (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Dept Econ, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",jcrespo@wu.ac.at; gernot.doppelhofer@nhh.no; martin.feldkircher@oenb.at,"Feldkircher, Martin/R-3436-2019; Feldkircher, Martin/JBJ-7518-2023","Crespo Cuaresma, Jesus/0000-0003-3244-6560; Feldkircher, Martin/0000-0002-5511-9215",,,,,56,123,127,3,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

For this reason the hypothesis was formulated: There is no statistically significant difference between the calculated probabilities, i.e. both approaches are identical from application point of view. The problem was solved using the example project whose model (network chart) contained 18 nodes and 24 activities (18 real. 6 fictions). For each activity have been known three time estimates (pessimistic, most likely, optimistic). The planned date of completion of the project was selected at 200 time units and it was calculated the probability of completion of the project by deterministic approach and Monte Carlo method. The calculated probabilities of project completion were compared using statistical hypothesis testing. The hypothesis was rejected for all testing.

To identify the possibly causes of observed variability in ATT, we regress ATT (calculated for every category according to classification NACE Rev. 2) by ownership (public or private sector), proportion of women in management, proportion of women in sector and proportion of small firms. We conclude that the unexplained gender pay gap vary in individual sectors of Czech economy. The estimated ATT ranges from -0.004 (NACE L-N) to -0.352 (NACE G). The most important factor explaining these differences is ownership as expected. The significant factor is the proportion of women in management too.

The results show that steady state BVAR has better prediction power for longer time horizons which is in accordance with its structure. On the other hand, DSGE model better predicts behaviour of variables for short periods, up to four quarters.

Our costs estimates have five distinguishing features: (1) we estimate costs for each county in the contiguous U.S., (2) we include afforestation of rangeland, in addition to cropland and pasture, (3) our opportunity cost estimates account for capitalized returns to future development (including associated option values) in addition to returns to agricultural production, (4) we develop a new set of forest establishment costs for each county, and (5) we incorporate data on Holdridge life zones to limit afforestation in locations where temperature and moisture availability prohibit forest growth. We find that at a carbon price of $50/ton, approximately 200 million tons of carbon would be sequestered annually through afforestation. At a price of $100/ton, an additional 100 million tons of carbon would be sequestered each year. Our estimates closely match those in earlier econometric studies for relatively low carbon prices, but diverge at higher carbon prices. Our results indicate a smaller, but still important, role for forest-based carbon sequestration in offsetting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper is to select such a supplier that minimizes total costs of the electricity for given household and given tariff. The costs are dependent on the prices of low and high tariff and on the fixed monthly fee set by the supplier and by distributor. According to these conditions it is possible to use multi-criteria decision-making methods to find the best supplier.

In this paper we will show two different approaches to modelling age-specific mortality rates, and from the obtained models we prepare a projection of these rates to 2050. Data cover the period 1920-2012. The first type of model is an individual random walk with drift. Male and female population will be analysed for the range of 0-100+ years, and each completed age will be analysed as the individual time series with an annual frequency. The second model will be Lee-Carter, which is currently often used. It is based on Principal components method, which can capture and explain the main factors of mortality. Based on this models there will be constructed the forecasts of age-specific death rates for the period from 2013 to 2050. The obtained forecasts will be confronted and according to their provided results and their computational complexity there will be determined the recommendations about their suitability or their further improvement.","[Simpach, Ondrej; Langhamrova, Jitka] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Demog, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Simpach, Ondrej] Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Simpach, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Demog, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",ondrej.simpach@vse.cz; langhamj@vse.cz,"Langhamrová, Jitka/Z-2115-2019","Langhamrova, Jitka/0000-0002-8127-6433",,,,,20,7,7,0,1,PALACKY UNIV OLOMOUC,OLOMOUC,"KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,890,895,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900153,0

Based on the analysis on Marxism human science, the author states the function of Marxism human science in ideological and political education, and also proposes the development tendency of ideological and political education under the view of Marxism human science. Marxian materialistic conception of history concerns for the problems about human beings very much. Moreover, it also devotes itself to the research on the theory of human beings, so as to establish extremely extensive Marxism thought of human science, and thus make the theory of human science to become one of integral parts of Marxist theory. Marxism theory of human science is extensive and profound, which involves humanity, human essence, subjectivity, value, human rights, human development and a series of significant theoretical problems. Objects of ideological and political education are human beings. Moreover, its methods even directly act on human. Therefore, all this should be rooted in scientific cognition of human. Marxism human science just takes human beings as principal objects of research, and it can scientifically reveal human survival & development and other laws.

The study adopted a multistage sampling technique. The data from the survey was used to analyze the impact of loan received on earnings using a loan-impact probability model. The study found that Microfinance is an effective poverty alleviation strategy as it reaches the target customers more effectively and helps to a large extent in improving their standard of living and social status and also impacts greatly on Customers' savings habit and income generation. The study therefore recommended th MFIs should embark on funds mobilisation drive to be able to reach out to more viable customers for provision of financial services. It also recommended that there should be provision of incentives by government to sustain MFIs in order to further extend their services to the rural areas and capacity building of MFIs in Nigeria should be made mandatory so as to develop appropriate policies that will enhance sustainability and stability.","[Taiwo, Joseph N.; Ojo, J.

Are either emission taxes or emission permits better suited in such a dynamic setting? Although the monopoly can be forced to price taking behaviour, the inability of governments to commit leads to too slow and to too little expansion. Prices and quantities are equivalent for different kinds of government's objectives. An (important) exception is the case of non-competitive supply of the dirty input: taxes dominate from a welfare perspective however due to the additional scope to accrue rents and not due to an improvement of incentives for the development of clean technologies. Permits eliminate pollution entirely, which fosters the expansion of the clean technology. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Researching and teaching of critical thinking has been underway in China, but the key ethical dimension has not gotten enough attention and discussion, which is in a state of absence. The external embodiment of critical thinking is subjects' practical activities about the world such as cognitive and critical transformation. However, fundamental embodiments of critical thinking is the constant process of cognition, reflection, criticism, conquers and supervision that subjects deal with adverse psychological inertia and thinking inertia of themselves. Not only relative reference and basis of cognition, reflection, conquest and development need support from ethical dimension, starting point and destination, self consciousness of supervision system, self evaluation and decision system during specific implementation process of critical thinking activities also need support from ethical dimension. Ethical dimension exists in the concept gene of critical thinking, with the evolution of the concept and connotation development, it infiltrates continuously the main content, constituent elements and constituent features of new conceptions. Timely establishment of ethical dimension and fully tap of ethical connotation and practice standards of critical thinking have a profound historical significance in the domestic field of critical thinking and future development in the field of engineering science and technology innovation.

The PLS, Fixed-Effects estimations identify several promotions that successfully attract fans. These include fireworks displays and both high-value and low-value merchandise promotions, food and drink specials, family/group general admission ticket discounts, and beer discounts. Furthermore, those venues with higher per capita incomes and larger populations tend to have higher attendance levels. There is evidence that higher average ticket prices reduce attendance. There also is evidence that team performance in the form of winning and greater total runs scored per game attracts fans: teams with better win-loss records have higher attendance, as do home teams that play in higher scoring games. There is evidence that home teams committing more fielding errors experience a modest decline in attendance. Attendance appears to be higher on the Memorial Day, July 4, and Labor Day weekends. Finally, attendance is sensitive to scheduling. Games scheduled for Fridays and Saturdays and during July have much higher attendance, whereas games on Mondays and Tuesdays have much lower attendance.","Jacksonville Univ, Jacksonville, FL 32211 USA",Jacksonville University,"Cebula, RJ (通讯作者)，Jacksonville Univ, 2800 Univ Blvd N, Jacksonville, FL 32211 USA.",Dr.RichardCebula@gmail.com,"Cebula, Richard J/P-7535-2018",,,,,,29,5,7,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The model consists of a generation sector and a transmission sector. In the generation sector the incumbent and entrants compete in a Cournot fashion taking as given the access charge to the transmission network set in advance by the regulator to maximize the social welfare. Two vertical structures, integration and separation, are considered. Under vertical separation the transmission network is established as an organization independent of every generator, whereas under vertical integration it is a part of the incumbent's organization. The optimal vertical structure is shown to depend on the number of entrants. If the number of entrants is smaller than a certain threshold, vertical separation is superior in welfare to vertical integration, and vice versa. This is because the choice of vertical structure produces a trade-off in the effects on competition promotion and production efficiency. If a break-even constraint is imposed in the-transmission sector, however, vertical integration is shown to be always superior in welfare. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Current trends indicate that should there be no change to existing policies, and the governance systems and institutions underpinning them, the absolute number of energy poor will barely shift. Most significantly, addressing energy poverty is critical to absolute poverty reduction, enhanced gender equality and political stability in the Asian region. We offer a solution to progress the energy poverty alleviation effort focused on encouraging sustainable, development-centred investment. This will involve multi-actor partnerships between developed and developing country governments, investors, and multilateral institutions. We propose that there may be spill over effects for investing firms, in the form of strengthened corporate reputation. Consequently, energy poverty alleviation efforts can create new opportunities for commerce, multilateral institutions, NGOs, and developing and developed countries. It is envisaged that the multi-actor approach put forward by this paper will facilitate the partnerships, programs and provisions needed to alleviate energy poverty in Asia. However, critical to the success of this collaborative approach is a genuine shift in sentiment from the key stakeholders involved in the effort. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The energy consumption of an assumed fleet of 1 million EVs in 2020 and 6 million in 2030 is assessed using detailed models of electric vehicles, real world driving cycles and car usage. It is shown that a substantial part of the charging demand of EVs can be met by otherwise unused wind power, depending on the amount of conventional power required for stabilizing the grid. The utilization of wind power is limited by the charging demand of the cars and the bottlenecks in the transmission grid. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to determine driving factors of energy consumption change for the road mode. It uses decomposition analysis to discuss the effects of economic, demographic and urban factors on the evolution of transport energy consumption. The main result highlighted in the present work is that vehicle fuel intensity, vehicle intensity, GDP per capita, urbanized kilometers and national road network are found to be the main drivers of energy consumption change in the road transport sector during 1990-2006 period. Consequently, several strategies can be elaborated to reduce road transport energy. Economic, fiscal and regulatory instruments can be applied in order to make road transport more sustainable.

Road freight transportation accounts for a quarter of the emissions from transportation sector, so it is one of the implementation areas for emission reductions. When disaggregate data exist, it is possible to detect inefficiency in freight movements and consequently to quantify emission cost of it in road freight sector. Using roadside axle surveys, this study first described the characteristics of road freight movements in Turkey for the period of 2000-2009. Emission estimations for the same period were presented to form a base for potential emission reduction analyses. The results showed that emission savings could be up to 11% by penalizing empty movements even only in the long haul. However, a policy regarding elimination of only inefficiently loaded movements without targeting reduction of empty runs did not provide significant emission reduction capacity. A scenario of replacing Conventional trucks with Euro IV ones showed significant emission reduction potential, especially for regulated emissions, and it may be the most promising option from application perspective.

The UK has recently introduced the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) as a signal of building energy performance. The aims of this article are: to evaluate how valid EPC's are signals of occupier satisfaction with office facilities; and to understand whether occupant attitudes towards environmental issues have affected commercial office rental values. This was achieved by surveying occupant satisfaction with their workplaces holistically using a novel multi-item rating scale which gathered 204 responses. Responses to this satisfaction scale were matched with the corresponding EPC and rental value of occupier's workplaces. The satisfaction scale was found to be both a reliable and valid measure. The analysis found that EPC asset rating correlates significantly with occupant satisfaction with all facility attributes. Therefore, EPC ratings may be considered valid signals of overall facility satisfaction within the survey sample. Rental value was found to correlate significantly only with facility aesthetics. No evidence suggests rental value has been affected by occupants' perceptions towards the environmental impact of facilities. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, most recent empirical studies and modeling estimates of the potential of technological change focus on the average returns to research and development (R&D) for a composite technology and contain little or no information about the distribution of returns to R&D which could be important for capturing the range of costs associated with climate change mitigation policies by individual technologies. Through an empirical study of patent citation data, this paper adds to the literature on the outcomes of energy R&D by focusing on the behavior of the most successful innovations for six energy technologies, allowing us to determine whether uncertainty or differences in technologies matter most for success. We highlight two key results. First, we compare the results from an aggregate analysis of six energy technologies to technology-by-technology results. Our results show that existing work that assumes diminishing returns but assumes one generic technology is too simplistic and misses important differences between more successful and less successful technologies. Second, we use quantile regression techniques to learn more about patents that have a high positive error term in our regressions - that is, patents that receive many more citations than predicted based on observable characteristics. We find that differences across technologies, rather than differences across quantiles within technologies, are more important. The value of successful technologies persists longer than those of less successful technologies, providing evidence that success is the Culmination of several advances building upon one another, rather than resulting from one single breakthrough. Diminishing returns to research activities appear most problematic during rapid increases of research investment, such as experienced by solar energy in the 1970s. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Data are from 508 households representing new vehicle buyers in San Diego County, California in 2011. The mixed-mode survey collected information about access to residential recharge infrastructure, three days of driving patterns, and desired vehicle designs and motivations via design games. Across the higher and lower price scenarios, a majority of consumers designed and selected some form of PHEV for their next new vehicle, smaller numbers designed an HEV or a conventional vehicle, and only a few percent designed an EV. Of those who did not design an EV, the most frequent concerns with EVs were limited range, charger availability, and higher vehicle purchase prices. Positive interest in HEVs, PHEVs and EVs was associated with vehicle images of intelligence, responsibility, and support of the environment and nation (United States). The distribution of vehicle designs suggests that cheaper, smaller battery PHEVs may achieve more short-term market success than larger battery PHEVs or EV.

We propose a constrained regression model that preserves the natural order of the interval in all instances, either for in-sample fitted intervals or for interval forecasts. Within the framework of interval time series, we specify a general dynamic bivariate system for the upper and lower bounds of the intervals. By imposing the order of the interval bounds into the model, the bivariate probability density function of the errors becomes conditionally truncated. In this context, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators of the parameters of the system are inconsistent. Estimation by maximum likelihood is possible but it is computationally burdensome due to the nonlinearity of the estimator when there is truncation. We propose a two-step procedure that combines maximum likelihood and least squares estimation and a modified two-step procedure that combines maximum likelihood and minimum-distance estimation. In both instances, the estimators are consistent. However, when multicollinearity arises in the second step of the estimation, the modified two-step procedure is superior at identifying the model regardless of the severity of the truncation. Monte Carlo simulations show good finite sample properties of the proposed estimators. A comparison with the current methods in the literature shows that our proposed methods are superior by delivering smaller losses and better estimators (no bias and low mean squared errors) than those from competing approaches. We illustrate our approach with the daily interval of low/high SP500 returns and find that truncation is very severe during and after the financial crisis of 2008, so OLS estimates should not be trusted and a modified two-step procedure should be implemented.

These constraints may reduce the operational flexibility of a hydro plant and therefore its revenue. The objective of this paper is to assess the economic impact of minimum environmental flows and maximum ramping rates on the annual operation of a hydropower plant. For this purpose, a revenue-driven annual optimization model based on discrete dynamic programming and mixed integer linear programming is used. The model considers hourly water inflows and energy prices, limits on reservoir level and water discharge, power generation dependence on the available head, wear and tear costs of hydro units caused by power variations, start-up and shut-down costs of hydro units, and the above-mentioned environmental constraints. In order to show the applicability of the proposed methodology, it is used in a real hydropower plant under five different water year types and 56 distinct combinations of the considered environmental constraints. The results indicate that the revenues of the hydropower plant are very sensitive to the presence and magnitudes of these constraints. Annual losses increase quadratically as a function of the maximum ramping rates and almost linearly as a function of the minimum environmental flows. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In the directive there is a requirement, among others, for individual consumption meters for heat and hot water to be installed by 31 December 2016 in multi-apartment buildings. Individual consumption meters had earlier been found to create a saving behavior due to the tenants being charged for their own use of heat and hot water. The purpose of this study is to investigate how widespread is the use of individual metering and charging (IMC) of heat and hot water among cooperatively owned multi-apartment buildings in Sweden. An additional purpose is to investigate the level of knowledge of and the attitude to IMC. This has been done through data collection and interviews of board members in randomly selected housing cooperatives, divided into different categories. The result indicates a very low spread and a strong resistance against IMC for heat and hot water. The perception of a low cost-efficiency is probably the most important reason, but also a low level of knowledge about IMC could contribute. The result can give some indication of the work needed to carry. out the new EU-directive. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimates of console energy use vary widely between 32 and 500 kWh/year. Most such estimates are unreliable as they are based on incorrect assumptions and unrepresentative data. To address the shortcomings of existing estimates of console energy use, this study collates, normalises and analyses available data for power consumption and usage. The results show that the average energy use of high definition games consoles (sold between 2005 and 2011 inclusive) can be estimated at 102 kWh/year, and 64 kWh/year for new console models on sale in early 2012. The calculations herein provide representative estimates of console energy use during this period, including a breakdown of the relative contribution of different usage modes. These results could be used as a baseline to evaluate the potential energy savings from efficiency improvements in games consoles, and also to assess the potential effectiveness of any proposed energy efficiency standards. Use of accurate data will help ensure the implementation of the most effective efficiency policies and standards. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper uses a finite-mixture modelling approach to investigate the likely determinants of relative economic performance for Irish towns. The main argument put forward is that determinants of success can act in different ways for different groups of towns and the modelling approach differentiates towns on the basis of their relationship between performance measures and likely performance determinants. The results suggest that determinants of success such as centrality and road quality, capacity and functional score, as well as the population size of supporting and competing hinterlands have very different impacts on different groups of towns, highlighting heterogeneity in the way in which different factors impact economic performance.","[Cullinan, John; Garvey, Eoghan; Keane, Micheal] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Cullinan, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Business & Econ, Cairnes Bldg, Galway, Ireland.",john.cullinan@nuigalway.ie; michael.keane@nuigalway.ie,,,,,,,28,2,2,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

Using data from a water conservation information campaign implemented as a randomized controlled trial, we estimate heterogeneous household responses. Understanding such heterogeneity is important for improving the cost-effectiveness of non-pecuniary programs, extending them to other populations and probing the mechanisms through which the treatment effects arise. We find little evidence of heterogeneous responses to purely technical information or to traditional conservation messages that combine technical information and moral suasion. In contrast, norm-based messages that combine technical information, moral suasion and social comparisons exhibit strong heterogeneity: households that are wealthier, owner-occupied and use more water are more responsive. These subgroups tend to be least responsive to pecuniary incentives. We find no evidence that any subgroup increases their water use in response to the messages. By targeting the messages to subgroups known to be most responsive, program costs could be reduced by over 50% with only a 20% reduction in the treatment effect. Combining theory and data, we also shed light on the mechanisms through which the treatment effects arise, which has implications for program design and future research on the program's welfare effects.

Do institutions matter for regional development?, Regional Studies. This paper discusses whether institutions matter for regional development and how to integrate them in regional development strategies. It is found that while institutions are crucial for economic development, generating an institution-based regional development strategy is likely to be undermined by the lack of definition of what are efficient institutions. Problems related to the measurement of institutions, to their space and time variability, to the difficulties in establishing the right mix of formal and informal institutions, and to the endogeneity between institutions and economic development make one-size-fits-all approaches to operationalizing institutions difficult. The paper posits that, in order to overcome these problems, it is crucial to distinguish between the institutional environment' and institutional arrangements', that is, to target not the institutions which shape the unique character of any territory, but the institutional factors that represent barriers for the efficacy of other factors influencing economic development (that is, education, training and skills, innovation, infrastructure and the like).","London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",,,,,94,639,665,18,286,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We calculate the 20-year internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) for each location scenario as a function of state- and region-specific factors. This analysis demonstrates that biorefinery IRR and NPV are very sensitive to bio-oil yield, feedstock cost, location capital cost factor, and transportation fuel market value. The IRRs and NPVs generated for each scenario vary widely as a result, ranging from a low of 7.4% and -$79.5 million in Illinois to a high of 17.2% and $165.5 million in Georgia. The results indicate that the economic feasibility of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway is strongly influenced by facility location within the United States. This result could have important implications for cellulosic biofuel commercialization under the revised Renewable Fuel Standard. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate these features by using circular statistics in an econometric modelling framework applied to the flows of UK university graduates. While the traditional statistical techniques applied in economics do not fully account for the complexity of mobility flows, these techniques to study directionality are still relatively unexplored. The database used includes observations on around 30,000 British graduates. Our results suggest that a higher level of human capital is associated with more unidirectional flows as higher human capital migrants selectively target specific labour markets.","[Faggian, Alessandra] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev AED Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Corcoran, Jonathan] Univ Queensland, Fac Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [McCann, Philip] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Queensland; University of Groningen,"Faggian, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev AED Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",faggian.1@osu.edu; jj.corcoran@uq.edu.au; P.McCann@rug.nl,"Faggian, Alessandra/B-5332-2012; Faggian, Alessandra/K-8548-2019; Corcoran, Jonathan/A-4631-2010; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","Faggian, Alessandra/0000-0002-2479-2933; Corcoran, Jonathan/0000-0003-3565-6061; McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654",,,,,30,10,10,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

It is shown that, regardless of whether effects (i) are treated as parameters or as an error term, (ii) are estimated in different stages of a hierarchical model, or whether (iii) correlation between effects and regressors is allowed, when the same prior information on idiosyncratic parameters is introduced into all estimation methods, the resulting common slope estimator is also the same across methods. These results are illustrated using the Grunfeld investment data with different prior distributions. Random effects estimates are shown to be more efficient than fixed effects estimates. This efficiency gain, however, comes at the cost of neglecting information obtained in the computation of the prior unknown variance of idiosyncratic parameters.","SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Rendon, SR (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",srendon@ms.cc.stonybrook.edu,,"Rendon, Silvio/0000-0003-1015-2035",,,,,20,15,16,2,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether relatively high subsidies to private energy research can be justified by higher external knowledge spillovers from private energy research compared to knowledge spillovers from other private research. Estimation of spillover effects is carried out using an unbalanced panel of more than a thousand Danish private companies observed over the period 2000-2007. We reject that there are higher spillovers from private energy research compared to other types of private research. Instead the results suggest that the external knowledge spillovers from energy research may be lower than for other types of private research. This implies that high subsidies earmarked for private energy research should not be an element in a first best policy to reduce CO2 emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005 and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OSCLA) detail the criteria the federal government must follow when allocating leases for offshore wind farms. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides primary federal oversight to offshore wind in federal waters, and in 2009 they released their formal management guidelines going forward. This research examines lease allocation methods BOEM may use, as well as several promising alternatives, through the lens of the mandated criteria set forth by OSCLA and the EPAct of 2005. We find significant variation between allocation methods in terms of how well they meet each of the criteria. Price-based allocations will have difficulty in meeting criteria while also accounting for the immature status of the offshore wind energy industry. Instead, a multiple factor approach which includes non-monetary considerations may be a more appropriate way to balance federal mandates and industry needs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reports the findings of a survey carried out in 2009 and 2010 of 246 citizens at different locations in the municipality of Chongqing in order to reveal information about attitudes towards energy and energy saving in the context of household electrical appliances. This study shows that citizens in Chongqing receive relatively little information and guidance on how to save energy in the home and that their stated level of knowledge on this subject is also rather limited. Respondents showed some willingness to save energy as long as this did not reduce their comfort and convenience, and they appeared likely to respond to economic incentives, such as high electricity prices or discounts on appliances. But they seemed to be unaware of the potential for information to help them save energy. The survey also demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity across society with respect to sources of information and trust in those sources and with respect to attitudes to energy saving at home. These results show that the government needs to substantially adjust its strategies for promoting household energy saving. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this paper is to use a system approach to evaluate coal-derived SNG in terms of life-cycle energy efficiency and CO2 emissions. This project examined main applications of the SNG and developed a model that can be used for evaluating energy efficiency and CO2 emissions of various fuel pathway systems. The model development started with the GREET model, and added the SNG module and an end-use equipment module. The database was constructed with Chinese data. The analyses show when the SNG are used for cooking, power generation, steam production for heating and industry, life-cycle energies are 20-108% higher than all competitive pathways, with a similar rate of increase in life-cycle CO2 emissions. When a compressed natural gas (CNG) car uses the SNG, life-cycle CO2 emission will increase by 150-190% compared to the baseline gasoline car and by 140-210% compared to an electric car powered by electricity from coal-fired power plants. The life-cycle CO2 emission of SNG-powered city bus will be 220-270% higher than that of traditional diesel city bus. The gap between SNG-powered buses and new hybrid diesel buses will be even larger-life-cycle CO2 emission of the former being around 4 times of that of the latter. It is concluded that the SNG will not accomplish the tasks of both energy conservation and CO2 reduction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the specific example of the UK, we demonstrate the advantages of the-complementary nature of wind and photovoltaic resources.

The study confirms the positive contribution of respondents' participation in social group activities to the number of power-saving practices conducted. It also reveals the emergence of voluntary social face-to-face and/or online interactions for power-saving. The study suggests it would be useful to provide effective information to proactive individuals who are closely engaged in power-saving in households and who are proactively disseminating power-saving information practices to others. Such individuals include (1) women who have school-children and who are proactively engaging in the social interactions of their children's schools, other parents, neighbours, as well as their own parents and relatives; and (2) men and women who are using various kinds of online interaction tools and are also engaged in face-to-face social interactions.

Furthermore, many of these studies have not explicitly accounted for the effect of population changes in the convergence process. This paper attempts to overcome these limitations by applying a dynamic panel data model using the generalized method of moments system estimates for the seventeen regions of Spain during the 1955-2008 period. The main conclusion that stems from our analysis is that the deep reduction in steady-state disparities across Spain's regions can be largely attributed to the differences in their population growth rates, which were mainly due to migration flows. In contrast, investment in physical capital, although it promoted convergence, played a minor role, while technology was a strong factor for divergence.","[Martin Mayoral, Fernando] FLACSO ECUADOR Programa Econ, Quito, Ecuador; [Garcimartin, Carlos] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Madrid 28032, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Mayoral, FM (通讯作者)，FLACSO ECUADOR Programa Econ, La Pradera E7-174 & Av Diego de Almagro, Quito, Ecuador.",fmartin@flacso.org.ec; carlos.garcimartin@urjc.es,"mayoral, fermin/C-2652-2013","Martin-Mayoral, Fernando/0000-0002-8553-5770",,,,,58,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, there have been few overall studies on the evolution of these resources. This paper uses a dynamic model to study the exhaustion patterns of world fossil and nuclear fuels and their possible replacement by renewable energy sources. The results show that peak oil will be the first restriction and it will not be easily overcome. Electric vehicles can produce some interesting savings, but they are insufficient to avoid the decline in oil. Biofuels are even more limited, due to the enormous extensions of fertile land they require and their low productivity. This shows that overcoming the decline in oil will need much more ambitious policies than the mere substitution of technology. If the oil-economy relationship does not change substantially, world economic growth may be seriously limited or even negative. In contrast, the production of electrical energy is not such a worrying problem in the short and middle-term. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, it will need to face a radical change if it aims to switch from a fossil-based system to a renewable-based system. Even though there are many promising technologies under development, they must also be economically viable to be implemented. This paper studies the economic feasibility of synthesizing natural gas through methanation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen from water electrolysis. It is shown that the main influences for profitability are electricity prices, synthetic natural gas (SNG) selling prices and that the by-products from the process are sold. The base scenario generates a 16% annual return on investment assuming that SNG can be sold at the same price as petrol. A general number based on set conditions was that the SNG must be sold at a price about 2.6 times higher per kWh than when bought in form of electricity. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the running costs weigh more heavily than the yearly investment cost and off-peak production can therefore still be economically profitable with only a moderate reduction of electricity price. The calculations and prices are based on Swedish prerequisites but are applicable to other countries and regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We explained this result by modeling the simple behavior of developers in the context of a single city within a linear space. In this paper, we consider the case of two municipalities that leads to development policies that are reflected in different characteristic time functions in each territory. Myopic assumptions, in the sense that each city is interested only in what happens on its side of the border, can easily lead to unintended leapfrogging. Whereas competition between the cities, including in the case that each city takes into consideration processes in the entire region, can result in intentional leapfrogging or in spatially concentrated development, depending on the policy objectives of the authorities.","[Czamanski, Daniel; Broitman, Dani] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Czamanski, D (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",danny@czamanski.com,"Broitman, Dani/V-7972-2019; Czamanski, Danny/AAB-7207-2021","Broitman, Dani/0000-0003-0287-4898; Czamanski, Danny/0000-0002-3309-4475",,,,,7,8,8,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The efforts have paid off with a dramatic decrease in carbon intensity. Nevertheless, China is still confronted with tough challenges in emission control due to the fast pace of industrialization, large total historical emission and high growth rate of emissions. Therefore, China should give priority to energy saving by improving energy efficiency and sectoral structure adjustment and upgrade, and develop sustainable and renewable energy to optimize energy mix and its carbon content. China should continue to regard significant reduction of energy intensity and carbon intensity as the main objective in the near future, strive to achieve peak emissions around 2030, and realize a relatively sharp emissions reduction by 2050 in order to address climate change to meet the goal of making the warming less than 2 degrees. During the 12th Five Year Plan (FYP), China will further strengthen measures to control the amount of energy consumption, establish a statistics, accounting and evaluation system of carbon emissions, and promote a market-based carbon emissions trading mechanism to facilitate the low-carbon transformation of China's economy.

Our method partitions wind energy into hourly and sub-hourly components and uses corresponding market prices to determine variability costs. We use publically available 15-min ERCOT data, although the method developed can be applied to higher time resolution data if available. We do not estimate uncertainty costs though our metric can separate integration costs into variability and uncertainty components. The mean variability costs arising from 15-min to 1-h variations (termed load following) for 20 ERCOT wind plants was $8.73 +/- $1.26 per MWh in 2008 and $3.90 +/- $0.52 per MWh in 2009. Load following variability costs decrease as capacity factors increase, indicating wind plants sited in locations with good wind resources cost a system less to integrate. Twenty interconnected wind plants had a variability cost of $4.35 per MWh in 2008. The marginal benefit of interconnecting another wind plant diminishes rapidly: it is less than $3.43 per MWh for systems with 2 wind plants already interconnected, less than $0.7 per MWh for 4-7 wind plants, and less than $0.2 per MWh for 8 or more wind plants.

Substituting fossil fuels by biodiesel produced from Jatropha curcas has gained widespread attention as Jatropha cultivation is claimed to offer green house gas emission reductions. Farmers respond worldwide to this increasing demand by converting forests into Jatropha, but whether Jatropha-based biodiesel offers carbon savings depends on the carbon emissions that occur when land use is changed to Jatropha. This paper provides an impact assessment of a small-scale Jatropha project in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique. The paper outlines the estimated impacts on above and below-ground carbon stocks when land use is changed to increase Jatropha production. The results show that expansion of Jatropha production will most likely lead to the conversion of miombo forest areas to Jatropha, which implies a reduction in above and below-ground carbon stocks. The carbon debts created by the land use change can be repaid by replacing fossil fuels with Jatropha-based biodiesel. A repayment time of almost two centuries is found with optimistic estimates of the carbon debt, while the use of pessimistic values results in a repayment time that approaches the millennium.

In particular, the paper examines deployment targets and the means to achieve them, for hydro, wind and solar. These are its priority technologies, in which the country has a level of competitive advantage. For each of these energy sources, four projections have been produced. These projections show whether and when China will meet its deployment targets in terms of the cumulative amount of gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity by 2015. In doing this, historical data from 2005 to 2010 has been analyzed for all three energy sources. Both the average annual growth rate (AAGR), and the compound average growth rate (CAGR) have been computed, in terms of the world averages and China's national performance over this period. AAGR and CAGR have been used for producing four scenarios for each renewable energy, and a logarithmic scale has been applied to them in order to make them more reliable by smoothing out excessive fluctuations. The most likely scenarios for each technology are described. Finally, the gap between these scenarios and the respective national targets set for 2015 and 2020 are calculated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is now essential to maintain access to everyday necessities, as well as being a vital part of most economies. However, our current transportation system is placing unsustainable demands on finite resources of fossil fuels, minerals and materials: change is therefore essential. Identifying rational choices is difficult because a future transport option must not only abate these demands over the entire lifetime, but do so at an affordable cost whilst maintaining acceptable levels of utility. This paper offers a framework to evaluate powertrains for whole life criteria, in order to help validate current and future developments. It supports integrated comparisons of both fuel and vehicle technology combinations for cost, energy and greenhouse gas emissions throughout a vehicles lifetime. Case studies illustrate the use of this framework All powertrains were found to require considerable amounts of energy and emit some emissions over their whole lifetime. Significant benefits over incumbent vehicles were found to be potentially attainable through the use of alternative powertrains. However, the majority of these benefits were currently found to increase user costs, worsen the vehicle production impacts and be heavily reliant on the source of the vehicles in-use energy.

Based on an analysis of non-use values of green-e as well as the application of the contingent valuation (CV) method and payment card (PC) introduction technology, the average WTP ranges from RMB 7.91 yuan/month to 10.30 yuan/month (approximately US$ 1.15-1.51/month with an exchange rate of 6.83 yuan/US$ yuan/US$) for urban residents in Jiangsu Province. The current work also explores the differences in demographic variables across varying WTP amounts and the different marginal effects of demographic variables at the same level of WTP. The findings reveal that there are significant differences in demographic variables, such as level of education, household income and location of residence, across the population segments. Moreover, the finding that some respondents with high income and higher education prefer higher WTP amounts to lower WTP amounts suggests that green-e is a luxury product, and consequently, a Veblen effect exists in certain Chinese market segments.

We examine the relevance of life cycle analysis (LCA) and environmentally extended input-output analysis (EIO) as methodological tools for identifying the emission intensities on which the tax is based. The price effects of the tax and the policy implications of considering non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG) are also analyzed. The results from the case study on pulp production show that the environmental tax rate based on LCA (1.8%) is higher than both EIO approaches (0.8 and 1.4% for product and industry, respectively), but they are of the same order of magnitude. Although LCA is more product specific and provides a more detailed analysis, we recommend EIO as a more relevant approach to applying an economy-wide environmental tax. If an environmental tax were applied to non-CO2 GHG instead to CO2 alone, the tax would greatly affects sectors such as agriculture, mining of coal, extraction of peat, and food. Therefore, it is worthwhile for policy-makers to pay attention to the implications of considering either a CO2 tax or a global GHG emissions tax in order to make their policy measures effective and meaningful.

Promoted by international climate conventions and supported by government research and development programs, an increasing number of CCS pilot and demonstration projects have been launched in China. In this study, we analyze the structure of China's CCS effort from a technological innovation system (TIS) perspective. Within this system, key socio-political components, including institutions, actor-networks, and technology development, are examined to evaluate the state of the innovation system. The study assessed the perceived capacity of seven functional areas of the CCS innovation system through a survey of key CCS actors and stakeholders. The findings suggest that China's CCS innovation system has a strong functional capacity for knowledge and technology development. It is significantly weaker in the innovative functions of knowledge diffusion, market formation, facilitating entrepreneurs and new entrants into the CCS market. Based on the evaluation of China's technological innovation system to develop CCS, the article articulates specific public policies to formulate a more robust innovation system to traverse the valley of death from research and development to commercial deployment and accelerate energy innovation in China.

China presents a good example of a developing country that has successfully embarked on rural electrification projects over the last few decades and achieved a great feat of almost 100% electrification rate (IEA, 2009. World Energy Outlook, 2009, International Energy Agency, Paris (see LEA website at http://www. worldenergyoutlook.org/electricity.asp.)). The purpose of this paper is to find out how China has achieved this feat: how China's rural energy projects were financed and whether China provides lessons for other countries to follow. The above questions are examined through an extensive literature review and the paper finds that unlike many other countries following the top-down approach to rural electrification, China has preferred to use a phased development through a bottom-up approach where local resources, and village level development and empowerment played an important role. While the state provided the overall guidance and financial support, the integrated rural development approach has produced local-level solutions that are subsequently integrated to produce an alternative development pathway. Strong government commitment, active local participation, technological flexibility and diversity, strong emphasis on rural development through agricultural and industrial activities and an emphasis on capacity building and training have also played an important role in the success. However, despite achieving the universal access objective. China still faces a number of issues related to rural electricity use, especially in terms of regional use patterns, long-term sustainability of supply and commercial operation of the systems. The Chinese model could serve as an inspiration for other developing countries trying to ensure universal electricity access. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The present paper aims at filling this gap, analysing experiences with and behavioural responses to fuel poverty. It examines the day-to-day energy situation of households, which are poor/at-risk-of-poverty and/or suffering from fuel poverty in a case study conducted in the Austrian capital Vienna. Qualitative interviews provide the data for investigating the relevant factors in causing fuel poverty (among those, bad housing conditions, outdated appliances, financial problems), and provide a basis for discussion about the respective behavioural strategies of the people concerned. The results show that the ways of handling this problematic situation vary greatly and that people follow different strategies when it comes to inventing solutions for coping with the restrictions and finding ways of satisfying at least a part of their basic energy needs. Nonetheless, it also clearly surfaces that the scope of action is limited in many cases, which in turn only supports the claim that changes in the overall conditions are essential.

Examples of demand response from around the world are discussed in order to assess the main considerations for cool climates. Different tariff types and forms of control are assessed in terms of what is being asked of electricity users, with a focus on real-time pricing and direct load control in energy systems with increasingly distributed resources. The literature points to the significance of thermal loads, supply mix, demand-side infrastructure, market regulation, and the framing of risks and opportunities associated with DR In concentrating on social aspects of residential demand response, the paper complements the body of work on technical and economic potential.

Standard jackknife estimators, as applied to 2SLS, may not reduce the bias of the exogenous variable coefficient estimators since the estimator biases are not monotonically nonincreasing with sample size (a necessary condition for successful bias reduction) and they have moments only up to the order of overidentification. Our proposed approaches do not have either of these drawbacks. (1) In the first procedure, both endogenous and exogenous variable parameter estimators are unbiased to order T-2 and when implemented for k-class estimators for which k < 1, the higher-order moments will exist. (2) An alternative second approach is based on taking linear combinations of k-class estimators for k < 1. In general, this yields estimators that are unbiased to order T-1 and that possess higher moments. We also prove theoretically how the combined k-class estimator produces a smaller mean squared error than 2SLS when the degree of overidentification of the system is 0, 1, or at least 8. The performance of the two procedures is compared with 2SLS in a number of Monte Carlo experiments using a simple two-equation model. Finally, an application shows the usefulness of our new estimator in practice versus competitor estimators.","[Iglesias, Emma M.] Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, La Coruna 15071, Spain; [Phillips, Garry D.

We compare and contrast CCS applied to coal-fired power plants with CSP. At present, both technologies are more expensive than existing electricity-generating options, but costs should decrease with large-scale deployment, especially in the case of CSP. For CCS, technological challenges still remain, storage risks must be clarified, and regulatory and legal uncertainties remain. For CSP, current challenges include electricity transmission and business models for a rapid and extensive expansion of high-voltage transmission lines.

I have analysed the long-term relationship among China's primary energy consumption sources. Changes in coal consumption lead those in the consumption of other energy sources in the long term. Coal and oil fuels substitute for each other equally. The long-term elasticities of China's coal consumption relative to its hydroelectricity consumption were greater than one and nearly equal during the two sample periods. Therefore, increased hydroelectricity consumption did not imply a reduction in coal consumption. China holds abundant hydroelectricity, wind and, solar energy potential. China must prevent an excessive escalation of its economy and resultant energy demand to realise a meaningful substitution of coal with hydroelectricity. Moreover, China must develop and use wind and solar energy sources. Natural gas can be a good substitute for coal, given its moderate price growth and affordable price levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a highly accurate estimator for public energy R&D expenditures, and examine deviations from the estimated values using data for member states of the International Energy Agency, 1981-2007. Given that unpredictable fluctuation in public spending on new energy technology reduces the positive effect of such spending on innovation, our empirical analyses imply that countries with fractionalized legislatures can improve the performance of their energy technology programs by enacting institutional mechanisms that reduce the volatility of public spending. Similarly, the results indicate that left-wing and right-wing governments can improve the performance of public technology programs through agreements that distribute gains in such a fashion that partisan shifts do not cause spending cuts. Contravening the conventional wisdom, we also find that public energy R&D is unusually stable in the United States. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using state-level data and survey responses from energy officials in 44 states, this study catalogs the extent and types of small wind policies adopted by states. It examines the factors correlated with policy adoption, and perceptions about which policy tools are most effective. Results indicate that 84% of the states participating in the survey have adopted at least one policy to promote small wind technologies, and most have adopted several policies. The most frequent policy is net metering, and this policy tool was also perceived to be one of the most effective at encouraging businesses and consumers to install small wind technologies. However, several other policy tools perceived to be most effective at promoting small wind installations have been adopted by relatively few states. This identified gap suggests opportunities for improving policy effectiveness. In explaining factors associated with adoption of policy tools, we find support for variables comprising both the policy diffusion and internal determinants models of policy adoption, including state commitment to environmental protection and policy innovations, citizen ideology, per capita wealth, energy policy network communications, and desire to be viewed as an environmental leader.

This risk cannot be fully identified and avoided unless future climate information and building related adaptation measures are considered. The Low Carbon Futures project is developing a tool that uses UKCP09 climate projections input to predict dwelling overheating risks. To enhance the usefulness of this tool for the building industry, and to better understand current building design processes, interviews were conducted with building professionals, allowing industry preferences for the tool to be sought and to provide clearer indications of proposed outcomes. This paper examines results from a questionnaire, focus groups and semi-structured interviews with building industry professionals. The research shows that the housing industry maintains adherence to traditional designing methods where overheating, whether current or future, is not considered a serious concern. No design stage detailed overheating assessments are currently undertaken to reduce the UK's increased room air-conditioner sales, despite drives for low energy/zero carbon homes. The collated feedback will help tailor the tool and its eventual outputs, with this paper attempting to converge on a set of recommendations for low carbon dwelling design with reduced overheating risk.

The UK Government revised Building Regulations in 2002, 2006 and 2010, towards more stringent energy efficiency standards and ultimately the target of 'zero carbon' new homes from 2016. This paper aims to: reveal levels of compliance with energy Building Regulations of new-build dwellings in England and Wales; explore underlying issues; and identify possible solutions. In total 376 new-build dwellings were investigated. The compliance revealed was poor, at a level of 35%; accompanied by 43% 'grey compliance' and 21% 'grey non-compliance' (due to insufficient evidence of achieving required carbon emissions reductions). It is a serious concern when building control approves so many dwellings when insufficient evidence of compliance has been received. Underlying issues were centred on: incorrect compilation and/or insufficient submission of carbon emissions calculations by builders/developers; inappropriate timings of such submissions; and a paucity of proper checks by building control. Exploring these issues reveals a complex system of factors influencing energy regulations compliance, which involves a wide range of stakeholders. The findings should inform the formulation and implementation of energy efficiency building regulations and policy in the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Strengers, Y",,,,"Strengers, Yolande",,,Peak electricity demand and social practice theories: Reframing the role of change agents in the energy sector,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Demand management; Social practice theory; Peak demand,CLIMATE-CHANGE POLICY; COMFORT,"Demand managers currently draw on a limited range of psychology and economic theories in order to shift and shed peak electricity demand. These theories place individual consumers and their attitudes, behaviours and choices at the centre of the problem. This paper reframes the issue of peak electricity demand using theories of social practices, contending that the 'problem' is one of transforming, technologically-mediated social practices. It reflects on how this body of theory repositions and refocuses the roles and practices of professions charged with the responsibility and agency for affecting and managing energy demand. The paper identifies three areas where demand managers could refocus their attention: (i) enabling co-management relationships with consumers; (ii) working beyond their siloed roles with a broader range of human and non-human actors; and (iii) promoting new practice 'needs' and expectations. It concludes by critically reflecting on the limited agency attributed to 'change agents' such as demand managers in dominant understandings of change. Instead, the paper proposes the need to identify and establish a new group of change agents who are actively but often unwittingly involved in reconfiguring the elements of problematic peaky practices.

We present evidence that the equity premium is consistent with a stochastic discount factor (SDF) calculated as the average of the household clusters' intertemporal marginal rates of substitution in the 1984-2002 period. The result is driven by the skewness of the cluster-based cross-sectional distribution of consumption growth, but cannot be explained by the cross-sectional variance and mean alone. We find that nine clusters are sufficient to explain the equity premium with relative risk aversion coefficient equal to six. The result is robust to various averaging schemes of cluster-based consumption growth used to construct the SDF. Lastly, the analysis reveals that standard approximation schemes of the SDF using individual household data produce unreliable results, implying a negative SDF.","[Grishchenko, Olesya V.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Monetary Affairs, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Rossi, Marco] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; University of Notre Dame,"Grishchenko, OV (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Monetary Affairs, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",Olesya.V.Grishchenko@frb.gov; marco.rossi@nd.edu,,,,,,,32,7,7,0,10,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Presently, wind potential is limited by a paucity of electrical transmission lines and/or capacity between promising wind resources and primary load centers. We present the model SimWIND to address this shortfall. Sim WIND is an integrated optimization model for the geospatial arrangement and cost minimization of wind-power generation-transmission-delivery infrastructure. Given a set of possible wind-farm sites, the model simultaneously determines (1) where and how much power to generate and (2) where to build new transmission infrastructure and with what capacity in order to minimize the cost for delivering a targeted amount of power to load. Costs and routing of transmission lines consider geographic and social constraints as well as electricity losses. We apply our model to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Interconnection, considering scenarios that deliver up to 20 GW of new wind power. We show that Sim WIND could potentially reduce ERCOT's projected similar to$5B transmission network upgrade line length and associated costs by 50%. These results suggest that SimWIND's coupled generation-transmission-delivery modeling approach could play a critical role in enhancing planning efforts and reducing costs for wind energy integration.

The objective function used in the optimization model comprises of the capital cost of the new generating units to be built, the fuel cost incurred in running all the generating units in the system including the transportation cost of fuel from the fuel source ends to the generating unit locations and the capital cost of the new transmission lines to be installed for meeting the forecasted system demand at the target planning year. Constraints taken care of in the model include the fuel availability limits at the fuel sources, the fuel transportation limits for the transportation of fuels from fuel sources to the generating unit locations, capacity of generating units required to be built as well as the power transmission limits of the transmission lines in the system. The developed model is tested on a system to bring out the relative advantage of adopting the integrated generation and transmission expansion planning approach as compared to the sequential approach of first planning the generation expansion and then the transmission expansion.

The article is shaped by extensive primary research, literature review and engagement with policy makers, industry and community organisations, energy market institutions, colleagues and others over a period of four years. It outlines how new business models may reduce emissions ahead of policy and regulation, and the importance of keeping an open mind when considering 'barriers' to distributed energy.

On the other hand, increased temperatures are expected to increase hydropower demand for cooling in warm periods while decreasing demand for heating in winter, subsequently altering the annual hydropower pricing patterns. The resulting variations in hydropower supply and pricing regimes necessitate changes in reservoir operations to minimize the revenue losses from climate warming. Previous studies in California have only explored the effects of hydrological changes on hydropower generation and revenues. This study builds a long-term hydropower pricing estimation tool, based on artificial neural network (ANN), to develop pricing scenarios under different climate warming scenarios. Results suggest higher average hydropower prices under climate warming scenarios than under historical climate. The developed tool is integrated with California's Energy-Based Hydropower Optimization Model (EBHOM) to facilitate simultaneous consideration of climate warming on hydropower supply, demand and pricing. EBHOM estimates an additional 5% drop in annual revenues under a dry warming scenario when climate change impacts on pricing are considered, with respect to when such effects are ignored, underlining the importance of considering changes in hydropower demand and pricing in future studies and policy making.

In this paper, some critical points regarding the origination and formulation of the SD concept are discussed. It is argued that the SD concerns with selected sectors and regions rather than the whole society and all regions of the world. To tackle these shortcomings, the conventional definition of SD is extended in this paper according to a broad philosophy of harmonizing key aspects of human, nature and systems performances over generations. Based on this extended definition, an improved Driving Force-State-Response (DSR-HNS) policy making framework is introduced. The main contribution is the modeling of the state block by human, nature and systems components to design overall and coherent policies. A procedure using the framework is also elaborated to monitor the current policies and design new ones, which provides a dynamic, nonlinear, feedback controlled policy making practice, not accommodated by existing policy making frameworks. Finally, a case study is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the modified framework and the proposed model.

Its main contribution is to present new data on international textile trade in 1913, which reveals how, within European countries, there was a clear dominance of German exports, followed closely by those from France and Britain. The scenario that emerges is quite different to that obtained from an analysis of intercontinental trade, where British hegemony was still very evident in 1913. The fact that, when looking only at the intra-European textile trade, Britain lags behind Germany and is almost on par with France, indicates that we are dealing with very different markets to those emerging on aggregate data, in which analysis can be reduced to a single country.","Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Carreras-Marín, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Carreras-Marin, Anna/D-4328-2014","Carreras-Marin, Anna/0000-0002-0235-3323",,,,,41,0,0,0,9,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The foreign and domestic stock of knowledge have been approximated throughout several variables such as the stock of R&D, the stock of patents and the expenses for using foreign licenses and patents. Our results suggest that the inflow of foreign technology had a positive and significant effect on the Spanish TFP, being this effect higher than the effect of the domestic stock of knowledge. Moreover, the openness to foreign trade has also favoured the arrival of foreign technology and the increase of productivity.

The shipping industry has utilised this for conventional submarines. The potential of a load levelling strategy through use of a hybrid battery-diesel-electric propulsion system is investigated. The goal is to reduce exhaust gas emissions by reducing fuel oil consumption through consideration of a re-engineered ship propulsion system. This work is based on operational data for a shipping fleet containing all types of bulk carriers. The engine loading and the energy requirements are calculated, and sizing of suitable propulsion and the battery storage system are proposed. The changes in overall emissions are estimated and the potential for fuel savings identified. The efficiency of the system depends on the storage medium type, the availability of energy and the displacement characteristics of the examined vessels. These results for the global fleet indicate that savings depending on storage system, vessel condition and vessel type could be up to 0.32 million tonnes in NOx, 0.07 million tonnes in SOx, and 4.1 million tonnes in CO2. These represent a maximum 14% of reduction in dry bulk sector and 1.8% of world's fleet emissions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Employing the conceptual framework of a commonly accepted asset pricing model, we analyze the risk faced by renewable energy investors in large emerging markets. We find that firms in Brazil, China and India expose multinational investors to the same risk as investing in emerging markets generally. The risk to domestic investors in those same firms ranges from substantially below-average to above-average, depending upon the country. The results are robust across several model versions and statistical techniques.

In general, this measure is combined with efficient heating systems to minimize the delivered energy and greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, these better systems are often more expensive so that the extrainvestment could be hardly recovered for small-scale energy consumption. The main objective of the article is to show how equilibria between cost-effectiveness and environmental performance of heating systems are changed when small SH needs are considered (i.e. for passive and low-energy houses). The scope is limited to new single-family dwellings. Furthermore, the passive house standard provides means of simplifying the SH by using the ventilation air: the idea is that savings should counterbalance the extra-investment in super-insulation. In theory, a new global economic optimum is generated at the passive house level. The second objective of the work is to study which conditions could lead to this new optimum. Only a detached-house typology is investigated to address this last issue. Regarding methodology, all the investigations are done considering the Belgian context. Energy and environmental performance is evaluated using a method that complies with the EN-15603 and EN-15316 standards. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsequently, it analyses the differences in innovative performance between firms engaged in different configurations, also taking into account their geographical dimensions. Four configurations emerged, all of which have positive effects on a firm's innovative performance in comparison with the 'go-at-it-alone' strategy. After controlling for actor composition and tie depth, however, their geographical composition is found to be unrelated to the innovative performance of firms.","[Knoben, J.; Oerlemans, L. A.

Exploring the links between immigration, ageing and domestic water consumption: the case of the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Regional Studies. Mediterranean urban environments are increasingly undergoing structural or temporary episodes of water stress, which may lead to decreases in the use of water. Taking the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (MAB) as a case study, this paper argues that socio-demographic factors may also contribute to explain decreases in per-capita urban consumption values. Using a generalized linear mixed model with panel data information for the period 2003-2007 for twenty-three municipalities of the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, including the ten districts of Barcelona, an attempt is made to examine the role of immigration and ageing in explaining these reduced average consumptions per capita.","[March, Hug; Sauri, David] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Perarnau, Judit] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"March, H (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain.",hug.march@gmail.com; juditperarnau@gmail.com; david.sauri@uab.cat,"Saurí, David/G-8131-2015; March, Hug/F-4935-2016","Saurí, David/0000-0002-3618-7773; March, Hug/0000-0003-2549-0803",,,,,73,34,37,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Many countries in the region have insufficient generation capacity to meet rapidly rising demand. Electricity shortages have become a binding and powerful constraint on the continent's sustainable development. Their resolution will require coordinated effort to improve the effectiveness and governance of the region's utilities and to significantly scale-up generation capacity. A broad portfolio of low carbon (low-C) technologies needs to be deployed in order to address the electricity deficit in a cost-effective way and not be disruptive to economic growth. Since nuclear power can deliver low-C electricity in bulk, reliably and without intermittency, it could make a significant contribution towards resolving Africa's power crisis. However, the post-Fukushima safety concerns related to large nuclear plants with substantial radioactive inventories will be especially pronounced in Africa. Moreover, large scale reactors with huge upfront investment requirements are likely to be unsuitable for capital-constrained African countries with small electricity grids. One promising direction for nuclear development in Africa might be to downsize reactors from the gigawatt scale to less-complex smaller units (with substantially smaller radioactive inventory) that are more affordable.

While the coastal region benefits from the influx of skilled labour, the rest of China suffers from severe brain drain. Estimates from zero-inflated negative binomial gravity models indicate that employment opportunities, especially interregional wage differentials, play a dominant role in attracting skilled labour, and that the impact of amenities on skilled migration turns out to be small and less clear. Findings suggest that China's skilled people prioritize their career prospects over the quality of life in the migration decision-making process.","[Liu, Ye; Shen, Jianfa] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",liuye@cuhk.edu.hk; jianfa@cuhk.edu.hk,"Shen, Jianfa/H-8142-2013; Liu, Ye/J-2787-2019","Liu, Ye/0000-0003-2511-5413; Shen, Jianfa/0000-0003-4110-0561",,,,,88,72,88,9,104,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The estimated relationships are taken to represent preference relationships over attributes of electricity supply systems (costs, safety, environmental friendliness, etc.). Controlling for a variety of individual and macro-level factors, we find that individuals' SWB varies systematically and significantly with differences in the electricity mix across countries and across time. Among other results, we find that a greater share of solar & wind power relative to nuclear power and electricity from coal and oil is associated with greater SWB at all levels of income and that the implied preference for solar & wind power over nuclear power has risen drastically after the Fukushima nuclear accident.

Statistical results suggest that both localization and urbanization economies significantly affect firm R&D. Downstream sectors are the major driving force of business R&D.

We generalize the traditionally used logarithm transformation of realized volatility to the Box-Cox transformation, a more flexible parametric family of transformations. A two-step maximum likelihood estimation procedure is introduced to estimate this model on the basis of Koopman and Scharth (2013). Simulation results show that the two-step estimator performs well, and the misspecified log transformation may lead to inaccurate parameter estimation and certain excessive skewness and kurtosis. Finally, an empirical investigation on realized volatility measures and daily returns is carried out for several stock indices.","[Zheng, Tingguo] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Song, Tao] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Inst Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Zheng, TG (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",zhengtg@gmail.com; songtao@xmu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371160, 11101341]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-13-0509]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Fujian Province University (NCETFJ)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Fujian Province University (NCETFJ)(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),"The authors thank the Joint Editors, an Associate Editor and two anonymous referees, Marcel Scharth at the Department of Econometrics, VU University Amsterdam, and our colleague Ming Lin at the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics, Xiamen University, for helpful comments and suggestions.

In this note, we summarize some corrections to Halliday (2010). A more detailed version can be found in Appendix S1. Defining e= n*-n, where n* is the true log household size and n is its error-ridden measurement, we note that sigma(2)(e) = V(e)= V(E[e vertical bar W]) + E(V[e vertical bar W]), where W equivalent to (N, M, D, B) which are the number of household members, migrants, deaths and births during the survey period. Each of these quantities is in levels and is observable in the data. The first component is commonly referred to as the between component whereas the second component is typically called the within component in the literature on inequality. In the published version, we bounded the between component, but we neglected the within component. Once we correct this, we obtain that these errors could be as high as 20% of the total variation in household size, but this is still not sufficient to resolve the paradox in Deaton and Paxson (1998).","[Halliday, Timothy J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Halliday, Timothy J.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Halliday, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, 2424 Maile Way,533 Saunders Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

High cost is a main restriction element for large-scale development of RE, and accurate cost estimation of renewable power generation is urgently necessary. This is the first systemic study on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of RE in China. Results indicate that feed-in-tariff (FIT) of RE should be improved and dynamically adjusted based on the LCOE to provide a better support of the development of RE. The current FIT in China can only cover the LCOE of wind (onshore) and solar photovoltaic energy (PV) at a discount rate of 5%. Subsidies to renewables-based electricity generation, except biomass energy, still need to be increased at higher discount rates. Main conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) Government policy should focus on solving the financing problem of RE projects because fixed capital investment exerts considerable influence over the LCOE; and (2) the problem of high cost could be solved by providing subsidies in the short term and more importantly, by reforming electricity price in the mid-and long-term to make the RE competitive.

As nuclear power plants constitute one of the socially and politically most contested technologies, the question arises, which time horizons companies as well as politicians have to consider for the accomplishment and grid-connection of individual and whole fleets of reactors. Unfortunately, there are no large-N studies investigating the time for completion of such large-scale projects. For the first time, we statistically explain the duration of the construction of all initiated nuclear plant projects so far. Based on the International Atomic Energy's comprehensive Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) we assess the impact of demographic, economic, and political preconditions of a country, at the same time accounting for different types of reactor technologies. To account for non-linear relationships, we apply non-parametric survival models with P-splines. A main result of our analysis is that time of connection to grid increases over the years indicating increased societal sensibilities, respect for higher security standards, and increased project complexities. The Harrisburg and the Chernobyl disaster did not induce a separate additional delaying effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results suggest that: China's international embodied carbon emission balance has been in a state of continuous growth for the period 2001-2011, and China has become a pollution haven; the relationship between per capita output and CO2 emission is inverse N-typed and China's industries are in the rising stage of the curve; FDI and trade comparative advantage are two main elements boosting China's carbon emissions; trade openness, environmental regulation, and technology will lower the growth rate of China's industrial carbon emissions (ICEs). Consequently, China's policies should center on adjusting the industry structure and scale of FDI inflows, transforming industries with trade comparative advantages into a clean type, facilitating environmental regulation level, and bringing in and developing low-carbon technology to avert China from being a pollution haven.

However, stratified tanks are also associated with the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria, such as Legionella, due to the hospitable temperatures that arise during operation. Sanitary Measures, aimed at homogenising the temperature distribution throughout the tank, have been proposed; such measures reduce the effective energy storage capability that is otherwise available. Here we quantify the conflict that arises between thermodynamic performance and bacterial sterilisation within 10 real world systems. Whilst perfect stratification enhances the recovery of hot water and reduces heat losses, water samples revealed significant bacterial growth attributable to stratification (P<0.01). Temperature measurements indicated that users were exposed to potentially unsanitary water as a result. De-stratifying a system to sterilise bacteria led to a 19% reduction in effective hot water storage capability. Increasing the tank size to compensate for this loss would lead to an 11% increase in energy consumed through standing heat losses. Policymakers, seeking to utilise hot water tanks as demand response assets, should consider monitoring and control systems that prevent exposures to unsanitary hot water. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study reports an assessment that compares grid extension with distributed generation (DG) alternatives, based on the subsidies they will necessitate, and costs of service interruptions that are appropriate in the rural Indian context. Using cross-sectional household expenditure data and region fixed-effects models, average household demand is estimated. The price elasticity of demand is found to be in the range of -0.3 to -0.4. Interruption costs are estimated based on the loss of consumer surplus due to reduced consumption of electric lighting energy that results from intermittent power supply. Different grid reliability scenarios are simulated. Despite the inclusion of interruption costs, standalone DG does not appear to be competitive with grid extension at distances of less than 17 km. However, backing up unreliable grid service with local DG plants is attractive when reliability is very poor, even in previously electrified villages. Introduction of energy efficient lighting changes these economics, and the threshold for acceptable grid unreliability significantly reduces. A variety of polices to promote accelerated deployment and the wider adoption of improved end-use efficiency, warrant serious consideration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in the Portuguese legislation there are no rules concerning the use of daylight, and therefore, designers are not stimulated to adopt solutions that make use of the existing potential of sunlight availability. In the same way, it is difficult to understand the lack of specific regulation, with quantified targets, limiting power density of artificial lighting installed inside buildings. The present opportunity, generated by the need to carry out the revision of Portuguese building energy systems regulation, should be used to fill the existing gap in national legislation regarding those matters. In this paper the authors present some proposals for future legislation that will have as central purpose the utilization of efficient lighting systems and the promotion of architectural solutions that optimize the use of daylighting. It is possible, and desirable, to add new directives to national legislation that contribute to the improvement of Portuguese buildings, characterized by its good performance in terms of daylight availability, and at the same time, increasing the energy efficiency and reducing the energy consumption of lighting systems installed in those buildings.

One of its important components is the feed-in tariff (FiT) scheme-launched in December 2011. The scheme is managed and administered by the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) of Malaysia. This paper analyses the impact of the FiT mechanism in Malaysia a year after its implementation; particularly on the installation and economical aspects. First, the history of the scheme is presented before summarising the application process for the scheme. Next, a detailed evaluation on the implication of the scheme is discussed. Some of the key findings from the analysis include: (i) the uptake for renewable energy installations has been extremely high, particularly for solar photovoltaic installation; (ii) the foreign and domestic direct investment related to renewable sectors have increased significantly; (iii) more 'green' jobs have been created, particularly in the manufacturing and installation sectors, and (iv) there are plans to include wind and thermal energy in the FiT scheme. It can be concluded that the FiT scheme in Malaysia has produced significant impact during the first year of its implementation. With a proper monitoring by SEDA and more awareness among the people, renewable energy will most likely flourish in Malaysia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

At its introduction the EPC was considered a pioneering instrument, one that would help overcome an information deficit hindering consumer interest in energy efficient dwellings. Now that the EPC has been implemented for several years it is possible to examine its impact. This research draws on data from ex-ante and ex-post assessments of the EPC in a number of countries and presents the results of a survey of Dutch private dwelling purchasers. This survey was based on two sample populations, one received an EPC during property transaction and another did not. Differences were sought between the two samples in a number of areas relating to the adoption of energy efficiency measures. Results show that many projections about the impact of the EPC have fallen short. The EPC was found to have a weak influence, especially pre-purchase. The potential of the EPC in driving energy efficiency improvement in the existing stock is doubted especially if it continues to act independent from a mix of instruments designed to tackle multiple barriers. It is argued that the energy saving potential of existing dwellings, applauded in climate change policy, will remain unexploited if it continues to be assessed subjectively by householders.

A major advantage of distributed resources is their potential for deferring investments in distribution network capacity. However, utilizing the full benefits of these resources requires addressing several technical, economic and regulatory challenges. A significant barrier pertains to the lack of an efficient market mechanism that enables this concept and also is consistent with business model of distribution companies under an unbundled power sector paradigm. This paper proposes a market-oriented approach termed as contract for deferral scheme (CDS). The scheme outlines how an economically efficient portfolio of distributed generation, storage, demand response and energy efficiency can be integrated as network resources to reduce the need for grid capacity and defer demand driven network investments.

While border carbon adjustment (BCA) measures are a potential remedy, they have also been criticised on various grounds. This paper therefore investigates whether a policy fostering the switch to carbon-free technologies can substitute for BCAs. A reason for the effectiveness of a targeted technology policy is that major leakage prone sectors (such as iron and steel), have two main sources of carbon emissions, combustion of fossil fuels and industrial processes. While combustion emissions can be reduced relatively easy by increasing energy efficiency, reducing process emissions requires a switch to low-carbon production processes, e.g. in steel production by deploying electrolysis based on large-scale solar electricity. We show by means of a multi-regional computable general equilibrium analysis that such a switch in steel production technology can eliminate a significant fraction of carbon leakage and also increase sectoral output and welfare. Since the necessary technologies are not available at large scale yet (however, are likely to be by 2020), a transitional BCA scheme may be a crucial supportive instrument to foster such technology switches. Yet, in the long run BCA should be phased out to preserve the incentive for carbon-free innovation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Duopoly firms in the Bertrand model always differentiate maximally, whereas in the Cournot model the market demand structure is not so critical, but the functional form of the transportation cost plays a crucial role in determining equilibrium location. Non-maximal distance appears in the Cournot equilibrium when a convex transportation cost is allowed, bringing about the findings that the equilibrium consumer surplus may be higher and the equilibrium profits may be lower under Cournot competition than under Bertrand competition.","[Sun, Chia-Hung] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Lai, Fu-Chuan] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lai, Fu-Chuan] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",Soochow University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chengchi University,"Sun, CH (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, 56 Kueiyang St,Sect 1, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",jerry52.sun@msa.hinet.net; uiuclai@gate.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The objective for these strategies is to identify how the EU can reach its target of an 80% reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 compared to 1990 levels. None of these scenarios involve the large-scale implementation of district heating, but instead they focus on the electrification of the heating sector (primarily using heat pumps) and/or the large-scale implementation of electricity and heat savings. In this paper, the potential for district heating in the EU between now and 2050 is identified, based on extensive and detailed mapping of the EU heat demand and various supply options. Subsequently, a new 'district heating plus heat savings' scenario is technically and economically assessed from an energy systems perspective. The results indicate that with district heating, the EU energy system will be able to achieve the same reductions in primary energy supply and carbon dioxide emissions as the existing alternatives proposed. However, with district heating these goals can be achieved at a lower cost, with heating and cooling costs reduced by approximately 15%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study used focus groups with children and parents at two primary (elementary) schools in London, UK, to explore home energy use and energy feedback. Energy was found to be a little-discussed subject at home. Children derived more motivation to save energy from responsibility conferred by school activities than other (e.g. environmental) concerns, and some connected energy saving with dangers of using electricity (e.g. fire). Material and social constraints (e.g. access to outside space, parents' environmental attitudes) meant that it was sometimes difficult for children to save energy even when motivated. However, parents showed greater inclination to pay attention to energy saving when framed as supporting their child's learning than as a financial or environmental concern. Children were disinclined to reduce energy-consuming activities such as watching television, and while parents complained about children's energy use most saw it as a low priority issue. Policy implications of these findings are considered, and the approach employed is argued to be an effective way of investigating children's perceptions around energy use. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Therefore, it is worth investigating how the accident influenced public perceptions of renewable energy and its technologies, between the time before the accident and after the accident. This study aims to explore the effects of the Fukushima accident on the public perceptions of renewable energy technologies in South Korea, the closest nation to Japan. This study found that there were notable differences of public perceptions, including public attitudes, perceived benefits, trust, intention to use, knowledge and risks between before and after the earthquake. In addition, the perceived cost of renewable energy technologies was the primary determinant of the intention to use the technologies before the accident, whereas public attitudes toward the technologies became the main antecedents of the intention after the accident. After the accident, we found that there is a multi-dimensional matrix of perceived trust-benefits (with risks)attitude-intention to use, in explaining the public acceptance of renewable energy technologies. Moreover, we found significant roles of the perceived trust, benefits and risks in the research model. Based on the empirical findings, both implications and suggestions are presented.

An evolutionary geographical political economy approach demonstrates that Northern Rock's growth and decline was shaped by its location in an old industrial region, and echoes the historical position of the peripheral region in the spatial division of labour. A longitudinal investigation focuses on the labour market dynamics of Northern Rock's rapid growth and decline on the North East of England. The Northern Rock case highlights the enduring occupational structure of the region's labour market, and shows how older industrial regions suffer from a process of occupational disadvantage' that restricts their ability to adapt to economic change.","[Dawley, Stuart; Marshall, Neill; Pike, Andy; Pollard, Jane; Tomaney, John] Newcastle Univ, CURDS, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Dawley, S (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, CURDS, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",Stuart.Dawley@ncl.ac.uk; Neill.Marshall@ncl.ac.uk; Andy.Pike@ncl.ac.uk; Jane.Pollard@ncl.ac.uk; John.Tomaney@ncl.ac.uk,"Tomaney, John/I-7709-2019","Tomaney, John/0000-0002-7648-2910",ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,97,29,30,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

When the server is up, the customers arrive according to a Poisson input process with the parameter lambda > 0. When the server is under repair (down), all the arriving customers refuse to enter the system because they are not willing to wait. The customer's service time is assumed to be Erlang distributed with the shape parameter n and the scale parameter n mu. That means the service process of each customer consists of n exponentially distributed phases and the customer is served after finishing the last phase of the service process. Times between catastrophes are exponentially distributed with the paramete eta; times to repair are also exponentially distributed, but with the parameter zeta. In the paper we present a mathematical model of the studied queuing system that enables to numerically calculate steady-state probabilities.

Forty percent of the floorspace in China is in rural villages and towns. Most of these buildings are very energy inefficient, and may struggle to provide for basic needs. They are cold in the winter, and often experience indoor air pollution from fuel use. The Chinese government plans to adopt a voluntary building energy code, or design standard, for rural homes. The goal is to build on China's success with codes in urban areas to improve efficiency and comfort in rural homes. The Chinese government recognizes rural buildings represent a major opportunity for improving national building energy efficiency. The challenges of rural China are also greater than those of urban areas in many ways because of the limited local capacity and low income levels. The Chinese government wants to expand on new programs to subsidize energy efficiency improvements in rural homes to build capacity for larger-scale improvement.

The hypothesis defended is that FASA-Renault was able to make the three-pronged investment defined by Chandler as a key factor for the industrial success of a large enterprise. In addition, the article considers that the development of FASA-Renault was made possible by the continued transfer of resources and capabilities by Renault. The period under analysis goes from 1965 to 1974, that is, from when Renault became the main partner of FASA until the outbreak of the oil crisis and subsequent stagflation. At that time, FASA-Renault was the thirteenth largest industrial company in Spain and had confirmed its position as the second manufacturer in the Spanish automobile industry.","Univ Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Antoni de Capmany, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Fernández-de-Sevilla, T (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Antoni de Capmany, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,,,,,,,41,7,7,0,3,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The results indicate that gender inequality varies among countries and is affected by socio economic and cultural differences in the Balkans. Balkan countries exhibit considerably lower wages and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) compared to European average. Women in Balkan countries, exhibit lower income and higher unemployment compared to men. Currently, gender inequality at work remains a characteristic of this region. The challenge for modern societies, countries, European and international institutions is to protect the minorities and prevent gender inequalities at work, particularly when societies experience financial hardship.","[Filippidis, Kostas] Univ Western Macedonia, Dept Balkan Studies, Florina, Greece; [Anastasiou, Sophia] TEl Cent Greece, Sch Business, Thebes, Greece; [Mavridis, Stelios] Thessalon Bar Assoc, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Kostas, Siassiakos] Supreme Council Civil Personnel Select ASEP, Athens, Greece",University of Western Macedonia,"Filippidis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Western Macedonia, Dept Balkan Studies, Florina, Greece.",kost_philip@hotmail.com; anastasiou@yahoo.com; mavridiss@yahoo.gr; k.siassiakos@0006.syzefxis.gov.gr,"ANASTASIOU, SOPHIA/AAC-1668-2020","ANASTASIOU, SOPHIA/0000-0002-3874-5732",,,,,25,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,1048,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100109,0

Research has established the perception of women on the role of the mass media in mobilising women to participate in politics. Under reported however, is the perception of women on the role of indigenous communication in mobilising women to participate in politics at the local level. This study therefore sought to examine the role indigenous communication played in galvanizing women in politics at the local level since they are established and well available in communities. Survey method was used as the study design. Questionnaire was used as instrument of data collection and interview as a tool of data collection. 400 copies of the questionnaire were administered and 394 were useful for data analysis. Percentages and chi Square were used for data analysis.Mean and standard deviation were used for ranking of the perception of women on the role of indigenous communication in politics. Also, 6 purposively selected participants took part in the interview. The findings show that women are of the view that indigenous communication influenced them to participate in politics either by voting, participating in rallies, elections, attend political meetings but not as contestant for elective political offices. The result further revealed that only 10% of the respondents have ever contested for elective positions. The study therefore recommends, among other strategies, the use of indigenous communication for sustained advocacy and mass mobilization of women for women's rights, and by logical extension, women's participation in politics, especially for purposes of seeking elective political positions.","[Oyesomi, Kehinde Opeyemi; Oyero, Olusola] Covenant Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,,kehinde.oyesomi@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; eosoola1@yahoo.com; taye4laide@yahoo.com; olusola.oyero@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"Oyesomi, Kehinde/AAT-5949-2021; Oyero, Olusola/GQA-8578-2022","Oyero, Olusola/0000-0001-7795-5516; Oyesomi, Kehinde/0000-0002-5318-0442",,,,,19,2,2,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,2622,2644,,,,,,23,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308101043,0

In the current work, globally existing low-carbon energy technologies that are compatible with the energy sector of Iran are identified and then prioritised against different criteria (i.e. Multi Criteria Decision Analysis). Results of technology prioritisation and a comprehensive literature review were then applied to conduct a SWOT analysis and develop a policy package aiming at facilitating the transfer of low carbon technologies to the country. Results of technology prioritisation suggest that the transport, oil and gas and electricity sectors are the highest priority sectors from technological needs perspective. In the policy package, while fuel price reform and environmental regulations are categorised as high priority policies, information campaigns and development of human resources are considered to have moderate effects on the process of technology transfer.

Changing such behaviour has considerable potential for conserving energy and is an important target of environmental policies which are designed to decrease energy consumption. It is hypothesized that people who consciously act in a pro-environmental way do not necessarily have lower CO2 emissions more than those who do not undertake environmental activities. Data about residential energy use is based on a survey carried out in Hungary in 2010 with a sample of 1012 people. Latent cluster analysis (LCA) was conducted based on data about the reported pro-environmental behavior in the survey and four clusters were identified. Relevant sociostructural and structural factors were also inverstigated. Results of the data analysis show that no significant difference is found between the impacts of environmentally aware and environmentally unaware consumers, i.e. both 'Brown' and 'Supergreen' consumers consume approximately the same amount of energy and produce approximately the same amount of carbon emissions because the motivation-driven activities of 'Supergreens' are offset by structural factors.

The analysis is carried out with the Irish TIMES model, a bottom-up energy systems modelling tool with detailed characterization of Ireland's energy system. The paper uses scenario analysis to provide pathways that demonstrate how Ireland can meet the non-ETS target at least cost. The paper considers the impacts (in terms of different technology choices and higher marginal abatement costs) arising from higher targets for the energy system to compensate for growth in agriculture activity and low mitigation potential in that sector. The results point to a need to reconsider Ireland's renewable energy focus, with a need for increased effort in renewable transport and renewable heat in particular. The results also point to significant electrification of residential heating. The results also point to a high marginal abatement cost ((sic)213/tCO(2)), which challenges the analysis carried out at EU level to establish Ireland's non-ETS target. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Entrepreneurship in a hub-and-spoke industrial district: firm survey evidence from Seattle's technology industry, Regional Studies. The paper investigates entrepreneurial dynamics in a hub-and-spoke industrial district. Using data on the genealogy of high-technology firms in Seattle, Washington State, the study examines the ways in which entrepreneurial firms relate to their parent firms and the role of agglomeration economies. The results illustrate that entrepreneurship is an important vehicle for the diversification of such a district. When compared, hub-related spinoffs such as those founded by former Microsoft employees do not differ much from other start-ups. The differences between Microsoft spinoffs and start-ups are very limited; both diversify the regional economy by entering new markets when compared with their parents.","[Mayer, Heike] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Mayer, Heike] Univ Bern, Ctr Reg Econ Dev, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern,"Mayer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",heike.mayer@giub.unibe.ch,,"Mayer, Heike/0000-0001-9419-0770",,,,,47,20,26,0,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

J,"Salant, SW",,,,"Salant, Stephen W.",,,The equilibrium price path of timber in the absence of replanting: does Hotelling rule the forests too?,RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forestry; Hotelling; Herfindahl,ECONOMICS; VINTAGES,"Prior to 1985, virtually all analyses of forestry economics took the price of timber as given. Since Mitra and Wan (1985), however, the literature has sought to solve social planning problems where the price of timber, as reflected in the path of the marginal utility of consumption, is endogenous. The purpose here is to focus directly on the equilibrium price path of timber under the stringent assumption that once a site is cleared, no new tree is planted and the site is used for some other purpose with an exogenously specified value. While extreme, this assumption permits us to show that familiar results from the Hotelling literature have their counterparts in forestry economics. The paper begins by describing the equilibrium price path if all trees are the same age and sit on sites of equal value. This turns out to generate a U-shaped price path under some circumstances. Heterogeneity is then introduced. It is shown that if trees differ only in site value, then in the competitive equilibrium it is optimal to extract the last tree on a more valuable site before extracting the first tree on a less valuable site. It is also shown that if trees differ only in their initial age, then in equilibrium, it is optimal to extract the last older tree before extracting the first younger tree. In short, the inisights of Hotelling (1931) and Herfindahl (1967) are shown to extend. As the concluding section suggests, some of these results reappear in special cases of the model with replanting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

If their inverted-U shaped pattern is empirically accepted with two significant regressors, the income per capita and its square transformation, the EKC hypothesis is supported. Using an OECD sample, this paper shows that the validity of testing the EKC hypothesis is sensitive to how we transform income non-linearly in sulfur and carbon EKC regressions. This paper carries out experiments on different powers of gamma for transforming income non-linearly and concludes that only when 0 < gamma < 1 and 1 < gamma < 2 will the EKC regression demonstrate a testable non-linear cointegration relationship between the two air pollutants and income per capita. In the generalized EKC regressions estimated in this paper, although we find sulfur and carbon EKC patterns in the OECD sample, none of the EKC regressions using different gamma is a cointegrating equation. This finding implies an inside critique to the EKC literature that failure of cointegration of the conventional EKC regression is not because of using the quadratic functional form, but because of the fundamentally spurious relationship between the trends of pollutants and income levels.

Algae biofuels avoid some of the previous drawbacks associated with crop-based biofuels as the algae do not compete with food crops. The favourable growing conditions found in many developing countries has led to a great deal of speculation about their potentials for reducing oil imports, stimulating rural economies, and even tackling hunger and poverty. By reviewing the status of this technology we suggest that the large uncertainties make it currently unsuitable as a priority for many developing countries. Using bibliometric and patent data analysis, we indicate that many developing countries lack the human capital to develop their own algae industry or adequately prepare policies to support imported technology. Also, we discuss the potential of modern biotechnology, especially genetic modification (GM) to produce new algal strains that are easier to harvest and yield more oil. Controversy surrounding the use of GM and weak biosafety regulatory system represents a significant challenge to adoption of GM technology in developing countries. A range of policy measures are also suggested to ensure that future progress in algae biofuels can contribute to sustainable development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Real-world events, a growing military realization of threats and opportunities, and an Administration intent on fostering American leadership in clean-energy innovation have coalesced to promote change across the military services in the energy domain. This has been particularly evident in the Department's efforts to lessen its oil consumption. However, the ability to turn policy into practice has met numerous challenges from within and without the defense establishment. The question remains whether the DOD will be able to move beyond oil in a significant way. By examining a series of US government policy documents and programs, this article seeks to analyze the motivations behind the drive by the DOD to reduce oil consumption, to identify the challenges in meeting this objective, and to analyze efforts underway by the Department. Given that replacing oil for the largest transport fleet in the world will take several decades, it will require a sustained leadership from senior military officials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To solve such problems, innumerous small scale projects have been implemented around the world either on the improvement of cooking stoves, biogas and others, as well as in generating electricity in decentralized systems. We discuss here the large scale approach to solve these problems in Brazil through the introduction of LPG (liquid petroleum gas) in Brazil 70 years ago, all over the country, as a cooking fuel that replaced significantly the use of fuel wood in rural areas. In addition to that, we describe the governmental program (Luz para Todos - LPT - Light for all) introduced more recently to extend the electricity grid to around 10 million people, reducing considerably the number of people without access to electricity in the rural areas of the country. Such experiences and the corresponding lessons learned could be replicated in other developing countries, contributing significantly to poverty alleviation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The Nordic hydro based power system, particularly the Norwegian, is in a favourable position to provide necessary production flexibility to the Continental European power system. For this provision sufficient transfer capacity is required. In order to assess the provision of power production flexibility, a detailed operation optimisation model is necessary. Moreover, investments in the power system have to be set in relation to the economic outcome of the system operation. As a simultaneous system optimisation is not possible due to the size of the operation optimisation model, a two-step investment algorithm containing an iteration loop is proposed in this paper. The proposed investment algorithm identifies profitable investments based on the results of the operation optimisation model, where the effect of the investments on the power market outcome is taken into account through the iterative process. The presented investment algorithm is used for a transmission expansion analysis for a 2030 scenario of the Northern European power system. The results for the simulation of the scenario and the transmission expansion analysis are presented as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In response to pressure from the international community, and in recognition of its role in global climate change mitigation, the Chinese government has announced a series of climate policy commitments, in both the Copenhagen Accord and its domestic 12th 5 Year Plan, to gradually reduce emissions intensity by 2020. Emissions intensity reduction commitments differ significantly from emission level reduction commitments that are commonly adopted by developed economies. In this paper, we investigate the economic implications of China's recent commitments to reduce emissions intensity, and highlight the complexities involved in modelling intensity targets under uncertainty. Using G-Cubed, an intertemporal, computable general equilibrium model of the world economy, we show that China's emissions intensity targets could be achieved with a range of low and high growth emissions level trajectories corresponding to low and high growth GDP scenarios, which lead to different welfare consequences.

However, given the restrictions that pertain to the production of these resources, this article evaluates the availability of Venezuelan unconventional oil for helping meet the future worldwide petroleum demand. Venezuela has the world's second-largest oil reserves, but the majority of it is unconventional extra-heavy oil from the Orinoco Oil Belt. The perspective of Venezuelan production, the ways in which PDVSA, the state oil company, will raise funds for planned investments and the future oil price predictions are used to assess Venezuela's ability to serve as a source of unconventional oil in the coming years. Findings indicate that Venezuelan crude oil will be increasingly able to provide part of the marginal petroleum supply at a level predicted in global scenarios but short of that predicted by the country's government. Operational difficulties and the effort to raise financial resources for the oil production in the Belt require urgency in overcoming difficulties. As conventional production in Venezuela will stabilise in the coming years and the country is dependent on oil production, Venezuela will rely on extra-heavy oil extraction to ensure increased oil production and the stabilisation of internal accounts.

The significant reduction in Japan's energy intensity ceased in the early 1980s and has even slightly increased since the early 1990s, indicating that Japan seemingly stopped taking aggressive action to improve energy use. However, furthe(4)r analysis at prefecture level and sector level provides additional insight on energy intensity trends. To analyze the causes of the increase in Japan's energy intensity, energy intensity is decomposed into energy efficiency (improvements in energy efficiency) and energy activity (structural changes from the secondary sector to the tertiary sector of the economy). Our result indicates that the non-uniform energy intensity trends between prefectures are attributed to a high variability in energy efficiency. At sector level, we estimate the income elasticity of energy consumption in each sector and find that a structural change in energy consumption behaviors occurred in all sectors at different time points. The industrial sector and commercial sector became less energy efficient after 1981 and 1988, respectively, which is presumably responsible for the deterioration of Japan's energy intensity since the early 1990s.

About half of these households received feedback together with information about electricity-saving measures (pilot group), while the remaining households served as a control group. Participation in the pilot group was random, but households were able to choose between two types of feedback: access to a web portal or written feedback by post. Results from cross section OLS regression suggest that feedback provided to the pilot group corresponds with electricity savings of around 4.5% for the average household. Our results from quantile regressions imply that for households in the 30th to the 70th percentile of electricity consumption, feedback on electricity consumption is statistically significant and effects are highest in absolute terms and as a share of electricity consumption. For percentiles below or above this range, feedback appears to have no effect. Finally, controlling for a potential endogeneity bias induced by non random participation in the feedback type groups, we find no difference in the effects of feedback provided via the web portal and by post.

The country has reduced its dependence on foreign sources of energy to zero and become self-sufficient in its own energy production and use, offering important lessons for other nations around the world. This study explores the core of Denmark's successful approach: a commitment to energy efficiency, prolonged taxes on energy fuels, electricity, and carbon dioxide, and incentives for combined heat and power (CHP) and wind turbines. Through these commitments, the study shows how Denmark transitioned from being almost 100 percent dependent on imported fuels such as oil and coal for their power plants in 1970 to becoming a net exporter of fuels and electricity today. The country leads the world in terms of exportation of wind energy technology, with a hold on roughly one-third of the world market for wind turbines. It was able to phase out the use of virtually all oil-fired power plants in less than five years and implemented a progressive moratorium on future coal-fired power plants in the 1990s. Their most recent strategy seeks to achieve 30 percent of total energy supply from renewable energy by 2025. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Technology is important to support symbiosis, but few studies in China have focused on this topic at the industrial park level. This research presented a case study in a national iron and steel industrial park in China. Focus was given onto carbon mitigation through industrial symbiosis technology using substance flow analysis (SFA). Three typical iron and steel industry technologies, including coke dry quenching (CDQ), combined cycle power plant (CCPP), and CO2 capture by slag carbonization (CCSC) were evaluated with SFA. Technology assessment was further conducted in terms of carbon mitigation potential and unit reduction cost. Compared with the Business as usual (BAU) scenario, application with CDQ, CCPP, and CCSC reduced the net carbon emissions by 56.18, 134.43, and 222.89 kg CO2 per ton crude steel inside the industrial parks, respectively, including both direct and indirect emissions. Economic assessment revealed that the unit costs for the three technologies were also high, thereby necessitating national financial support. Finally, relevant policy suggestions and future concerns were proposed and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Their emission factor values were then compared with the standards of Energy Protection Agency, Euro Union and World Bank. Emission factors of gas turbine and steam power plants show that gas turbine power plants have a better performance than steam power plants. For economic analysis, fuel consumption and environmental damages caused by the emitted pollutants are considered as cost functions; and electricity sales revenue are taken as benefit functions. All of these functions have been obtained according to the capacity factor. Total revenue functions show that gas turbine and steam power plants are economically efficient at 98.15% and 90.89% of capacity factor, respectively; this indicates that long operating years of power plants leads to reduction of optimum capacity factor. The stated method could be implemented to assess the economic status of a country's power plants where as efficient capacity factor close to one means that power plant works in much better condition.

Building on an analysis of the different types of policy instruments to correct market failures specific to CCS in its various stages of development, we suggest a way to combine these into an integrated policy architecture. This policy architecture adapts to the need of a maturing technology, meets the requirement of policymakers to maintain flexibility to respond to changing circumstances while providing investors with the policy certainty that is needed to encourage private sector investment. This combination of flexibility and predictability is achieved through the use of 'policy gateways' which explicitly define rules and criteria for when and how policy settings will change. Our findings extend to bioenergy-based CCS applications (BECCS), which could potentially achieve negative emissions. We argue that within a framework of correcting the carbon externality, the added environmental benefits of BECCS should be reflected in an extra incentive. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An increasing number of companies have set targets and have adopted initiatives to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, raising the question of what sorts of outcomes can realistically be expected from corporate action on climate change? This paper aims to shed some light on this issue through an analysis of the climate change performance of the UK supermarket sector. This sector is directly responsible for around 1% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, but it has been estimated that indirectly it may be responsible for up to 10% of emissions. In the period between 2000 and 2010, the major UK supermarkets transformed their approach to climate change. This paper examines the outcomes that resulted from these actions. It finds that there have been significant and steady improvements In energy efficiency, but that these efficiency gains are often outstripped by the impacts of business growth.

However, there are few studies that have analyzed the consumption of energy by groups of buildings. This work aims to develop a model able to estimate the energy consumption by residential sectors, in different areas inside a city, through the adoption of an energy planning methodology using the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil as a case study. In this model, the most important variables of consumption behavior are related to the economy. The methodology coupled different approaches. Its first step was to survey the ownership of appliances and the socioeconomic profile of households in each region inside of the city, through the statistical analysis of census data. The second step was to characterize the average energy consumption by typical residential equipment. Then, it was possible to compute the energy consumption according to equipment and region. Finally, the modeled municipal energy consumption was compared with that recorded by the energy utility company. As a result, maps of energy consumed by end use are presented for the years 1991, 2000, and 2007. The conclusions of this work can be applied in energy planning projections and in local urban planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Some political opposition was raised - inter alia - by uncertainties about the effective cost of such technologies. Because of the cost structure of CCS power plants with high 'flat' investment cost and - in case of high carbon allowance prices - comparable low variable cost, the application of CCS will induce a merit-order effect causing a decline in wholesale electricity prices on the spot market. On the one hand, the reduction of electricity supply cost raises suppliers' rents, while the decline of wholesale electricity prices augments consumers' surpluses. These positive welfare effects tend to mitigate political opposition against CCS. On the other hand, the merit-order effect reduces electricity suppliers' revenues as the wholesale prices decline. This mitigates their scope for additional investments in CCS capacity. In this study, we focus on the influence of CCS in Germany on electricity supplier and consumer surpluses and associated impacts on the scope for investments in additional CCS capacity. By means of the applied model of electricity markets, influences on European electricity exchange and welfare levels are investigated. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To standardize the application of emergy synthesis and set pair analysis (EM-SPA) in ecosystem health assessment, a procedure for using EM-SPA models was established in this paper by combining the ability of emergy synthesis to reflect health status from a biophysical perspective with the ability of set pair analysis to describe extensive relationships among different variables. Based on the EM-SPA model, the relative health levels of selected urban clusters and their related ecosystem health patterns were characterized. The health states of three typical Chinese urban clusters - Jing-Jin-Tang, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta - were investigated using the model. The results showed that the health status of the Pearl River Delta was relatively good; the health for the Yangtze River Delta was poor. As for the specific health characteristics, the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta urban clusters were relatively strong in Vigor, Resilience, and Urban ecosystem service function maintenance, while the Jing-Jin-Tang was relatively strong in organizational structure and environmental impact. Guidelines for managing these different urban clusters were put forward based on the analysis of the results of this study. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This is certainly technically feasible. However, this paper asks whether the green battery idea is politically feasible. The paper analyses four scenarios, three of which Norway serves as a green battery and one domestic. It focuses on decision-makers' and interest groups' positions on new interconnectors from Norway to continental Europe and the United Kingdom (UK), pumped-storage hydropower, and new renewable energy production in Norway. The paper argues that the present policy is characterised by incremental change decisions about new interconnectors are made on an individual basis. Moreover the paper argues there is little reason to believe that this status quo policy will change based on any of the green battery scenarios in the near term. Still, decision-makers and interest groups are positive, in principle, towards new interconnectors and pumped-storage hydropower. Hence, Norway might become a green battery in the longer term. In the short term, however, a politically feasible contribution from Norway is balancing power through already existing hydropower capacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

On-road automobile energy intensity has shown little improvement, albeit from a low base, over the past four decades. We also consider policy measures undertaken by the Japanese government. Political arrangements in Japan after World War II made it attractive for politicians to pursue energy conservation by making transportation, particularly by automobile, expensive for the average Japanese citizen. The revenues raised from various fees and taxes on automobile transportation were redistributed to core supporters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These political arrangements have come under fire in recent years, calling into question Japan's traditional approach towards transportation sector energy efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Technical Efficiency index represents the capacity of an economy to produce a higher level of Gross Domestic Product for a given level of total energy input. The level of the Technical Efficiency index is determined from the energy mix (fossil fuels, non-fossil fuels, nuclear energy) of each country and depends on the maximization level of the production of the Gross Domestic Product of the economic system, without waste of energy resources. The current study is applied in the case of the EU15 countries. Its stope is to highlight the differentiations of country classifications before and after the integration of nuclear energy in the energy mix of each country. The main result is that the integration of nuclear energy as an additional input in the energy mixture affects negatively the Technical Efficiency of countries.

The energy policy calls for public actions to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions. The research participants are 94 people, selected by balancing sexes, ages, and residential areas, from a wide range of vocations. The research data were collected by semi-structured interview with the participants individually. Interview questions were designed to elicit the participants' constructs, beliefs, behaviours, and tensions in relation to energy policy and traditional culture. Data analysis was performed based on a qualitative methodology by the procedure of open coding, theme finding, constant comparison, and theory generation. The analysis identifies four tensions: (1) tensions in knowledge bases between energy conservation and carbon reduction, (2) tensions in lifestyles between having and being, (3) tensions in social systems between authority and conformity, and (4) tensions in creation boundaries between technology and nature. The themes underlying the four tensions are uncertainty, pleasure, power, and control, respectively. Solutions to the four tensions may include practical knowledge, pragmatic idealism, hierarchical collaboration, and sustainable innovation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a survey of 2034 American adults, we find that households are, on average, willing to pay between $79 and $89 per year in support of reducing domestic greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions 17% by 2020. Even very conservative estimates yield an average WTP at or above $60 per year. Taking advantage of randomized treatments within the survey valuation question, we find that mean WTP does not vary substantially among the policy instruments of a cap-and-trade program, a carbon tax, or a GHG regulation. But there are differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of those willing to pay across policy instruments. Greater education always increases WTP. Older individuals have a lower WTP for a carbon tax and a GHG regulation, while greater household income increases WTP for these same two policy instruments. Republicans, along with those indicating no political party affiliation, have a significantly lower WTP regardless of the policy instrument. But many of these differences are no longer evident after controlling for respondent opinions about whether global warming is actually happening. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Netherlands, a labelling scheme was introduced in 2008. Certificates contain the energy label of the dwelling and corresponding theoretical gas and electricity consumption, calculated based on the dwellings physical characteristics, its heating, ventilation and cooling systems and standard use characteristics. This paper reports on a large-scale study of around 200,000 dwellings comparing labels and theoretical energy use with data on actual energy use. The study shows that dwellings with a low energy label actually consume much less energy than predicted by the label, but on the other hand, energy-efficient dwellings consume more than predicted. In practice, policy targets are set according to the theoretical rather than the actual consumptions of the building stock. In line with identified discrepancies, the study shows that whereas most energy reduction targets can be met according to the theoretical energy consumption of the dwelling stock, the future actual energy reduction potential is much lower and fails to meet most of the current energy reduction targets.

Environmental rebound effects from consumption decisions,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rebound effect; Conservation; Household consumption,ENERGY-REQUIREMENTS; EFFICIENCY; EMISSIONS; INTENSITIES; HOUSEHOLDS; BACKFIRE,"Shifting consumer preferences towards 'green' consumption is promoted by many governments and environmental groups. Rebound effects, which reduce the effectiveness of such actions, are estimated for cost-saving 'green' consumption choices using Australian data. Cases examined are: reduced vehicle use, reduced electricity use, changing to smaller passenger vehicles, and utilising fluorescent lighting. It is found that if rebound effects are ignored when evaluating 'green' consumption, environmental benefits will be overstated by around 20% for reduced vehicle use, and 7% for reduced electricity use. Rebound effects are higher, and environmental benefits lower, when more efficient vehicles or lighting are utilised rather than simple conservation actions of forgoing use. In addition, lower income households have higher rebound effects, suggesting that environmental policy directed at changing consumer behaviour is most effective when targeted at high income households. An inherent trade-off between economic and environmental benefits of 'green' consumption choices is demonstrated. The size of the rebound effect, and the observed variation with household income, is attributed to Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA) methodologies associated with the calculation of embodied GHG emissions of consumption goods. These results should be therefore be interpreted as the minimum rebound effect to include in policy evaluation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper argues that the resulting localities debate threw this baby out with the bathwater and rather than invent new concepts to capture socio-spatial relations in the twenty-first century, the paper urges a return to locality to enlighten regional studies. The paper offers three new readings of locality, which when taken together constitute the basis for thinking about regions, society and space through the lens of new localities. It further suggests that for locality to have analytical value it must also have both an imagined and a material coherence, and it puts a new locality framework to work in research on devolved regional economic and social geographies.","[Jones, Martin] Aberystwyth Univ, Wales Inst Social & Econ Res Data & Methods WISER, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales",Aberystwyth University; Aberystwyth University,"Jones, M (通讯作者)，Aberystwyth Univ, Wales Inst Social & Econ Res Data & Methods WISER, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.",msj@aber.ac.uk; m.woods@aber.ac.uk,"Jones, Martin R/C-5752-2013; Jones, Martin/ABI-6890-2020; Woods, Michael/N-4352-2016","Jones, Martin/0000-0002-4627-2293; Woods, Michael/0000-0003-3813-4138",,,,,110,63,66,0,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

These policies have activated a new relationship between fossil fuel and vegetable oil prices. Combining a multiple structural change approach with rolling cointegration, the article identifies four structural breaks in the relationships between the price of mineral and vegetable oils. Results show that policy instruments are responsible for these structural changes in the long-run relationships between prices. The analysis also shows that from the implementation of the directive 2003/30/EC the price dynamic of rapeseed oil has shifted from its own market to the diesel market, making it subject to interactions with the more complex reality of mineral oil.

This alternative offers a unique opportunity for a net removal of atmospheric CO2 while fulfilling energy needs. Empirical studies using bottom-up energy models show that BECCS has an important role to play in the future energy mix. Most of these studies focus on global BECCS potential, whereas it is of interest to understand where this mitigation option will be deployed. This key issue will strongly depend on regions' biomass resources and possession of storage sites. The aim of this study is to assess the global and regional potential of BECCS up to 2050 in power generation. This analysis is conducted using the multiregional TIAM-FR optimization model. The climate policy scenarios investigated lead to a considerable expansion of renewable energy and CCS and BECCS technologies in the power sector. CCS from fossil fuel is mainly deployed in fast developing countries (India and China) and BECCS is highly distributed in developing countries, even though biomass resources are widely available in all regions.

Improvements to model accuracy rely primarily on the refinement of parameter sensitivities and on plausible future carbon emissions trajectories. Carbon emissions are the leading cause of global warming, yet current considerations of future emissions do not consider structural limits to fossil fuel supply, invoking a wide range of uncertainty. Moreover, outdated assumptions regarding the future abundance of fossil energy could contribute to misleading projections of both economic growth and climate change vulnerability. Here we present an easily replicable mathematical model that considers fundamental supply-side constraints and demonstrate its use in a stochastic analysis to produce a theoretical upper limit to future emissions. The results show a significant reduction in prior uncertainty around projected long term emissions, and even assuming high estimates of all fossil fuel resources and high growth of unconventional production, cumulative emissions tend to align to the current medium emissions scenarios in the second half of this century. This significant finding provides much-needed guidance on developing relevant emissions scenarios for long term climate change impact studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in a time of economic insecurity, domestically as well as in Russia's primary export market in Europe, maintaining the status quo to ensure political stability is likely to be prioritized by the authorities at the expense of investments and structural reform which may be a premise for reaching the APG utilization goal.

Moreover, there have been several announcements by the private and public sectors regarding the construction of new pipelines to supply natural gas to the Peruvian southern and central-north markets. This paper presents future scenarios for the use of natural gas in the large-sized industrial and commercial sectors of the country based on different hypotheses on developments in the natural gas industry, national economic growth, energy prices, technological changes and investment decisions. First, the paper estimates the market potential and characterizes the energy consumption. Then it makes a selection of technological alternatives for the use of natural gas, and it makes an energetic and economic analysis and economic feasibility. Finally, the potential use of natural gas is calculated through nine different scenarios. The natural gas use in cogeneration systems is presented as an alternative to contribute to the installed power capacity of the country. Considering the introduction of the cogeneration in the optimistic-advanced scenario and assuming that all of their conditions would be put into practice, in 2020, the share of the cogeneration in electricity production in Peru would be 9.9%.

As in a developing country context political considerations make tariff levels more important than supply security, satisfying the earmarked level of demand takes a back seat. Retail market regulators are often forced by politicians to keep the retail tariff at suboptimal level. This imposes budget constraint on distribution companies to procure electricity that it requires to meet the earmarked level of demand. This is the way demand response is introduced in the system and has its impact on spot market prices. We model such a situation of not being able to serve the earmarked demand as disutility to the regulator which has to be minimised and we compute associated equilibrium. This results in systematic mechanism for cutting loads. We find that even a small cut in ability of the distribution companies to procure electricity from the spot market has profound impact on the prices in the spot market. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reports on a cross-sectional survey of low income householders participating in the Warm Front Scheme in five urban areas of England. Surveys were conducted of 2685 individuals, before and or after intervention. Pathways to self reported health were modelled by logistic regression. Of all the dimensions of health examined, only self reported mental health is directly associated with Warm Front measures. Intermediary variables associated with Warm Front intervention were shown to be significantly correlated with more dimensions of self reported health status. Higher temperatures, satisfaction with the heating system, greater thermal comfort, reductions in fuel poverty and lower stress were significantly correlated with improved health. Alleviating fuel poverty and reducing stress appeared to be the main route to health. We conclude there are complex and indirect relationships linking energy efficiency measures to outcomes on all dimensions of health which contribute to significant material and psychosocial benefits. The impact of the Warm Front Scheme cannot be fully understood by a limited analysis which merely relates indoor temperature and property characteristics to physiological health outcomes.

A human-centered analysis of the worldwide energy situation is conducted in terms of quality of life-related variables that are affected, but not directly determined, by energy consumption. Data since 1980 show a continuous global increase in both energy consumption and quality of life, and lower population growth in countries with higher quality of life. Based on these trends, we advance non-linear energy consumption predictions and identify various plausible scenarios to optimally steer future energy demands, in order to maximize quality of life. The scenarios consider the coupling between energy consumption rate per capita, quality of life, population growth, social inequality, and governments' energy-for-life efficiency. The results show the energy cost of increasing quality of life in the developing world, energy savings that can be realized by limiting overconsumption without impacting quality of life, and the role of governments on increasing energy-for-life efficiency and reducing social inequality.

This paper sheds light on this issue and tries to resolve it by addressing the following questions: what kind of structural shock is underlying the price fluctuations of PV Si feedstock? How can we quantify the magnitude, timing and relative importance of these shocks? What are their dynamic effects on the real price of PV Si feedstock? By carefully studying development conditions, the structural decomposition of the real price of PV Si feedstock is proposed: exchange rate shocks, production cost shocks, aggregate demand shocks and demand shocks specific to feedstock markets. With a Structural Vector Autoregression model, the paper quantifies and verifies the impact of structural shocks on PV Si feedstock real price changes. Based on national data, an analysis is further taken to confirm the essential role of demand shocks specific to feedstock markets in determining sharper price fluctuations during 2004-2009. The results of this study have important implications for national solar PV development, which can be better promoted and administrated if structural shocks in feedstock markets can be carefully evaluated and understood.

Concurrently, Australian houses have steadily increased in size from 1984 to 2009. This paper estimates the capacity of building codes to reduce residential emissions and achieve progressive reduction targets in light of increasing house sizes. A Residential Emissions Calculator was developed to compare heating and cooling loads for 72 new Australian houses-based on star ratings, historic Australian house sizes by state, and international house sizes. The analysis illustrates that house size has significant impact on the capacity of residential building codes to reduce emissions, and informs three key results: (1) Victoria is forecast to dominate emissions from new houses in Australia, (2) The increase in house size from 2003 to 2009 in Victoria decreased the effectiveness of moving from 5 stars to 6 stars by 38%, (3) Progressive CO2-e reduction targets of 80% could be achieved by a variety of house size and star rating scenarios (with significant housing affordability impacts). The result posit building codes and house size as potent strategies to limit energy associated emissions and underlines the need to apply these strategies in tandem as part of integrated national emissions management policy.

To aid the targeting of policies to promote the types of P2 that achieve environmental goals, this study investigates the intricate nature of P2 adoption by (1) distinguishing among three types of P2: procedural changes, input and material changes and equipment and product changes, (2) disentangling the adoption decision into a binary and a count decision, and (3) analyzing benefit- and cost-related factors. Using a sample of facilities of S&P 500 firms, I employ NB hurdle models to analyze how facilities respond to these factors in making P2 adoption decisions. I find that facilities that have lower cost of adoption due to past P2 experience have higher likelihood of adoption and higher rates of adoption of all types of P2. However, those exposed to greater threat of enforcement action find limited scope for P2 in achieving environmental compliance objectives. Some regulatory threat variables even have a negative effect. Facilities also adopt P2 to enjoy market-related benefits: final good producers are more likely to adopt P2 that appeal to consumers (input and material changes), while intermediate good producers are more likely to adopt P2 that is valued by its supply chain (procedural changes). Community characteristics and other knowledge sources are not always positively associated with the likelihood of adoption nor with the rate of adoption. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides a transparent framework for calculating the cost of generated electricity from a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant and the internal rate of return on equity. The different factors contributing to the capital cost and generation cost of CSP technology have been discussed. The effect of variation of plant size, solar insolation and discount rate has been shown. India has launched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) and plans to install 20 GW of grid connected solar power by 2022. An analysis of the bids received in the National Thermal Power Corporation's Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd. (NVVN) bidding process, indicates that successful companies have access to low interest capital (effective discount rate ranging from 6.3-12.2%). With the current generation cost of 11-12 Rs/kW h (24-25 US Cents/kW h), an achievable target for CSP in the future is likely to be 6.5-7 Rs/kW h (14-15 US Cents/kW h). This may be possible through reductions in solar field and power block costs combined with increases in collector and overall plant efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By use of the European Consumer Satisfaction Index (ECSI), the paper estimates consumer satisfaction in biomass, petroleum, electricity and renewable energy subsectors. The findings are that consumer satisfaction is highest in the renewable energy sub sector at 74.7% followed by petroleum at 62.8%. The electricity sub sector has the lowest consumer satisfaction of 53.06%. Further, it is found that the image of renewable energy providers is also the highest at 72.5% followed by that of petroleum companies at 63.1%. In the electricity sub sector, perceived value scored the highest at 64.2%. The paper concludes that image of a service provider, loyalty of consumers, consumer expectations, perceived value, perceived quality and the way complains are handled are very important factors that determine consumer satisfaction levels. It is recommended that for monitoring and evaluation purposes in the performance of the energy sector, the Energy RegulatoryCommission(ERC) could use the consumer satisfaction index level to evaluate whether the regulatory policies and their implementation are bearing fruit where a high index would be associated with good performance and vice versa.

We do so through a general equilibrium model in which Peak Oil endogenously emerges from the interplay between the geological, technical, macroeconomic and geopolitical determinants of supply and demand under non-perfect expectations. We analyze the macroeconomic effects of oil production profiles and demonstrate that Peak Oil dates that differ only slightly may lead to very different time profiles of oil prices, exportation flows and economic activity. We investigate Middle-East's trade-off between different pricing trajectories in function of two alternative objectives (maximisation of oil revenues or households' welfare) and assess its impact on OECD growth trajectories. A sensitivity analysis highlights the respective roles of the amount of resources, inertia on the deployment of non conventional oil and short-term oil price dynamics on Peak Oil dates and long-term oil prices. It also examines the effects of these assumptions on OECD growth and Middle-East strategic tradeoffs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The Western politicians need to recognize that their rhetoric in relation to China's efforts to secure energy supplies overseas has done nothing but intensify China's fear that they might seek to deny China's access to the oil it needs for the development. China needs to reconsider its stance of distrusting global oil markets and to recognize that the reliance on aggressive acquisitions of overseas oil fields and equity oil production has been of little help in strengthening its energy security. Given that China's energy security depends increasingly and deeply on the stability of global oil markets and reliable and growing oil supplies to the market.

Several recent studies have identified large swathes of the world's 'sunbelt' as technically suitable for the technology, but current estimates grossly overestimate site suitability for CSP. There is a need for more realistic suitability estimations in order to provide a more accurate basis for policy and investment decisions. This paper establishes a generally applicable GIS-based methodology to better enable identification of CSP-suitable sites at the continental scale. We test the methodology, identifying a large number of CSP suitable sites in Western Australia (WA). Our results indicate a 99.4% reduction from technically suitable areas to areas showing medium-to-very-high suitability in the current and near term in WA. The availability of infrastructure is critical to site suitability and the introduction of new major loads and infrastructure in currently under-developed regions is likely to open up further areas with medium to very high suitability. Despite the fact that current global/continental scale estimates of CSP potentials are likely overestimated by at least two orders of magnitude, truly CSP-suitable areas remain more than sufficient to motivate investment in utility-scale CSP and power potentials from this technology remain enormous.

In order to consider the merits of mechanisms and policies to support a change in behaviour that results in greater take-up of home working, this paper applies energy consumption per commute calculations and a logit model using a case study of Ireland. In marked contrast with larger countries, the energy consumption per commute is relatively low in Ireland. Nonetheless, the analysis indicates that, on average, at least an average net saving of 9.33 kW h per day can be achieved where an individual converts to working from home, after deducting the home energy consumption associated with home working. We find that land use patterns, public transport networks, internet infrastructure, commute distances and socio-demographic characteristics can serve to influence rates of home working. Encouraging the higher and lower professional categories and those in the service sectors to work from home should be the highest priority in terms of energy and emissions reductions. Increased coverage of internet services and railway coverage will support higher rates of home working. Increased dispersion of residential, commercial and industrial areas serves to encourage greater home working. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A sample of 125 households was involved in the study, of which 63 were the control group. Both self-reported behavioral changes and actual energy reductions were measured and any Hawthorne effect was identified. It was found that self-reported behavioral changes were strongly correlated to the level of trust in the energy conservation information given, the need for ease in practicing the recommended conservation measures and feeling of satisfaction in executing the measures; these results differ from several past studies on energy interventions. 60.7% of those who reported behavioral changes actually reduced energy consumption. Reasons were found and discussed. Lessons from this intervention study can be applied to design integrated policies aimed at promoting energy conservation in households. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

I then use qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to isolate specific combinations of energy firm attributes that are associated with network position. I find that the energy industry has several key intra-firm interlocks that link dominant companies to each other and that the industry is well represented on the boards of EPPN organizations. Additionally, several dominant energy firms provide links between ultra-conservative and moderate policy development organizations. Finally, QCA models suggest that firms with many employees, high revenue, and who produce oil are most likely to hold prominent positions in the EPPN-though above average political campaign contributions offer an alternative path into the network.

The main contribution lies in providing a new approach to environmental efficiency estimation, in which the efficiency estimates quantify the distance from the policy objective of minimum emissions. We are able to examine a very large pool of nations and provide country-wise efficiency estimates. We estimate three econometric models, corresponding with alternative interpretations of the Cancun vision (Conference of the Parties 2011). The models reveal progress in global environmental efficiency during a preceding decade. The estimates indicate vast differences in efficiency levels, and efficiency changes across countries. The highest efficiency levels are observed in Africa and Europe, while the lowest are clustered around China. The largest efficiency gains were observed in central and eastern Europe. CO2 efficiency also improved in the US and China, the two largest emitters, but their ranking in terms of CO2 efficiency deteriorated. Policy implications are discussed.

In this work, a meta-analysis of European RE generation issues from international scientific literature was carried out. Fifty-four local RE implementation issues were identified. Five main clusters of issues were determined, some were aligned along sectoral lines (e.g., governance and technology) but others were inherently multi-sectoral (e.g., complexity and multiplicity of factors), challenging the traditional sectorial view. Results show that RE issues are not just a finite list of independent issues but are hierarchical, multi-scale and cross-linked. As a further step, these issues clusters were linked to the European RE policy and subsidiarity through the National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAP) in selected MS. EU policy and NREAP subsidiarity proved limited in their scope in dealing with local RE issues. With this scope, the way that EU policy partially fails to facilitate delivery of RE targets, promotes weak subsidiarity through NREAPs and does not address local issues of RE, is discussed.

During the year 2010, the Taiwan government planned a four-year project budgeted at 300 million US dollars, called The Penghu Low Carbon Island Development Project. The policy objective is to use Penghu Island (population 85,000) as a test platform to evaluate new ways to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions before attempting to replicate the policies on Taiwan Island. For Taiwan, a zero carbon island green transportation policy will regulate the total number of electric scooters, the total number of gasoline motorcycles, influence government subsidy incentives, and create the need for new motorcycle license issuing and control. These factors interact with each other to form a complex and dynamic system that impacts policy as well as the current way of life. In this study, a system dynamics approach is designed to construct a model for evaluating the green transportation policy on Penghu Island. Simulations are conducted to model green transportation system behavior and related policy effects in a smaller, controlled environment before creating policies for Taiwan Island that will impact the lives of over 23 million people.

In this regard, 40 case studies using the reviewed frameworks reported during 1994-2011 are surveyed. Then, their application area and application intensity are investigated. It is concluded that PSR, and DPSEA & DPSEEA have the higher and lower application intensities, respectively. Moreover, using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with a set of criteria, it is shown that PSR and DPSIR have the highest and lowest priorities. Finally, the shortcomings of frameworks applications are discussed. The paper is helpful in selecting appropriate policy making frameworks and presents some hints for future research in the area for developing more comprehensive models especially for sustainable electric energy policy making.

In addition, we calculated the trend of decoupling effects in nonferrous metals industry in China by presenting a theoretical framework for decoupling. As the results suggest, Chinese nonferrous metals industry has gone through four decoupling stages: strong negative decoupling stage (1996-1998), weak decoupling stage (1999-2000), expensive negative decoupling stage (2001-2003) and weak decoupling stage (2004-2008). We have analyzed the reasons for each phase. Generally speaking, the rapid growth of the industry is the most important factor responsible for the increase of CO2 emissions, and the change in energy mix was mainly due to the increased proportion of electric energy consumption that has contributed to the increase of CO2 emissions. Reduction of energy intensity has contributed significantly to emissions decrease, and the utility mix effect has also contributed to the emission decrease to some extent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to electricity market regulations that inhibit market entry for independent developers, New Zealand's wind energy development has been limited to primarily large wind farms developed by a handful of electricity utilities. In contrast to many other countries, NZ lacks policy support for entry of smaller investors into the wind generation sector. In order to gage the acceptability of a feed in tariff (FIT) for wind energy in New Zealand, a survey questionnaire (366 respondents) with land owning farmers and semi structured interviews with wind energy stakeholders was conducted. Although international literature suggests that a FIT would be the most suitable policy support scheme to accelerate wind energy deployment, this conclusion was not reached by many influential stakeholders in NZ. However, a majority of the surveyed farmers supported the introduction of a FIT for wind energy. The study also revealed that farmers' acceptance of wind energy in their local area increases with their awareness about climate change issues. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis has been performed through applying an electricity system investment and production optimization model based on linear programming. This model has been calibrated according to the real electricity generation data. The results show that the introduction of a global carbon price of 18 (sic)/ton would lead to a total abatement of several hundreds of million tons in 2006, i.e. 5% reduction of global CO2 emissions compared to a baseline scenario with zero CO2 price. Through a sensitivity study, we show that in addition to the CO2-price, relation between natural gas and coal price is crucial for the abatement achieved through fuel switching. On a long-term horizon, integration of wind is determined as the most economic option to respond to ambitious emissions reduction targets. A wind power capacity of 4913 GW in 2020 and 15729 GW by 2040 allows reducing CO2 emissions by 35% and 78%, respectively, from the level of year 2000 while the CO2-price rises from 18 to 44 (sic)/ton.

Two key related factors highlight the need to establish a RE sector: first the UAE has one of the highest carbon footprint in the world and second, the rate of depletion of its main energy generation resource fossil fuel. In this study, we present a review of overall policies in sixty-one countries, focusing on their efforts to adopt RE resources in the power sector, and on their implementation of fundamental policies implemented. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability to Abu Dhabi UAE of the main RE policies implemented worldwide.

As well as displacing fossil fuel consumption by increasing renewable energy generation, projects are expected to have a range of social impacts which may result in additional positive sustainability outcomes. These include potential to increase: acceptance of renewable energy developments; awareness of renewable and sustainable energy technologies and issues; uptake of low carbon technologies; and sustainable/pro-environmental behaviours. To date however, there has been little investigation of whether and how these impacts occur. This paper presents results from qualitative research investigating the social impacts of a community woodfuel project as experienced by project participants and other local stakeholders. Findings show projects can raise awareness of renewable energy technologies and increase uptake of renewables. Overall the case study project successfully changed the local social context for development of woodfuel heating, reducing risk for all involved in the future development of this sector, particularly in the immediate locality. There was some evidence of increased engagement with wider sustainability issues but this was limited to direct participants, suggesting local projects need to be supported by wider systemic change to maximise impacts.

This paper contends that this widespread phenomenon is mainly ascribable to the processes of liberalization and privatization of electricity markets, which have induced electric utilities to dramatically reduce R&D expenditures. A closer inspection to recent data concerned with ten major electric companies of the world shows that the drop of research expenditures was particularly strong among the private or newly-privatized companies. Instead, those that remained under public control did not reduce remarkably their R&D efforts. According to the widely recognized need of a surge of energy R&D, the policy implications of the above findings are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification comes from a heteroscedastic covariance restriction that is shown to be a feature of many models of endogeneity or mismeasurement.

This paper and the special issue it introduces take stock of advances in the learning region literature of the past twenty years. It then suggests a different approach to conceptualizing the relation between space and learning. Based on an understanding of learning as social interaction among individuals, the paper and special issue suggest a relational approach to explaining learning in a socio-spatial context. This approach augments the Territorial Innovation Models literature that too often reduces relational concepts, such as social capital, to stylized regional characteristics.","[Rutten, Roel] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Social & Behav Sci, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Rutten, Roel] Tilburg Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Boekema, Frans] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Sch Management, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Rutten, R (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Social & Behav Sci, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",r.p.j.h.rutten@uvt.nl; f.boekema@fm.ru.nl,,,,,,,54,61,63,1,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

According to institutional economics theory, the design of effective and efficient arrangements depends on production and transaction characteristics, the institutional environment, and the organizational environment supporting the transaction between producers and the industry. This paper presents a comparative study on two cases in the feedstock-for-biodiesel industry in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The two case studies represent the production and transaction system of soybeans (Glycine max L Merrill) and castor beans (Ricinus communis L).

Inconsistent and inadequate drug coverage, however, prevents many children from receiving timely and equitable access to the best treatment Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate parents willingness to pay (WTP) for biologic and nonbiologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) used to treat JIA. Methods: Utility weights from a discrete choice experiment were used to estimate the WTP for treatment characteristics including child reported pain, participation in daily activities, side effects, days missed from school, drug treatment, and cost. Conditional logit regression was used to estimate utilities for each attribute level, and expected compensating variation was used to estimate the WTP. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% confidence intervals for all WTP estimates. Results: Parents had the highest marginal WTP for improved participation in daily activities and pain relief followed by the elimination of side effects of treatment. Parents were willing to pay $2080 (95% confidence interval $698-$4065) more for biologic DMARDs than for nonbiologic DMARDs if the biologic DiVIARD was more effective. Conclusions: Parents' WTP indicates their preference for treatments that reduce pain and improve daily functioning without side effects by estimating the monetary equivalent of utility for drug treatments in JIA. In addition to evidence of safety and efficacy, assessments of parents' preferences provide a broader perspective to decision makers by helping them understand the aspects of drug treatments in JIA that are most valued by families.","[Burnett, Heather F.; Ungar, Wendy J.; Feldman, Brian M.] Hosp Sick Children, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada; [Ungar, Wendy J.; Feldman, Brian M.; Miller, Fiona A.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Regier, Dean A.] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4E6, Canada; [Feldman, Brian M.] Univ Toronto, Hosp Sick Children, Div Rheumatol, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Feldman, Brian M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Pediat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Feldman, Brian M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Feldman, Brian M.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto; British Columbia Cancer Agency; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Ungar, WJ (通讯作者)，Hosp Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Ctr Res & Learning, 11th Floor,686 Bay St, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.",wendy.ungar@sickkids.ca,,"Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4953-6255; Ungar, Wendy/0000-0002-0762-0101",Ontario Ministry of Health; Long-term Care Drug Innovation Fund,"Ontario Ministry of Health(Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario); Long-term Care Drug Innovation Fund",Funding for this research was provided by a program grant from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care Drug Innovation Fund.,,51,3,4,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2014,17.0,8.0,,,,,830,837,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.08.2668,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AX4RC,25498778.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346918100009,0

However, reliable, objective measures of work pressure are in short supply. This paper uses Danish day care teachers as an ideal case for analysing whether work pressure measured by the child-to-teacher ratio, that is, the number of children per teacher in an institution, affects teacher sickness absenteeism. We control for individual teacher characteristics, workplace characteristics, and family background characteristics of the children in the day care institutions. We perform estimations for two time periods, 2002-2003 and 2005-2006, by using generalized method of moments with lagged levels of the child-to-teacher ratio as instrument. Our estimation results are somewhat mixed. Generally, the results indicate that the child-to-teacher ratio is positively related to short-term sickness absence for nursery care teachers, but not for preschool teachers.

While state and local government pension obligations have been analyzed in great detail, much less attention has been paid to the costs of the other major retiree benefit provided by these governments: retiree health insurance. The first portion of the paper uses the information contained in the annual actuarial reports for public retiree health plans to reverse engineer the cash flows underlying the liabilities given in the report. Obtaining the cash flows allows us to construct liability estimates which are consistent across governments in terms of the discount rate, actuarial method and assumptions concerning medical cost inflation and mortality. We find that the total unfunded accrued liability of state and local governments for the provision of retiree health care exceeds $1 trillion, or about 1/3 of total state and local government revenue. Relative to pension obligations discounted at the same rate, we find that unfunded retiree health care liabilities are 1/2 the size of unfunded pension obligations. We also find that using assumptions concerning the growth in health care costs that are arguably more realistic than those employed by most states actually reduces the size of the liability in most cases. Pushing in the opposite direction, we find that using plausibly more realistic mortality assumptions increases the size of liability. The second portion of the paper places retiree health care obligations into context by examining the budget pressures associated with retiree health on a continuing, largely pay-as-you go basis. We find that much of the projected increase in retiree health obligations as a share of revenue is the result of health care cost growth. On average, states could put their retiree health obligations into long-run fiscal balance by contributing an additional 3/4 percent of total revenue toward the benefit each year. There is, however, wide variation across the states, with the majority of states requiring little in the way of additional financing, but some states requiring a significantly larger increase.

Our primary approach compares trends in wages and hours for public employees with and without state/local government provided health insurance using individual-level micro-data from the 1992-2011 CPS. To adjust for differences between insured and uninsured public sector employees, we create a matched sample based on an employee's propensity to receive health insurance. We assess the relationship between state contribution to the health plan premium, state-level healthcare spending, and the wages and hours of state and local government employees. We find modest reductions in wages are associated with having employer-sponsored health insurance (ESHI), although this effect is not precisely measured. The reduction in wages associated with having ESHI is larger among non-unionized workers. Further, we find little evidence that provision of health insurance increases hours worked.

Similarly, the volume and quality of healthcare consumption could rise with incomes because of demographic changes, usage of innovative medical technologies, and other factors. Hospital healthcare spending is the largest component of aggregate US healthcare expenditures. The novel contribution of our paper is estimating and decomposing the income elasticity of hospital care expenditures (HOCEXP) into its quantity and quality components. By using a 1999-2008 panel dataset of the 50 US states, results from the seemingly unrelated regressions model estimation reveal the income elasticity of HOCEXP to be 0.427 (std. error=0.044), with about 0.391 (calculated std. error=0.044) arising from care quality improvements and 0.035 (std. error=0.050) emanating from the rise in usage volume. Our novel research findings suggest the following: (i) the quantity part of hospital expenditure is inelastic to income change; (ii) almost the entire income-induced rise in hospital expenditure comes from care quality changes; and (iii) the 0.427 income elasticity of HOCEXP, the largest component of total US healthcare expenditure, makes hospital care a normal commodity and a much stronger technical necessity than aggregate healthcare.

A significant contribution of our paper is that we compare two types of SSB taxes recently advocated by policy makers: A 20% flat rate sales (valoric) tax and a 20 cent/L volumetric tax. Censored demand is accounted for using a two-step procedure. We find that the volumetric tax would result in a greater per capita weight loss than the valoric tax (0.41 kg vs. 0.29 kg). The difference between the change in weight is substantial for the target group of heavy purchasers of SSBs in low-income households, with a weight reduction of up to 3.20 kg for the volumetric and 2.06 kg for the valoric tax. The average yearly per capita tax burden on low-income households is $17.87 (0.21% of income) compared with $15.17 for high-income households (0.07% of income) for the valoric tax, and $13.80 (0.15%) and $10.10 (0.04%) for the volumetric tax. Thus, the tax burden is lower, and weight reduction is higher under a volumetric tax.

Objective: To use VHA database to conduct a population-based study of patterns of myelosuppressive chemotherapy use and to assess the incidence and management of febrile neutropenia (FN) among VHA patients with lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Methods: Data were extracted for the initial myelosuppressive chemotherapy course for 27,899 patients who began treatment in the period 2006 to 2011. FN-related costs were defined as claims containing FN diagnosis. Results: Most patients were men (98.0%); most were 65 years or older (55.8%). Patients received a mean 3.4 to 3.9 chemotherapy cycles/course (median cycle duration 34-43 days). The incidence of FN among patients with lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer or NHL was 10.2%, 4.6%, 5.4%, and 17.3%, respectively. Primary or secondary prophylactic antibiotics/colony-stimulating factors were received by 21% and 12% of patients, respectively. Antibiotics were more commonly given as primary or secondary prophylaxis for patients with lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer; colony-stimulating factors were more common for patients with NHL. Among patients with FN, those with lung cancer had the highest inpatient mortality (10%); patients with NHL had the highest costs ($24,571) and the longest hospital length of stay (15.4 days). Conclusions: VHA cancer care was generally consistent with National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommendations; however, compared with the general population, chemotherapy cycles were longer, combination chemotherapy was used less, and treatment to prevent FN was used less, differences that may be attributed to the unique VHA patient population. The impact of these practices warrants further investigation.","[Wang, Li; Baser, Onur] STATinMED Res, Plano, TX USA; [Barron, Richard; Langeberg, Wendy J.] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Baser, Onur] MEF Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Dale, David C.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98105 USA",Amgen; MEF Universitesi; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Dale, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Med, Box 356422,Hlth Sci Bldg,AA 522, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",dcdale@u.washington.edu,"Library, MEF/O-1457-2019",,"Amgen, Inc.","Amgen, Inc.(Amgen)","This study was funded by Amgen, Inc.",,24,3,5,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2014,17.0,6.0,,,,,739,743,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.06.009,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AP8XS,25236998.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342363300010,0

To this end, we consider a financial market that features volatility uncertainty. We use the notion of G-expectation and its corresponding G-Brownian motion recently introduced by Peng (2007) to ensure a mathematically consistent framework. Our financial market consists of a riskless asset and a risky stock with price process modeled by geometric G-Brownian motion. We adapt the notion of arbitrage to this more complex situation, and consider stock price dynamics which exclude arbitrage opportunities. Volatility uncertainty results in an incomplete market. We establish the interval of no-arbitrage prices for general European contingent claims, and deduce explicit results in the Markovian case.","Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Math Econ, Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld,"Vorbrink, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Math Econ, Bielefeld, Germany.",jvorbrin@math.uni-bielefeld.de,,,German Science Foundation (DFG) [IRTG 1132],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),I thank Frank Riedel for valuable advice and Yongsheng Song for fruitful discussions.

We estimate the effect of a large cut in the Finnish alcohol tax on mortality, alcohol-related illnesses and work absenteeism in Sweden. This tax cut led to large differences in the prices of alcoholic beverages between these two countries and to a considerable increase in cross-border shopping. The effect is identified using differences-in-differences strategy where changes in these outcomes in regions near the Finnish border are compared to changes in other parts of northern Sweden. We use register data where micro level data on deaths, hospitalisations and absenteeism is merged to population-wide micro data on demographics and labour market outcomes. Our results show that the Finnish tax cut did not have any clear effect on mortality or alcohol-related hospitalisations in Sweden. However, we find that workplace absenteeism increased by 9% for males and by 15% for females near the Finnish border as a result of the tax cut. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, several states have introduced laws that provide incentives to retailers and bar owners who use electronic scanners to ensure that the customer is 21 years or older and uses a valid identification to purchase alcohol. This paper is the first to investigate the effects of these laws using confidential data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 Cohort (NLSY97). Using a difference-in-differences methodology, I find that the false ID laws with scanner provision significantly reduce underage drinking, including up to a 0.22 drink decrease in the average number of drinks consumed by underage youth per day. This effect is observed particularly in the short-run and more pronounced for non-college students and those who are relatively younger. These results are also robust under alternative model specifications. The findings of this paper highlight the importance of false ID laws in reducing alcohol consumption among underage youth.

People frequently, however, find participating in clinical trials meaningless or disempowering. Moreover, people often do not incorporate trial results directly into their decision making. The lack of patient centeredness in clinical trials may be partially addressed through trial design for example, Bayesian adaptive trials designed to adjust in a prespecified manner to changes in clinical practice could motivate people and their health care providers to view clinical trials as more applicable to real-world clinical decisions. The way in which clinical trials are designed can transform the evidence generation process to be more patient centered, providing people with an incentive to participate or continue participating in clinical trials. To achieve the transformation to patient-centeredness in clinical trial decisions, however, there is a need for transparent and reliable methods and education of trial investigators and site personnel.","[Mullins, C.

The model's distinguishing characteristic is that a given agent's behaviour is influenced by an aggregation of the views or actions of those around them. The model allows for considerable flexibility in terms of the genesis of this herding or clustering type behaviour. At an econometric level, the model is shown to nest various extant dynamic panel data models. These include panel AR models, spatial models, which accommodate weak dependence only, and panel models where cross-sectional averages or factors exogenously generate strong, but not weak, cross sectional dependence. An important implication is that the appropriate model for the aggregate series becomes intrinsically nonlinear, due to the clustering behaviour, and thus requires the disaggregates to be simultaneously considered with the aggregate. We provide the associated asymptotic theory for estimation and inference. This is supplemented with Monte Carlo studies and two empirical applications which indicate the utility of our proposed model as a vehicle to model different types of cross-sectional dependence.

Flexible alternatives are Markov-switching GARCH and change-point GARCH models. They require estimation by MCMC methods due to the path dependence problem. An unsolved issue is the computation of their marginal likelihood, which is essential for determining the number of regimes or change-points. We solve the problem by using particle MCMC, a technique proposed by Andrieu et al. (2010).

Regardless of model misspecification, the proposed bootstrap achieves the same sharp magnitude of refinements as the conventional bootstrap methods which establish asymptotic refinements by recentering in the absence of misspecification. The key idea is to link the misspecified bootstrap moment condition to the large sample theory of GMM under misspecification of Hall and Inoue (2003).

At the same time, general budget support (GBS) has been increasing. GBS allows governments to set their own priorities, but little is known about how these additional resources are subsequently used. This paper uses cross-country panel data to assess the impact of GBS programmes on health spending in low-income and middle-income countries, using dynamic panel techniques to estimate unbiased coefficients in the presence of serial correlation. We found no clear evidence that GBS had any impact, positive or negative, on government health spending derived from domestic sources. GBS also had no observed impact on total government health spending from all sources (external as well as domestic). In contrast, health-specific aid was associated with a decline in health expenditures from domestic sources, but there was not a full substitution effect. That is, despite this observed fungibility, health-specific aid still increases total government health spending from all sources. Finally, increases in total government expenditure led to substantial increases in domestic government health expenditures.

The model is defined by y(t) = s(t) rho Yt-1 + epsilon(t), t = 1, ..., n, where S-t is an i.i.d. binary variable with p = P(s(t) = 1), independent of epsilon(t) i.i.d. with mean zero and finite variance. We say that the process y(t) is persistent if the autoregressive coefficient (rho) over cap (n), of y(t) on y(t-1) is close to one. We take p < 1 < p rho(2) which implies 1 < rho and that y(t) is stationary with infinite variance. Under this assumption we prove the curious result that <(rho)over cap>(n) rho(-1). The proof applies the notion of a tail index of sums of positive random variables with infinite variance to find the order of magnitude of Sigma(n)(t=1) y(t-1)(2) and Sigma(n)(t=1) y(t)y(t-1) and hence the limit of (rho) over cap (n) (p) under right arrow (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find a strong and significant intergenerational correlation that is robust to different covariate sets, sample restrictions, model specifications and potential endogeneity. Importantly, the intergenerational persistence is economically relevant, with maternal mental health associated with lasting effects on the child's educational attainment, future household income and the probability of having criminal convictions. These results do not disappear after controlling for children's own childhood and adulthood mental health. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Testing is not mandatory, but agents have to reveal their test results to the insurers, facing a discrimination risk. A costly prevention effort allows agents with a genetic predisposition to decrease their probability to develop the disease. We study the individual decisions to take the test and to undertake the prevention effort as a function of the effort cost and of its efficiency. If effort is observable by insurers, agents undertake the test only if the effort cost is neither too large nor too small. If the effort cost is not observable by insurers, moral hazard increases the value of the test if the effort cost is low. We offer several policy recommendations, from the optimal breadth of the tests to policies to do away with the discrimination risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While CCRCs have experienced significant growth over the last few decades, very little is known about the quality of care CCRCs provide. This paper is the first to rigorously study CCRCs on a national scale and the only study that focuses on nursing home quality. Using a national sample from 2005, we determine if the quality of post-acute care provided by CCRC nursing homes is superior to traditional nursing homes. To mimic randomization of patients, instrumental variables analysis is used with relative distance as an exclusion restriction to handle the endogeneity of the type of facility where care is provided. After adjusting for endogeniety, we find that CCRC nursing homes provide post-acute care quality that is similar or lower to traditional nursing homes, depending on the quality measure.

However, their interpretation may be complicated by differential patient survival rates. If patient characteristics are not perfectly observable and hospitals differ in their mortality rates, then hospitals with low mortality rates are likely to have a larger share of un-observably sicker patients at risk of a readmission. Their performance on readmissions will then be underestimated. We examine hospitals' performance relaxing the assumption of independence between mortality and readmissions implicitly adopted in many empirical applications. We use data from the Hospital Episode Statistics on emergency admissions for fractured hip in 290,000 patients aged 65 and over from 2003 to 2008 in England. We find evidence of sample selection bias that affects inference from traditional models. We use a bivariate sample selection model to allow for the selection process and the dichotomous nature of the outcome variables. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The Turkish government introduced 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) into the national immunization program in 2009. This suggests that replacing 7-valent PCV with a higher-valent version could at least maintain standard of care if not improve it, and that it could be affordable. Objectives and Methods: The aim of this analysis was to assess the potential direct cost-effectiveness of 13-valent PCV in Turkey, a country with a birth cohort of 1.4 million, against a no vaccine state, against the default 7-valent PCV state, and against a 10-valent PCV state, using a published cohort model with a 5-year horizon. Results and Conclusions: The cost per life-year gained is below the 1 x per-capita gross domestic product threshold across large changes in key input parameters, indicating that the model is stable and suggesting that any PCV would be very cost-effective in a Turkish national pediatric immunization schedule.","[Turel, Ozden] Bezmialem Vakif Univ, Dept Pediat & Pediat Infect Dis, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kisa, Adnan] Zirve Univ, Gaziantep, Turkey; [McIntosh, E.

Approximately 60% of all admissions occur through an emergency department, and bed competition from emergency admission provides one path by which waiting times for elective procedures may be lengthened. In this article, we investigated the extent to which public hospital waiting times are affected by the volume of emergency admissions and whether there is a differential impact by elective patient payment status. The latter has equity implications if the potential health cost associated with delayed treatment falls on public patients with lower ability to pay. Using annual data from public hospitals in the state of New South Wales, we found that, for a given available bed capacity, a one standard deviation increase in a hospital's emergency admissions lengthens waiting times by 19 days on average. However, paying (private) patients experience no delay overall. In fact, for some procedures, higher levels of emergency admissions are associated with lower private patient waiting times.

This article reports the proceedings of the Fifth Mount Hood Challenge in 2010. Methods: Eight modeling groups participated. Each group was given four modeling challenges to perform (in type 2 diabetes): to simulate a trial of a lipid-lowering intervention (The Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus [ASPEN]), to simulate a trial of a blood glucose-lowering intervention (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation [ADVANCE]), to simulate a trial of a blood pressure-lowering intervention (Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes [ACCORD]), and (optional) to simulate a second trial of blood glucose-lowering therapy (ACCORD). Model outcomes for each challenge were compared with the published findings of the respective trials. Results: The results of the models varied from each other and, in some cases, from the published trial data in important ways. In general, the models performed well in terms of predicting the relative benefit of interventions, but performed less well in terms of quantifying the absolute risk of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methodological challenges were highlighted including matching trial end-point definitions, the importance of assumptions concerning the progression of risk factors over time, and accurately matching the patient characteristics from each trial. Conclusions: The Fifth Mount Hood Challenge allowed modelers, through systematic comparison and validation exercises, to identify important differences between models, address key methodological challenges, and discuss avenues of research to improve future diabetes models.","[Palmer, Andrew J.; Mt Hood 5 Modeling Grp] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Res Inst Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Palmer, AJ (通讯作者)，Menzies Res Inst Tasmania, Med Sci 1 Bldg,17 Liverpool St,Private Bag 23, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia.",andrew.palmer@utas.edu.au,"Palmer, Andrew/J-7289-2014; Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/I-6766-2018","Palmer, Andrew/0000-0002-9703-7891; Willis, Michael/0000-0002-6565-7025; Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/0000-0002-0647-7817; Steen Carlsson, Katarina/0000-0002-2325-5634","Novo Nordisk A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark); Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (Beerse, Belgium); Medical Research Council [G0801042] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0509-10206] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0801042] Funding Source: UKRI","Novo Nordisk A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark)(Novo Nordisk); Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (Beerse, Belgium)(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","The organization of the Mount Hood 5 Meeting was supported by an unrestricted grant from Novo Nordisk A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark) and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (Beerse, Belgium).",,22,99,101,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16.0,4.0,,,,,670,685,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.01.002,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796302.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900027,0

Our approach is based on sample splitting by regular sampling of the original data at lower frequencies, so that standard techniques for testing independence can be used for each individual subsample. We then propose several alternative statistics that aggregate information across subsamples and investigate their asymptotic and finite sample properties. We apply our methods to test the predictability of excess returns in foreign exchange markets. We also illustrate how our serial dependence tests can provide useful information for identifying particular economic alternatives when testing the expectations hypothesis in foreign exchange markets.

Evidence from the English National Health Service,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Competition; Hospital; Inequality,SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; WAITING-TIMES; CHOICE; COST,"Increasing evidence shows that hospital competition under fixed prices can improve quality and reduce cost. Concerns remain, however, that competition may undermine socio-economic equity in the utilisation of care. We test this hypothesis in the context of the pro-competition reforms of the English National Health Service progressively introduced from 2004 to 2006. We use a panel of 32,482 English small areas followed from 2003 to 2008 and a difference in differences approach. The effect of competition on equity is identified by the interaction between market structure, small area income deprivation and year. We find a negative association between market competition and elective admissions in deprived areas. The effect of pro-competition reform was to reduce this negative association slightly, suggesting that competition did not undermine equity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, results may be sensitive to the assumed underlying survival function. Objective: To estimate the expected progression-free survival (PFS) for fulvestrant 500 mg versus alternative hormonal therapies for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who relapsed previously by means of a network meta-analysis of currently available randomized controlled trials using alternative underlying survival functions. Methods: Eleven randomized controlled trials were included that evaluated fulvestrant 500 mg (n = 3), fulvestrant 250 mg (n = 5), fulvestrant 250 mg loading dose (n = 3), anastrozole 1 mg (n = 3), megestrol acetate (n = 4), letrozole 2.5 mg (n = 3), letrozole 0.5 mg (n = 3), and exemestane (n = 2). PFS percentages and numbers at risk were derived from Kaplan-Meier curves and combined by means of Bayesian network meta-analysis on the basis of the difference in the shape and scale parameters of the Weibull, log-normal, and log-logistic parametric survival functions. Results: The log-normal distribution provided the best fit, suggesting that the proportional hazard assumption was not valid. Based on the difference in expected PFS, it was found that fulvestrant 500 mg is more efficacious than fulvestrant 250 mg, megestrol acetate, and anastrozole (-5.73 months; 95% credible interval [CrI] -10.67, -1.67). Expected PFS for fulvestrant 500 mg ranged from 10.87 (95% CrI 9.21, 13.07) to 17.02 (95% CrI 13.33, 22.02) months for the Weibull versus log-logistic distribution. Conclusions: Fulvestr-ant 500 mg is expected to be more efficacious than fulvestrant 250 mg, megestrol acetate, and anastrozole 1 mg and at least as efficacious as exemestane and letrozole 2.5 mg in terms of PFS among postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer after failure on endocrine therapy. The findings were not sensitive to the distribution, although the expected PFS varied substantially, emphasizing the importance of performing sensitivity analyses.","[Cope, Shannon; Jansen, Jeroen P.] MAPI Consultancy, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ouwens, Mario J.

Methods: Following a scoping review of the literature, a Rand Delphi consensus method was used to engage key interdisciplinary decision makers, clinicians, and cancer survivors in reaching consensus on a core patient-reported outcome domain taxonomy and outcome measures. Results: Of the 21,900 citations identified in the scoping review, 1,503 citations were included in the full article review (380 conceptual articles, 461 psychometric evaluation articles, and 662 intervention studies) and subjected to data abstraction and mapping. Final consensus was reached on 20 domains, related subdimensions, and 45 self-report measures considered relevant and feasible for routine collection in cancer by the Delphi panel (PROMS-Cancer Core). Conclusions: Standardization of patient-reported outcome data collection is key to assessing the impact of cancer and treatment on the person for population comparison and monitoring the quality of clinical care. The PROMS-Cancer Core taxonomy of domains and outcome measures can be used to guide the development of a patient-reported outcome information system for cancer.","[Howell, Doris; Mayo, Samantha; Mohammed, Shan; Doran, Diane] Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Howell, Doris; Green, Esther; Doran, Diane] Univ Toronto, Fac Nursing, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fitch, Margaret] Sunnybrook Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bakker, Debra] Laurentian Univ, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada; [Green, Esther] Univ Toronto, Canc Care Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sussman, Jonathan] Support Care Res Unit, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Sussman, Jonathan] McMaster Univ, Dept Radiat Oncol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Lee, Charlotte] UC Irvine Sch Nursing, Irvine, CA USA; [Doran, Diane] Univ Toronto, Res Unit, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Research Institute; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Laurentian University; University of Toronto; Cancer Care Ontario; McMaster University; University of Toronto,"Howell, D (通讯作者)，Princess Margaret Hosp, 610 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.",doris.howell@uhn.on.ca,"Sussman, Jonathan/AAQ-1588-2021; Howell, Doris/S-8927-2016","Sussman, Jonathan/0000-0002-7702-8816; Howell, Doris/0000-0002-0683-8715; Mayo, Samantha J./0000-0002-0083-5679; Mohammed, Shan/0000-0003-0889-2229","Canadian Association for Health Research, Knowledge Translation Institute","Canadian Association for Health Research, Knowledge Translation Institute","This study was supported by the Canadian Association for Health Research, Knowledge Translation Institute.",,78,48,51,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2013,16.0,1.0,,,,,76,87,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.10.017,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,077WN,23337218.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314060200010,0

Analysis of the most recent data containing independent measures of neighbourhood social capital shows that neighbourhood social capital appears to be associated with benefits in some aspects of individual health in the Welsh setting. The improvement stands beyond individual determinants and neighbourhood deprivation.

This study aims to provide a broad, cross-sectional indication of the extent and methods of public engagement in HTA, with a focus on which public are engaged, by what mechanisms, and the purpose of public engagement. Methods: An international Web-based survey of 217 organizations involved in HTA was undertaken. Contact e-mail addresses for targeted organizations were identified from the Internet. Results: Individuals from 39 (18%) of the contacted organizations completed a survey. The majority (67%) of responding HTA organizations undertake public engagement activities, predominantly involving lay representatives of organized groups (81%), and to a lesser extent individual patients/consumers (54%) or citizens/community members (54%). For organizations undertaking public engagement, mechanisms based on communication or consultation were the most common, although some organizations have used or intend to use participatory approaches, particularly the Citizens' Jury (8%) or Consensus Council (20%) methods. Respondents identified with a number of rationales and barriers for undertaking public engagement. Conclusions: This survey provides further insight into the public engagement approaches that are used by HTA organizations in practice. In particular, it suggests a limited adoption of participatory methods to date, and interest in the use of social media. Study findings require further confirmation, due to limitations related to survey response. There is considerable opportunity for further research into pragmatic, robust, and meaningful approaches to public engagement to strengthen HTA policy and decision-making frameworks. An agenda for future research evolving from the survey responses is proposed.","[Whitty, Jennifer A.] Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Sch Med, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia; [Whitty, Jennifer A.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Hlth Inst, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus; Menzies Health Institute Queensland; Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus,"Whitty, JA (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Sch Med, Univ Dr, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia.",j.whitty@griffith.edu.au,"Whitty, Jennifer A/N-6434-2013","Whitty, Jennifer A/0000-0002-5886-1933","Griffith University; Queensland Government Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation; Queensland Health","Griffith University(Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus); Queensland Government Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation; Queensland Health","This study was funded by a Griffith University New Researcher Grant and a Smart Futures Fellowship award from the Queensland Government Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation, Queensland Health and Griffith University.",,41,44,47,0,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2013,16.0,1.0,,,,,155,163,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.09.011,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,077WN,23337227.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314060200019,0

Methods: The study consisted of two phases: scale construction and scale validation. For the item-generation phase, a summary of the literature combined with qualitative results from item-generation interviews with 29 acute or chronic leukemia patients and 16 health care providers yielded an initial item pool reflecting leukemia-specific concerns and symptoms. Items underwent iterations of review and reduction according to defined retention criteria to support content validity, as defined by priority concerns of patients. Seventeen final leukemia-specific items were combined with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General to create the FACT-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) scale. For the validation phase, 79 individuals with acute or chronic leukemia completed questionnaires at three time points. Results: All FACT-Leu subscale and aggregated scores showed high internal consistency as ranging from 0.75 to 0.96). Test-retest reliability was adequate for all subscales (intraclass correlation range 0.765-0.890). The FACT-Leu scale demonstrated good convergent validity, with significant correlations with quality-of-life criteria and performance status, in the expected direction. FACT-Leu subscale scores were significantly different among the three performance status change groups, suggesting good responsiveness to change. Conclusions: The FACT-Leu scale is a valid, reliable, and efficient measure of leukemia-specific health-related quality of life for acute and chronic disease.","[Cella, David; Jensen, Sally E.; Webster, Kimberly; Lai, Jin-Shei; Yount, Susan] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med Social Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Cella, David; Lai, Jin-Shei; Rosen, Steven; Yount, Susan] Northwestern Univ, Robert H Lurie Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Du, Hongyan] NorthShore Univ HealthSyst, Ctr Clin Res Informat, Evanston, IL USA; [Jensen, Sally E.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Surg, Div Organ Transplantat, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Tallman, Martin S.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Leukemia Serv, New York, NY 10021 USA",Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Ann & Robert H.

Previous econometric studies of specialty choice from the US suggest that although income plays a role, other non-pecuniary factors may be important. This paper presents a novel application of a choice experiment to identify the effects of expected future earnings and other attributes on specialty choice. We find the implied marginal wage estimated from our discrete choice model is close to the actual wages of senior specialists, but much higher than those of senior GPs. In a policy simulation we find that increasing GPs' earnings by $50,000, or increasing opportunities for procedural or academic work can increase the number of junior doctors choosing general practice by between 8 and 13 percentage points. The simulation implies an earnings elasticity of specialty choice of 0.95. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The requirements of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and other agencies together with the increasing use of patient-reported outcome measures has led to an increase in the demand for PBMs. Recently, interest has grown in developing new PBMs and while previous research on PBMs has mainly focused on the methods of valuation, research into the methods of developing descriptive systems is an emerging field. Results: Traditionally, descriptive systems of PBMs were developed by using top-down methods, where content was derived from existing measures, the literature, or health surveys. A contrasting approach is a bottom-up methodology, which takes the views of patients or laypeople on how their life is affected by their health. This approach generally requires the use of qualitative methods. Qualitative methods lend themselves well to the development of PBMs. They also ensure that the measure has appropriate language, content validity, and responsiveness to change. While the use of qualitative methods in the development of non-PBMs is fairly standard, their use in developing PBMs was until recently nonexistent Conclusions: In this article, we illustrate the use of qualitative methods by presenting two case studies of recently developed PBMs, one generic and one condition specific. We outline the stages involved, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, and compare with the top-down approach used in the majority of PBMs to date.","[Stevens, Katherine] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Palfreyman, Simon] NHS Fdn Trust, Sheffield Teaching Hosp, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; University of Sheffield,"Stevens, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",K.Stevens@Sheffield.ac.uk,"Palfreyman, Simon/O-4418-2015; Stevens, Katherine/E-4679-2010","Palfreyman, Simon/0000-0002-5927-1951; Stevens, Katherine/0000-0002-9018-6413",,,,,56,42,51,0,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15.0,8.0,,,,,991,998,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.08.2204,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244799.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300001,0

A data-dependent moment selection method based on minimizing the approximate mean squared error is developed. In addition, a new version of the GMM estimator based on kernel-weighted moment conditions is proposed. It is shown that kernel-weighted GMM estimators can reduce the asymptotic bias compared to standard GMM estimators. Kernel weighting also helps to simplify the problem of selecting the optimal number of instruments. A feasible procedure similar to optimal bandwidth selection is proposed for the kernel-weighted GMM estimator. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A tax contract specifies a range of tax rates a party is committed to if in government. We develop a new model of party competition and formation of the government which chooses tax rates, public-good provision, and perks. We show that the introduction of tax contracts has two effects: a perks effect and a policy-shift effect. The former plays a central role in societies with a low degree of political polarization, where it tends to reduce politicians' perks. In highly polarized societies, tax contracts can yield more moderate political outcomes. However, there exist circumstances in which tax contracts induce more extreme policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The AIC criterion is inconsistent and its limit distribution is given.

However, IVF's expense may prevent many couples from receiving treatment, and those who are treated may take an overly aggressive approach to reduce the probability of failure. Aggressive treatment, which occurs through an increase in the number of embryos transferred during IVF, can lead to medically dangerous multiple births. We evaluated the principle policy proposalinsurance mandatesfor improving IVF access and outcomes. We used data from US markets during 19952003 to show that broad insurance mandates for IVF result in not only large increases in treatment access but also significantly less aggressive treatment. More limited insurance mandates, which may apply to a subset of insurers or provide weaker guidelines for insurer behavior, generally have little effect on IVF markets.

Accordingly, these characteristics may be indistinctly represented by achievements or shortfalls. A difficulty arises when inequality needs to be assessed. One may focus either on achievements or on shortfalls but the respective inequality rankings may lead to contradictory results. In this note we propose a procedure to define indicators that measure equally the achievement and shortfall inequality. Specifically, we derive measures which are invariant under ratio-scale or translation transformations, and a decomposable measure is also obtained. As the indicators proposed depend on the distribution bounds, families of indices that guarantee the same inequality rankings regardless of the distribution maximal levels are identified.

We test for the existence of customization in physicians' prescribing for bipolar disorder, using data from a naturalistic clinical effectiveness trial of bipolar disorder treatment (STEP-BD), which did not constrain physician prescribing. Multinomial logit is used to model the physician's choice among five combinations of drug classes. We find that our observed measure of the patient's clinical status played only a limited role in the choice among drug class combinations, even for conditions such as mania that are expected to affect class choice. However, treatment of a patient with given characteristics differed widely depending on which physician was seen. The explanatory power of the model was low. There was variation within each physician's prescribing, but the results do not suggest a high degree of customization in physicians' prescribing, based on our measure of clinical status.

Based on product-level data, we find evidence that the profit-seeking behavior of the medical providers in the prescription drug market transfers the force of competition from the unregulated wholesale market to the regulated retail market and hence market competition still plays an important role in the determination of the regulated price. We also find that the profit-seeking behavior plays a similar role to advertising in that it increases the brand loyalty and hence lowers price elasticity. An important implication of our study is that the institutional features in the pharmaceutical market matter in shaping the nature of pharmaceutical competition and the responsiveness of pharmaceutical consumption with respect to changes in price.

Methods: A systematic review was conducted, and a Bayesian meta-regression approach was used to establish the relative effectiveness of eplerenone and spironolactone by using evidence from randomized controlled trials. A decision analytic model was developed to assess the costs and consequences associated with the primary outcome of the trials over a lifetime time horizon. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of eplerenone compared with that of standard care alone was (sic)4457 and (sic)7893 for each additional quality-adjusted life-year when 2-year and lifetime treatment duration was assumed, respectively. In both scenarios, spironolactone did not appear cost-effective compared with eplerenone. The results were sensitive to the higher relative effectiveness estimated for eplerenone compared with spironolactone from the meta-regression. When a class effect was assumed for the effect on mortality and hospitalizations, spironolactone emerged as the most cost-effective treatment. Conclusions: Eplerenone appears more cost-effective than spironolactone for the treatment of post-MI HF. These findings, however, remain subject to important uncertainties regarding the effects of treatment on major clinical events. An adequately powered, well-conducted randomized controlled trial that directly compares spironolactone and eplerenone may be required to provide more robust evidence on the optimal management of post-MI HF. Despite these uncertainties, the use of an aldosterone antagonist was consistently demonstrated to be a highly cost-effective strategy for the management of post-MI HF in the National Health Service.","[McKenna, Claire; Walker, Simon; Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Lorgelly, Paula] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Fenwick, Elisabeth] Univ Glasgow, Sect Hlth Policy & Publ Hlth, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Burch, Jane; Suekarran, Sara; Harden, Melissa; Wright, Kath; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Bakhai, Ameet] Barnet Gen Hosp, Barnet, Herts, England; [Bakhai, Ameet] AMORE Hlth Ltd, Pinner, England; [Witte, Klaus] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Witte, Klaus] Leeds Gen Infirm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; Monash University; University of Glasgow; University of York - UK; University of Leeds; Leeds General Infirmary; University of Leeds,"McKenna, C (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",claire.mckenna@york.ac.uk,"Lorgelly, Paula K/B-5400-2012; Wright, Kath/P-1516-2019","Witte, Klaus/0000-0002-7146-7105; Lorgelly, Paula/0000-0002-8990-9514; Walker, Simon Mark/0000-0002-5750-3691; Wright, Kath/0000-0002-9020-1572",National Institute for Health Research,National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Program.

Methods: Estimates of direct cost savings from LAGB were available from the literature. Although longitudinal data on indirect cost savings were not available, these estimates were generated by quantifying the relationship between medical expenditures and absenteeism and between medical expenditures and presenteeism (reduced on-the-job productivity) and combining these elasticity estimates with estimates of the direct cost savings to generate total savings. These savings were then combined with the direct and indirect costs of the procedure to quantify net savings. Results: By including indirect costs, the time to breakeven was reduced by half a year, from 16 to 14 quarters. After 5 years, net savings in medical expenditures from a gastric banding procedure were estimated to be $4970 (+/-$3090). Including absenteeism increased savings to $6180 (+/-$3550). Savings were further increased to $10,960 (+/-$5864) when both absenteeism and presenteeism estimates were included. Conclusions: This study presented a novel approach for including absenteeism and presenteeism estimates in cost-benefit analyses. Application of the approach to gastric banding among surgery- eligible obese employees revealed that the inclusion of indirect costs and cost savings improves the business case for the procedure. This approach can easily be extended to other populations and treatments.","[Finkelstein, Eric A.] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Singapore 169857, Singapore; [Allaire, Benjamin T.] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [DiBonaventura, Marco daCosta] Kantar Hlth, Hlth Sci Practice, New York, NY USA; [Burgess, Somali M.] Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, Global Hlth Outcomes Strategy & Res, Irvine, CA 92715 USA",National University of Singapore; Research Triangle Institute; AbbVie; Allergan,"Finkelstein, EA (通讯作者)，Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, 8 Coll Rd, Singapore 169857, Singapore.",eric.finkelstein@duke-nus.edu.sg,,"Finkelstein, Eric/0000-0001-6443-9686; Allaire, Benjamin/0000-0002-7033-2129","Allergan, Inc.","Allergan, Inc.(AbbVieAllergan)","This research was supported by Allergan, Inc.",,14,14,16,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2012,15.0,2.0,,,,,299,304,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.12.004,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,914DZ,22433761.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301930600011,0

This study used horizon scanning or early awareness and alert activity as a novel measure of innovation to determine whether new and emerging health technologies reported by international horizon scanning agencies reflected diseases constituting the greatest burden. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of the 20 member agencies of EuroScan (the International Information Network on New and Emerging Health Technologies), representing 17 developed countries. Burden of disease was defined as disability-adjusted life-years, taken from the 2004 World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease estimates. This analysis focused on 102 specific diseases within 21 broader groups. Horizon scanning output was measured as the number of technologies reported by EuroScan member agencies between 2000 and 2009. Results: At best there was a weak association between innovation and burden of disease. An apparent high-level association was dependent on just three high-prevalence disease groups: malignant neoplasms, neuropsychiatric conditions, and cardiovascular disease. Disaggregating broader groups into specific diseases further weakened the association. Innovation is disproportionately strong in cancer and nonischemic heart disease and disproportionately weak in mental health. Conclusions: Innovations reported by early awareness and alert systems do not always reflect conditions accounting for the highest morbidity and mortality. The results do not support previous reports of a positive relationship between burden of disease and innovation, but accord with evidence of notable discrepancies among key groups. Factors other than disease burden drive innovation.","[Martino, Orsolina I.; Ward, Derek J.; Packer, Claire; Simpson, Sue] Univ Birmingham, Natl Horizon Scanning Ctr, Birmingham B15 2SP, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Martino, OI (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Natl Horizon Scanning Ctr, 90 Vincent Dr, Birmingham B15 2SP, W Midlands, England.",o.i.martino@bham.ac.uk,,"Packer, Claire/0000-0002-2549-6976; Simpson, Sue/0000-0001-8111-3709; Ward, Derek/0000-0003-0740-9741; Stevens, Andrew/0000-0003-2079-3397",National Institute for Health Research,National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),The study was undertaken as part of the research program of the National Horizon Scanning Centre (NHSC).

We addressed this gap by estimating two preference-based single index measures: the DEMQOL-U from the self-report DEMQOL (mild-to-moderate dementia severity) and the DEMQOL-Proxy-U from the carer-report DEMQOL-Proxy (all levels of dementia severity). Methods: We conducted valuation studies on 593 members of the general population (306 for the DEMQOL-U, 287 for the DEMQOL-Proxy-U) using the time trade-off elicitation technique. We then fitted a range of mean and individual-level multivariate regression models to the valuation data to derive preference weights for each measure. We applied the estimated weights to a large, clinically representative sample. Results: Mean observed time trade-off values ranged from 0.18 to 0.95 for DEMQOL-U and from 0.33 to 0.96 for DEMQOL-Proxy-U. The best performing models for each measure were main effects models estimated using individual-level data. DEMQOL-Proxy-U had inconsistent but insignificant coefficient estimates for one dimension. Models were estimated to remove these inconsistencies. Conclusion: Preference-based single index measures from DEMQOL and DEMQOL-Proxy for use in economic evaluation will enable economic evaluation using quality-adjusted life-years to be undertaken for people across the full range of dementia severity. Future research will examine how the utilities from each measure can be used and combined to populate cost-effectiveness models.","[Rowen, Donna; Mulhern, Brendan; van Hout, Ben; Young, Tracey A.; Brazier, John E.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Banerjee, Sube; Knapp, Martin] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Knapp, Martin] London Sch Econ, Personal Social Serv Res Unit, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Smith, Sarah C.; Lamping, Donna L.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1, England",University of Sheffield; University of London; King's College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Mulhern, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",b.mulhern@sheffield.ac.uk,"Banerjee, Sube/E-3757-2010; Young, Tracey A/A-4543-2010; Knapp, Martin RJ/G-3011-2011; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Young, Tracey/0000-0001-8467-0471; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Banerjee, Sube/0000-0002-8083-7649; Knapp, Martin/0000-0003-1427-0215; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063",National Institute for Health Research [07/73/01] Funding Source: researchfish; Department of Health [07/73/01] Funding Source: Medline,National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Department of Health,,,27,71,71,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2012,15.0,2.0,,,,,346,356,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.10.016,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,914DZ,22433767.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301930600017,0

Multilevel models were used to estimate health-related quality of life trajectories and assess factors associated with variations among trajectories, controlling for mortality effects and cohort membership. Four biennial cycles (1996/97-2004/05) of the Canadian National Population Health Survey were used. Information for 13,665 respondents, including those who were subsequently institutionalized and/or died, was used. A typical life-course trajectory was concave with a slow decline until the age of 60, followed by a more rapid decline. Receiving social assistance, lower education and not being married had significant negative impacts on trajectories for young (age 18-39) and middle-aged (40-64). Chronic conditions and health behaviours such as smoking were important for seniors (65+). It is important to focus on the most relevant and important determinants of health in each phase of life.

There is, however, limited evidence on whether they work in low-income countries, particularly when implemented at scale. This paper explores the impact of a national programme in Nepal that provides cash incentives to women conditional on them giving birth in a health facility. Using propensity score matching methods, we find that the programme had a positive, albeit modest, effect on the utilisation of maternity services. Women who had heard of the SDIP before childbirth were 4.2 percentage points (17 percent) more likely to deliver with a skilled attendant. The treatment effect is positively associated with the size of the financial package offered by the programme and the quality of care in facilities. Despite the positive effect on those exposed to the SDIP, low coverage of the programme suggests that few women actually benefited in the first few years. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Social welfare functions are parameterized by an altruism parameter generating the Benthamite and Millian criteria as polar cases. The economy considered is in continuous time and is populated by homogeneous cohorts with a given life span. Production functions are linear in labor, (costly) procreation is the unique way to transfer resources forward in time. First, we show that egalitarianism is optimal whatever the degree of altruism in perpetual youth model, that is when lifetime span is finite but age structure does not matter: in this case egalitarianism does not discriminate between the social welfare functions considered. Then we show that, when life span is finite but age structure matters, egalitarianism does not arise systematically as an optimal outcome. In particular, in a growing economy, that is when population growth is optimal in the long-run, this egalitarian rule can only hold when the welfare function is Benthamite. When altruism is impure, egalitarianism is impossible in the context of a growing economy. Either in the Benthamite or impure altruism cases, procreation is never optimal for small enough life spans, leading to finite time extinction and maximal consumption for all existing individuals, (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
