Results suggest that during 2009 interest rates on deposits stood higher than expected based on historical patterns. In the case of household deposits, the divergence has persisted until present, reflecting banks' efforts to increase their funding in the domestic market. The pass-through process appears to have normalized relatively quickly in the case of loans to non-financial companies, while interest rates on household loans remained above the levels predicted by previous behavior, given the deterioration in banks' risk perception towards this sector.","[Radu, Razvan] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,Razvan.Radu@bnro.ro,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2012,,,,,,,262.0,266,,,,,,5,Economics; Information Science & Library Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BDG67,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313136800049,0

This strategy had little effect on the development of rural areas of the country, thus a decentralised urbanisation strategy was introduced. The development of rural new towns in the frontier regions of the country and a more recent development of regional economic corridors are two significant strategies to reduce regional imbalance, attract investment and generate employment opportunities to all regions in Malaysia. This paper examines the regional economic development policy of the country and evaluates the strategies of developing rural new towns and urban economic corridor development. The findings from the analysis of these strategies indicate that the development of new towns has been slow due to a host of factors which are related to the planning and implementation aspects of development. Additionally, the impact of the corridor development to spread the distribution of economic growth to other parts of the regions has raised some issues and problems. This paper concludes that the development of rural new towns and urban economic corridors should to be properly planned based on principle of holistic development that encompasses urban-rural integration and spatial equilibrium.","[Salleh, Abdul Ghani] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Housing Bldg & Planning, Pulau Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,5,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,627.0,634,,,,,,8,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600054,0

Inflation expectations are discussed by Phillips as well. Contrary to Friedman, price expectations drive his system from the demand side but not from the supply side of the economy.

A performance-based contract is characterized by low term specificity (i.e. contractual incompleteness) and rewards being tied to performance. Based on an integration of transaction cost economics and agency theory we hypothesize how PBCs affect innovation. We argue that low term specificity, i.e., not stipulating how the partner should deliver the performance and which resources to use, enhances a partner's autonomy, which in turn fosters innovation. However, too low term specificity inhibits innovation. Furthermore, we state that tying rewards to performance positively affects innovation. This relationship is, however, negatively moderated by the partner's degree of risk-averseness.","[Sumo, Regien; van Weele, Arjan J.] Eindhoven Univ Technol, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [van der Valk, Wendy] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; Tilburg University,"Sumo, R (通讯作者)，Eindhoven Univ Technol, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",r.a.f.sumo@tue.nl; a.j.v.weele@tue.nl,"van der Valk, Wendy/E-6890-2011","van der Valk, Wendy/0000-0002-8581-1851",,,,,87,0,0,0,21,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,757.0,+,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500119,0

Levy processes offer the possibility of distinguishing jumps, diffusion, drift and the laxity to answer questions on frequency, continuity, etc. An important feature of normal inverse Gaussian-Levy (NIG-Levy) model is its path richness: it can model so many small jumps in a way that eliminates the need for a Gaussian component; hence, limitations arising from Gaussian based models are almost eliminated. Secondly, the characteristics listed above are reflected in the Levy triplet and are easily introduced in the modeling picture through estimated Levy parameters. Thirdly, knowledge of NIG-Levy parameters enables us to use NIG-Levy models as underlying asset price models for pricing financial derivatives. We use the R open software to calculate Levy parameters for 12 Estonian companies and choose good NIG-Levy asset price models by the method proposed by Kaarik and Umbleja (2011). We observe that not all financial data of Estonian companies trading on the Tallinn Stock Exchange between 01 Jan 2008 - 01 Jan 2012 can be effectively modeled by NIG-Levy process, despite having Levy parameters.

We conducted a survey through face-to-face interviews in Andalusia (southern Spain) with 439 consumers of olive oil. The consumers' preferences were estimated using the conjoint analysis (CA). Furthermore, market segmentation was also performed through a cluster analysis. The results indicate that price and origin labelling (PDO label) are the attributes that most affect consumers' preferences. Four consumer segments were identified, two of which concern liking the origin label.","[Erraach, Yamna; Sayadi, Samir; Parra-Lopez, Carlos] Andalusian Inst Agr Res & Training IFAPA, Dept Agr Econ & Sociol, Granada 18080, Spain; [Cristina Gomez, Ana] Univ Cordoba, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Policy, E-14080 Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba,"Erraach, Y (通讯作者)，Andalusian Inst Agr Res & Training IFAPA, Dept Agr Econ & Sociol, POB 2027, Granada 18080, Spain.",,"Parra-López, Carlos/A-7730-2008; Sayadi, Samir/C-2954-2016","Parra-López, Carlos/0000-0003-4923-4169;","Andalusian Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise [SEJ-03121]; Ministry of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment [AGR7431]; Institute of Agricultural Research and Training (LFAPA)","Andalusian Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise; Ministry of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment; Institute of Agricultural Research and Training (LFAPA)","The authors would like to recognise the financial support of this research to the Andalusian Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise through the project SEJ-03121 (MULTIOLI) and the Ministry of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment through the project AGR7431.

We also found that the perception of the parking charge was fairly heterogeneous, depending both on the drivers' income levels and whether or not they were local residents.

The primary objectives of this study are to (a) investigate the relationships between offline price dispersion and a company's performance, (b) examine the relationships between online price dispersion and a company's performance and (c) investigate the effect of price dispersion between offline and online channels on a company's performance. The findings show that a decrease in online price dispersion has a positive impact on a hotel performance. Therefore, to enhance hotel performance, hotel marketers should manage pricing strategies for multiple online channels; in addition, hotel companies should pursue rate parity policies across different online channels. Conversely, the results show a positive relationship between offline price dispersion and hotel performance. It is suggested that customization and bundling strategies for offline channels enhance the overall profitability of hotels. The findings advance knowledge of consumers' purchasing behaviour and sellers' pricing strategies.","[Kim, Woo Gon; Cho, Meehee] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dedman Sch Hospitality, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Kim, Daekwan] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Mkt, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Shin, Geon-Cheol] Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul 130701, South Korea",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Kyung Hee University,"Cho, M (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dedman Sch Hospitality, 288 Champ Way,UCB 4100, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",wkim@business.fsu.edu; mcho3@fsu.edu; dkim@business.fsu.edu; gcshin@khu.ac.kr,"Kim, Daekwan/AAE-4940-2020; Shin, Geon-Cheol/AHE-7221-2022","Shin, Geon-Cheol/0000-0002-1575-7247; Kim, Daekwan/0000-0003-3427-2410; Cho, Meehee/0000-0001-9097-173X; Kim, Woo Gon/0000-0002-5898-7528",,,,,110,17,18,2,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The total least squares are applied to estimate the conditional expected payoff to the option holder from continuation, and the quasi-Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the paths of stock prices. We show that the approximations of a set of conditional expectation functions in the TLSQM method converge to the true expectation function under general assumptions. It provides the mathematical foundation for the use of the TLSQM method in the derivatives research. In order to illustrate the high efficiency of the proposed approach, several examples are given to price American barrier options using TLSQM, LSM, and binomial trees, respectively. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the TLSQM method is accurate, and it makes improvements in computational speed and efficiency, compared with the LSM method.","[Zhang, Lihua] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weiguo; Xu, Weijun] S China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xiang] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA",Zhejiang University of Technology; South China University of Technology; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Xu, WJ (通讯作者)，S China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lihzhang23@gmail.com; wgzhang@scut.edu.cn; xuwj@scut.edu.cn; soar_shi@yahoo.com,"xu, wei/HHD-2891-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [70825005, 71171086]; National Social Science Foundation of China [11ZD156]; New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-10-0401]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 70825005, 71171086), National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 11&ZD156) and New Century Excellent Talents in University (No. NCET-10-0401).",,28,4,5,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Correlation between the discrete (number of vehicles) and the continuous (total annual miles traveled) parts is captured with a full variance-covariance matrix of the unobserved factors. The model system is estimated using Simulated Log-Likelihood methods on data extracted from the 2009 US National Household Travel Survey and a secondary dataset on vehicle characteristics.

This article presents a case study of the strategic use of industrial recruitment to build out North Carolina's biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry. This case study helps shed light on how recruitment practices can be designed and improved to support continued manufacturing job growth, but in ways that also limit the recruitment of potentially footloose establishments. As such, it presents an alternative perspective to recent studies of industrial recruitment that focus narrowly on efforts to limit or curb locational incentives for industry attraction.","Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Lowe, NJ (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, 303 New East Bldg,CB 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",nlowe@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,51,13,16,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The comparison reveals that the MIP performs better than the Fund's surveillance in terms of the provision of clear and practical advice, knowledge of domestic polities and ease of activating sanctions. Neither the MIP nor the IMF, however, provide for mechanisms to prevent political considerations from interfering with the activation of sanctions and the distribution of the burden of adjustment. The MIP also does not attenuate problems of asymmetric treatment that create the conditions for public backlashes. Its single-country focus and the limited integration of macroeconomic and financial analysis are further factors that may undermine the effectiveness of the MIP. In the conclusions, the paper reflects on the factors that may help explain the limited incorporation of the lessons available from the Fund's experience into the MIP.","[Moschella, Manuela] Univ Turin, I-10125 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Moschella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Culture Polit & Soc, Lungo Dora Siena 100, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",manuela.moschella@unito.it,,,,,,,45,30,30,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

If important missing variables are determined using common factors that can influence between-team attendance, the attendance function can be estimated by a panel factor model. Our results indicate that the determinants of fans' attendance decisions have changed over time. In earlier years (1904-1957), the home team's win record was the only significant team characteristic influencing attendance.

The concept of fragmentation relates to how activities are spatiotemporally reorganized, by subdividing activities into smaller components that are then performed at different times and/or locations, in connection with ICT use. The association between ICT, activity fragmentation and travel relationships remains uncharted. Based on a two-day Dutch communication-activity-travel diary different associations between ICT use, paid work spatiotemporal fragmentation indicators and frequency of travel are specified and tested with Path Analysis Modelling accounting for sociodemographic and land use factors. The results demonstrate that the interrelationships between fragmentation, ICT and travel are quite complex. ICT and fragmentation apparently have a reciprocal relationship with mobile ICT use influencing the degree of spatial fragmentation whereas the usages of sedentary ICT are influenced by the degree of temporal fragmentation. Person-ICT attributes and ICT use mediate the participation in non-work activities, and can replace work and non-work travel. Fragmentation reduces work trips but at the same time restricts non-work personal travel possibilities and can reallocate time for leisure activity and travel. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We account for the variation caused by the collective impact of social, temporal and spatial choices of individuals to produce predicted space-time visualizations of activity participation. The focus is on how social contexts of an activity impact the temporal and spatial decisions regarding the activity locations and how this impact varies depending on activity types. A comparison across activity types and social interaction types is made among spatial patterns during a day. The CentreSIM dataset, which is a household-based activity diary survey collected in Centre County (Pennsylvania, USA) in 2003, provides very detailed social interaction information enabling the analysis of social, spatial and temporal aspects of activity participation. In this paper we use this information to develop a spatio-temporal interpolation method and demonstration based on kriging. In this way, we extract the dynamic social taxonomy of places from the behavioral information in the dataset and suggest how urban and transportation models can be informed from the dynamics of places by observing what is taking place (activities being pursued in the context of this paper) combined with what exists (business establishments) or what is available (businesses that are open). The method here can also be used to improve the design of urban environments (e.g., filling gaps in desired activity locations), manage specific places (e.g., extending the opening and closing times of businesses), study transportation policies that are sensitive to time of day (e.g., pricing of parking to discourage crowding and traffic congestion), and modeling of spatio-temporal decisions of social activities in travel demand models (e.g., to guide the development of model specification and representation of the space in which behavioral models are applied).

However, with land prices soaring, land has become a secure and profitable asset, which in turn has triggered land speculation. The ensuing bubble is detrimental to sustainable development. This paper examines the impact of China's land pricing system on land hoarding by local governments, who acquire and hold land as one form of China's land speculation. We first review the mechanism of land speculation; next, we analyze the institutional root of land hoarding by local governments in China; last, we investigate empirically the relationship between the magnitude of local governments' land hoarding and the land pricing system based on provincial level data from 1995 to 2010. The results indicate that land price is positive and significantly correlated with the magnitude of land hoarding by local governments. Their land hoarding behaviors have adapted to the progress of land reform and to changes in land market conditions. The instrumental variables (IV) estimation accounting for the possible endogeneity of land price generates more significant and pronounced effects than non-IV estimation. According to IV estimation, one yuan per square meter increase of land price could trigger local governments to hoard 40.8 ha more land annually and 163.1 ha more land cumulatively over the period 1995 to 2010; while according to non-IV estimation, the magnitude is 03 and 3.8 ha, respectively.

Even with much touting of the positive effects of inter-NGO cooperation on humanitarian outcomes, the extant literature offers us few insights into the determinants of this cooperation, especially in a cross-national framework. Drawing on both the current NGO literature and the larger cross-disciplinary literature on inter-organizational cooperation, I argue that both trust and opportunity are needed for inter-NGO cooperation. Trust in other organizations is highly dependent on governance structures within the state. Similarly, in the uncertain situation of humanitarian disasters and development work in non-Western states, security concerns and a lack of a coordinating leadership body can limit the opportunities of NGOs to collaborate. The presence of humanitarian state interveners can act to mitigate these concerns and provide NGOs with more opportunities to collaborate. Using a novel measure of NGO to NGO cooperation in non-Western countries, empirical results of this project largely support the hypotheses derived from this trust and opportunity framework.","Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Murdie, A (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, 315 Profess Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",murdiea@missouri.edu,"Murdie, Amanda/GQB-5152-2022","Murdie, Amanda/0000-0002-6459-0594",,,,,82,18,24,3,67,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

During the previous 10 years, Putin's rating had correlated closely with Russians' perceptions of the state of the economy. Yet the fall in his approval - from 79% in December 2010 to 63% a year later - occurred despite roughly stable economic perceptions. Comparing Levada Center polls from late 2010 and 2011, the paper explores both who (what types of respondents) grew disenchanted with Putin, and why (what issues or grievances prompted this switch). It finds that (a) the fall in support for the Kremlin - although faster among members of the creative class, women, the rich, and residents of provincial cities - was broad-based, occurring among all social groups examined; (b) attitudes toward immigration, the West, and Russia's international status, as well as assessments of public service quality, changed little during 2011; (c) Putin's declining popularity most likely reflected stronger - not weaker - economic concerns; although the proportion judging economic performance to be poor did not increase, those who saw economic weakness became much less supportive of the Kremlin. Russians appear to have increasingly blamed their political leaders for unsatisfactory economic and political outcomes.","[Treisman, Daniel] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Treisman, Daniel] Int Ctr Study Inst & Dev, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Treisman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",treisman@polisci.ucla.edu,,,,,,,20,37,44,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The upper level decision-maker tries to minimize the total system travel time under a budget constraint by optimizing both link-based credit charging and road capacity improvement, whilst at the lower level considering the users' route choice behavior through the generalized travel time including the travel time and the converted time from the value of credit charging for using the link. Therefore, this proposed model integrates the improvement of the urban road network according to improving the road capacity with the given budget constraint and decreasing the travel demand with the tradable credit scheme. After presenting a relaxation algorithm, the numerical experiments on the nine node network are illustrated. Analysis shows that the proposed model is efficient in mitigating traffic congestion according to the less total system travel time than the other ways compared in this paper. The tradable credit scheme offers the better combination of cost-effectiveness, administrative flexibility and distributional fairness comparing with congestion pricing. Moreover, this tradable credit scheme is revenue neutral. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper contributes to this debate by focusing on the shared beliefs, norms and rituals that hold a region together. Working between the New Regionalism literature and thinking on international regimes, this paper - to paraphrase Friedrich Kratochwil and John Ruggie - outlines the inescapable inter-subjective quality' of a region. This focus on inter-subjectivity seeks to improve on existing approaches that consider shared social structures as already fixed, and/or as autonomous constructs operating over and above regional actors. In order to appreciate how inter-subjective structures and regional agents interact with each other, the paper explores the social construction of Latin America. Specifically, it examines the politics of regionness - understood here in relation to identity, space and agents - to demonstrate how various regional actors operate within, and reconstruct, shared meaning. In so doing, it interrogates the practices that govern and continually produce the region.","Australian Natl Univ, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Emerson, RG (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Bldg 22, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",guy.emerson@anu.edu.au,,"Emerson, Ronald Guy/0000-0002-3863-0513",,,,,43,6,8,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Evidence from west European bailouts and east European markets,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Foreign bank ownership; Vienna Initiative; cutting and running; bank subsidiaries; financial crisis; European integration,,"Very high levels of foreign bank ownership in central and eastern Europe (CEE) gave rise to fears that the region would be vulnerable to 'cutting and running' during a financial crisis, whereby western parent banks would repatriate capital and liquidity to their home markets and abandon their CEE clients. Such fears were compounded by the economic nationalism of late 2008 and early 2009 in western Europe, as well as by west European bank bailout programmes that privileged home markets over foreign ones. Although CEE experienced a severe credit crunch in late 2008, compared to other financial and economic crises, western bank behaviour in CEE has not amounted to 'cutting and running'. While many experts credit the 'Vienna Initiative' for maintaining foreign bank exposures in the region, this paper argues instead that it was the deep form of financial integration to which CEE was subject that kept banks committed. Specifically, western banks' 'second home market' business model, in which capital moved east via foreign-owned bank subsidiaries as opposed to primarily via branches or cross-border lending, led to only moderate retrenchment from CEE.","Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Epstein, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",,,,,,,,77,43,44,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

A quantile regression approach was used to analyse the determinants of spending. The inclusion of environmental awareness as a factor that might influence spending behaviour is an advance on previous studies of determinants of spending, and this factor was found to increase spending significantly.

Traditional theories which describe movements of unemployment as fluctuations around a moving natural rate have been challenged by hysteresis theories. The question arises how one can discriminate between these competing theories. To this end, we estimate a time-varying parameter model of the unemployment rate for the US, UK, Germany, and France. The parameters of the model were estimated jointly by maximum likelihood estimation using the Kalman filter algorithm. When the moving natural rate model is tested against the alternative of a unit root process, the unit root hypothesis is resoundingly rejected. Among the determinants of the natural rate institutions that alter labour market incentives for workers appear to have been more important than institutions that affect labour demand.","[Srinivasan, Naveen; Mitra, Pratik] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India; [Mitra, Pratik] Reserve Bank India, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Reserve Bank of India,"Srinivasan, N (通讯作者)，Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Gen AK Vaidya Marg, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",naveen@igidr.ac.in,,,,,,,43,6,6,2,29,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The aim of this paper is to develop a demand trend change early warning forecast model (EWFM) for the city of Sao Paulo multi-airport system (SPMARs). For SPMARs the EWFM is based on the combination of leading indicators and alarms against possible occurrence of changes on trend component of the monthly number of domestic air passengers. A topdown induction procedure is employed to identify leading indicators to provide an interpretable prediction procedure to support the development of scenarios for future demand trend. Results show that changes on such demand trend are mostly associated to changes on the economic activity and six different scenarios were built combining the identified leading indicators. The EWFM was employed to assist managerial decision making for both short and long terms in order to evaluate different alternatives to prevent congestion delay occurrences and to support infrastructure planning.

A reverse first-price sealed-bid auction model is used to motivate broker pricing behavior. Confirming the model predictions, our empirical analysis shows that increased mortgage brokerage competition at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level leads to lower fees. The findings are robust to different measures of fees as well as different measures of competition. We also provide evidence that broker competition reduces mortgage origination fees on retail (nonbrokered) loans as well. In addition, our results indicate that pricing complexity is an important determinant of fees, and increased broker competition is associated with a higher probability of a loan being priced with transparency. Our results suggest that mortgage brokers increase competition and lower fees in the mortgage market.","[Ambrose, Brent W.] Penn State Univ, Inst Real Estate Studies, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Conklin, James N.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Ambrose, BW (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Inst Real Estate Studies, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",bwa10@psu.edu; jnc152@psu.edu,"Ambrose, Brent/C-8531-2017; Conklin, James/HKF-3240-2023","Ambrose, Brent/0000-0001-5977-3663;",,,,,43,16,20,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2014,42.0,2,,,,,363.0,421,,10.1111/1540-6229.12039,0.0,,,59,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,AH2NT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335958900004,0

The corresponding standard deviation in the two regimes is 5.60% and 0.30%, implying that LGR is more stable than HGR. The probability of the hotel industry staying in LGR (HGR) is 97% (66%) and the expected duration of HGR (LGR) is about 3 (39) months. Moreover, this study shows that the tourism market growth is significant in causing the hotel industry to stay in the HGR.

The deals are put together by banks, which can exercise strategic options over the risk put into the deals. The banks face a trade-off between the benefits of risk-taking now and future franchise benefits if the deal pays off. The key insight is a convex relationship between the value of the bank's equity position and the risk in the deal. Although there is a continuum of possible risk, banks choose either the highest or lowest levels of risk open to them. Changes in strategy are discontinuous and unpredictable; a history of low risk-taking may be a prelude to increased risk-taking later. Competition, to the extent of reducing franchise value, can lead to more risk-taking, as can more information in the market.

We disaggregate public expenditure into three categories and search for the corresponding private consumption multipliers. Our analysis is based on the estimation of a structural vector error correction model with quarterly non-interpolated data for the period 1981:1-2007:4. Initially, we estimate negative but barely significant effects on consumption of shocks to total public spending. Then, using the public spending breaking down, we find that while shocks to public wages crowd-out private consumption as predicted by neoclassical models, shocks to the non-systematic component of social spending and government purchases of goods and services generate a positive reaction, so to crowd-in private consumption. Thus, the qualitative and quantitative dimensions of fiscal multipliers on private consumption change across different public spending categories. Our findings suggest that any empirical support of competing theoretical models on the issue would benefit from a disaggregation of government expenditure, rather than focusing on the aggregate measure.","[Marattin, Luigi] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Salotti, Simone] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Oxford OX33 1HX, England",University of Bologna; Oxford Brookes University,"Salotti, S (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Wheatley Campus, Oxford OX33 1HX, England.",luigi.marattin@unibo.it; ssalotti@brookes.ac.uk,"Salotti, Simone/N-7916-2019","Salotti, Simone/0000-0003-1898-6683",,,,,45,5,5,1,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The study mainly finds that the EP's extension of powers by the treaties and non-treaty-based inter-institutional agreements has led it to become a legislative powerhouse, the work of which is concentrated in the less visible committees. This development, however, comes at the cost of the EP's function as a public arena of debate and conflict, with the big party groups mainly voting like a singular bloc in the plenary because decisions had already been agreed in the committees. In sum, increasing competences and workloads do not lead to more legitimacy and accountability.","[Kohler, Manfred] Austrian Fed Minist European & Int Affairs, A-1014 Vienna, Austria",,"Kohler, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Fed Minist European & Int Affairs, Burgerserv, Abt 5A 4, Minoritenpl 8, A-1014 Vienna, Austria.",manfred.kohler@bmeia.gv.at,"Kohler, Manfred/C-1076-2017",,,,,,52,8,10,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using a comprehensive panel of annual data for the 48 contiguous US states over the period 1945-2004, we find overwhelming evidence in support of threshold effects in the relationship between inequality and growth. Our analysis shows that while the effect of inequality on growth is significantly negative at lower levels of development, this effect diminishes along the growth process and then turns significantly positive at higher levels of development. Quantitatively, the coefficient estimates imply that when real income per capita is below the threshold of $12,140 (2004 US dollar), a one standard deviation increase in the share of income held by the top 1% of the population reduces the growth rate of real per capita income by 0.6479 percentage points. In contrast, when income per capita is above the threshold of $21,065 (2004 US dollar), a one standard deviation increase in the top percentile income share raises the rate of growth of real per capita income by 0.2561 percentage points.","[Lin, Yi-Chen] Tamkang Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan; [Huang, Ho-Chuan] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Tamsui, Taiwan; [Yeh, Chih-Chuan] Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Tamkang University,"Lin, YC (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Econ, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan.",ylin@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,36,8,8,1,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

In an exploratory study we have analysed what-if-scenarios within this regulatory framework to quantify the costs in attaining the TtW emission targets and possible impacts on the well-to-wheel (WtW) emissions of the EU's new vehicle portfolio. In particular, we analysed the introduction of electric drive vehicles (EDV) and shifts between car segments. We performed the what-if-scenarios on the basis of the monitoring data for CO2 emissions from new passenger cars in the EU that was further reprocessed to achieve a break-down per vehicle segment, enriched with cost information and well-to-tank (WtT) emission data. Our calculations show that under the assumption that there are no significant segment shifts towards smaller vehicles, a minimum share of 11% of EDV would be needed to comply with a stricter CO2 target of 70 g/km, as improvements on conventional cars cannot provide sufficient savings. Deploying the EDV allows a cost effective achievement of the regulatory TtW targets, but also leads to higher WtW emissions than the baseline under the assumption that the TtW targets are not overachieved. Public incentives would be necessary to increase the share of EDV in the portfolio. We calculated that the order of magnitude of these incentives would be in the range of scrappage schemes that have been recently witnessed in European countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To mitigate potential biases caused by measurement errors and omitted confounders, we employ climatic factors to instrument for malaria deaths.

The findings reveal strong evidence of cross-subsidization from non-aeronautical revenue to aeronautical charges. In addition, unit cost strongly correlates to airport charges and aeronautical fees are more expensive for hub airports and airports with higher international traffic. While the aeronautical fees for Southwest airports are cheaper, it is not evident for airports dominated by low cost carries in general. Finally, there is a substitution effect in the price setting of landing charges and terminal charges: a higher landing charge leads to lower terminal charge and vice versa.

Using a Bayesian vector autoregression with an uninformative prior we find that parameter uncertainty raises the annualized long-run volatilities of all three asset classes proportionally with the same factor relative to volatilities that are conditional on maximum likelihood parameter estimates. As a result, the horizon effect in optimal asset allocations is much weaker compared to models in which only equity returns are subject to parameter uncertainty.

This paper studies the importance of such influence, documenting trade linkages over the last two decades and quantifying spillover effects in a vector autoregression setting. We find that, after controlling for common external factors, spillovers from Brazil are only relevant for Southern Cone economies (especially Mercosur's members) and Peru, but not for the rest of South America, and these findings are consistent with the extent of trade linkages between these countries. We find also that spillovers can take two different forms: the transmission of Brazil-specific shocks and the amplification of global shocks - through their impact on Brazil's output. Finally, we also find suggestive evidence that depreciations of Brazil's currency may not have significant impact on output of its key trading partners.","[Adler, Gustavo; Sosa, Sebastian] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Adler, G (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2014,37.0,3,,,,,456.0,480,,10.1111/twec.12094,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AD7LK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333445200005,0

The absence of the expected result for the latter category can be due to a rapid increase in the supply of skilled labour, to outsourcing of skilled jobs or because changes in the trade flows are too small to have any significant effect in those countries.","[Bigsten, Arne] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Munshi, Farzana] BRAC Univ, Dept Econ, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of Gothenburg; Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee BRAC; BRAC University,"Bigsten, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,"Bigsten, Arne/0000-0002-4527-0819",,,,,27,6,9,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2014,37.0,3,,,,,501.0,510,,10.1111/twec.12128,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AD7LK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333445200007,0

Analyzing a novel data-set comprising 312 cases of illegal corporate raiding (reyderstvo) between 1999 and 2010, this article identifies a shift both in the regional and sectoral distribution of raids over time, as well as an increasing participation of state agencies in criminal raiding attacks. Using panel regression analysis to look at the determinants of increasing state involvement, this article shows that election results for the ruling president and his party, as well as the degree to which elections are manipulated throughout Russia's regions, are significantly and positively correlated with the number of raids in a given region, while regions with governors that have stronger local ties are characterized by a smaller number of attacks. A potential interpretation of these findings is that the federal center may tolerate a certain degree of predatory activities by regional elites, as long as these elites are able to deliver a sufficiently high level of electoral support for the center, with the effect being weaker in regions where the governor is interested in the long-term development of the regional economy.","Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Int Ctr Study Inst & Dev, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Rochlitz, M (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Int Ctr Study Inst & Dev, Moscow, Russia.",michael.rochlitz@gmail.com,"Rochlitz, Michael/K-6830-2015","Rochlitz, Michael/0000-0001-8652-8874",,,,,47,64,73,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Road pricing is one example of a theoretically well-developed transport policy measure that has proven notoriously difficult to decide and implement. There are however lessons to learn from practice on how to manage barriers to policy formation and implementation also within this field. Drawing on the congestion charging schemes implemented in London in 2003 and Stockholm in 2006, and the Swiss Heavy Vehicle Fee scheme implemented in 2001, this paper identifies a selection of strategies which appear to have supported the policymakers' capacity to implement effective road pricing schemes. Together, these three examples offer a sound empirical basis from which to infer a set of strategies for the formulation and implementation of politically-contentious road pricing packages addressing issues of measure combination, flexibility, legitimacy, communication, timing and organisational dynamics. While acknowledging the primacy of broader external and contextual issues, the conclusion is that taking inspiration from the strategies identified in this paper may increase the likelihood of successful policy package processes.

We use Finland as an example of the transformation process in which a welfare state form we call a cartel polity is shifting towards a corporate polity, a particular adjustment of the competition state. We conceptualise the corporate polity as a spatio-temporal fix under construction. The corporate polity is both an on-going process to build a corporation-inspired management model for the Finnish state and a novel state ethos that is underpinned by constant concern about the state's international competitiveness in front of 'nature-like' market forces, transnational investors and highly skilled labour. We propose that the imaginary of a corporate polity is endorsed by a discursive practice that constructs a ceaseless crisis condition in the Finnish state, through repetitive and mundane activities related to state governance. Through the empirical analysis, we single out four dimensions of the corporate polity: fiscal-managerial, digital, capacity-oriented and territorial. Finally, we provide brief reflections on the potential state transformations in the future.","[Ahlqvist, Toni] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Turku 20521, Finland; [Moisio, Sami] Univ Oulu, Dept Geog, Oulu 90014, Finland",VTT Technical Research Center Finland; University of Oulu,"Ahlqvist, T (通讯作者)，VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Itainen Pitkakatu 4,POB 106, Turku 20521, Finland.",toni.ahlqvist@vtt.fi; sami.moisio@oulu.fi,"Moisio, Sami/AAF-9886-2019","Moisio, Sami/0000-0002-9202-1380; Ahlqvist, Toni/0009-0006-9155-9441",,,,,117,55,56,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This paper analyzes the filmic adaptation of Steinbeck's work focusing on two main questions. 1. The novel's political content, which was definitely problematic for a Hollywood studio of the classical era. Steinbeck's ideas were 'tamed', but not betrayed, and the final result was a frankly left-wing movie. 2. The novel's style, which melts traditional narrative and experimental storytelling. In accordance with the Hollywood mode of representation, the movie ignores the novel's more avant-garde elements. But at the same time, Ford's film presents scenes that go beyond the canons of mise-en-scene and editing typical of classical cinema, melting harsh realism with expressionistic stylization.","Univ Turin, Dipartimento Studi Umanist, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Alonge, G (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Studi Umanist, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",giaime.alonge@unito.it,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Respondents were asked to rank thirteen motivation factors in the order of their importance. The findings indicated that interesting work and good wages were the most important factors for all students. The results suggest that future business persons are motivated by factors from many different categories.

Electronic business leads to optimization of operations and opportunities for faster and better decision-making. However, the growing need for new types of information and communication infrastructure increases the costs of doing business and is an important factor of competitiveness in the market. The objective of this paper is to investigate and analyse the application of Information and Communication Technology in the enterprises in Eastern Croatia. The authors analyse the possibilities and costs of the introduction and use of the leased information and communications infrastructure in eight cities of Eastern Croatia. They thereby use a range of scientific research methods (methods of analysis, comparison, induction, deduction, description and classification, etc.) as well as individual mathematical-statistical methods used for the analysis and ranking of certain parameters. In the paper, the enterprises are divided by size, and the analysis is done according to projected needs of companies based on the number of users and average requirements for services. The authors researched the costs establishment of enterprise and the cost of taxes, local taxes and other fees for each city separately. Based on the results the cost of infrastructure was calculated for each city.

I find that Hare is least vulnerable to strategic voting in general, whereas Borda, Coombs, approval, and range are most vulnerable. I find that plurality is most vulnerable to compromising and strategic exit (causing an unusually strong tendency toward two-party systems), and that Borda is most vulnerable to strategic entry.

In Cameroon it has been projected that in 2030, two out of three Cameroonians will live in cities. In response to this urban growth, there has been a growth in vegetable production within and around the cities. This survey analyzes the dynamics of the changes within vegetable production systems in what can be termed the rural-urban continuum. A survey was conducted among 150 vegetable producers in Bamenda, distributed equally to producers in rural, peri-urban and urban zones. The data were analyzed using SPSS. The results show that most vegetable producers (34.7%) are young (30-40 years of age). Gender parity between the vegetable producers is respectively 51.3% men to 48.7% women. The majority (48.7%) of respondents had reached a primary school level of education. Land tenure is high in rural and peri-urban zones, where more than 92% of the vegetable producers own their land, compared with 74% in the urban zone. Classifying vegetable production systems by typology showed that the further one moves from the urban centre, the more the cultivated surface increases. Thus, 88% of the respondents in the urban zone possess kitchen gardens with an area less than or equal to 500 m(2), whereas 76% of the respondents in the peri-urban zone own a vegetable farm situated close to their dwelling with an area between 1000-2500 m(2), and 48% the respondents in the rural zone own vegetable fields far from their dwelling greater than or equal to 2500 m(2) in size. In the rural and peri-urban zones respectively, 80 and 86% of vegetable producers sell more than 75% of their vegetable products, compared to 4% in the urban zone, where the vegetables are produced more for home consumption. The constraints of production vary from one zone to another along the continuum. In urban zones, land tenure is the main production constraint for 50% of vegetable producers, whereas in peri-urban and rural zones, the major production constraint is lack of access to agricultural inputs.","[Kamga, A.] GEF Small Grant Programme PNUD Cameroun, Small Grants, Cameroon; [Kouame, C.] World Vegetable Ctr, AVRDC, Ivory Coast, Japan; [Drescher, A.

As their index depends on the ordering of the variables in the underlying VAR model, they check robustness by computing the index for a small number of randomly chosen permutations, stating that it was impossible to explore the huge number of renumerations. Building on a new divide-and-conquer strategy, we provide an algorithm for swiftly calculating the spillover index's maximum and minimum over all renumerations. Using this new algorithm, we find that the true range of the spillover index can be up to three times as large as estimated by Diebold and Yilmaz.

We hypothesize that this apparently anomalous behavior is due to a combination of credit constraints and nonconvexities in production. In particular, the high-stakes nature of the gambles creates the potential for a farmer to undertake a productive investment that would normally be unaffordable and thereby move to a permanently higher level of income. We show that the degree to which farmers are willing to accept risk in return for this opportunity appears to relate in an intuitive way to their current agricultural production technology as well as the demographic composition of their household.","[Maertens, Annemie] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Chari, A.

Geographically, Vukovar is located in the heart of the Danube region, and this region, despite the large number of festivals, does not have any significant Danube oriented film festival.

This paper includes comparative strengths and weaknesses of the festival and methods for placing the festival at the level it deserves.

Diminishing returns of cash keeping in enterprises are the basic concept of his monetary analysis. Main results are an algebraic equation of exchange, the interaction between the monetary interest rate and the rate of return on real capital and finally a synthesis of an extended quantity theory and the production cost theory of money. The Nature and Essence of Money includes important elements of the development in monetary economics in the late nineteenth and the beginning twentieth century mainly influenced by contributions of Irving Fisher, Knut Wicksell and John Maynard Keynes.","Bundesminist Ernahrung Landwirtschaft & Verbrauch, D-53123 Bonn, Germany",,"Nellinger, L (通讯作者)，Bundesminist Ernahrung Landwirtschaft & Verbrauch, Rochusstr 1, D-53123 Bonn, Germany.",Ludwig.Nellinger@bmelv.bund.de,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,4,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Through comparative analysis of statistical data and of the trends in demand identified in the last year, through market research and considering carmakers strategies, we intended to obtain genuine information, which, if applied under uniform programmes, would determine the formulation of policies for sale ready to meet the new requirements of the automotive market. The auto industry has a huge impact in the economies of those countries where governments find ways to create a legislative framework, thus encouraging such business not only for manufacturers, but especially for buyers who are the only ones able to sustain sales recovery. The demand for cars is not to be treated only in general. It requires a structural analysis, due to all the transformations undergone in recent years which must be taken into consideration when designing specific products followed by adequate sales policies. In this paper we found that marketing and sales traditional tools were still used, products were generally still classic, with a range of gadgets adapted and attached, but without the necessary sparkle which to increase market's appetite for automobiles. It is now the time for new marketing strategies, for smart products with absolute technical novelties not only at an optional level, but also at the level of the automobile's structure.","[Stancu, Ion; Dragan, Hermina] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Stancu, I (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania.",,,,,,,,4,2,2,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,19.0,26,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900003,0

One recurring theme of many successful companies is that they establish 'why' (the purpose of their existence), followed by 'how' and 'what' they do to fulfill their purpose. The 'why' statement perhaps does not fit in with the mission or vision statement; therefore, a company's foundation statement becomes the umbrella mantra of its raison d'etre. Reframing 'how' a business operates and 'what' it shall provide needs to be reviewed continuously and innovatively. The continuous innovation process of successful companies is that they not only focus their attention on improving their product and/or service but across each aspect of the company. This paper will discuss successful companies that define the 'why' through their foundation statement, reframe often, engender an innovative culture, and thus pivot their company forward in a competitive global economy.","[Veckie, Edward Anthony] Unified Engn Com Corp, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Veckie, Edward Anthony] Unimatix Control & Automat Inc, Hamilton, ON, Canada",,"Veckie, EA (通讯作者)，Unified Engn Com Corp, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",eveckie@unifiedengineering.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,441.0,445,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600043,0

An important role in these change processes is played by the process of market segmentation according to the customers' requirements and shopping behaviour. Properly performed market segmentation then contributes to increased profitability of the company and of the entire value network. The methods used in segmentation are based on combinations of various segmentation criteria, which can be identified through an analysis of the customers' behaviour and the customers' requirement preferences. The most widely used methods of market segmentation include the cluster analysis. Her application within market segmentation is accompanied by two strategic decisions as follows: what criteria to use for input into the cluster analysis and how many clusters to discover. The decision on the used criteria is then connected with the question of the need to standardize variables, where literature takes different stands on this topic. Therefore, the paper specifies and discusses, using a particular example of segmentation, the problems relating to the use of attitude scales, including the method of standardization proposed by us. It shows and discusses the outcomes of the performed segmentation of the customers of chosen unbranded garages. The segmentation was performed from the point of view of perception of the importance of the chosen types of offered services when deciding about a repeated use of the garage services. It is based on the outcomes of primary quantitative research performed using the method of personal questioning involving 386 clients of the garages.","[Vlckova, Vladimira; Patak, Michal; Lostakova, Hana; Spitalsky, Ladislav] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Vlckova, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,"Patak, Michal/G-9285-2016; Vlckova, Vladimira/W-1868-2018","Patak, Michal/0000-0002-5025-8849; Vlckova, Vladimira/0000-0002-6271-7424",,,,,15,0,0,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,621.0,628,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800077,0

Parametric estimates of simple homogeneous coefficient convergence models suggest that there may be heterogeneity in emissions convergence across different subsamples of observations. The semiparametric models confirm that there is heterogeneity across countries in coefficient estimates; however, such heterogeneity does not appear to be substantial enough to qualitatively influence the estimates derived from the parametric models. Hence, I find that (i) the green Solow model is a robust framework for analyzing carbon emissions convergence and (ii) carbon emissions are converging across a large sample of countries. My results suggest that international agreements that assign pollution rights based on population levels may be agreeable to many nations.","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Delgado, MS (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",delgado2@purdue.edu,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Employment status is regressed on one of the following measures of fatness: BMI and waist circumference entered linearly as continuous variables and obesity as a categorical variable defined using both BMI and waist circumference. Controls for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics in childhood and physical, mental and behavioural health are also included. The regression results for women indicate that all measures of fatness are negatively associated with the probability of being employed and that the employment elasticity associated with waist circumference is larger than the elasticity associated with BMI. The results for men indicate that employment is not significantly associated with BMI and waist circumference when these are entered linearly in the regression, but it is significantly and negatively associated with obesity defined either using BMI or waist circumference as categorical variables. The results also indicate that the negative association between obesity and employment status is larger among women. For example, the probability of being employed for the obese category defined using BMI is around 8 percentage points lower for women and 5 percentage points lower for men. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Unrealizable Appreciation Gains due to Trading Constraints as the Solution to the Short-Term Disparity,REAL ESTATE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COMMERCIAL REAL-ESTATE; COMMON RISK-FACTORS; INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE; STOCK; MARKETS; INDEX; INTEGRATION; ECONOMIES; MOVEMENTS; SCALE,"This study addresses the short-term disparity between REIT returns and direct property returns, and argues that this phenomenon is due to the trading constraints in the direct property market imposed on REITs (the dealer rule). This renders REITs unable to time markets in order to realize short-term property appreciation profits, making REITs primarily a property income investment rather than a full property investment, and explains the observed disparity. Empirically, I find that REIT returns consistently reflect property income returns, but not property appreciation returns. This makes this study the first in the literature to find a consistent link between REIT returns and any portion of direct property returns at short time horizons, in the context of a linear factor model. I then set up a natural laboratory to test the trading-constraints explanation by examining the appreciation dependence of different types of REITs, which should be differently affected by the trading constraints. I find that returns to UPREITs, which are less affected by the constraints, have a stronger appreciation dependence than returns to regular REITs. I also perform a size test and find that large REITs, which are less affected by the constraints, have a stronger appreciation dependence than small REITs. When testing the effects of UPREIT and size characteristics simultaneously, I find a consistent UPREIT effect. I further find that Real Estate Operating Companies (REOCs), which are not subject to trading constraints, show short-term property appreciation dependence. These findings offer strong support for the trading-restrictions explanation.","Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Mühlhofer, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",tobias.muhlhofer@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,18,19,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,DEC,2013,41.0,4,,,,,814.0,857,,10.1111/reec.12001,0.0,,,44,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,273PU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328549000004,0

A flexible VAR approach is used to model macroeconomic growth, inflation, short rate and the yield spread. Then the term structure is built given restrictions implied by the no-arbitrage condition. Contrary to previously proposed macrofinance models of the term structure, the model suggested here explicitly accounts for financial and real spillovers between economies. As documented in the paper, foreign macroeconomic factors contain a lot of information about the domestic term structure of yields. Put to data, the model explains the dynamics of yields very well. It provides better out-of-sample forecasting results than the closed economy models. Openness induces more variability in the estimated term premia of yields with shorter maturities.","[Traczyk, Adam] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Traczyk, Adam] Helaba Invest KAG mbH, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Traczyk, A (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Junghofstr 24, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",adam.traczyk@helaba-invest.de,,,,,,,44,1,2,0,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The paper examines the evolution of Chinese IPE research on global finance and money and suggests that research in these issue areas appears to be reaching a turning point. The main empirical finding is that this shift in knowledge production has been induced principally by China's emergence as a financial force and the national developmental concerns this entails, as well as by the onset of the 2008-09 global financial crisis and the rise of the emerging economies' grouping. The growing Chinese scholarship on the IPE of finance and money is adding analytical depth and broadening Chinese IPE, particularly on the impact of financial globalization on developing and emerging economies. While such research will likely contribute to Chinese policymaking in the future, the scholarly test for Chinese IPE is whether and how it will contribute to filling the global knowledge gaps on the determinants of financial and monetary policy, and whether it will give rise to new understandings on global finance and money, especially the causes of international financial crises. Heretofore, much of the literature has been heavily policy-oriented and normative.","[Wang, Xin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chin, Gregory] York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",University of International Business & Economics; York University - Canada,"Wang, X (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,111,4,4,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

However, the issue of how representative they are of the returns on portfolios of commercial properties is an open issue. Our study addresses this topic by analyzing a sample of 12,427 repeat sales transactions between Q4 2000 and Q2 2011. We find that the aggregate real estate indices (Moody's REAL CPPI) do a good job of tracking real returns when portfolios of more than 20 properties are considered. At this level, tracking is somewhat less effective than our benchmark of the S&P500 and its component stocks. Compared to the average root mean squared deviation (RMSD) from one asset, randomly selected portfolios with 20 assets reduce the RMSD by 75 % for the S&P500 compared to 66 % for the aggregate index. These results suggest that the aggregate indices can be effective in hedging and evaluating the performance of direct real estate investment. We further find that tracking at the property type level provides little benefit over using an aggregate index. However, indexing using a property type and location matched index provides lower tracking error for any level of diversification.","[Boudry, Walter I.; Liu, Crocker H.] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Coulson, N.

While housing market research suggests that list prices can serve as a strong anchor and/or signal, list price information is included in less than one-third of the commercial property sales and is less likely to be included as part of the sellers' offering information for larger and more complex properties. Given the potentially powerful effect of list prices (first offers) on outcomes, the non-use of list price information is a puzzle. We speculate that the limited use of list prices may be due to the sellers' interests in both maintaining their informational advantage and not truncating higher than expected offers, especially during periods of economic growth or with more complex properties. Using a two-stage selection correction model, we find that office properties which provide list price information are, on average, associated with lower price outcomes (ceteris paribus) and that these outcomes vary by price cohort and economic condition. It is important to note, however, that while these findings identify a correlation, they do not necessarily imply causation. Our results support the notion that asymmetric information and information signaling play a dominant role in explaining the sellers' strategic non-use of list price information in the commercial real estate market and that the signaling effect is more pronounced in higher priced properties and during periods of strong economic growth.","[Gatzlaff, Dean] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Ctr Real Estate, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Liu, Peng] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ctr Real Estate & Finance, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Cornell University,"Gatzlaff, D (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Ctr Real Estate, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",dgatzlaff@cob.fsu.edu; peng.liu@cornell.edu,", erbfh/AAE-7959-2020",,,,,,35,9,9,0,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This implies spatially sensitive policy implementation capable of mobilising the potentials of all territories. However, the concept is vague. Moreover, in Poland this agenda is being launched in a context of entrenched territorial disparities, traditionally constrained policy implementation capacity and institutional change.

To avoid the holdout problem which is a typical consequence of such negotiations necessitates a good pricing strategy that meets the subjective valuation considerations of the owners and protecting property rights to warrant a fair and efficient outcome. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature that includes contributions from game theory in the form of Nash bargaining, Bayesian theory for incomplete information, auction theory and Mechanism Design which have individually enriched this field and proposed credible solutions. In this paper, we consider a setting that has a single buyer and N sellers. We take a Mechanism Design approach to study the assembly problem in a utilitarian framework, where we associate risk-averse utility functions with the sellers. Given a set of reserve prices reported by sellers, and their risk-aversion behaviour, we seek an incentive-compatible mechanism that simultaneously maximizes the sum of individual expected utilities while delivering a Pareto optimal per-seller penalty-reward structure. We show how this mechanism, inspired and adapted from the actuarial Risk Exchange concept in the Insurance industry, can be fruitfully applied to the land assembly problem, yielding an efficient and optimal solution to the holdout problem, while making very minimal demands on knowledge of sellers valuations.

The assessment is essentially qualitative, illustrated by static simulations of income effects for French professional farms. It uses the French case to highlight the diverging opinions between stakeholders on these proposals and argue why they are a step in the right direction but a too timid step as crucial issues are not adequately addressed. Furthermore several key parameters of the reform remain unknown, even after the European parliament decisions (January 2013). We first summarise the main elements of the proposals presented by the European Commission regarding the first pillar subsidies. We then highlight the main points that are subject to debate on the basis of French stakeholder reactions (public authorities, farmers' unions, food companies and non-governmental organisations). We finally propose an assessment of these proposals focusing more specifically on the redistribution of direct payments between countries and categories of farms.","[Chatellier, Vincent] INRA, SAE2, UR LERECO 1134, F-44316 Nantes, France; [Guyomard, Herve] INRA, UAR 233, Unite Coll Direct, F-75007 Paris, France",INRAE; INRAE,"Chatellier, V (通讯作者)，INRA, SAE2, UR LERECO 1134, F-44316 Nantes, France.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,6,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2013,12.0,3,,,,,11.0,19,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AG2VS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335275800002,0

In designing such programs, special attention must be paid to ensure that the drivers' behavioral responses to pricing are well understood. This is important because, if the analysts do not correctly predict users' reactions, policies and programs may fail to achieve their objectives. Knowledge of users' responses to pricing assists policy makers to design effective pricing programs. This paper investigates the behavioral impacts of time of day pricing using stated preference data collected from regular users of the New Jersey Turnpike. As part of the data collection process, the respondents were presented with hypothetical toll scenarios and asked how they would change behavior. Using these data, discrete choice models were estimated as a function of policy variables and respondents' socio-economic attributes. The final model shows that time of day pricing could induce changes in the payment method used to pay the tolls, route choice, and time of travel. It was found that the amount of the toll, total travel time, and schedule delay together with other socio-economic variables were important factors in determining which alternative a user would select. Market share analyses for basic toll scenarios were conducted to assess the overall impacts of alternative toll scenarios. Elasticities were computed for the key variables in the model. In its final sections, the paper discusses policy implications and chief conclusions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Can peculiarities of national wage-bargaining systems explain this situation? The article develops the idea that wage growth differentials across Europe are due to differences in wage-bargaining systems. It is demonstrated that wage growth in the exposed industry is restrained by competition. Spillovers from the exposed sector of the economy to the public sector thus can induce overall wage restraint. However, it is shown that spillovers from the exposed to the public sector differ according to the wage-bargaining system. Pattern-setting regimes lead to substantial spillovers and thus induce higher wage restraint than other wage-bargaining systems.","[Ramskogler, Paul] Oesterreich Nationalbank, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"Ramskogler, P (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Nationalbank, Foreign Res Div, Otto Wagner Pl 3, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",paul.ramskogler@oenb.at,,,,,,,34,7,7,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The distinction between common factors and idiosyncratic components using principal component analysis allows for the detection of cross-member cointegration and the determination as to whether national or international sources are responsible for the non-stationarity of money and its determinants. Indeed, the finding that the common factors are I(1) while the idiosyncratic components are I(0) indicates that cross-member cointegration may exist and non-stationarity in the variables is primarily driven by common international trends. Furthermore, it is found that the impact of income on money demand is positive, whereas it is negative for the interest rate, exchange rate and stock prices. Except for the income elasticity of money demand, all estimated long-run coefficients are larger for the common factors of the variables than for the variables themselves. This article provides evidence that the exchange rate is an important determinant of money demand, whereas the results for the stock prices are ambiguous. Finally, the results of a panel-based error-correction model suggest that several domestic money stocks converge to a common international equilibrium relationship between the common factors.","Univ Duisburg Essen, Ruhr Grad Sch Econ, Dept Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Dobnik, F (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Ruhr Grad Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",frauke.dobnik@uni-due.de,,,,,,,60,5,6,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Foster care can be seen as occupying a liminal position between the domains of work' and family', requiring management of the tensions presumed to exist between competing value systems. Through a review of research and policy developments, the relevant boundary issues are contextualized and explored, drawing examples from areas such as remuneration, taxation and benefits, employment status, work-life balance and the labour process. It is argued that while foster care shares the hybridity and ensuing tensions of care work more generally, the spatial and temporal integration of work and family and the high level of state regulation give them a particular intensity. In turn, this offers great potential for the study of work/non-work boundaries.

Sociological explanations argue that pay in such occupations is low because society undervalues women's work', while economic theory argues that this is due to scant requirements for specialized skills. This article sheds light over these debates by examining the impact of occupational feminization on wages in Britain and exploring the mechanisms that produce it, using innovative statistical models that account for both observable and unobservable skill. Results confirm that occupational sex-segregation explains a sizeable portion of the gender wage gap and that wages in female-dominated occupations are lower than wages in other occupations. Inconsistent with human capital theory, low pay in female-dominated occupations cannot be explained fully by low skill specialization or by observable or unobservable characteristics of their workers. Remaining wage penalties in such occupations are consequently taken as evidence of institutional devaluation of women's work'.","[Perales, Francisco] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Perales, Francisco] Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Perales, F (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Michie Bldg 9, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",f.perales@uq.edu.au,"Perales Perez, Francisco/F-9549-2014","Perales Perez, Francisco/0000-0001-7508-9431",,,,,47,36,37,3,61,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Numerous papers have empirically addressed this issue by estimating demand systems for alcohol and tobacco, and subsequently calculating cross-price effects. However, this traditional approach is often seriously hampered by insufficient price variation observed in survey data. We, therefore, suggest an alternative instrumental variables approach that statistically mimics an experimental study and does not rely on prices as explanatory variables. This approach is applied by means of German survey data. Our estimation results suggest that a reduction in tobacco consumption results in a moderate reduction in alcohol consumption. It is demonstrated that this implies that alcohol and tobacco are complements. Hence, we conclude that successful anti-smoking policies will not result in the unintended side-effect of an increased (ab)use of alcohol.","[Tauchmann, Harald; Schmidt, Christoph M.] RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Tauchmann, Harald] CINCH Hlth Econ Res Ctr, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Requate, Till] Univ Kiel, Inst VWL, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Schmidt, Christoph M.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, IZA CEPR, D-45128 Essen, Germany",University of Kiel; Ruhr University Bochum,"Tauchmann, H (通讯作者)，RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",harald.tauchmann@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,42,31,34,1,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Estonia was the first post-communist country to introduce a currency board in 1992, and consecutive governments have systematically prioritized macroeconomic stability and fiscal prudence. Estonia implemented an internal devaluation in 2008-2009, which enabled it to become the first post-Soviet republic to adopt the euro in 2011. This article explores the origins of the currency board and shows how institutions, interests, and ideas have contributed to Estonian exceptionalism in macroeconomic policy and to euro adoption.

The EU's role in EU CSR has changed from social-liberal standard-setter to neo-liberal cheerleader and back. This article attempts to explain these shifts. It argues that Europe's institutional diversity hampers standard-setting while economic crises and declining levels of business legitimacy facilitate it. Contention has been fuelled by CSR's inherent ambiguity: is CSR a means to regulate the economy, or a domain of voluntary activity that must remain free of state regulation? Fearful of regulation, business groups - German employers in particular - have forcefully advocated the latter view. In addition to converting EU CSR from social-liberal to neo-liberal, business has neutralized two of the Commission's standard-setting advocates. The financial crisis, the power of arguments and discourse, and the impact of global policy developments in the field of CSR have re-empowered standard-setters. The article concludes with a critical analysis of the EU's renewed CSR strategy and non-financial reporting agenda.","[Kinderman, Daniel] Univ Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Kinderman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",kindermd@udel.edu,"Kinderman, Daniel/I-2695-2019","Kinderman, Daniel/0000-0003-2874-4549",,,,,37,34,38,1,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

But how do they affect regional growth within states? Using Baden's 1836 entry into the Zollverein, the customs union of German states, I investigate the internal impact of a change in tariffs. With a new data set of regional employment data I demonstrate that the Zollverein had a substantial positive effect. Two market access effects are shown, one follows the standard market access predictions and the second triggers the direct investment by Swiss entrepreneurs in German regions close to their home base. Furthermore occupational change within the crafts sector was shifting labour towards higher taxed occupations and towards the region close to Switzerland. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This article empirically assesses the responsiveness of local decision makers to a state-mandated permitting process that may require them to ignore or override locally adopted land use regulations. I develop a screening model to formalize expectations about permitting outcomes between developers, who hold private information about their projects, and local Zoning Boards of Appeal under the rules of the Massachusetts law known as Chapter 40B. I then analyze a novel data set of 40B permit applications made during the period 1999-2005. I examine summary statistics and estimate a bivariate probit model with selection in order to jointly evaluate the determinants of local permit approvals and developer acceptances of permits. I find that, in general, local institutions comply with the state-mandated permitting process and that permits granted to developers typically result in housing production. I also find that information asymmetries and community characteristics influence the success of the permitting process in a manner consistent with this study's screening model.","Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Sch Business, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Fisher, LM (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Sch Business, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",Lynn_Fisher@kenan-flagler.unc.edu,,,,,,,10,6,8,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2013,41.0,2,,,,,418.0,447,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2012.00340.x,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,165HD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320473300007,0

We exploit differences in the size of the total transfer received based on timing of birth to identify the causal effects of interest. Specifically, individuals born late in a quarter receive a larger total transfer than comparable individuals born early in the following quarter. We find that the transfer increases the labor market participation of youth and the number of months worked. The estimated effect is larger for individuals from low-income families. The results suggest that some youths are borrowing constrained. Since we find no evidence of corresponding effects on academic performance, alleviating the constraint appears only to affect consumption decisions and not human capital investment.

Aside from the facts that the BRIC countries have been ready to depart from the Washington consensus on certain key elements (state intervention), while maintaining other aspects (fiscal discipline), there isn't much support for the notion that these countries somehow share specific development strategies. If anything, the papers in this special issue show that these four countries have rather different etiologies of growth. The notion of BRICs, I argue, is thus better apprehended through its symbolic and political dimensions, as an effort by well-placed actors in the financial markets to drum up excitement about investment opportunities, as well as reorient the governance structures of the world economy away from the traditional stronghold of Europe.","[Fourcade, Marion] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fourcade, Marion] Sci Po, Max Planck Sci Po Ctr, Paris, France",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Fourcade, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,18,27,34,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Given this limited coverage, the current study empirically examines Chathoth and Olsen's (2003) conceptual framework of hospitality strategic alliances: moving from joint ventures, a traditional form of alliance, to collaborative alliances, such as the competitor-alliance, a newer form. The paper investigates strategic alliances in which US public hotel companies engaged during 2000-2008 and finds that collaborative alliances were more common in the hotel industry than joint ventures. The paper also investigates, through an event study methodology, how the stock market perceives the hotel alliances as they evolve from joint ventures to collaborative alliances. The authors find that the stock market perceives joint ventures positively. In the case of collaborative alliances, the market reacts positively after the initial announcement, though negatively prior to the announcement.","[Koh, Yoon] Univ Houston, Conrad N Hilton Coll Hotel & Restaurant Managemen, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Lee, Seoki] Penn State Univ, Sch Hospitality Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Koh, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Conrad N Hilton Coll Hotel & Restaurant Managemen, 229 CN Hilton & Coll,Suite 236, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",ykoh@uh.edu; leeseoki@psu.edu,"Koh, Yoon/AAE-5355-2022; Lee, Seoki/AFK-7195-2022","Lee, Seoki/0000-0003-4720-9170; Koh, Yoon/0000-0002-0213-0082",,,,,44,5,6,0,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

It asks, in particular, whether the bank rate policy followed different patterns in core and peripheral countries. Based on OLS, ordered probit and pooled estimations of central bank discount rate behaviour, two main findings emerge: firstly, the discount rate decisions of core countries were motivated by a desire to keep the exchange-rate within the gold points. In stark contrast, the discount rate decisions of peripheral countries reflected changes in the domestic cover ratio. The main reason for the difference in behaviour was the limited effectiveness of the discount rate tool for peripheral countries, which resulted in more frequent gold point violations. Consequently, peripheral countries relied on high reserve levels and oriented their discount rate policy towards maintaining the reserve level. Secondly, interest rate decisions were influenced by Berlin and London to a similar degree, suggesting that the European branch of the Classical Gold Standard was less London-centred than had been hitherto assumed. In establishing general patterns of discount rate policy, this paper aims to contribute to the wider discussion on monetary policy under the gold standard and the core-periphery dichotomy.

First we estimate the effect of the increase in the federal excise tax on cigarette price and sales. Then, we estimate the effect of the decrease in cigarette sales on tobacco farms. Results suggest that under a scenario of market power implied by a conjectural elasticity of 0.11 manufactures could charge $0.23 per pack more than the federal excise tax increase, which would be enough to offset the estimated 1.42 billion-pack sales decline and to maintain the industry's revenue net of taxes. This decrease in cigarette sales induced by the increase in the federal excise tax would result in the tobacco leaf output and price declining by 2.85 and 0.41%, respectively. As a result, the tobacco leaf sector would sustain a loss of 3.25% in revenue, amounting to nearly $48.4 million.","[Tiller, Kelly J.; Feleke, Shiferaw T.; Starnes, Jane H.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Feleke, ST (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",sfeleke@utk.edu,,,,,,,31,0,0,1,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Although there is growing evidence for a negative association between fast food prices and weight among adolescents, less is known about adults. That any measured relationship to date is causal is unclear because there has been no attempt to separate variation in prices on the demand side from that on the supply side. We argue that the minimum wage is an exogenous source of variation in fast food prices, conditional on income and employment. In two-stage least-squares analyses, we find little evidence that fast food price changes affect adult BMI or obesity prevalence.

In the present paper, we are concerned with measuring parameters of social preference functions at the individual level. We draw upon concepts developed for eliciting other types of utility functions, in particular the literature on decision making under incomplete information. Our method derives parameters of social preference functions from indifference statements about the distribution of payoffs a group. We apply our method in a controlled social preference experiment to establish the external validity of estimated parameters. Our results show the expected relationships to some external factors (like educational background of subjects) and also a strong correspondence between parameter estimates and factors that, according to the subjects' own descriptions, influenced their behavior. We also find that some concepts discussed in the literature on social preferences, in particular envy toward players receiving a larger payoff, have very diverse and complex effects at the individual level.","[Graf, Christoph; Vetschera, Rudolf; Zhang, Yingchao] Univ Vienna, Fac Business Econ & Stat, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Vetschera, R (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Fac Business Econ & Stat, Bruenner Str 72, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",christoph.graf@univie.ac.at; rudolf.vetschera@univie.ac.at; yingchao.zhang@univie.ac.at,,"Graf, Christoph/0000-0003-2477-9082; Vetschera, Rudolf/0000-0003-2809-8989",,,,,48,5,8,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2013,74.0,3,,,,,357.0,382,,10.1007/s11238-012-9312-9,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,077RT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314045900003,0

Using data across 43 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas during 1987-2006, we analyze the impact of tourism inflows - proxied by the number of hotel rooms sold - on the employment in 22 non-hotel industries. We estimate a dynamic labor demand model with inter-industry spillover effects, using various estimators including GMM-based dynamic panel methods. We find statistically and economically significant effects - an additional 100 rooms sold per day during a year in a given MSA generates between 2 and 5 new jobs per non-hotel industry in that area.

First, when the provision of public goods is binary, there are Nash equilibria supporting efficient allocations, and these are Strong Nash equilibria of the game. On the other hand, a model of a continuous public good (Saijo-Yamato, J Econ Theory 84:227-242, 1999) showed that the participation of all agents is not an equilibrium in many situations. This article considers the provision of a discrete and multi-unit public good, and examines a unit-by-unit participation game. Namely, people are asked to participate in each unit of public good provision, and those who chose to participate share the marginal cost of public good. In this game of public good provision, there are subgame-perfect equilibria that are Pareto efficient. We also use the refinement concepts to eliminate inefficient subgame-perfect equilibria and also to characterize the efficient subgame-perfect equilibria.","[Nishimura, Yukihiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Shinohara, Ryusuke] Shinshu Univ, Dept Econ, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan",Osaka University; Shinshu University,"Nishimura, Y (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",ynishimu@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp; ryusukes@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Shinohara, Ryusuke/0000-0003-2916-8352",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21730247] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,17,1,1,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2013,40.0,3,,,,,793.0,814,,10.1007/s00355-011-0644-0,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,072HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313662000011,0

The present article places Llull's contributions and discussion in the historical context of elections in the medieval Church and the emergence of majority rule as a new general principle for making enforceable collective decisions in replacement of traditional unanimous requirements. To make the majority principle operational, Llull initially proposed a system of exhaustive binary comparisons that is more efficacious in producing a winner than the Condorcet system, in anticipation to the so called Copeland procedure. In contrast to some previous tentative suggestions, careful reading of Llull's papers demonstrates that he did not propose a rank-order count system, such as those proposed later on by Cusanus and Borda. A new hypothesis is presented to explain Llull's later proposal of an eliminatory system of partial binary comparisons. Some performance of Llull's voting systems is estimated by innovative analysis of results in certain modern sports tournaments.","CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Bellaterra 08193, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Colomer, JM (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",Josep.colomer@gmail.com,"Colomer, Josep M/B-1739-2012",,,,,,41,23,25,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2013,40.0,2,,,,,317.0,328,,10.1007/s00355-011-0598-2,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,072HT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313661600001,0

In a 6-month field trial 40 EVs were leased to a sample of early adopter customers. In general, users were satisfied with range and stressful range situations rarely occurred. Results further suggested that users were comfortable with utilizing approximately 75-80% of their available range resources. Several personality traits (e.g., control beliefs, low impulsivity) and system competence variables (e.g., daily practice, subjective competence) were positively related to range level values and thus range utilization. Comfortable range was positively related to range satisfaction. We recommend that psychology-based strategies should be applied to enhance range optimization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Consistent with the occupational segregation hypothesis, the occurrence and frequency of work travel varied across the types of occupation and men had a higher chance both to be in jobs with travel overnight demands and to travel more often than women did.

In particular, we characterize how shifts in the distribution of individual levels of risk tolerance affect the group's attitude towards risk. In a model with efficient risk-sharing and two agents an increase in the level of risk tolerance of one or of both agents might have an ambiguous impact on the collective level of risk tolerance; the latter increases for some levels of aggregate wealth while it decreases for other levels of aggregate wealth. For more general populations we characterize the effect of first-order like shifts (individual levels of risk tolerance more concentrated on high values) and second-order like shifts (more dispersion on individual levels of risk tolerance) on the collective level of risk tolerance. We also evaluate how shifts in the distribution of individual levels of risk tolerance impact the collective level of risk tolerance in a framework with exogenous egalitarian sharing rules.

This article highlights the poor size properties of commonly employed balancing tests and attempts to shed some light on the link between the results of balancing tests and bias of the evaluation estimator. The simulation results suggest that in scenarios where the conditional independence assumption holds, a permutation version of the balancing test described in Dehejia and Wahba (Rev Econ Stat 84:151-161, 2002) can be useful in applied study. The proposed test has good size properties. In addition, the test appears to have good power for detecting a misspecification in the link function and some power for detecting an omission of relevant non-linear terms involving variables that are included at a lower order.","[Lee, Wang-Sheng] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Lee, Wang-Sheng] IZA, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Lee, WS (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Level 12,239 Bourke St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",wangsheng.lee@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,44,88,103,2,30,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

By the cointegration model, we get appropriate long-term relationship between capital and its determinants.

The crucial question is to find out what can cause delaying of the project due date or failure of project objectives. Some authors try to analyse activity parameters called criticalness. Criticalness usually expressed by Criticality Index reflects the risk of influencing project due date by this activities. Another view via project simulation is how often a particular activity should be element of the critical path. All of these methods are primary derived from activity duration, type of links between activities and type of constraints. In the reality many different criteria (soft or hard) should influence criticalness of the activity. Criticalness in our approach is defined in a slightly different way. We derive this parameter from the character of activity duration (known or random), resource assignments (in right time and right place), activity costs and number of parallel activities.

Clark (2007b) argued both theoretically and empirically that pre-industrial income fluctuated, but was not trending upwards, a position Persson (2008) labeled the Malthus Delusion. Clark (2010a), in particular, estimated that pre-industrial English income was as high on average as in 1800. In contrast, Broadberry et al. (2011) estimate that income tripled between 1270 and 1800. One test of early income estimates is the share employed in farming. This paper, focusing on the poll tax returns of 1379-1381, shows that only 56-59% of the English population was in farming or fishing. This small share implies incomes in 1381 equivalent to those of 1800. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We use comprehensive, firm-level data from Indias organized manufacturing sector to show that market-share reallocations were briefly relevant to explain aggregate productivity gains following the beginning of Indias trade reforms in 1991. However, aggregate productivity gains during the period from 1985 to 2004 were largely driven by improvements in average productivity. We show that Indias trade, FDI, and licensing reforms are not associated with productivity gains stemming from market share reallocations. Instead, we find that most of the productivity improvements in Indian manufacturing occurred through learning and that this learning was linked to the reforms. In the Indian case, the evidence rejects the notion that market share reallocations are the mechanism through which trade reform increases aggregate productivity. Although a plausible response would be that Indias labor laws do not easily permit market share reallocations, we show that restrictions on labor mobility cannot explain our results.","[Harrison, Ann E.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Harrison, Ann E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Martin, Leslie A.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Nataraj, Shanthi] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Melbourne; RAND Corporation,"Nataraj, S (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA.",annh@wharton.upenn.edu; Leslie.Martin@unimelb.edu.au; snataraj@rand.org,"; Martin, Leslie/N-9525-2015","Harrison, Ann/0000-0002-1873-2432; Martin, Leslie/0000-0002-0955-6836; Nataraj, Shanthi/0000-0002-1982-3221","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0922332] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,40,37,45,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

The model is taken from Iacoviello and Neri (2010). There are two production sectors: consumption/investment goods sector and housing sector. These sectors contain various types of nominal and real rigidities and also different technological trends. On the demand side, there is financial friction in the form of collateral constraint which affects borrowing capacity and consumer spending. The model is estimated using Bayesian techniques. The parameters are economically interpreted, the model moments are compared to moments from data and dynamical properties of the model are studied using impulse responses and variance and shock decompositions. Results show that monetary policy has more pronounced effect on consumption and output when houses are better collateralizable. Consumption shocks, housing technology and housing preference shocks played important role in fluctuation of the real variables while inflation target shocks and cost-push shocks influenced mostly nominal variables. However, recent boom and bust in housing prices was caused primary by housing preference shocks (demand side shocks). Supply shocks were also significant but to much less extent.","[Hlousek, Miroslav] Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,hlousek@econ.muni.cz,"Hlousek, Miroslav/G-8508-2013","Hlousek, Miroslav/0000-0001-9118-6792",,,,,9,1,1,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,261.0,266,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000045,0

We use the same data set of thirty seven, aggregate and disaggregate, industrial production indices used by Herrera et al. (2011) as a proxy for real output and a post-1973 data sample. We check the robustness of our results by using two proxies for the price of oil, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price and the Refiners' Acquisition Cost (RAC) of crude oil, and by testing for both nominal and real effects. We find significant evidence of nonlinearities for both aggregate and disaggregate indices. Our research highlights the importance of nominal prices and extreme events such as the Great Recession in the transmission of nonlinearities. Our results show that nonlinear impacts of the price of oil on the aggregate economy vary according to time period even within the post-1974 data. Since 2000, oil price volatility is up markedly, but the number of industries it impacts is down when compared with the full sample. This is in keeping with what one would expect, based on trend improvements in GDP per unit of energy use. However, for those series, where oil price volatility is significant, the impact of oil volatility is substantially higher than in the full sample; this runs contrary to what one might expect from the observed GDP per unit of energy use improvements.","[Pinno, Karl; Serletis, Apostolos] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Pinno, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",kpinno@shaw.ca,,,,,,,33,30,30,1,21,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,34.0,3,,,SI,,191.0,216,,10.5547/01956574.34.3.9,0.0,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,173NB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321085100009,0

But in the places where there are more barriers such as the city's high-rise, culvert, boulevards and deep canyons, its function is often a failure. Dead reckoning (Dead - Reckoning) DR is another commonly-used automobile positioning technology. But the direction error is large and is accumulated with time, so it can't be used separately for a long time. To integrate GPS and DR, we can also play to the advantages of both and learn from each other. We can accurately and reliably position and navigate better than any single navigation system. This paper studies the mathematical model of vehicle navigation system adaptive federated Kalman filter based on GPS/DR combination. In the combination of GPS and DR, when the DR positioning error is large and accumulate with the time, it will correct and calibrate according to the GPS. When the signal of GPS is lost, it will use DR autonomous positioning, maintaining navigation. The multi-sensor system plays a role composed of two systems of mutually independent subsystem, so, the application of Kalman filtering technique lies in the optimal combination of location, and we can make GPS/DR integrated vehicle navigation system to achieve both navigation and mutual correction.","[Qian, Wang] Suzhou Vocat Univ, Suzhou 215000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Suzhou Vocational University,,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,18.0,,,,,,287.0,291,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BA4DZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335479600059,0

The objective of this paper is to develop an analysis of the determinants of MTTs, assessing the theoretical propositions and empirical findings of previous studies. The authors use a large dataset of 183,000 international tourists who visited Brazil from 2004 to 2010. They employ a censored zero-inflated negative binomial model to overcome econometric deficiencies in previous studies. The set of explanatory variables used in preceding analyses is substantially extended to include additional determinants such as level of education, type of accommodation and season. Some of the findings throw light on conflicting theoretical arguments in the literature, especially those regarding the effects of party size and monetary and time constraints. The authors find a qualitative difference between single and multiple destination trips. Finally, tourists' decisions to take single or multiple destination trips are shown to be different and somehow detached from the decision on how many destinations to visit.","[De Oliveira Santos, Glauber Eduardo] Univ Balearic Isl, Tourism & Environm Econ Programme, Palma de Mallorca, Spain; [De Oliveira Santos, Glauber Eduardo] Sci & Technol Sao Paulo IFSP, Fed Inst Educ, BR-01109010 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Ramos, Vicente; Rey-Maquieira, Javier] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Instituto Federal de Sao Paulo (IFSP); Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Santos, GED (通讯作者)，Univ Balearic Isl, Tourism & Environm Econ Programme, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.",glaubereduardo@gmail.com,"Rey-Maquieira, Javier/G-1167-2016; Ramos, Vicente/P-5941-2015; de Oliveira Santos, Glauber Eduardo/G-9727-2013","Ramos, Vicente/0000-0003-1486-6537; de Oliveira Santos, Glauber Eduardo/0000-0001-8731-101X",,,,,38,19,21,3,25,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We use data from the 2006 Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network. Diversification is explained based on internal and external characteristics. External determinants include the distance to urban population centers, landscape features and social capital in the local community. Internal determinants include farm size, specialization, tenancy restrictions, labor use and business structure. We apply a multivariate probit model to determine the factors that affect diversification decisions so as to assess the correlation between farmers' strategies. The results highlight the importance of social capital and networks in developing diversification in Italian rural areas. Furthermore, we find the presence of both synergies and trade-offs in different types of diversification.

The evidence shows that the adaptability channel (legal flexibility) is more important for explaining antitrust effectiveness than the political channel (authority independence). The evidence also suggests that countries in which a judicial decision is a source of law will provide more legal flexibility and will adapt more easily to changing economic circumstances. They will therefore also have better enforcement of antitrust rules. On the other hand, a legal tradition that takes no formal notice of legal precedent will make the competition environment much less predictable. To the extent that these findings are true, one would expect competition agencies in Common law countries to perform better than those in Civil law countries.","[Ma, Tay-Cheng] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Jinhe Ctr Econ Res, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Ma, Tay-Cheng] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Chinese Culture University,"Ma, TC (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Jinhe Ctr Econ Res, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",tcma1234@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,6,6,0,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We estimate these country differences by exploiting statistical information for pre-tax retail prices and for export unit values. Conclusions from both independent data sets are, in general, quite consistent. Results support the claim that, in the period before the Block Exemption Regulation (1400/2002) came fully into force, international price discrimination was an important source of car price dispersion within the euro area. For a more recent period, we found that estimated deviations in pricing-to-market behaviour across destinations have become lower. This convergence suggests that car market integration was progressively improved at the end of the last decade.","[Balaguer, Jacint] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Balaguer, Jacint] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Balaguer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",,"Balaguer, Jacint/H-9677-2019","Balaguer, Jacint/0000-0003-3798-1976",,,,,21,1,1,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2012,35.0,11,,,,,1502.0,1529,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01467.x,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,041FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311385400005,0

On the premise that real estate broker incentives emanate from two primary sources, factors that increase broker operating efficiency and negotiable features arising from the relationship between the listing broker and the seller, this study assesses the degree to which these incentives affect the marketing time, probability of sale, and selling price of single-family houses. Of particular interest, this study investigates efficiency and broker intermediation effects on residential property associated with a broker concentrating his listings into a service area. Empirical results show that properties within an individual broker's GIS-determined service area are more likely to sell, sell faster, and sell with an associated price premium. These effects are more concentrated in the market for higher priced homes. Also, additional compensation favorably motivates the broker with higher-priced properties, but has no effect on the sale of lower-priced properties.","[Springer, Thomas M.] Clemson Univ, Richard H Pennell Ctr Real Estate Dev, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Brastow, Raymond T.; Waller, Bennie D.] Longwood Univ, Farmville, VA 23909 USA",Clemson University; Longwood University,"Springer, TM (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Richard H Pennell Ctr Real Estate Dev, 301 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",springe@clemson.edu,"Waller, Bennie D./AAF-6043-2021; Waller, Bennie D/HKM-9179-2023",,,,,,22,24,31,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

By identifying for each NGO the degree of official financing, we address the largely unresolved issue of whether financial dependence on the government impairs the targeting of NGO aid. It turns out that German NGOs are more active in poorer countries, while they do not complement official aid by working under difficult local conditions. Beyond a certain threshold, rising financial dependence weakens their poverty orientation and provides an incentive to engage in easier environments. In addition, we find that the NGOs follow the state as well as NGO peers when allocating aid. This herding behaviour is, however, hardly affected by the degree of official financing.","[Dreher, Axel] Univ Heidelberg, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany; [Dreher, Axel] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Dreher, Axel] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Dreher, Axel] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Dreher, Axel] KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Nunnenkamp, Peter; Thiele, Rainer] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Thiel, Susann] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Gottingen; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Dreher, A (通讯作者)，Univ Heidelberg, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany.",,"Dreher, Axel/AAN-1839-2020","Dreher, Axel/0000-0002-7227-3599",,,,,40,12,12,1,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2012,35.0,11,,,,,1448.0,1472,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01455.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,041FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311385400003,0

It is concluded that rating agencies lag behind markets, that their business model is flawed, and that the lack of competition renders the big three CRAs with too strong a market position. The reliance on CRAs should be reduced by attaching less importance to them in prudential regulation and accounting standards. At the same time, more competition and transparency is needed to increase the quality of ratings. Finally, several policy options to change the ratings industry are discussed, including the creation of a network of small CRAs, delegation of sovereign debt ratings to the European Central Bank or the creation of a European rating agency.","[Eijffinger, Sylvester C.

In particular, we apply the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) to seven major global REIT markets, and investigate their linkages among returns and volatilities at different time scales. Our findings suggest strong scale-dependency of the market linkages. Specifically, the linkage among returns generally increases with time scale, implying that portfolio diversification is most efficient at short time horizons. Moreover, the return linkage is found to be time varying and its dynamics varies across scales. In addition, results on the volatility linkage, which manifests itself through volatility comovements and spillover, show that volatility comovements generally strengthen as scale increases and volatility spillover varies across scales in terms of strength and direction. Our findings cast doubt on the use of the scale-free correlation coefficient as a universal measure of market linkage. Our findings can be utilized by time-scale-conscious investors to improve portfolio selection and risk management.","Univ Guelph, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Coll Management & Econ, Real Estate & Housing, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jian@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,44,28,31,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

As part of its emissions reduction strategy, the United Kingdom Government is demonstrating support for new vehicle technologies, paying attention, in particular, to electric vehicles. Cluster analysis was applied to Census data in order to identify potential alternative fuel vehicle drivers in the city of Birmingham, United Kingdom. The clustering was undertaken based on characteristics of age, income, car ownership, home ownership, socio-economic status and education. Almost 60% of areas that most closely fitted the profile of an alternative fuel vehicle driver were found to be located across four wards furthest from Birmingham city centre, while the areas with the poorest fit were located towards the centre of Birmingham. The paper demonstrates how Census data can be used in the initial stages of identifying potential early adopters of alternative vehicle drivers. It also shows how such research can provide scope for infrastructure planning and policy development for local and national authorities, while also providing useful marketing information to car manufacturers.

The data stem from a stated preference discrete choice experiment with 598 potential German car buyers. In order to simulate a realistic future purchase situation, seven vehicle types were incorporated in each of the six choice sets, i.e. hybrid, gas, biofuel, hydrogen, and electric vehicles besides common gasoline and diesel vehicles. The econometric analysis with flexible multinomial probit models reveals that potential car buyers in Germany currently have a low stated preference for electric, hydrogen, and hybrid vehicles. While our paper also discusses the impact of common vehicle attributes such as purchase price or service station availability, it particularly considers the effect of socio-demographic and environmental awareness variables. The estimation results reveal that younger potential car buyers have a higher stated preference for hydrogen and electric vehicles, males have a higher stated choice of hydrogen vehicles, and environmentally aware potential car buyers have a higher stated preference for hydrogen and electric vehicles. These results suggest that common policy instruments such as the promotion of research and development, taxation, or subsidization in the field of electromobility could be supplemented by strategies to increase the social acceptance of alternative vehicle types that are directly oriented to these population groups. Methodologically, our study highlights the importance of the inclusion of taste persistence across the choice sets and a high number of random draws in the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane simulator in the simulated maximum likelihood estimation of the multinomial probit models.

We find that the municipalities closer to the original sites of nineteenth century government sponsored settlements (colonias) have higher per capita income, less poverty and dependence on Bolsa Familia cash transfers, better health and education outcomes; and for the areas close to German colonies, also less inequality of income and educational outcomes than otherwise. Since that is a reduced form relationship, we then attempt to identify the relative importance of more egalitarian landholdings and higher initial human capital in determining those outcomes.

An empirical study might prove more suitable for evaluating the performance of tourism clusters, and yet the literature in this respect is scarce and there is a need for more research. This paper evaluates tourism clusters in Portugal and maps them through multivariate analysis. The empirical results validate the need to apply statistical tests and reveal that substantial differences in cluster performance do exist. In particular, the study identifies three different clusters in Portugal with varying performance levels - low, medium and high.

Using a new and detailed firm-level data set with matching stock price and balance sheet information, we construct new stock return indices as well as firm-specific liquidity measures for our empirical analysis. Our main finding is that there was a substantial illiquidity effect on returns. Securities in the 25th percentile of the liquidity distribution earned, on average, a 0.59 percent higher monthly return than securities in the 75th percentile. This effect is comparable with estimates from modern stock markets and suggests that the liquidity premium is not solely a modern phenomenon but could be an inherent characteristic of financial markets.","[Gernandt, Otto; Palm, Thomas] Goldman Sachs Int, London, England; [Waldenstrom, Daniel] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Waldenstrom, Daniel] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Gernandt, O (通讯作者)，Goldman Sachs Int, London, England.",ogernandt@centerbridge.com; thomas.palm@gs.com; daniel.waldenstrom@nek.uu.se,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The housing search process starts with an alternative formation and screening stage. At this level households evaluate all potential alternatives based on their lifestyle, preferences, and utilities to form a manageable choice set with a limited number of plausible alternatives. Then the final residential location is selected among these alternatives. This two-stage decision making process can be used for both aggregate zone-level selection as well as searching disaggregate parcel or building-based housing markets for potential dwellings. In this paper a zonal level household housing search model is developed. Initially, a household specific choice set is drawn from the entire possible alternatives in the area based on the average household work distance to each alternative. Following the choice set formation step, a discrete choice model is utilized for modeling the final residential zone selection of the household. A hazard-based model is used for the choice set formation module while the final choice selection is modeled using a multinomial logit formulation with a deterministic sample correction factor. The approach presented in the paper provides a remedy for the large choice set problem typically faced in housing search models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Public good provision is financed either by a lump sum tax or by a proportional income tax. We analyze both the simultaneous and the sequential determinations of the public good's size and location. We show that, while the choice of the type of public good follows the traditional median logic, the majoritarian determination of the taxation rate need not coincide with the preferences of a median income citizen. With lump sum financing, income heterogeneity plays no role and the sequential equilibrium consists of the median location together with the public good level most-preferred by the individual located at the median distance from the median. This policy bundle also constitutes an equilibrium with simultaneous voting in the special case of a uniform bivariate distribution of individuals' income and location. With proportional taxation, there is no policy equilibrium with simultaneous voting. We offer a complete characterization of the equations describing the sequential equilibrium in the general case and we show why and how our results depart from those most-preferred by the median income individual located at the median distance from the median. We also compare these majority voting allocations with the socially optimal one.","[De Donder, Philippe] Mfg Tabacs MS102, Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ, CNRS, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [De Donder, Philippe; Le Breton, Michel] Mfg Tabacs MS102, IDEI, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Peluso, Eugenio] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37100 Verona, Italy",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Verona,"De Donder, P (通讯作者)，Mfg Tabacs MS102, Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ, CNRS, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",dedonder@cict.fr; lebreton@cict.fr; eugenio.peluso@univr.it,,"PELUSO, Eugenio/0000-0002-4914-5310",,,,,18,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2012,39.0,2-3,,,SI,,457.0,489,,10.1007/s00355-012-0656-4,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,968FR,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305963200011,0

This process is causing sustainability problems, not only in socio-economic terms (decrease in olive farmers' profits) but also from an environmental point of view (soil erosion, water pollution and biodiversity losses). The main objective of this study is to develop a methodology to analyse the sustainability of olive-growing farms in Andalusia. This methodology will allow us to take into account the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, socio-cultural and environmental), as well as to obtain a precise diagnosis of olive groves through a selection of indicators. A total of 27 indicators were selected, of which 7 analyse the economic dimension of sustainability, 9 analyse the socio-cultural dimension and 11 evaluate the environmental sustainability of olive groves in Andalusia. This set of indicators aims to help both decision-making processes and the implementation of public policies.","[Antonio Gomez-Limon, Jose] Univ Cordoba, Dept Agr Econ, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Riesgo, Laura] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Gómez-Limón, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Cordoba, Dept Agr Econ, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.",,"GÓMEZ-LIMÓN, José A./B-8247-2011; riesgo, laura/A-2923-2012","GÓMEZ-LIMÓN, José A./0000-0002-6364-0027; riesgo, laura/0000-0001-5733-0658","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; FEDER [AGL2009-12553-C02-01, AGL2010-17560-C02-01]; Regional Government of Andalusia [AGR-5892]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Regional Government of Andalusia(Junta de Andalucia),"The research was co-financed by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and FEDER through projects AGL2009-12553-C02-01 and AGL2010-17560-C02-01, and the Regional Government of Andalusia through project AGR-5892.",,40,12,12,1,14,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2012,11.0,2,,,,,39.0,49,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,003SD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308630700006,0

EU legislation sets out sustainability criteria for biofuels to qualify for this target and procedures for verifying that they are met. Using the AGLINK-COSIMO model, we investigate the impacts of the biofuel target on global trade flows and land use, both under the current biofuel tariff regime and assuming zero EU tariffs for biofuels. The EUs 2020 transport fuel target increases the global area of agricultural crops by 0.9 per cent. With zero tariffs, the extra global land requirement is 21 per cent smaller, but a larger share of it falls outside the EU. This outcome sharpens the issue of how the EUs unilateral sustainability criteria can be implemented given current international trade rules.","[Gay, Stephan Hubertus] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, The Hague, Netherlands; [Kavallari, Aikaterini] Agr Econ Inst, The Hague, Netherlands",,,,,,,,,,16,10,14,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2012,35.0,6,,,,,784.0,798,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01430.x,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,944IB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304191600006,0

In particular, they demonstrate that the importance attributed to potential growth determinants varies tremendously over different revisions of international income data. They conclude that 'agnostic' priors appear too sensitive for this strand of growth empirics. In response, we show that the found instability owes much to a specific BMA set-up: first, comparing the same countries over data revisions improves robustness; second, much of the remaining variation can be reduced by applying an evenly 'agnostic' but flexible prior.

We focus on Chelsea, Massachusetts, because it is a dense city, dominated by multifamily housing structures with high rates of foreclosure for which we have particularly good data. We distinguish between occupant-owners and investors using local data, and we find that many investors are misclassified as occupant-owners in the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. Then, employing a competing risks framework to study ownerships during the period 1998 through mid-2010, we find that local investors, who tend to invest more in relation to purchase prices and sell more quickly, experienced approximately 1.8 times the mortgage foreclosure risk of occupant-owners, conditional on financing. Nonlocal investors have no statistically significant difference in foreclosure risk from occupant-owners. Nonetheless, those owners with subprime purchase mortgages (most of whom are occupant-owners) faced the highest foreclosure risk when house prices fell.","[Fisher, Lynn M.] Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Lambie-Hanson, Lauren] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lambie-Hanson, Lauren] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston,"Fisher, LM (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",Lynn_Fisher@unc.edu; lslh@mit.edu,,,,,,,39,16,18,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2012,40.0,2,,,,,351.0,386,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2011.00317.x,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,945YL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304313400006,0

ANNs provide consistent estimates for the hedonic price of each attribute and permit a number of hypotheses on the hedonic price relationship to be tested nonparametrically. In particular, we exploit results by Stinchcombe and White (Econom Theory 14:295-324, 1998) in order to carry out misspecification testing in linear and semiloglinear hedonic models. The same approach directly applies to testing misspecification of any parametric specification for the hedonic relationship. A nonparametric significance test for the variables in the hedonic model is also proposed. The test extends the approach developed by Racine (J Bus Econ Stat 15(3):369-378, 1997) in kernel-based nonparametric testing to ANN-based inference. The finite sample performance of the proposed tests is analyzed through Monte Carlo experiments, and simulation-based algorithms for computation of the null distribution of the tests are proposed. Then, the performance of three classes of regression models-linear, semi-log, and ANNs-applied to hedonic price modeling in a Spanish regional housing market is compared. Our results indicate the presence of nonlinear behavior, as predicted by economic theory, with the ANN-based tests detecting statistically significant evidence of misspecification-both in the linear and the semilog specifications-and ANN regressions providing moderate improvement of predictive performance.","[Landajo, Manuel] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Bilbao, Celia] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Bilbao, Amelia] Univ Oviedo, Dept Quantitat Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Landajo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Avenida Cristo S-No, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",landajo@uniovi.es; cbilbao@uniovi.es; ameliab@uniovi.es,"Bilbao-Terol, Amelia/B-6569-2014; Landajo, Manuel/B-6945-2008",,,,,,57,18,19,0,30,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This criticism is misplaced in two ways. First, no predictable link exists between the exchange rate and the trade balance of an international creditor economy. Second, since 1995, the stable yuan/dollar rate has anchored Chinas price level and facilitated counter cyclical fiscal policies that have smoothed its high real GDP growth at a remarkable 9 to 11 per cent per year. With its now greater GDP, China displaces Japan as the largest economy in East Asia but with a much stronger stabilising influence on East Asian neighbours from its higher economic growth and more stable dollar exchange rate. Now, an ever larger China is an essential stabiliser for the world economy as exemplified by its prompt and effective fiscal response to the global credit crunch of 200809. However, cumulating financial distortions in China and the United States threaten to undermine Chinas growth and its stabilising influence on the rest of the world.","[McKinnon, Ronald] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Schnabl, Gunther] Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Leipzig, Germany",Stanford University; Leipzig University,"McKinnon, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,24,33,34,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2012,35.0,6,,,,,667.0,693,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01416.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,944IB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304191600001,0

We explore the role of several factors and we use three different indicators of export concentration. We find robust evidence across specifications and indicators that trade openness induces higher specialisation. In contrast, financial development does not seem to help countries to diversify their exports. Looking at the effects of exchange rates, in some of the results, a negative effect of real exchange rate volatility on export diversification is detected, but no significant effects of exchange rate overvaluation. There is also evidence that human capital accumulation contributes positively to diversify exports and that increasing remoteness tends to reduce export diversification. We also explore the role of terms of trade shocks. Most of the results suggest an interesting interaction between this variable and human capital: improvements in the terms of trade tend to concentrate exports, but this effect is lower for those countries with higher levels of human capital. This evidence suggests that countries with higher education can take advantage of positive terms of trade shocks to increase export diversification.","[Agosin, Manuel R.; Alvarez, Roberto; Bravo-Ortega, Claudio] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Alvarez, Roberto] Cent Bank Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Central Bank of Chile,"Agosin, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",,"Agosin, Manuel R./ABH-1852-2020; Agosin, Manuel/AAD-9648-2019; Bravo-Ortega, Claudio/HSH-0498-2023","Agosin, Manuel R./0000-0002-4196-918X; Bravo-Ortega, Claudio/0000-0003-3974-5459",,,,,35,125,131,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2012,35.0,3,,,,,295.0,315,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01395.x,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,904FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301180500003,0

This belief is generally consistent with theoretical arguments in the academic literature (e.g., Bird and Rowlands 1997; Bordo et al. 2004) but the empirical literature often finds otherwise (e.g., Jensen 2004). This paper argues that the effect of IMF agreements on a country's access to foreign direct investment (FDI) depends on its domestic institutions. Access to FDI depends on a country's ability to credibly commit to implementation, and this ability varies systematically across regime type. The theory is empirically tested using a treatment effects model with a Markov transition in the treatment equation in a dataset covering 142 countries from 1976 to 2006. We find that in democracies IMF program participation has a strong positive effect on FDI inflows and in autocracies participation has a weak negative effect.","[Bauer, Molly E.; Cruz, Cesi; Graham, Benjamin A.

While the genesis of this trade lay in investment decisions by United States-based companies that pioneered exports from Australian and western Canadian mines, its development was largely shaped by the strategies of the Japanese steel mills who acted as a buying cartel. By the early 1980s, this cartel had engineered an oversupplied market characterised by constantly falling prices. By 2001, however, this strategy proved counterproductive, as exports of coking coal in particular were concentrated in the hands of an oligopoly of super-efficient producers that drove up prices.","Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Bowden, B (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",,,,,,,,64,5,5,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-8992,,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

These events are particularly dramatic for the small pelagic fish market, which is characterized by low prices, a low level of consumption and poor market penetration. This paper evaluates the value of the social capital network as substance of relationships among the Adriatic small pelagic fish (Engraulis encrasicolus anchovies, Sardina pilchardus sardines and Scomber scombrus mackerel) supply chain actors; starting from the definition of each marketplace role and commercial flows, the paper defines the supply chain value-system and the possibility to enhance the fishery's share value, according to increasing relationships. Applied approach of the value chain to different supply chains of the Adriatic fishery system made it possible to estimate value distribution among the phases of the chain and to understand the fishery firms competitive position. Critical aspects causing fishing firms low profitability were detected and analyzed through the Social Network Analysis (SNA). Five local small pelagic fishery systems (Manfredonia, Molfetta, Ancona, Martinsicuro and Chioggia) were studied. For each of them, small pelagic fish supply chains were defined with particular reference to the role of local fish marketplaces and operators involved. Analysis of production areas revealed profound differences both in structural aspects (fleet composition, vessels, type and structure of local fish markets, fish ranges and prices) and in the business relations and management of supply chain dealers.","[De Blasi, Giuseppe; De Boni, Annalisa; Roma, Rocco] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy; [Trevisan, Giovanna] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Venice, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"De Blasi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.",,"Roma, Rocco/AGE-1180-2022; De Boni, Annalisa/U-9144-2017","Roma, Rocco/0000-0001-6329-7321; De Boni, Annalisa/0000-0002-9445-1210",,,,,23,3,3,0,25,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2012,11.0,1,,,,,27.0,32,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,941NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303971100005,0

This research aims to partially fill this gap by developing an activity-based stochastic decision support system for the main small pelagic species-European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and mackerel (Scomber spp.). This model is able to simulate the income effects from different fishery policies and the individual fisherman's strategies. The overall results show that there is high variability in the economic impacts from the fisheries management tools, which primarily depend on: i) the adopted fishing method, ii) the monthly landings dynamics, iii) the relevant fixed costs, and iv) the low ex-vessel market prices and their instability due to the weak bargaining power of the fishermen and the buyers' and final consumers' limited willingness to pay for small pelagic species. From a policy point of view, the uncertain profit for the fishing unit's owner and the unstable crew wages suggest that any proposed management tool at this micro-level should be carefully evaluated to complement the area-scale and the enterprise level evaluation.","[Defrancesco, Edi; Trestini, Samuele] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Terr & Sistemi Agroforestali, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy",University of Padua,"Defrancesco, E (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dipartimento Terr & Sistemi Agroforestali, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.",,"Defrancesco, Edi/M-8654-2015; TRESTINI, SAMUELE/B-6157-2012","Defrancesco, Edi/0000-0002-3369-1616; TRESTINI, SAMUELE/0000-0002-9828-8262",,,,,30,0,0,2,14,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2012,11.0,1,,,,,12.0,18,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,941NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303971100003,0

A European identity has not displaced national identities in the EU, but, for a significant share of EU citizens, a European identity exists alongside a national identity. At the same time, political parties asserting more traditional nationalist identities and policies have directed their dissatisfaction against immigrants, foreigners and, sometimes, the EU. Those who participate in Europe are more likely to develop a European identity, while those whose economic and social horizons are essentially local are more likely to assert nationalist identities. It is argued in this article that the issue of European and national identity plays a heightened role in European politics, particularly in the economic crisis of 200711. The resolution of that crisis, which may result in increased European political co-operation, will have to take into account highly salient national identities that have so far resisted such co-operation.","[Fligstein, Neil; Polyakova, Alina] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sandholtz, Wayne] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Fligstein, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fligst@berkeley.edu,"Polyakova, Alina/JFB-0475-2023",,,,,,56,126,142,5,113,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This article examines the determinants of salaries for NBA players, aiming to identify the existence of nationality discrimination on players' salary and whether the market size of international players' home countries matters to their compensation. Based on an unbalanced panel data of 618 NBA players between the 1999-2000 and 2007-2008 seasons and employing the technique of two-stage double fixed-effect model, the empirical results suggest that international players seem to receive a lower salary than that of their U.S.-born counterparts, ceteris paribus, suggesting the existence of salary discrimination by nationality. However, international players who come from a large economy receive preferential labor market treatment, highlighting the importance of the home country market to their salaries. The player characteristics such as positions, height, draft, and a team's local market size indeed play crucial roles in determining players' salaries. The authors also find that U.S.-born White players tend to be paid less than U.S.-born Black players. It may reflect the fact that more WHITEs tend to be Bench players or the possibility of racial discrimination.","[Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli 320, Taiwan",National Central University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 320, Taiwan.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,24,31,36,0,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

On the other hand, achieving high levels of organizational performance requires the creation and development of entrepreneurial orientation. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of intellectual capital on entrepreneurial orientation and performance. Hence, one of the factors that could play an important role in enhancing the capabilities of human resources and tendency of organizations to be entrepreneurial is the evaluation and use of Intellectual capital in an appropriate way. Overall, we can say that increase in intellectual capital will result to improvement of knowledge resources. Organization's readiness to take an appropriate decision under uncertainty, increase in production of new products and development of entrepreneurial activity and firms with higher entrepreneurial orientation can shape their internal resources better to improve their work performance. This study is based on the methodology of structural equation model. Regarding data collection, it is a descriptive-correlation study. The approach adopted in this study focuses on managers of manufacturing business as a fundamental source of potential future entrepreneurs. The results show that all dimensions of intellectual capital positively affect entrepreneurial orientation. Based on the results, human capital makes the greatest impact on organizational performance and also entrepreneurial orientation significantly has an impact on organizational performance.

We specify a model that relates electricity demand to previous EE DSM spending, energy prices, income, weather, and other demand factors. In contrast to previous studies, we allow EE DSM spending to have a potential long-term demand effect and explicitly address possible endogeneity in spending. We find that current period EE DSM expenditures reduce electricity demand and that this effect persists for a number of years. Our findings suggest that ratepayer funded DSM expenditures between 1992 and 2006 produced a central estimate of 0.9 percent savings in electricity consumption over that time period and a 1.8 percent savings over all years. These energy savings came at an expected average cost to utilities of roughly 5 cents per kWh saved when future savings are discounted at a 5 percent rate.","[Palmer, Karen] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Arimura, Toshi H.] Sophia Univ, Tokyo 102, Japan; [Li, Shanjun] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Newell, Richard G.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Resources for the Future; Sophia University; Cornell University; Duke University,"Palmer, K (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",Toshi.Arimura@gmail.com; SL2448@cornell.edu; richard.newell@duke.edu; palmer@rff.org,"; Newell, Richard/I-3838-2015","Li, shanjun/0000-0002-6141-8940; Newell, Richard/0000-0002-3205-5562",Abe Fellowship; Resources for the Future Center for Climate and Electricity Policy,Abe Fellowship; Resources for the Future Center for Climate and Electricity Policy,"The authors appreciate the very helpful research assistance of David McLaughlin, Maura Allaire, Yatziri Zepeda Medina, Kazuyuki Iwata, Erica Myers, and John Mi.

Tolls as one of the most important component part of the revenue budget SFTI of the Czech Republic determine the further development of transport infrastructure. The development must be in accordance with Transport Policy of the Czech Republic and European agreements. Collected toll amount may be influenced by different factors e.g. the number of registered vehicles, road transport performance, or intensity of traffic, etc. Because the influence of these factors on the toll varies, it is necessary to determine the significance and the relationships between these factors. Analysis of the toll impact can then be used to determine the correct amount of tolls.

We find that the racial gap differs across homeownership rates and that studies that examine the gap only at the mean may be misleading. We also find that although household characteristics explain the homeownership gap for most households, there is a substantial portion of the gap that remains unexplained for households with a very low propensity to own homes. A comparison of the estimates from the semiparametric model and a probit model suggests that the semiparametric approach is able to capture the heterogeneity structure between the ethnic groups, particularly in the tails of the distribution. To illustrate the flexibility of our household-level approach, we decompose the homeownership gap in cities of varying levels of segregation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Low income and ethnic minority groups are often considered to be especially constrained in their education choices because they need to stay at home for financial or cultural reasons. This paper provides new quantitative evidence on these issues from England. It improves on previous studies by using a large administrative data set on a population of school leavers and by using methods that allow for great flexibility in the way that student characteristics might influence choices. Our findings are that geographical distance has little or no impact on the decision to participate in England, but has a strong influence on institutional choice. Institution attendance probabilities fall with distance from home, with an elasticity of -1. Small, but potentially important differences between student groups have implications for the sorting of students across institutions, and hence the spatial distribution of human capital.

Assessing the potential uptake of these new categories of vehicles requires an understanding of likely consumer responses. Previous in-depth explorations of appraisals and evaluations of electric vehicles have tended to focus on 'early adopters', who may not represent mainstream consumers. This paper reports a qualitative analysis of responses to electric cars, based on semi-structured interviews conducted with 40 UK non-commercial drivers (20 males, 20 females; age 24-70 years) at the end of a seven-day period of using a battery electric car (20 participants) or a plug-in hybrid car (20 participants). Six core categories of response were identified: (1) cost minimisation; (2) vehicle confidence; (3) vehicle adaptation demands; (4) environmental beliefs; (5) impression management; and, underpinning all other categories, (6) the perception of electric cars generally as 'work in progress' products. Results highlight potential barriers to the uptake of current-generation (2010) plug-in electric cars by mainstream consumers. These include the prioritization of personal mobility needs over environmental benefits, concerns over the social desirability of electric vehicle use, and the expectation that rapid technological and infrastructural developments will make current models obsolete. Implications for the potential uptake of future electric vehicles are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It provides parametric and nonparametric estimates of a lower bound for the degree of inequality of opportunity for wage and salary workers. On average, the contribution of opportunity-shaping circumstances to earnings inequality declined from 22 percent in 1988 to 15 percent in 2006. Levels of inequality of opportunity were fairly stable while earnings differentials widened markedly, leading to a decline in the share of inequality attributable to opportunities. Father's background and geographic origins had the largest effect on earnings, although the impact of mother's education has risen in recent years. The degree of inequality of opportunity did not differ significantly by gender or rural-urban area, although the incidence was lower for men and for rural areas. The results indicate an increase in inequality of opportunity across age groups, but there is some evidence that opportunity differentials have been declining for the oldest generation.","Econ Res Forum, Cairo, Egypt",,"Hassine, NB (通讯作者)，Econ Res Forum, Cairo, Egypt.",nbelhaj@erf.org.eg,,,,,,,20,38,46,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Numeral studies have been done at the micro and macro levels to discover the role of energy and its impact on economic growth. However, little have been done to explore the essence of energy in a particular sector especially the energy based sector like manufacturing sector. This paper investigates the relationship between electricity consumption, export and production in Malaysia's manufacturing sector in a multivariate framework. This study has two objectives. The first objective is to discover the existence of long-run relationship among the variables and the second objective is to examine the short-run causality among the variables. This is a time series analysis with the sample period covers from 1980-2010. Johansen and Juselius cointegration test is employed to discover the long-run relationship while Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) Granger causality test will be used to find out the causal relationship. We found that GDP from the manufacturing sector, electricity consumption of the manufacturing sector, export of manufacturing sector, the labor of the manufacturing sector and capital of the manufacturing sector are cointegrated in the long run. The VECM results show unidirectional causality running from electricity consumption of manufacturing sector to GDP of the manufacturing sector and from electricity consumption of manufacturing sector to labor of the manufacturing sector. Hence, these results indicate electricity is essential in the manufacturing sector.","[Husaini, Dzul Hadzwan; Lean, Hooi Hooi] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,,"Lean, Hooi Hooi/A-5754-2010; Husaini, Dzul hadzwan/AAQ-6656-2020; Husaini, Dzul Hadzwan/D-3664-2019","Lean, Hooi Hooi/0000-0002-6847-0274; Husaini, Dzul hadzwan/0000-0002-5704-9978;",,,,,27,0,0,0,0,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,701.0,711,,,,,,11,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600061,0

In the presence of agglomeration economies, when a firm moves into a community attracted by a tax reduction, other firms may decide to follow, implying that agglomeration economies increase tax effects. However, this result only holds when jurisdictions are relatively similar. If economic activities are concentrated in a single jurisdiction from the outset, agglomeration economies might offset tax differentials and so limit the role played by taxes. We analyze the effect of a local business tax on the location of employment in the Spanish region of Catalonia. We relate differences in the sensitivity of employment location to local taxes to differences in the Ellison and Glaeser (1997) index, an industry measure of geographical concentration. We test if agglomeration economies: (1) strengthen tax effects in dispersed local labor markets in which municipalities are relatively similar: and (2) weaken tax effects in (concentrated) local labor markets showing a marked core-periphery pattern. We find that agglomeration economies strengthen tax effects in dispersed local labor markets but neither weakens nor strengthens tax effects in concentrated local labor markets.

Compared models act in the artificial market as forecasting strategies of agents who trade on the market. There are traded one risky asset paying a dividend and one risk-free asset in the artificial market. The way how agents trade (buy or sell risky asset) affects the price of risky asset, which in turn influences their expectations and therefore their subsequent decisions whether to buy or sell. Moreover, each agent can recalculate parameters of his strategy, if he is not satisfied with its performance. So the forecasting strategies and the artificial market evolve side by side.

Defined by Manners, it acknowledges the normative foundations of the European project, examines how Europe acts to (re)shape internationally accepted norms, and makes the claim that Europe ought to influence external partners' conception of 'normal' behaviour in pursuit of a just global order. This article, however, argues that a moral economy perspective is central to a critical reorientation of the concept of normative power towards appraisal of discrepancies between nominal EU norms and material EU policy outcomes. Examining Europe's 'normative power' in its relations with the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries, it demonstrates how amoral economy of ACP-EU ties has been instituted in negotiation with European ethical norms as to solidarity with 'the poor'. Nevertheless, the moral economy of ACP-EU ties is seen not to be 'moral' in terms of outcomes for vulnerable citizens in ACP countries. Rather the embedding of moral norms concerning pro-poor 'development' has rationalised asymmetric economic ties. 'Normative power' is understood as the EU's utilisation of moral norms in the public legitimisation and self-rationalisation of geopolitical interest and commercial gain in its relations with external 'partners'.","Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Langan, M (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, A99 Pathfoot Bldg, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",mark.langan@stir.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,42,45,2,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The model incorporates the actions of heterogeneous housing consumers, developers, and farmer/landowners who make economic decisions in land and housing markets. The model allows for population growth and simulates the evolution of land use patterns and prices over a 20-year time period. Zoning regulations in the form of minimum lot size restrictions imposed in an outlying area are shown to have effects that vary with the stringency of the regulations: 2-acre minimum lot sizes have little effect on the spatial patterns of development, but they do increase land and housing prices and result in higher incomes in the region: 5-acre minimum lot sizes push development toward the city center, leaving agricultural land in the zoned region undeveloped until quite late in the simulation period. While house prices are higher with 5-acre zoning, land prices in the zoned region fall, highlighting the countervailing influences of lot size restrictions on land prices. The new modeling approach allows for the tracking of the transitional dynamics of development, both over space and time as the urban area grows. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The Russian authorities' 'official nationality' is moderate in aspiration. However, the effect is less benign because the Kremlin both mobilises extreme nationalism for regime goals and suppresses it when it becomes destabilising. This approach prevents nationalism either of extreme or moderate orientation becoming an influential, independent force in Russian politics. Such conflicting imperatives make Russia a more unpredictable international partner than if its policies were founded on a consistent ideological nationalism.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh EH8 9YD, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"March, L (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Room 3-08,Chrystal Macmillan Bldg,15A George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9YD, Midlothian, Scotland.",l.march@ed.ac.uk,,"March, Luke/0000-0002-2974-2134",,,,,99,35,41,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,3,,,SI,,401.0,425,,10.1080/09668136.2012.661927,0.0,,,25,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,943ZT,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304167900002,0

First, the article examines how the IMF made the issue of capital account liberalisation 'legible' through constructing a particular 'legibility map' on capital mobility, which was rigorously promoted across its membership. Second, the article explores the processes through which the IMF's legibility map on capital mobility was accepted by the organisation's member states. The article traces debates within the IMF Executive Board relating to the decision to amend the IMF's Articles of Agreement to give the organisation a formal mandate and jurisdiction over capital account liberalisation to complement its existing mandate and jurisdiction over current account transactions. By tracing the negotiations on this amendment proposal, the article illustrates how the IMF used the ambiguities inherent within its cognitive map on capital account liberalisation to persuade member countries of the need to amend its Articles of Agreement. In the wake of the Asian crisis, however, the persuasiveness of the IMF's policy preferences on capital mobility quickly declined in tandem with a broader deterioration in the organisation's cognitive authority in the world economy.","Univ Trento, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Moschella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Trento, Italy.",manuela.moschella_1@unitn.it,,"Moschella, Manuela/0000-0002-3159-9533",,,,,58,12,14,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It was tested regarding to five synthetic antioxidants: Baynox plus, BHT, BHA, Baynox and Vitablend bioprotect 350. Vitablend bioprotect 350 produced the greatest delay in the induction period, about 20 hours while the other four compounds produced a delay for around 8 to 10 hours. Oxidation stability of biodiesel is an important issue because fatty acid methyl esters are more sensitive to oxidative degradation than mineral fuel. Therefore, in the latest European specification for biodiesel a minimum value of 6 h is specified for the induction period at 110 degrees C as measured by the Rancimat instrument. In order to reach that value the use of additional antioxidants is required.","[Mursec, Bogomir; Lakota, Miran; Stajnko, Dents; Vindis, Peter; Rakun, Jurij; Berk, Peter] Univ Maribor, Fak Kmetijstvo Biosistemske Vede, Hoce 2311, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Mursec, B (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fak Kmetijstvo Biosistemske Vede, Pivola 10, Hoce 2311, Slovenia.",,,,,,,,4,0,1,0,6,AGRONOMSKI FAKULTET SVEUCILISTA U ZAGREBU,10000 ZAGREB,"SVETOSIMUNSKA 25, 10000 ZAGREB, CROATIA",1333-2651,,,ACT TASKS AGRIC ENG,,,2012,40.0,,,,,,127.0,132,,,,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BCA45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309447100012,0

The last two levels of training and professional learning allow one, after presenting his/her Dissertation Paper and the PhD Thesis, to get his/her Practice License, which has two professional levels: the specialist level and the expert level, in a certain field of Forensic Biology, levels that impose certain limits in what the elaboration of the expertise is concerned.","[Sirbu, Vasile] Iasi Al I Cuza Univ, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Sandu, Ion] Iasi Al I Cuza Univ, ARHEOINVEST Interdisciplinary Platform, Iasi 700506, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Sirbu, V (通讯作者)，Iasi Al I Cuza Univ, Iasi 700505, Romania.",sirbu@uaic.ro; sandu_i03@yahoo.com,"Sandu, Ion/B-5797-2012",,"POSDRU, Promoting Scientific Research from the field of Forensics in the Legal Activity [86/1.2/S162307]","POSDRU, Promoting Scientific Research from the field of Forensics in the Legal Activity","This research was financially supported by the POSDRU, Promoting Scientific Research from the field of Forensics in the Legal Activity (Grant NO.86/1.2/S162307).",,13,4,4,0,19,HONG KONG EDUCATION SOC,TSEUNG KWAN O,"FLAT 16E BLOCK 3 THE PINNACLE, 8 WANG HANG RD, TSEUNG KWAN O, NEW TERRITORIES 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-988-19750-3-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,425.0,+,,,,,,3,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BET96,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318122400075,0

Therefore, various countries are competing on different market segment by specializing in different market niches based on the availability of resources and trade opportunities in the country (Cattaneo, 2009). During the Asia Financial Crisis in 1997, Malaysia's healthcare industry particularly the private healthcare sector with the encouragement from the government started promoting medical tourism industry in the country. Looking into this scenario, the purpose of the study is to identify factors that contribute to the sustainability of medical tourism industry in Malaysia through customer satisfaction from the aspects of pricing strategies, medical care and medical practices. Pricing strategies will be examined from the view of lower cost medical procedures, cheaper hospitals charges, lower travel and accommodation cost for patients and family with affordable air travel. Meanwhile, medical care will be analyzed by quality medical care by physicians, personalized care by nurses and support services, customer services, communication, transportation, admission and discharge procedures, care during recuperation period, quality accreditation and waiting hours. Whereas medical practices will be observed through pre-appointment with doctors, treatments success rate, ethics in medical treatment especially in transplant tourism and reproductive tourism and continuity of care after treatment. The main implication of the study is focused towards the management of healthcare centers to sustain competitive advantage in the medical tourism industry in terms of customer satisfaction through available resources.","[Thilagavathi; Chelliah, Shankar] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, Georgetown, Pulau Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,,"Chelliah, Shankar/I-1995-2012",,,,,,39,0,0,0,17,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,331.0,342,,,,,,12,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600029,0

In contrast, higher levels of work intensity increase fatigue and stress and undermine work-life balance.

In southern Europe these consequences resulted in specific dynamics. In Portugal, several districts show a decline in agriculture, which is important in order to analyse the past dynamics and to identify future trends. The present paper proposes a methodological approach that combines the use of a multivariate Biplot method with a geographic information system (GIS). This approach was applied to the main land uses and crops' dynamics in Portugal's municipalities. Results show that this methodology is able to provide a detailed insight into the main changes in land uses and crops and to identify trends, since it is a very useful tool for policy evaluation and implementation.","[de Sousa Xivier, Antonio Manuel; Costa Freitas, Maria de Belem] Univ Algarve, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol Faro, Faro, Portugal",Universidade do Algarve,"Xivier, AMD (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol Faro, Faro, Portugal.",,"Freitas, Maria/HZJ-0739-2023; Costa+Freitas, Maria de Belem/ADX-5830-2022; Xavier, Antônio R/F-1950-2017; Xavier, Antonio/V-7299-2017","Costa+Freitas, Maria de Belem/0000-0001-7645-7099; Xavier, Antonio/0000-0002-8158-3732",FCT (Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation),FCT (Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge partial financial support from FCT (Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation), program POCT (Science and Technology Operational Program).",,28,4,5,0,6,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2014,13.0,4,,,,,63.0,71,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CD5HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351118700008,0

However, the estimation may be wrong if the profiles of motorists are different at different times of day. This study uses a survival model to examine the demographic and socioeconomic profiles of motorists at different times of day at congested locations in southern California, by using on-road remote-sensing measurements and license plates images obtained in 2007 and 2008 by the California South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). More than 80,000 vehicles were observed from fifteen selected study sites over fifteen days. Their plates, through anonymized registration records, revealed addresses at the census block group level, which have homogenous profiles by construction. Motorists' profiles at different times of day display large variation, however, according to extended Cox model with a non-parametric baseline hazard, which is used to accommodate both the time-invariant and time-varying effects of the covariates. This study thus proposes a new approach to examine heterogeneity among motorists. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Lee, J. F.

The stock of FDI grew at an average annual growth rate of 49 per cent over the past decade reaching US$85.4billion or nearly 25 per cent of GDP in 2011. FDI flows have not recovered from the global financial crises. Most FDI stock is concentrated in finance, construction and real estate. Recent greenfield FDI is concentrated in construction, while more than half of the top merger and acquisition deals took place in finance, transportation, communications and utilities. The list of top OECD home countries for FDI in the UAE included Chile, Denmark, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Switzerland, UK and the US. Though investment policy limits foreign investment and reduces competition, the UAE has undertaken reforms and contracted investment treaties that have encouraged investment. Efforts are under way to speed up the ratification of a new foreign investment law, which removes several of the current legal barriers to FDI and offers foreign investors similar rights to those of UAE nationals.

This image is perceived to assist people in understanding the city, finding their way, and recalling the city. The quality of the image affects individuals' abilities in way-finding. This is especially important for cosmopolitan and global cities such as London in order to preserve resources and time, manage travel costs, limit pollution (air or noise) and enhance these cities as places to live, work and visit. This research examines the cognitive maps of London drawn by a sample of its residents to discover how different modes of transportation and GPS usage could affect individuals' urban images. Such research is useful for town planners, local government departments, and urban and transport planners because of the way it considers the legibility of London as and provides a tool to study individuals' urban images. 101 participants were recruited with at least a two-year residency from both genders (38.6% females and 61.4% males) with the average age of 33.88 and S.D. = 10.63. The results suggest car use has a positive correlation with seeing London in city scale and GPS usage has a negative correlation. Whilst recent studies have shown that there are differences between active travel modes (e.g., walking, bicycle riding or driving a car) and passive modes (e.g., as a passenger taking a bus, train or taxi), this study indicates that GPS usage also influences cognitive maps, with a negative correlation found between GPS usage and drawing maps on a city scale. Other significant associations were found for the car drivers with a positive relation with the number of roads mentioned on the maps, seeing London in city scale and having a two-dimensional facade image of the city in mind.

The Kuban' Cossacks' answer was to justify Cossacks' estate particularism for the sake of 'civic unity' by implementing separatism in the name of 'self-determination'. The result was the emergence of a Cossack nation-building movement during the civil wars, which pursued the separation of a Cossack state from Bolshevik Russia.","Daejeon Univ, Taejon 300716, South Korea",Daejeon University,"Koo, JJ (通讯作者)，Daejeon Univ, Daehak Ro 62, Taejon 300716, South Korea.",jjjkoo@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,NOV 26,2014,66.0,10,,,,,1649.0,1678,,10.1080/09668136.2014.967554,0.0,,,30,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AS9HR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344554500004,0

A nationwide pattern of agricultural consolidation during the 1990s (featuring rural depopulation and a reduction in cultivated area and herd sizes upon the termination of Soviet-era subsidization levels) has had decidedly different outcomes in different parts of the vast Russian countryside. This paper - using Stavropol' as a surrogate for regions which by physical attributes, location, and human capital are best positioned to support agricultural activity - identifies a number of developments that may signal a new growth trajectory for agriculture in Russia: evolving specialization of former socialized farms in response to market conditions (in Stavropol' involving the shrinkage of animal husbandry and the release of surplus labor); increased levels of absentee (corporate) ownership of farmland in the more favorable locations; decoupling of the economic fate of large farms (success) from local municipal budgets (deficiency); and the expansion of non-Russian ethnic communities in the countryside, with attendant land use changes.","[Ioffe, Grigory] Radford Univ, Dept Geospatial Sci, Radford, VA 24142 USA; [Nefedova, Tatyana] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Moscow V71, Russia; [de Beurs, Kirsten] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Radford University; Russian Academy of Sciences; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Ioffe, G (通讯作者)，Radford Univ, Dept Geospatial Sci, Radford, VA 24142 USA.",gioffe@radford.edu,"Nefedova, Tatiana G./V-6050-2018; de Beurs, Kirsten/GQH-8453-2022","de Beurs, Kirsten/0000-0002-9244-3292",,,,,17,11,13,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

A survey of consumer attitudes on electric cars was conducted in Manitoba from late 2011 to early 2012. It utilizes two price assessment methods. The van Westendorp price sensitivity method (PSM) shows the acceptable price range for EVs to be $22,000-27,500. This range closely matches average price range for sales of conventional cars during the same period. The willingness-to-pay method reveals consumers are unwilling to pay large premiums for EVs, even when given information on future fuel savings. A consumer group with experience or exposure to EVs is somewhat different. Nearly 25% of these people are willing to pay a premium of up to $10,000. Different interpretations can be drawn from these responses, calling for further research. An apparent policy opportunity involves consumer education to enhance knowledge and facilitate EV purchase decisions. Survey results also support the hypothesis that EV rollout has focused too much on technology, and not enough on consumers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

National Party Competition on the EU and the Euro Crisis,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"While European issues have, for a long time, played hardly any role in national elections and party politics, the EU has seen a continuous increase in politicization throughout the last decades. So far, however, contestation has been restricted largely to constitutional issues, and has been driven mainly by Eurosceptic parties that challenged mainstream parties' positive attitudes towards EU integration. This article discusses to what extent the euro crisis has added to this a left-right conflict between mainstream parties about their different views on European policies. It argues that the potential for such debates across the EU remains restricted. While the euro crisis has clearly increased the saliency of European issues, overall the incentive structure of mainstream parties in many Member States still works against publicly visible discussions among them. The plausibility of the argument is demonstrated through a comparison of interparty debates on the euro crisis in Austria and Germany.","[Miklin, Eric] Salzburg Univ, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria",Salzburg University,"Miklin, E (通讯作者)，Salzburg Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Rudolfskai 42, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",eric.miklin@sbg.ac.at,,,,,,,21,16,16,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

To address this gap, this article explores the relationship between external perceptions and effectiveness by considering the case of climate change in which, despite broadly favourable external perceptions, EU external effectiveness has been somewhat limited. It uses the case of Chinese and Indian relations with the EU on climate change to illustrate that the findings of the external perceptions literature should be interpreted in the light of the dynamics of specific policy areas as well as broader changes in the context of world politics. The argument is illustrated using the example of negotiations on the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012, which shows how, under certain circumstances, positive external perceptions may in fact limit external effectiveness.","[Torney, Diarmuid] TAPIR Transatlant Fellowship Programme, Berlin, Germany; [Torney, Diarmuid] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Torney, D (通讯作者)，43 Albert Rd, Glenageary, Dublin, Ireland.",diarmuidtorney@gmail.com,,"Torney, Diarmuid/0000-0003-4156-9044",,,,,54,21,21,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Moreover, it is the first study which looks at the role of importing, exporting and FDI simultaneously in the context of a global economic recession. We use a tailor-made representative dataset that covers all enterprises from the manufacturing sector with at least 20 employees. Our most striking result is to demonstrate the disadvantage of exporting for the chances of survival of a firm during the crisis in western Germany. Importing instead reveals a positive correlation with survival and firms that both export and import do not show a different exit risk relative to non-traders. A plausible explanation is that in a global recession, deteriorating markets abroad cause demand losses for exporters and improved conditions on factor markets which result in an advantage for firms sourcing from factor markets abroad. Two-way traders do not show a link with exit risk, supporting the idea that they were able to outweigh their losses from exporting with their gains from importing, in what could be called an export-import hedge. Furthermore, we cannot support the hypothesis that foreign multinationals are more volatile during times of economic crisis.","[Wagner, Joachim; Geluebcke, John P.

The tour product is composed of predesigned tours and optional tours. Consumers are sensitive to the price and the availability of optional tours, represented as the ratio of optional tours. The authors analyse how the ratio of optional tours to predesigned tours affects each player's equilibrium decisions given three different consumer attitudes towards optional tours. They find that when the channel is coordinated and the ratio of optional tours is sufficiently large, the local operator may reduce commissions. To curb the impacts of lowering commissions, the authors introduce a tax mechanism aimed at optional tours.

Using a large panel of worker-level data from Britain, we first demonstrate the existence of an urban premium for wage levels, which increases in city size. We next provide evidence of a city size premium on wage growth, but show that this effect is driven purely by the increase in wage that occurs in the first year that a worker moves to a larger location. Controlling for sorting on the basis of unobservables we find no evidence of an urban wage growth premium. Experience in cities does have some impact on wage growth, however. Specifically, we show that workers who have at some point worked in a city experience faster wage growth than those who have never worked in a city. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our contribution is to use unique UK survey data that contain (potentially biased) assessments of each child's mental state from three observers (parent, teacher and child), together with expert (quasi-)diagnoses, using an assumption of optimal diagnostic behaviour to adjust for reporting bias. We use three alternative restrictions to identify the effect of mental disorders on educational progress. Maternal education and mental health, family income and major adverse life events are all significant in explaining child mental health, and child mental health is found to have a large influence on educational progress. Our preferred estimate is that a one-standard-deviation reduction in true' latent child mental health leads to a 2- to 5-month loss in educational progress. We also find a strong tendency for observers to understate the problems of older children and adolescents compared to expert diagnosis.

For every dichotomisation of the income distribution into poorer and richer parts, the decomposition allows to detect the change in the relative income gap between the two parts and the reranking between poorer and richer individuals. This decomposition approach is particularly suitable when analysts split the population between the individuals initially below the poverty line and those above the poverty line, since the decomposition allows to capture the effects of reranking and disproportional growth in income between poor and non-poor individuals and to compare these effects with those detected for the entire population. An application to Italian income data illustrates the proposed decomposition.","Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Econ Metodi Quantitativi & Strategie, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Mussini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Econ Metodi Quantitativi & Strategie, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",mauro.mussini1@unimib.it,,,,,,,29,4,4,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

A long-term data analysis suggests that the poor performance of the Italian economy cannot be blamed on an unfortunate business cycle contingency. Other countries of the euro area have shown better performance, and the macroeconomic data indicate that the Italian economy has not grown at the same rate as these other European economies. We investigate the sources of economic fluctuations in Italy by applying the business cycle accounting procedure introduced by Chari et al. (Econometrica 75(3):781-836, 2007). We analyze the relative importance of efficiency, labor, investment and government wedges for business cycles in Italy during the 1982-2008 period. We find that individual wedges have played different roles during this period; however, the efficiency wedge is shown to be the factor most responsible for the stagnation phase that began in approximately 1995. Our findings also show that the decline in labor market distortions that occurred in Italy during the 1990s alleviated the stagnation effect somewhat and prevented an even more abrupt slowdown in per capita output growth.","[Orsi, Renzo] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy; [Turino, Francesco] Univ Alicante, Dept Econ, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",University of Bologna; Universitat d'Alacant,"Orsi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, Bologna, Italy.",renzo.orsi@unibo.it; fturino@ua.es,"Turino, Francesco/H-6947-2015","Turino, Francesco/0000-0003-4816-2319",,,,,24,5,6,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

He argued that the exports of primary products to industrializing North-Western countries were the main source of growth and that exports of silk stimulated the industrialization of the North-West (the industrial triangle). However, the benefits did not extend to the rest of the country. In this paper, we argue that this view is not supported by the trade data. Italian exports grew slowly relative to European and world trade, and exports from the North grew less than the total.

The decision in this natural experiment is made by groups of two or three persons. This setup enables the decision-making process to be studied with regard to group and communication characteristics. The contestants show fairly risk averse behavior. There is also a significant heterogeneity in attitude to risk. In particular, all-female groups are much less likely to go for the risky option. Furthermore, decision-making behavior appears to vary across differently composed groups and prior performance. The study also documents the importance of discussions: The propensity to gamble increases with discussion length, and the correlation between communication content and the final choice is strong, indicating that time and subjective context are important features of decisions made under risk.","[Keldenich, Klemens; Klemm, Marcus] Ruhr Grad Sch Econ, Essen, Germany; [Keldenich, Klemens] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Klemm, Marcus] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Klemm, Marcus] German Fed Stat Off, German Council Econ Experts, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Ruhr University Bochum,"Klemm, M (通讯作者)，German Fed Stat Off, German Council Econ Experts, Gustav Stresemann Ring 11, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany.",marcus.klemm@rub.de,,,,,,,38,1,1,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2014,77.0,2,,,,,243.0,274,,10.1007/s11238-013-9398-8,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AL2ZX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338995800006,0

Using annual data for five countries for the period 1840-1920, this article shows that growth in exports had a significant effect on the growth of bank liabilities (deposits plus note issues). For the most part, changes in banking laws did not have a significant effect on the development of banking. This latter result likely reflects heterogeneity in the meaning of changes, as well as the potential dominance of de facto political factors in shaping the importance of de jure legal changes.

Natsdems, who are simultaneously pro-European and democratic but also xenophobic, and who target an audience among the urban middle classes, reflect a fundamental shift in Russian society.

This student mobility is considered as a type of tourist activity and the term 'international academic tourism' is applied to it. This paper presents an empirical analysis, using the system generalized method of moments estimator for dynamic panel data models. The purpose is to analyse the economic and other determinants of tourism demand in the European Region Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students (Erasmus) based on inbound student and work placement mobility data during the exchange period from 2000 to 2010. The econometric results suggest that tourism demand is mainly driven by factors that are not strictly economic, such as relevant aspects of the destination chosen and preferences related to travel, the role of the tertiary education sector and the contribution of the Erasmus student mobility programme in the destination country. These findings have important implications for tourism policymakers.","[Cerdeira Bento, Joao Paulo] Univ Aveiro, Res Unit Governance Competitiveness & Publ Policy, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Cerdeira Bento, Joao Paulo] Univ Aveiro, Dept Econ Management & Ind Engn, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Bento, JPC (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, Res Unit Governance Competitiveness & Publ Policy, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",jpbento@ua.pt,"Bento, João/AFF-8431-2022","Bento, João/0000-0002-1145-9664",,,,,80,24,24,6,63,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

I find that tuition and fees are 1.5 % lower during gubernatorial election years than in non-election years. No similar cycle is found in private tuition and fees. Using a newly constructed dataset, I then explore the variation in electoral competition in gubernatorial and state legislative elections within states over time to uncover the underlying electoral incentives creating the cycle. The results suggest that the tuition cycle is not designed to increase the reelection prospects of governors as standard theories would predict. I find that tuition decreases during gubernatorial election years as the reelection prospects of the incumbent governor increases. Instead, the evidence suggests that popular governors use lower tuition as political pork to expand party power in the state by capturing swing districts in concurrent state legislative elections. I find that the magnitude of the cycle increases with the level of competition in state house elections and that the effect is concentrated among those districts held by the opposition party, particularly if those opposition districts are populated with voters likely to be responsive to tuition as a policy lever. These results reveal important dynamics about party competition within states in the United States and suggest that the electoral incentives driving political budget cycles can be complex.","Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, Kent, OH 44242 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Reynolds, CL (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",creynol9@kent.edu,"Reynolds, Curtis/AGN-6840-2022","Reynolds, Curtis/0000-0003-3409-743X",,,,,42,5,12,0,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The Heckscher-Ohlin model, for instance, predicts that the ideological left in the developing world will favour trade liberalization. Other research, specifically on trade agreements, suggests that leftist governments sign such treaties to credibly signal a commitment to sound economic policies. In light of these predictions, it is perhaps surprising that many left-wing Latin American governments have been especially averse to signing PTAs. In this article, I provide an explanation for the partisan left's disposition toward trade agreements. First, I identify the ways in which PTAs can be difficult to reconcile with hardline or populist left-wing governance. Second, I explore the conditions under which left governments are most inclined to sign trade agreements. I anticipate that regional commonalities and shared partisanship increase the prospects for cooperation. A statistical analysis of PTA signing in 18 Latin American countries, as well as a more in-depth treatment of several cases, yields results consistent with my expectations. These findings have implications for the literature on the political economy of trade agreements as well as the scholarship on globalization in the Latin American context.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Galantucci, R (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",,,,,,,,68,4,4,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We show that the transmission is asymmetric depending on the extention of the deviation of the actual policy rate from the one required by the Taylor rule.

Despite the fundamental importance of constitutions, we know surprisingly little about whether constitutional change is achieved by changing the explicit wording of the constitutional document, or by way of changing the meaning of the constitution while leaving the constitutional text unaltered. Which is the more common method and what variations in the use of these different methods are there in democratic political systems? This study systematically compares the use of explicit and implicit constitutional change in European Union (EU) Member States. The results show that implicit constitutional change is the more frequently used method, but also reveal substantial differences between EU countries. The article closes by discussing the road towards a theory of constitutional change. It does so by presenting five testable propositions that could lay the foundation for a theory of constitutional change.","[Karlsson, Christer] Uppsala Univ, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Karlsson, C (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Govt, Box 514, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",Christer.Karlsson@statsvet.uu.se,"Karlsson, Christer/W-2341-2019","Karlsson, Christer/0000-0002-4702-788X",,,,,20,4,5,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

More specifically, the paper explores the finite sample properties of the pre-test estimators introduced in Florax et al. (2003), which are based on Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests, within the context of a Monte Carlo study. The performance of those estimators is compared with that of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator of the encompassing model. We find that, even in a very simple setting, the bias of the estimates generated by pre-testing strategies can be very large and the empirical size of tests can differ substantially from the nominal size. This is in contrast to the ML estimator. However, if the true data generating process corresponds to the spatial error or lag model the issues arising with the pretest estimators seem to be lessened.

In line with theoretical predictions we find that foreign-owned firms do export more goods to more countries after controlling for firm size, productivity and industry affiliation.

All Member States must operate a Solvit centre within their administrations. Using a governmentality approach, the article investigates the normative underpinnings of the technologies deployed by Solvit and the experts which operate them. A survey study of the Solvit network shows the development of an EU identity and a cognitive judicialization which contributes to a depoliticization of issues. This allows Solvit to expand its remit from ex post monitoring to ex ante regulation.

The perspective of different generations reveals the rise of ethnic (local) interests and the disconnection of everyday life from official goals. It also shows that writers who worked in official channels reduced their participation in indoctrination processes and significantly influenced the mobilisation of national identity.,"Lithuanian Inst Hist, LT-01108 Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of History,"Ivanauskas, V (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Hist, Kraziu G 5, LT-01108 Vilnius, Lithuania.",vilius.ivanauskas@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,6,6,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,APR 21,2014,66.0,4,,,,,645.0,665,,10.1080/09668136.2014.897429,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AH0YU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335847500007,0

The purported goal of these rules was to provide temporary relief to REITs facing cash flow problems. We investigate how the introduction of these rules affects dividend policy of REITs. Surprisingly, we document that only 17 REITs chose to issue elective stock dividends. We examine the characteristics of these REITs and find that their cash flows are similar to REITs that do not select these dividends. This suggests that cash flow problems are unlikely to be the primary determinant of the ESD issuance decision. Instead, our findings indicate the decision to pay ESDs is related to the level of loans that are close to maturity, REIT size, growth prospects and poor performance during the financial crisis. Furthermore, we find that the same factors determine the ratio, amount and frequency of stock dividends issued by these REITs. We also examine the response of shareholders to ESDs announcements and find positive abnormal returns surrounding these dividend announcements.","[Devos, Erik] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Econ & Finance, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Spieler, Andrew] Hofstra Univ, Dept Finance, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA; [Tsang, Desmond] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; Hofstra University; McGill University,"Devos, E (通讯作者)，Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Econ & Finance, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",hdevos@utep.edu; andrew.c.spieler@hofstra.edu; desmond.tsang@mcgill.ca,"Tsang, Desmond/O-6079-2017; devos, erik/Q-9341-2019; Spieler, Andrew/AAU-5514-2021","Spieler, Andrew/0000-0002-8812-7676",,,,,57,6,8,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2014,42.0,1,,,,,33.0,70,,10.1111/reec.12007,0.0,,,38,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,AB1NC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331557900002,0

We use an original dataset of 9,555 farms for the period 2003-2007 drawn up from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and three different econometric models to explain the volatility of crop income. The results are contrasted between the specialization of the farms and the two countries. Italian farms use management tools (European payments, crop insurance and inputs) to improve their income and reduce its volatility. French farms use the same tools to raise incomes and their volatility and tend to substitute European payments with production. These results question the efficiency of structural policies aimed at stabilizing farmers' incomes.","[Enjolras, Geoffroy] Univ Pierre Mendes France, Ctr Etud & Rech Appl Gest, Grenoble, France; [Capitanio, Fabian] Univ Napoli Federico II Italy, Naples, Italy; [Aubert, Magali] INRA, UMR MOISA, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Adinolfi, Felice] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Med Vet, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); University of Naples Federico II; INRAE; University of Bologna,"Enjolras, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pierre Mendes France, Ctr Etud & Rech Appl Gest, Grenoble, France.",,"Capitanio, Fabian/E-7806-2011; Enjolras, Geoffroy/GRI-9967-2022; Aubert, Magali/JRW-7575-2023; Aubert, Magali/GXV-6317-2022; Capitanio, Fabian/J-2815-2016","Enjolras, Geoffroy/0000-0003-3034-7745; Capitanio, Fabian/0000-0003-0327-8019; ADINOLFI, FELICE/0000-0002-8181-5492; AUBERT, Magali/0000-0002-3905-4298",,,,,48,29,30,2,22,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2014,13.0,1,,,,,31.0,40,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AG2VW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335276200005,0

To take account of censoring, a two-step method is used. In the first step, the probabilities of purchasing milk, carbonated soft drinks and other soft drinks are estimated by probit models. The APC variables are highly significant. Older cohorts have higher probabilities of purchasing milk and lower probabilities of purchasing carbonated soft drinks than younger cohorts. In the second step, the probability density functions and the cumulative density function are used to correct for censoring. In the corrected demand system, there are positive cohort and negative age effects for milk. These effects suggest that the replacement of older by younger cohorts, in an increasingly older population, will result in reduced per capita purchases of milk. For carbonated soft drinks, there are no cohort or negative age effects, while there are positive age but no cohort effects for other soft drinks.","[Gustavsen, Geir Waehler; Rickertsen, Kyrre] Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Rickertsen, Kyrre] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, NO-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Rickertsen, K (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",geir.gustavsen@nilf.no; kyrre.rickertsen@umb.no,"Rickertsen, Kyrre/AAG-6921-2020","Rickertsen, Kyrre/0000-0002-5068-0847",,,,,32,5,6,0,18,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We do this using trading and performance data for 159 REMFs across the period 1998-2008. In support of the view that Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) stocks are relatively more transparent, we find that stock herding by REMFs is lower in REIT stocks than other stock. Herding behavior in our data reveals a tendency for managers to sell winners, reflective of the disposition effect. We find low overall levels of REMF momentum trading, but further evidence of the disposition effect when momentum trading is segregated into buy-sell dimensions. We test the robustness of our analysis using style analysis, and by reference to the level of fund dividend distribution. Our results for this are consistent with our conjecture about the role of transparency in herding, but they provide no new insights in relation to the momentum-trading dimensions of our analysis. Summarizing what are complex interrelationships, we find that neither herding nor momentum trading are demonstrably superior investment strategies for REMFs.","[Ro, SeungHan] Konkuk Univ, Dept Real Estate Studies, Seoul 143301, South Korea; [Gallimore, Paul] Univ Reading, Sch Real Estate & Planning, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England",Konkuk University; University of Reading,"Ro, S (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Real Estate Studies, Seoul 143301, South Korea.",shro@konkuk.ac.kr; p.gallimore@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,12,14,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2014,42.0,1,,,,,190.0,222,,10.1111/1540-6229.12024,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,AB1NC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331557900006,0

Utilising liner shipping network configurations, this paper assesses the impact of freight traffic consolidation in the container port industry by exploring the spatial pattern of traffic flow movements and identifying the variety of roles that container ports play within this context. On the basis of the network concept, the spatial inequality of freight traffic consolidation is determined by the density and direction of all meaningful connections (i.e. significant flows) identified by applying Multiple Linkage Analysis (MLA) to an initial traffic flow matrix. The effectiveness of the chosen methodology is tested empirically using a sample comprising the 18 major container ports in East Asia, together with another 21 important container ports located on the East-West trading route. Based on this sample network, the spatial structure of traffic flow consolidation reveals the nature and structure of hub-and-spoke operations within a port system, the relative hub-dependence of ports, the variety of roles which individual ports play within the overall structure of inter-port interactions and the hierarchical configuration of the port industry structure. The paper concludes that MLA offers new insights into the distributional inequality of traffic flows, the spatial and economic interactions between ports and the extent to which hinterlands overlap. Furthermore, the analysis clearly shows that inter-port relationships can no longer be evaluated as isolated phenomena; any change in a specific port's competitiveness will directly impact upon the structure of the whole maritime transportation system. Port authorities and terminal operators will need, therefore, to carefully analyse and disentangle specific inter-port relationships in order to provide the most appropriate basis for their decision making.

To this end, we consider certain methods which have scarcely been used in the literature on trade integration. First, we measure trade integration through a set of indicators which control not only for how open economies are, but also for their degrees of connectedness in the World Trade Web. Second, we assess how these indicators have evolved over time, what the likely steady state distribution might be, and whether results could differ depending on a variety of weighting schemes (GDP, population). The results show that, under current trends, future world trade will be much more trade-integrated, especially for the most heavily populated countries. However, there is still a long way to go before reaching the hypothetical scenario of geographically neutral trade.","[Arribas, Ivan] Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia, Spain; [Arribas, Ivan; Perez, Francisco] Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, Valencia, Spain; [Arribas, Ivan; Perez, Francisco] Ivie, Valencia, Spain; [Tortosa-Ausina, Emili] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia; Universitat Jaume I,"Tortosa-Ausina, E (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",tortosa@uji.es,"Arribas, Ivan/F-4245-2016; Tortosa-Ausina, Emili/B-1205-2017; Perez Garcia, Francisco/F-1090-2017","Arribas, Ivan/0000-0001-7600-8066; Tortosa-Ausina, Emili/0000-0002-7873-1714; Perez Garcia, Francisco/0000-0003-4724-3598",,,,,72,0,2,0,22,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Here the authors document this surge and identify variables associated with expanding self-employment. Results provide mixed evidence about the importance of capital access to self-employment growth, but reveal that different approaches are needed in different county types depending on their proximity to metro areas and population size, if the goal is to increase future rural self-employment rates. In all county types, the initial share of self-employed predicts self-employment growth, underscoring the importance of a culture favoring entrepreneurship and path dependence. Self-employment earnings and educational attainment also play significant roles, as does the ethnic diversity of the population. Population density matters in both rural and urban counties, but less so within individual rural-urban continuum code categories. State policy, especially labor market freedom, has important effects on self-employment in most county types and periods studied.","[Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, Northeast Reg Ctr Rural Dev, State Coll, PA 16802 USA; [Rupasingha, Anil] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Goetz, SJ (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, 7 Amsby Bldg, State Coll, PA 16802 USA.",sgoetz@psu.edu,,,,,,,34,25,31,0,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

A continuous-time version of the model presented in Batini and Haldane (In: Monetary policy rules. National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, pp. 157-202, 1999a) is used. The model comprises the IS equation, a supply curve and the interest parity condition. We modify the third equation to capture an impact of a domestic interest-rate hike on the speedy appreciation of local currency. We calibrate this modified model using available literature results and apply specialised software (VIKAASA) to compute the open-economy viability kernel that is a set of economic states, from which the central bank can control the economy so that it remains within a nominal constraint set. We then analyse the kernel topology and show a few stablising policies that keep the economy within the constraint set. We also discuss the robustness of such polices to shocks and parameter uncertainty and observe that viability-based policies come from models, which do not require explicit weights on the variables of interest of a central bank. We also contend that in general, viability-based policies are less likely to do damage, if the policy-maker is wrong about some aspects of the environment.","[Krawczyk, Jacek B.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Kim, Kunhong] Hallym Univ, Chunchon, South Korea",Victoria University Wellington; Hallym University,"Krawczyk, JB (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.",J.Krawczyk@vuw.ac.nz; kimku@hallym.ac.kr,"Krawczyk, Jacek B./R-1492-2019","Krawczyk, Jacek B./0000-0002-7435-4210",,,,,37,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The results rejected the Ricardian theorem but a weaker version is shown to have significant implications for the DR. If the government borrows to increase spending, private consumption is crowded out and the economy will suffer in the long run. The outcome is worst if the government borrows to deliver a tax cut. In particular, for every RD$ 1.00 of additional debt incurred to finance government primary spending, private consumption and gross domestic product (GDP) fall by a meaningful RD$ 2.15 and RD$ 1.15 respectively. If the debt is used to finance the tax cut, the fall is RD$ 2.15 in both consumption and output. Interestingly, if the government uses taxes to cover a budget deficit, the effect is neutral and consistent with Ricardian equivalence. The paper argues that fiscal distortions are in part responsible for these multipliers. Distortions are estimated to be 21 % coming from different sources including taxes evasion and fiscal drainage. These findings suggest that the DR could benefit from either reducing the level of fiscal distortions or the size and scope of the Dominican government. If, however, the government continues to pursue an active fiscal role under the current environment, it will generate an unnecessary burden to consumption and economic growth.","[Prazmowski, Peter A.] Amer Chamber Commerce Dominican Republ, Miami, FL 33102 USA; [Prazmowski, Peter A.] Grp Leon Jimenes, Miami, FL 33102 USA",,"Prazmowski, PA (通讯作者)，Amer Chamber Commerce Dominican Republ, X-16445,POB 025389, Miami, FL 33102 USA.",pprazmowski@live.com,,,,,,,48,1,1,1,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We find that obese white teenage girls are less likely to have been in a romantic relationship compared to their non-obese counterparts. In addition, obese white girls are less likely to ever have had sex (intercourse) or to ever have been intimate. There are no systematic differences in relationship experiences and sexual behaviors between obese and non-obese black girls. Overall, the estimated relationships are very robust to common environmental influences at the school-level and to the inclusion of proxies for low self-esteem, attitudes toward sex and interviewer assessment of appearance and personality.

Associated driving risks can be reduced by better maintenance of roadway infrastructure, enforcement of speed limits or other traffic laws. Given the preventive nature of these policies and regulations, accurate predictions of environmental attributes are needed. Currently, most of road safety prediction models are based on deterministic weather forecasts which are not able to capture changes in the likelihood of collision occurrence. As a result, probabilistic forecast is required to improve decision making, mainly in winter. In this paper, a stochastic approach to modeling highway collisions in winter time is considered which enables better assessment of driving conditions and a more accurate prediction. A logistic regression model with covariates is applied to crash data where environmental characteristics are modeled as a finite state space homogeneous multivariate discrete time Markov chain. After fitting the model, weather prediction as well as the conditional predictive probability distribution of collision occurrence are obtained. As the application, the ability of the proposed model to predict hourly environmental attributes and collision occurrence is examined using real highway crash data. The performance of the developed stochastic model is compared with several existing models in the literature using actual collision data. The results demonstrate that the proposed stochastic model outperforms existing models and it accurately predicts collision occurrence in the presence of stochastically changeable winter weather conditions. As a result, the proposed probabilistic forecast model can be used as a valuable tool in a decision support system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve closer cooperation between this two systems management is necessary to meaningfully connect them. The above connection can be achieved in a way to give coherent answers to the classic questions of economic organization: what, how and for whom to produce and educate, then to elaborate the basic functional adaptation of the educational system based on the responses: 1) STRATEGIC ADAPTATION. This adjustment relates to the formation of economics identity and its economic compatible educational identity and strategic formal education planning (professions and their levels with respect to the number and structure) and defining the desired strategic quality educational outcomes. For Croatia, can be recommend the formation of economic identity in three basic areas : Mediterranean, continental Central and entrepreneurial. For strategic formal education planning is necessary to conduct screening required professions and formal educational levels (primary, secondary, tertiary, post tertiary) with respect to the required number and structure. Also i necessary to define the desired educational quality of personnel needed. 2) TACTICAL-OPERATING ADJUSTMENTS. This adjustment relates to the definition of specific tactical and operational educational outcomes at every level of the educational areas and levels of education, as well as any specific educational institutions. This refers to the specific knowledge and skills, as well as specific values, attitudes and habits, respectively professional competence. Generally speaking, the knowledge needed to achieve economic development are: factual, procedural, scientific, heuristic, managing skills and effective use of information. Values, attitudes and habits that are consistent with economic development include the value of education to economic development, such as: discipline, diligence, patience, orderliness, thrift, honesty, initiative, urgency and efficiency. This adjustment includes the sound system establishment of tactical management of human resources at the national educational system, but also the operational level of each educational institution. Educational policy should be connected in a stated way with economic policy (development strategy), and that is the way functional human capital can be formed, which will be the carrier of the future economic development, with a wide demand and supply component. Specifically meaningful national educational policy (strategy) should be associated with all other sectoral, development and economic strategy in particular.","[Bogdanovic, Mario] Fac Econ Split, Split 21000, Croatia; [Pozega, Zeljko] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Bogdanovic, M (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Split, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",mbogdan2011@gmail.com; zpozega@efos.hr,"Bogdanović, Mario/F-7984-2017; Pozega, Zeljko/GSO-3095-2022","Bogdanović, Mario/0000-0003-3049-5342; Pozega, Zeljko/0000-0002-5113-4098",,,,,34,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,124.0,142,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600011,0

However, leafy vegetables are often overlooked by the scientific community. The objective of this research was to analyse the status of African leafy vegetables in Senegal prior to proposing action for future research and development of these species. Participatory surveys were carried out in order to inventory the various ways leafy vegetables are used, along with their constraints. Production and marketing are both exclusively ensured by women. Leafy vegetables are produced mostly in urban and peri-urban areas on small plots of less than 600 m(2). Traditional cultivation methods are often used to grow African leafy vegetables. The seeds used by farmers are a mixture of cultivars. African leafy vegetables are used as food and for medicinal purposes. They are consumed like spinach or as condiments accompanying the main course. Average daily intake is estimated at 23 g/person, which is comparable to the rate of consumption in sub-Saharan Africa (24 g/person). The average price of these vegetables is US$ 0.30, which is generally higher than other vegetables (US$ 0.19). Their contribution to the income of households can be as high as 100%. The development of ALV production is limited, however, by constraints, the most important ones being the reduction in gene-pool of certain species, poor cultivation practices, and lack of organization among stakeholders for marketing ALV. Involvement of policy-makers at the institutional and governmental levels is needed to reduce these constraints, improve production and consumption levels, and encourage access to export markets.","[Diouf, M.] Vegetable Breeder Tropicasem Technisem, Km 5,6 Bd Centenaire Commune Dakar BP 999, Dakar, Senegal; [Ba, C.

Despite efforts to lower these costs by offering new products and developing cost-comparison information sources, many new and promising inexpensive remittance methods have relatively low adoption rates. The lack of financial literacy among migrants has been identified as one potentially important barrier to competition and new product adoption. This paper presents the results of a randomized experiment designed to measure the impact of providing financial literacy training to migrants. Training appears to increase financial knowledge and information-seeking behavior and reduces the risk of switching to costlier remittance products, but it does not result in significant changes in the frequency of remitting or in the remitted amount.","[McKenzie, David; Zia, Bilal] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Gibson, John] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand",The World Bank; University of Waikato,"McKenzie, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jkgibson@waikato.ac.nz; dmckenzie@worldbank.org; bzia@worldbank.org,"Gibson, John/AAM-6159-2020","Gibson, John/0000-0003-3886-6873",,,,,30,32,39,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

We capture deep integration with a set of indices constructed in terms of policy areas covered in preferential trade agreements. We estimate an augmented gravity equation to investigate the impact of deep integration on production networks trade. The results show that on average, signing deeper agreements increases production networks trade between member countries by almost 12 percentage points. In addition, the impact of deep integration is higher for trade in automobile parts and information and technology products compared with textile products. To analyse whether higher levels of network trade increase the likelihood of signing deeper agreements, we follow the literature on the determinants of preferential trade agreements. The estimation results show that, after taking into account other PTA determinants, a ten percentage increase in the share of production network trade over total trade increases the depth of an agreement by approximately 6 percentage points. In addition, the probability of signing deeper agreements is higher for country pairs involved in North-South production sharing and for countries belonging to the Asia region.","[Orefice, Gianluca] CEPII, Paris, France; [Rocha, Nadia] WTO, Econ Res Div, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Orefice, G (通讯作者)，CEPII, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,40,93,100,6,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2014,37.0,1,,,,,106.0,136,,10.1111/twec.12076,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,287GL,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329529900007,0

Across the EU, there was a difference in the range of the bailing out of the financial sector from the public funds, reduction in economic growth and a decline in tax revenues. The result was an enormous increase in public debt, especially in the countries of the so-called periphery of the euro area. The paper deals with the prediction of the effects of loose monetary policy of the ECB associated with the historically lowest Refi rate. It also deals with the application of the negative interest rates on the sterilization of free funds of commercial banks in the ECB and the impact of this policy on the banks and the economic growth of the economies. The procedure consisted of the examining of the consequences of the debt crisis of the EU economies and of the efficiency analysis of the effect of stabilization measures of ECB on the level of public debt. The main results of the paper consist of following statements; low interest rates as the dominant tool of monetary policy of the central banks do not help to reduce public debts, although they generally reduce state costs for debt service. Loose monetary policy of the ECB is not reflected in the increase of lending to households and corporations, while doing so, there is rise of the risk that low interest would increase the likelihood of inflating asset prices and bursting of related price bubbles, especially in terms of stock markets. This may ultimately have an impact on the possible return of the crisis determined by the re-increasing involvement of investors in speculative financial instruments.","[Pavelka, Lubos] Univ Econ, Fac Commerce, Dept Int Trade, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Pavelka, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Commerce, Dept Int Trade, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",lubos.pavelka@euba.sk,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3995-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,404.0,412,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BF6XQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383767900044,0

This paper approaches the relationship between customer satisfaction and firm profitability from the perspective of the satisfaction-profit chain, which here consists of the following measures: quality and value perceived by customers, customer satisfaction, word of mouth, intent to repurchase, and firm profitability. The research focuses on one-year financial data of 80 food-manufacturing firms in the Czech Republic together with 60 to 160 customer responses to products of each firm. Findings based on correlation analysis, where the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and the distance correlation are calculated, show a positive relationship between perceived product quality, customer satisfaction, word of mouth, and intent to repurchase. The regression method of ordinary least squares shows intent to repurchase positively linked to firm profitability measured by return on assets considering liquidity and size of the firm as control variables. The method of ordinary least squares further implies that smaller firms tend to be more profitable, when the size is measured by the volume of assets.","Masaryk Univ, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Pokora, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,503.0,510,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800063,0

But urban market gardening systems are hampered by various constraints, among which is difficult access to mineral and organic fertilizer inputs. Urban areas offer a diversity of organic resources that could be used in cropping systems: but before proposing and testing fertilizers in urban agriculture, it is necessary to have an accurate description of the farming systems and soil fertility management practices of farmers, as well as the agronomic characteristics of locally available organic resources. In Mahajanga, Madagascar, a study was carried out to characterize market gardening systems with a focus on fertilization practices and their alternatives with the town resources. Cultivation and fertilization management were recorded weekly on a sample of farms (n=12) during two years, and the results were then tested through a survey on a larger sample of farmers (n=30). The market gardens were usually located around a waterhole (close to lakes or in lowlands). After the rainy season, plots of leafy vegetables, 12-14 m(2) in size, were planted progressively following the rice crop and as flood waters dried up. Each farmer had only a small plot of land and had to crop intensively. Most farmers cultivated plants with short growing cycles (e.g., 21 days), predominately Brassicaceae. Concerning soil fertility management practices, organic inputs (manure) and mineral nitrogen (urea) were mainly used. The organic or mineral fertilizer was always spread on the soil surface after crops had been transplanted, and were renewed at each planting cycle or each cut of long-cycle leafy vegetables. It is expected that fertilizers ensure three functions: fertilizer, amendment and mulch. All these functions have to be taken into account to propose new organic fertilizers as municipal wastes compost to respond to the scarcity and high cost of manure and urea.","[Ramahefarison, H.] Univ Mahajanga, BP 289, Mahajanga 401, Madagascar; [Aubry, C.] Inst Natl Rech Agronom, UMR Sadapt, INRA, F-75005 Paris, France; [Masse, D.] IRD Eco & Sols LEMSAT IRD ISRA UCAD, UMR, Inst Rech Dev, Dakar 18524, Senegal; [Rabeharisoa, L.

In order to meet the European Commission's requirements regarding the harmonization of the carcass classification systems in European Union, the two optical probes were calibrated on the same dissection trial carried out in 2007. The prediction formula for the two optical probes was calculated using the method of linear regression. However, the existing working documents do not report any tests having been done on the five principal assumptions which justify the use of linear regression models for purposes of prediction: i/ lack of multicollinearity in the predictors, ii/ linearity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables; iii/ independence of the errors; iv/ homoscedasticity of the errors and v/ normality of the error distribution. If any of these assumptions is violated, then the economic insights yielded by a regression model may be inefficient.

Using western experience in Russia, doing some bright projects to stimulate small businesses was important twenty years ago. Quantitative and qualitative parameters of SMEs in Russia lag behind most countries, largely due to the structure of its economy with the traditional dominance of large enterprises and the prevailing business climate. Small and medium-sized business in Russia is not innovative, does not perform antitrust function and does not create many jobs. Small and medium-sized business generates a positive competitive environment. But the importance of SMEs in Russia should not be exaggerated. The scale of subcontracting and franchising with independent small businesses in our country is extremely small. It happened so that the Russian economic policy and the leading part of the national political establishment were in a subordinate position in relation to the interests of a narrow circle of large businesses, mainly engaged in production and export of the most important natural resources. Manufacturing, infrastructural and other facilities of big business, its supply and marketing relations and, most importantly, its long-term economic interests focus on large enterprises and, with few exceptions, show no interest for the SMEs sector. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Russian system of economic institutions encourages big business mostly. It also proves an essential specific situation of small and medium-sized businesses in Russia. The development of Russian small and medium-sized business entirely depends on the state of the economy and the business climate in the country. The business climate in Russia does not correspond to the needs of small and medium-sized businesses. Measures to improve the business climate can potentially help Russian small and medium-sized businesses much more than the existing costly system meant to support them. It is obvious that the whole Russian system for SMEs support, fold increase in the federal budget to support Russian SMEs occurred in the recent years, is unable to compensate for a generally unfavorable business environment in Russia. It is necessary to improve the quality of investment, business climate and institutions in Russia. The real growth of the Russian SIV1Es can be expected only with the modernization, new industrialization of the Russian economy and business climate improvements.","[Vilenskiy, Alexandr] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Moscow 117901, Russia; [Vilenskiy, Alexandr] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics)","Vilenskiy, A (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Moscow 117901, Russia.",,,,,,,,3,1,1,0,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,273.0,278,,,,,,6,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900035,0

The company is aware of the necessity of their implementation, customers are calling for greener products, and companies are trying to implement environmentally friendly activities. Enterprises uphold the principles of environmentally suitable behavior, some of them are trying to use these approaches in production, others in most of their activities. Concept of innovation raises in many of us the idea of technological inventions that are the result of long efforts, activities and research work of scientists. However, innovation can be the result of operations of any enterprise, which was implemented in order to succeed in the market. These innovations can be oriented to products or business processes, or procedures, as well as marketing practices. The area of innovation is developed quite extensive, whether in Slovakia or abroad. The reason is the need for innovation in today's industry, and in all spheres of human activity, as well as customer requirements. The cooperation between enterprises of different industries is important in developing eco-innovations and may produce new, interesting and creative solutions. The partnership between companies from different industries allows access to new knowledge and its transmission creates fertile ground for innovation. Green innovations can take different forms; the main idea is, however, according to most authors, positive change for the environment. This change, whether in terms of products, processes or different business processes is now sorely needed. The paper deals with the innovation process and the implementation of innovative projects that focusing on eco-innovative products should meet certain criteria specific to green products. Whether it is the innovation of products, services or methods or processes, there is a need for the inclusion of specific requirements in the form of environmental benefits but implementation must be profitable for the companies to undertake this eco-innovation. Various approaches of eco-innovative projects can yield different results. The research carried out in Slovakia showed us a positive approach of Slovak SMEs to green innovations but the results show a relatively small percentage of the implementation of these innovations, despite many efforts. The reasons are mostly financial, personnel, legislative or resulting from the factors of the external environment that in Slovakia negatively affect businesses. Innovation as a stimulus of current economy and positive change in our society is that the economy needs, but conditions for SMEs are not appropriate and sufficient in order the innovative processes to be implemented in necessary and sufficient way. Another barrier in the development and implementation of innovations or green innovations is the lack of cooperation of subjects such as scientific and research institutions, universities with the business sector. Contribution seeks to outline possible solutions to these problems, which would strengthen the implementation success of eco-innovation processes in Slovakia.","[Zauskova, Anna; Bezakova, Zuzana] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Trnava, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Zausková, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Trnava, Slovakia.",,"Zaušková, Anna/AAB-6648-2020; UCM, FMK/D-7872-2016","Zaušková, Anna/0000-0002-5281-1556;",,,,,10,1,1,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,813.0,820,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900105,0

We argue that this conjecture is too simple and probably misleading because the depth of any given cooperative effort is in fact multidimensional. This multidimensionality manifests itself in the design characteristics of international agreements: in particular, the specificity of obligations, monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, dispute settlement mechanisms, positive incentives (assistance), and organizational structures (secretariats). We theorize that the first three of these design characteristics have negative and the latter three have positive effects on participation in international cooperative efforts. Our empirical testing of these claims relies on a dataset that covers more than 200 global environmental treaties. We find a participation-limiting effect for the specificity of obligations, but not for monitoring and enforcement. In contrast, we observe that assistance provisions in treaties have a significant and substantial positive effect on participation. Similarly, dispute settlement mechanisms tend to promote treaty participation. The main implication of our study is that countries do not appear to stay away from agreements with monitoring and enforcement provisions, but that the inclusion of positive incentives and dispute settlement mechanisms can promote international cooperation. In other words, our findings suggest that policymakers do not necessarily need to water down global treaties in order to obtain more participation.","[Bernauer, Thomas; Koubi, Vally; Spilker, Gabriele] ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bernauer, Thomas; Koubi, Vally; Spilker, Gabriele] IED, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kalbhenn, Anna] ECB, Frankfurt, Germany; [Koubi, Vally] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Bern, Switzerland; [Koubi, Vally] Univ Bern, Oeschger Inst Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; European Central Bank; University of Bern; University of Bern,"Bernauer, T (通讯作者)，ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, Zurich, Switzerland.",thbe0520@ethz.ch,"Spilker, Gabriele/GWU-7329-2022","Bernauer, Thomas/0000-0002-3775-6245",,,,,48,57,63,1,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We show that, in equilibrium, a clientele effect persists, with long-horizon buyers overwhelmingly choosing higher quality properties and short-horizon buyers settling for lower quality properties. This clientele effect creates a sample selection bias: the properties that are on the market are predominantly of lower quality. Since these are the preferred choice of short-horizon buyers, they demonstrate a faster turnover. Both the clientele effect and the selection bias are more pronounced with an increase in the variance of house quality and in the variance of the planned holding horizon. Our theoretical model supports empirical evidence on the existence of such bias in home price indices and explains it by the differences in ex ante holding horizons.","[Chernobai, Anna] Syracuse Univ, MJ Whitman Sch Management, Dept Finance, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Chernobai, Ekaterina] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Pomona, CA 91768 USA",Syracuse University; California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona,"Chernobai, A (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, MJ Whitman Sch Management, Dept Finance, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",annac@syr.edu; echer-nobai@csupomona.edu,"Chernobai, Anna/A-8973-2013",,,,,,42,7,7,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,DEC,2013,41.0,4,,,,,887.0,924,,10.1111/1540-6229.12020,0.0,,,38,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,273PU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328549000006,0

It is shown that decreases in CA deficits imply increases in tradable relative to non-tradable output and/or declines in investment. The impact of CA rebalancing' should therefore be expected to vary considerably across sectors of an economy. This intersectoral variation is studied by examining the dynamics of output, employment and prices using data for 55 sectors of the economy during 14 industrial country reversal episodes. The output and employment declines associated with CA reversals are most clearly evident in investment-related sectors, while sectors related to primary commodities generally perform relatively well following reversals. Reversals are also followed by increases in relative inflation for tradable goods sectors.","[Craighead, William D.] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Hineline, David R.] Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",Wesleyan University; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Craighead, WD (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",,,,,,,,23,3,4,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2013,36.0,12,,,,,1516.0,1541,,10.1111/twec.12069,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,273CN,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328511500004,0

If metabolism scales proportionately with stature, then relative to short individuals, taller individuals can produce more energy for a given work task. This also suggests that end-of-the-workday fatigue, or lack of energy, varies inversely with stature. We test this hypothesis with data from the 2004 Tanzanian Household Worker Survey in which workers report the extent of their fatigue at the end-of-the-workday. Ordinal latent variable parameter estimates reveal that relative to short workers, taller workers are less likely to report being tired at the end-of-the-workday. This suggests that the positive wage-height relationship also has a biological foundation whereby the energy requirements and metabolic costs associated with work effort/tasks are inversely related to stature.

Near linearity in the oil price of real-world hydrocarbon contracts also helps to explain expropriations.

We analyze how well UGBs do in containing development using fine-scale GIS data on cities in Oregon. Earlier studies on UGBs yield mixed results, with some authors finding no effects of UGBs on housing market variables and urbanization rates and others finding significant effects. A challenge in measuring these effects is that the location of the UGB is unlikely to be an exogenous determinant of a land parcel's value for development. The panel structure of our dataset allows us to estimate the UGB's effect on the probability of development using a difference-in-difference estimator applied to a narrow band of plots along each city's UGB. This estimator controls for time-invariant unobservable variables and common temporal effects among plots, thereby mitigating the potential for biased estimates due to the endogeneity of the UGB's location. We also pursue a novel approach to controlling for time-varying factors that exploits our fine-scale data. We find that UGBs contain development in many of the Oregon cities we examine, although there are some cities in which development rates are the same inside and outside of the UGB. Our results reveal that, in most cities, the effect of the UGB is small relative to pre-existing differences in development probabilities. This suggests that it may be difficult to identify UGB effects with cross-sectional data, the approach commonly taken in previous studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A well-developed literature on hiring low-skilled workers has much to say about why such zones have resulted in little employment for nearby residents of distressed areas but has not informed evaluation or policy for zones. Using the Detroit Empowerment Zone experience as a case, this article finds that referrals, usually from employees, determined hiring, resulting in industrial districts with few local workers and retail districts with many more, with workplaces segregated by race and ethnicity. Although skill requirements and screening approaches should not have excluded many qualified local workers, employers in industrial areas had negative stereotypes of workers from nearby neighborhoods. Trusted intermediaries such as community-based organizations may enable tax incentive zones to produce jobs for local workers by breaking down stereotypes and inserting a new mouth in the word-of-mouth hiring practices.","[Dewar, Margaret] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Dewar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Urban & Reg Planning Program, 2000 Bonisteel Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",medewar@umich.edu,,,,,,,53,5,6,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Amid conflicting reports from contemporaries on the effectiveness of these new courts, this essay examines their development over the first year of their existence. It argues that whilst tribunals were initially too inefficient for the regime, forcing greater central control over them, they played an important role in defining what constituted counter-revolution. In doing so, they promoted the regime's ideology, imparted an image of legality to the regime's actions, and helped the Bolsheviks to exert their control over a fragmented and diverse political landscape.","Univ Exeter, Dept Hist, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Rendle, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Hist, Amory Bldg,Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",M.Rendle@exeter.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,8,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,NOV 1,2013,65.0,9,,,SI,,1771.0,1788,,10.1080/09668136.2013.840117,0.0,,,18,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,293PA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329983700006,0

The authors argue that, unlike the international relations paradigm prevailing in studies of Russia's energy policy, the country's multiple roles in the international energy arena (as producer, consumer, exporter, importer, and transit state) warrant a more nuanced approach, reflecting Russian energy policy's flexibility over time and diversity across space. This paper endeavors, therefore, to apply a political economy and governance perspective to an understanding of the significant changes in Russia's energy policy-making regarding its dynamic energy relations with the Northeast Asia (NEA; China, Japan, and South Korea). In exploring the complex interactions between Russia's internal energy policy-making and its emerging energy relations in NEA, the authors addresses three key questions, namely: (1) how Russia's Asian energy policy corresponds to its domestic needs, (2) how much coherence in energy governance and cooperation exists between Russia and the Northeast Asian states at the institutional and organizational levels, and (3) the extent to which Russia's expectations for increased energy cooperation with the Northeast Asian states are likely to materialize.","[Shadrina, Elena] Meiji Univ, Grad Sch Governance Studies, Tokyo 101, Japan; [Bradshaw, Michael] Univ Leicester, Dept Geog, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",Meiji University; University of Leicester,"Bradshaw, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Geog, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",mjb41@leicester.ac.uk,"Bradshaw, Michael/AAL-3664-2021; Shadrina, Elena/S-4628-2019","Shadrina, Elena/0000-0002-3323-5768; Bradshaw, Michael/0000-0001-8842-3953",NERC [NE/G007748/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G007748/1] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,68,11,11,1,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

We first test whether art market price indices follow stochastic trends or whether they are stationary by means of linear unit root tests. Next, we estimate the Markov regime-switching ADF model and test whether the linear or the nonlinear regime-switching model provides a better characterization of the global art market price series. We find that all art market price indices (except for Drawings) exhibit nonlinearity. To our knowledge, our study is the first one in the literature to suggest that a nonlinear (Markov regime-switching) model provides a better characterization of the behavior of price dynamics in international art markets. In particular, our findings indicate that the market for the overall global art market, paintings, old masters, sculptures, photographs, prints, and contemporary art might indeed be stationary while exhibiting nonlinear regime-switching properties. On the other hand, the market for drawings and the Nineteenth century art are found to be nonstationary. Overall, despite the common ground of a regime-switching framework, we still find that the sub-segments of the art market have their own inner regime switching dynamics and hence they can evolve differently overtime.","[Cevik, Emrah Ismail] Bulent Ecevit Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Ekonometri Bolumu, TR-67100 Incivez, Zonguldak, Turkey; [Atukeren, Erdal] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Atukeren, Erdal] BSL Business Sch Lausanne, CH-1022 Chavannes, Switzerland; [Atukeren, Erdal] SBS Swiss Business Sch, CH-8302 Kloten, Switzerland; [Korkmaz, Turhan] Bulent Ecevit Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, TR-67100 Incivez, Zonguldak, Turkey",Bulent Ecevit University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Business School Lausanne; SBS Swiss Business School; Bulent Ecevit University,"Atukeren, E (通讯作者)，BSL Business Sch Lausanne, Rte Maladiere 21,POB 73, CH-1022 Chavannes, Switzerland.",emrahic@yahoo.com; atukeren@kof.ethz.ch; korktur@yahoo.com,"Atukeren, Erdal/J-7676-2019; Korkmaz, Turhan/AAG-7449-2020; Cevik, Emrah I/K-1967-2019","Atukeren, Erdal/0000-0001-7624-7294; Korkmaz, Turhan/0000-0001-5468-2279; Cevik, Emrah I/0000-0002-8155-1597",,,,,51,8,8,1,37,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

At its peak, malaria infected over 30% of the population. Malaria declined over the period for several reasons: improvements in public infrastructure; development of new insecticides; improvements in agriculture that promoted drainage; increases in incomes; and changes in migration patterns. This paper focuses on public works constructed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) during the 1930s and subsequent interventions during the 1940s. To estimate the relationship between these malaria programs and malaria rates, I construct a panel of annual county level malaria rates in Georgia from 1932 to 1947. Between 1932 and 1940 the malaria rate in counties that received WPA malaria projects fell from 25.9 deaths per 100,000 to 5.3 deaths per 100,000. The empirical estimates suggest that WPA malaria projects led to 9.1 fewer deaths per 100,000 or roughly 44% of the observed decline in treated counties. Additional public works constructed by the MCWA during World War II, and the introduction of DDT after 1945 completely eliminated malaria in Georgia by 1947. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Such subjective survival beliefs violate the rational expectations paradigm and are also not in line with models of rational Bayesian learning. In order to explain these empirical patterns in a parsimonious manner, we assume that self-reported beliefs express likelihood insensitivity and can, therefore, be modeled as non-additive beliefs. In a next step we introduce a closed form model of Bayesian learning for non-additive beliefs which combines rational learning with psychological attitudes in the interpretation of information. Our model gives a remarkable fit to average subjective survival beliefs reported in the Health and Retirement Study.","[Ludwig, A.] Univ Cologne, CMR, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Zimper, A.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa",University of Cologne; University of Pretoria,"Ludwig, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, CMR, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",ludwig@wiso.uni-koeln.de; alexander.zimper@up.ac.za,"Zimper, Alexander/KBQ-4867-2024","Zimper, Alexander/0000-0002-3730-3086",,,,,47,18,20,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2013,75.0,4,,,,,519.0,541,,10.1007/s11238-013-9355-6,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,216ZJ,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324325700003,0

A total of 138 graduate students were randomly assigned to 35 groups of 3 members each; and 33 were randomly labeled as individuals. The study simulated two scenarios in which the students, both individuals and groups, had to decide what their demands from the university authorities were-once as sellers and another time as buyers in regard to their own leisure time. The findings indicate the presence of an Endowment Effect (EE) in both individuals and groups. However, groups significantly amplified the Endowment Effect in comparison to individuals. The mechanism which best explains why groups tend to amplify negotiating decisions was found to be the Majority Rule, but the leader also influences such amplification.","Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Galin, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",ami30@bezeqint.net,"de Lima, Andréia/G-8040-2014",,,,,,33,4,5,1,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2013,75.0,3,,,,,389.0,401,,10.1007/s11238-012-9350-3,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,203SC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323312400004,0

Delaying the first birth leads to higher pre-natal levels of labor market involvement and reduces the negative effect of the first child on labor supply. The effect of the second child increases with the spacing of the two births as women, returning to work after the first birth, finance child care time increasingly through reductions in market time. Individual heterogeneity is considerable; women with lower propensity for children have the first birth later in life and space subsequent births more closely together, work more before the birth of the first child, but face larger effects of children on their labor supply.","[Troske, Kenneth R.] Univ Kentucky, Lexington, KY USA; [Troske, Kenneth R.; Voicu, Alexandru] Inst Study Labor, IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Voicu, Alexandru] CUNY Coll Staten Isl, New York, NY USA",University of Kentucky; IZA Institute Labor Economics; City University of New York (CUNY) System; College of Staten Island (CUNY),"Voicu, A (通讯作者)，CUNY Coll Staten Isl, New York, NY USA.",alexandru.voicu@csi.cuny.edu,,,,,,,60,16,18,0,26,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In particular, tax rules may prevent the proposal and adoption of inefficient projects that benefit only a small minority. We also propose redistribution efficiency as a socially desirable property of proposals and find that tax rules guarantee this kind of efficiency. Moreover, a constitution that requires certain restrictions on both taxes and subsidies satisfies a criterion we label robustness against counter-proposals.

In an otherwise conventional sticky-price model, standard aggregate demand logic is inverted at low enough asset market participation: interest rate increases become expansionary, and passive monetary policy ensures equilibrium determinacy and maximizes welfare. This suggests that Federal Reserve policy in the pre-Volcker era was better than conventional wisdom implies. We provide empirical evidence consistent with this hypothesis and study the relative merits of changes in structure and shocks for reproducing the conquest of the Great Inflation and the Great Moderation.","[Bilbiie, Florin O.] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Straub, Roland] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; European Central Bank,"Bilbiie, FO (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",,,,,,,,46,21,26,0,9,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In discussing a radical shift to a low carbon economy, many researchers identify a need for a more significant and rapid change to transport policy and travel patterns. However, it is not clear what is meant by rapid policy change and what conditions might be needed to support its delivery. Our contention in this paper is that notions of habit and stability dominate thinking about transport trends and the policy responses to them. We limit variability in our data collection and seek to design policies and transport systems that broadly support the continuation of existing practices. This framing of the policy context limits the scale of change deemed plausible and the scope of activities and actions that could be used to effect it. This paper identifies evidence from two sources to support the contention that more radical policy change is possible. First, there is a substantial and on-going churn in household travel behaviour which, harnessed properly over the medium term, could provide the raw material for steering behaviour change. Secondly, there is a growing evidence base analysing significant events at local, regional and national level which highlight how travellers can adapt to major change to network conditions, service availability and social norms. Taken together, we contend that the population is far more adaptable to major change than the policy process currently assumes. Disruptions and the responses to them provide a window on the range of adaptations that are possible (and, given that we can actually observe people carrying them out, could be more widely acceptable) given the current configuration of the transport system. In other words, if we conceptualise the system as one in which disruptions are commonplace, then different policy choices become tractable. Policy change itself can also be seen as a positive disruption, which could open up a raft of new opportunities to align policy implementation with the capacity for change. However, when set against the current framing of stability and habit, disruption can also be a major political embarrassment. We conclude that rather than being inherently problematic, disruption are in fact an opportunity through which to construct a different approach to transport policy that might enable rather than frustrate significant, low carbon change. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results reveal that male wealth was greater than female wealth in Wentworth County but that over time the gap declined. Female wealth rose continually in Wentworth County over the period 1872 to 1927 and by 1927 average female wealth was 61% that of males compared to about 17% in 1872. However, despite the onset of the married women's property legislation in the late nineteenth century and in particular the Ontario Married Women's Property Act in 1884, women's wealth does not appear to be consistently and significantly related to variables designed to capture the effect of the property law legislation using regression analysis. Given late nineteenth century economic and social factors that operated to improve the material and wealth status of women, the property rights legislation was a correlating rather than a causal factor in the growth of women's wealth. At best, the property law changes may have induced more financial asset holding within the wealth portfolios of women though male financial asset share of wealth also increased. As a result, the gender redistribution of wealth that began in the late 19th century was part of a broad set of social and economic changes rather than the result of a set of legal changes.

Inequality, measured here on the basis of farm-size distributions, is found to be negatively related to local school property tax revenues across the whole sample of 1345 rural counties. However, further analysis shows that this relationship is not consistent across the sample. In the North, there is a significant negative relationship between inequality and school funding, and this relationship is shown to be consistent with the fact that assessed values of property did not rise linearly with wealth. Across the South, there is no distinct relationship between inequality and school funding. The results also indicate that inequality in the South cannot directly explain the gap in school funding with the North, in the sense that redistributing farms in the South to match the Northern distributions leads to no predicted increase in school funding.

Using a new approach to the typology of tours, which takes into account not only the number but also the spatial distribution of activities chained into a tour, the paper sheds light on the reasons why findings in the existing research literature conflict. Descriptive and modelling analyses on a home-based tour dataset created from the Sydney Household Travel Survey are presented to show that tours using car or public transport are different in nature. For public transport, activities chained into a tour have destinations which are typically in close proximity and reachable by walking whereas the car was found to be utilised for travel involving multiple purposes at multiple destinations. The new approach in this paper to the typology of tours takes the destination into account to give clearer and more significant relationships between tour complexity and mode choice, allowing potential policy and planning implications for promoting public transport ridership to be drawn. The results indicate that if there is a spatial dispersion to the activities chained into a tour, this significantly reduces public transport use. Conversely, public transport use increases as the number of activities sharing a destination with others chained into a tour increases. These findings suggest that planning strategies to increase public transport use need to focus on providing multiple purposes at a single destination. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Research on the developmental origins of health and disease has led to the hypothesis that early developmental disturbance might permanently affect the lifecourse, accounting for some of the burden of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease. Here we assessed developmental disturbance using bodily and facial symmetry and examined its association with socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood, and attained status at midlife. Symmetry was measured at ages 83 (facial symmetry) and 87 (bodily symmetry) in a sample of 292 individuals from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (LBC1921). Structural equation models indicated that poorer SES during early development was significantly associated with lower facial symmetry (standardized path coefficient -.25, p = .03). By contrast, midlife SES was not significantly associated with symmetry. The relationship was stronger in men (-.44, p =.03) than in women (-.12, p = .37), and the effect sizes were significantly different in magnitude (p = .004). These findings suggest that SES in early life (but not later in life) is associated with developmental disturbances. Facial symmetry appears to provide an effective record of early perturbations, whereas bodily symmetry seems relatively imperturbable. As bodily and facial symmetries were sensitive to different influences, they should not be treated as interchangeable. However, markers of childhood disturbance remain many decades later, suggesting that early development may account in part for associations between SES and health through the lifecourse. Future research should clarify which elements of the environment cause these perturbations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It simulates the possible consequences of policy schemes such as decoupling, modulation and agri-environmental measures, using a representative farm Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) model calibrated with the neutral procedure. Selection of this calibration procedure is based on its better predictive power compared to two other procedures also tested: the average cost procedure and calibration with exogenous elasticities. The impact analysis focuses primarily on the distribution of different farming systems over the production area and on farms' gross margins. The analysis compares the results of a base year 2002 in which all subsidies are coupled, with those of scenarios entailing decoupled non agri-environmental support and complementary subsidies for integrated olive farming. Input costs and positive and negative price variations with respect to the base year are considered Results show inter alia that the recent agricultural policy changes favour the growth of integrated olive production. They also show that while decoupling has a small impact on land distribution in an increased price context, it might trigger an abandonment of part of the cultivated area in a decreased price context. This study opens up a new research avenue for the olive sector as it is the first time that farm modelling is used to investigate the impacts of olive agricultural and environmental policies on different market price and input cost settings.","[Mili, Samir; de Andres, Rosario; Urzainqui, Elvira] CSIC, Human & Social Sci Ctr, Madrid, Spain; [Judez, Lucinio] Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Ciencias Humanas y Sociales (CCHS); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Mili, S (通讯作者)，CSIC, Human & Social Sci Ctr, Madrid, Spain.",,,"Mili, Samir/0000-0003-3835-9310",European Commission; Spanish Government,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Spanish Government(Spanish Government),"This research is co-funded by the European Commission through FP7 project 'Sustainable agri-food systems and rural development in the Mediterranean Partner Countries'(SUSTAINMED), and the Spanish Government through National R&D project 'A model for evaluating the impacts of recent CAP measures on the Spanish agricultural sector'.",,41,6,6,0,7,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2013,12.0,1,,,,,22.0,36,,,,,,15,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AG2VO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335275400003,0

While the importance of wages and amenities is well-established from previous empirical studies, evidence regarding housing costs is far less conclusive. We develop and test a new method for representing housing prices in migration analyses. We first provide conditions under which utility-maximizing housing costs can be specified as a function of individual characteristics, similar to a Mincerian wage equation. Using large samples of individuals from the 2000 PUMS, we estimate the relationship between housing costs and individual attributes for each of 291 metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our approach accounts for rental and ownership decisions, the costs of rental and owned properties, and the costs of holding housing capital. We test our housing cost measure using observations of point-to-point migration decisions for a large sample of college-educated males. Our migration model includes additional controls for the wage each individual expects to earn in each area as well as a large set of area amenities. Our key finding is that our proposed housing cost measure yields the expected results (higher housing prices reduce the probability that an area is selected). We re-estimate the model using three alternative metropolitan area measures of housing costs: median house price, average apartment rent, and average urban land rent. These measures consistently produce counterintuitive positive effects of housing costs on area choice. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is concluded that voters are not very consistent with their own political profiles, disregard party manifestos, and are likely driven by political traditions, even if outdated, or by personal images of politicians.

After people reached their late 60s, however, a decline in well-being is found in the third stage.","[Wunder, Christoph] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany; [Wiencierz, Andrea; Kuechenhoff, Helmut] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Schwarze, Johannes] Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany; [Schwarze, Johannes] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Schwarze, Johannes] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Munich; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Wunder, C (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.",,"Küchenhoff, Helmut/A-8291-2010","Wiencierz, Andrea/0000-0001-8786-7915; Kuchenhoff, Helmut/0000-0002-6372-2487",,,,,89,62,71,0,44,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The operational efficiency of sample container terminals is estimated by data envelopment analysis, which is followed by regression analysis to examine factors affecting container terminal efficiency. We find that having some Chinese ownership may make a container terminal more efficient, while a container terminal is less efficient with Chinese as the major shareholder. It is also found that intra- and inter-port competition may enhance container terminal efficiency. Finally, the efficiency growth of terminals is examined, and implications for the regional economic disparity in China are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine the role played by the demand for university-based knowledge and university-developed technology. We identify links between businesses and the university as a key conduit facilitating the spillover of knowledge using data on the Department of Energy's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. We provide supply-side evidence on university research relationships and how the use of knowledge and technologies that flow from a university affect economic growth. We identify the role that SBIR-funded businesses play in the spillover of knowledge from the creating organization to where that knowledge is used and commercialized.

Voters' propensity to support an issue is modeled via a random utility function with two additive terms: the deterministic term accounts for voters' preference-driven/predictable behavior; the random one is a catch-all term that accounts for all the idiosyncratic/unpredictable factors. The relative strength of the two terms gives rise to a continuum of cases ranging from the Shapley value, where all aggregation patterns are equally probable, to a standard spatial value, like the Owen-Shapley index, where instead the conditional order is fully deterministic. As an illustrative application, we analyze the distribution of power in the Council of Ministers under three different scenarios: (i) EU15 Pre-Nice; (ii) EU27 Nice Treaty; (iii) EU27 Lisbon Treaty.","[Benati, Stefano] Univ Trento, Dept Sociol, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Vittucci Marzetti, Giuseppe] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Sociol & Social Res, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Trento; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Vittucci Marzetti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Via Bicocca degli Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",stefano.benati@unitn.it; giuseppe.vittucci@unimib.it,"Marzetti, Giuseppe Vittucci/AAG-2246-2020","Marzetti, Giuseppe Vittucci/0000-0003-3093-8000; Benati, Stefano/0000-0002-1928-5224",,,,,34,11,11,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2013,40.0,2,,,,,391.0,410,,10.1007/s00355-011-0608-4,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,072HT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313661600006,0

At the theoretical level, we argue that the debate should be reframed in order to capture not only the material, but also the ideational footprint of the euro, as well as to better conceptualise change in the International Monetary System (IMS). Our empirical work shows that the euro is perceived by financial elites as a useful diversification tool to avoid over-exposure to dollar weaknesses. However, despite its appeal as a valuable investment alternative, the European currency has a series of structural flaws that prevent it from substituting the dollar as the main international currency. Therefore, in purely material terms, the euro-sceptical literature is correct. However, we also find that the hitherto material inroads of the euro, while limited, have been sufficient to ideationally convince these elites that a multicurrency IMS is possible and might be more stable (and therefore preferable) to current dollar unipolarity. Therefore, the euro-optimist literature is far from wrong when it argues that the creation of the euro represents a challenge to the greenback, for it could be a stepping stone towards the formation of a multipolar IMS.","[Otero-Iglesias, Miguel] Lunam Univ, ESSCA Sch Management, Ctr European Integrat, Angers, France; [Steinberg, Federico] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Steinberg, Federico] Elcano Royal Inst, Madrid, Spain",ESSCA School of Management; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Otero-Iglesias, M (通讯作者)，Lunam Univ, ESSCA Sch Management, Ctr European Integrat, Angers, France.",,"Otero-Iglesias, Miguel/H-9807-2015","Otero-Iglesias, Miguel/0000-0003-2010-8476; STEINBERG WECHSLER, FEDERICO/0000-0002-8318-5527",,,,,119,25,25,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

These workers experience a particularly complex relationship between their work and their leisure; they belong to a culture in which drinking in public is the norm for consumers and, as employees, they are responsible for enforcing drinking rules within their workplace - which is also where much of their own leisure takes place. The concept of partial consumer is used to analyse the fluidity of the work-leisure and service-consumption divides in this context. The drinking norms that develop within the pub enable these workers to construct contextually variable behavioural norms around drinking behaviour, allowing them to behave differently behind and in front of the bar, the symbolic barrier between work and leisure.","[Sandiford, Peter John] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Seymour, Diane] Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",University of Adelaide; Oxford Brookes University,"Sandiford, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Business, Fac Profess, 10 Pulteney St, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",peter.sandiford@adelaide.edu.au,,"SANDIFORD, PETER/0000-0002-8075-6902",,,,,34,13,12,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We adopt a cross-sectional spatial econometric approach, relating domestic output volatility to (distance-weighted averages of) other countries output volatility, using a sample of 135 countries and rolling 10-year time windows over the period from 1955 to 2006. Using descriptive measures, test statistics and spatial econometric estimates, we find that cross-country interdependence was virtually insignificant in the early post-war period but has increased strongly from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s and remained at a high level since then. Results for the most recent period suggest that common shocks to output volatility have a magnified impact and roughly quadruplicate through international spillover effects, which are transmitted through both trade and financial openness.","[Badinger, Harald] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Dept Econ, Inst Int Econ, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Badinger, Harald] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Badinger, H (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Dept Econ, Inst Int Econ, Althanstr 39-45, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",,,"Badinger, Harald/0000-0002-7238-5136",,,,,23,2,3,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2013,36.0,1,,,,,12.0,30,,10.1111/twec.12022,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,073NQ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313750100002,0

This observation can be explained by the strategic behavior of voters. This article derives two broad classes of voting procedures under which strategic voting behavior induces a two-party system under standard assumptions on voter preferences. One class consists of the voting procedures with unique top-score, i.e., under which a voter can cast a top-score vote for only one candidate (e.g., Plurality Voting, Borda Count). The other class consists of the voting procedures that permit truncated ballots, i.e., under which voters do not have to cast all their votes (e.g., Approval Voting). This analysis suggests that the key for strategic voting behavior to induce a two-party system is that voters can always cast a different score for the two candidates they rank first and second on their ballots.","[Dellis, Arnaud] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Dellis, Arnaud] CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,"Dellis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, 1025 Ave Sci Humaines,Local 2174, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",arnaud.dellis@ecn.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,38,7,7,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2013,40.0,1,,,,,263.0,284,,10.1007/s00355-011-0597-3,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,070BC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313479800013,0

Using panel estimation methods and household travel diary data collected in Germany between 1997 and 2009, this study identifies the rebound effect in private transport by allowing for the possibility that fuel price elasticities-from which rebound effects can be derived-are asymmetric. This approach rests on empirical evidence suggesting that the response in individual travel demand to price increases is stronger than to decreases. We argue that such an asymmetric response would require referencing price elasticities derived from price decreases in order to identify the rebound effect, as it represents the response to a decrease in unit cost for car travel due to improved fuel efficiency. Failing to reject the null hypothesis of a symmetric price response, we alternatively estimate a reversible specification and obtain a rebound estimate for single-vehicle households being in the range of 46 to 70%, which is in line with an earlier German study by Frondel, Peters, and Vance (2008).","[Frondel, Manuel; Vance, Colin] Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch Essen, Essen, Germany; [Frondel, Manuel] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Vance, Colin] Univ Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ruhr University Bochum; University of Bremen,"Frondel, M (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch Essen, Essen, Germany.",Manuel.Frondel@rwi-essen.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of the German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 823],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of the German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are grateful for invaluable comments and suggestions by Christoph M.

Such a difficulty may be tackled by replacing unknown first-order inclusion probabilities in the Horvitz-Thompson expansion estimator of population total with estimates computed in a simulation study. However, one may also desire to estimate the variance of this statistic using simulated second-order inclusion probabilities. To improve the accuracy of their estimates, the available auxiliary information may be employed. Such an information often takes form of partial (hierarchic) ordering inequalities that may be incorporated into estimation using isotonic regresson methods. In this paper such an approach is adopted for a fixed-cost sequential sampling scheme. The active set optimization algorithm is applied to estimate inclusion probabilities and the variance of population total estimates.","[Gamrot, Wojciech] Univ Econ, Dept Stat, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,195.0,200,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000034,0

The unemployment rate of university graduates is the ratio of the number of unemployed graduates to the difference between the total number of the graduates and the number of the graduates who continue studying at university. The theoretical concept of convergence is based on the absolute (unconditional) respectively relative (conditional) form and the method of beta convergence is used within the article. The paper empirically estimates the panel model by the means of the pooled least squares method with fixed overview effects for the Bachelor's and Master's degrees of studies separately. The results show that there are vast differences in the employment of graduates on the labor market especially after the completion of the Bachelor's degree. The results of the estimated panel models further document the (non) presence of convergence, but also the speed of the process. There are also significant differences in the convergence behavior of the unemployed graduates from individual Faculties of Economics of Czech universities.","[Hanclova, Jana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Syst Engn, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic; [Simek, Milan] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Nat Econ, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava,"Hanclova, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Syst Engn, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",jana.hanclova@vsb.cz; milan.simek@vsb.cz,"Hanclova, Jana/D-7723-2013; Hanclova, Jana/AAJ-8363-2020","Hanclova, Jana/0000-0002-0939-6852","Student Grant Competition of Faculty of Economics; VSB-Technical University of Ostrava [SP2013/148]; European Social Fund [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296, CZ.1.07/4.1.00/22.0001]",Student Grant Competition of Faculty of Economics; VSB-Technical University of Ostrava; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"This research was supported by the Student Grant Competition of Faculty of Economics, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava within project (SP2013/148) and also by the European Social Fund within the projects CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296 and CZ.1.07/4.1.00/22.0001.",,19,0,0,0,4,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,231.0,236,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000040,0

The process mentioned above should be based on the knowledge generated at scientific and academic community and developed within economical entity. Economic effectiveness is an important part of regional brand affirmation. It is based on maximally rational information managing, constant quality improvement and holistic approach to business conduct. High productivity and competitiveness finally result in business excellence of economical entities of that region in the lump.

Maximal affirmation of the new economy principle is possible within civil society frame in which civil activism is very important corrective of both political and economical processes.

We study the agglomeration effects caused by trade-offs between centripetal and centrifugal forces which eventually determine the distribution of economic activity across space. The equilibrium solution with spatially myopic environmental policy results either in a monocentric or in a polycentric city with the major cluster at the natural advantage site. The regulator's optimum results in a bicentric city, which suggests that when environmental policy is spatially optimal, the natural advantage sites do not act as attractors of economic activity.

Desk research methods will be used for gathering information on the structure of eastern Croatia's tourism supply, the inductive-deductive method for explaning established insights and the case study method for Tvrda as an example of adequately valorised monument. Research results show that Osijek-Baranja county is an outstandingly rich region, regarding the availability and quality of resources, emphasizing the need for a sustainable evaluation of cultural heritage, given that existing attractions have an exceptional potential for expansion of tourism. Research results also point to potential benefits and harms of intensive use of resources and emphasize the need for balanced regional tourism development in the eastern Croatia. For further tourism development, it is necessary to orientate on tourism forms that explore specific local resources using principles of sustainable development. The object of study relies on eastern Croatia's micro-locations, perceived as resources valuable for cultural tourism development. The contribution is reflected in emphasizing the importance of conducting proper assessment of attractions and applying the results to similar regions. Previous secondary research show inadequate use of cultural and monumental heritage in Osijek-Baranja county. It is desirable to conduct new studies to redefine the using of these resources to enrich literature related to the mentioned topic. This research will help establish the presence of valuable resources for tourism development and demonstrate their role in the region's cultural identity.

We use a unique dataset, which combines information on recreational trails in Indianapolis with data on violent crimes and anthropomorphic and diagnostic data from children's clinic visits between 1996 and 2005. We find that having a trail near a home reduces children's weight. However, the effect depends on the amount of nearby violent crimes. Significant reductions occur only in low crime areas and trails could have opposite effects on weight in high crime areas. These effects are primarily among boys, older children, and children who live in higher income neighborhoods. Evaluated at the mean length of trails this effect for older children in no crime areas would be a reduction of 2 lb of the body weight. Falsification tests using planned trails instead of existing trails, show that trails are more likely to be located in areas with heavier children, suggesting that our results on effects of trails represent a lower bound.

Subsequently it will be pointed to differences that arise when using both methods and the differences that occur when we compare the estimates that are published by the Czech Statistical Office. Given that the estimates of life expectancy at birth using different approaches are similar, then based on ARIMA model and Random Walk with Drift there will be extrapolated to the near future (2012-2030).

The embedded value solves deficiencies of classic life insurance accounting systems that can often lead to uncertain results.

Teaching in mixed-level classes, design of personalized curriculum structure, good attitude towards the CET4 and strengthening the construction of teachers' team are the key factors in improving students' application ability and promoting the higher engineering education quality.","[Zuo, Ying] Beijing Inst Petrochem Technol, Dept Foreign Languages, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Petrochemical Technology,,zuoying@bipt.edu.cn,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,21.0,,,,,,441.0,446,,,,,,6,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA3ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335241700085,0

Building on recent advances in international and comparative political economy, we propose a framework for the comparative study of the ways in which transnational integration regimes (TIRs) shape the development of regulatory institutions in emerging market democracies. The ability of TIRs to alleviate the supply and demand problems of institutional change in these countries depends in large part on the ways in which TIRs translate their purpose and power into institutional goals, assistance and monitoring. Integration modes can be combined in different ways so as to empower or limit the participation of a variety of domestic public and private actors to pursue and contest alternative institutional experiments. We illustrate the use of our framework via a brief comparison of the impact of the European Union accession process on post-communist countries and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Mexico, with special attention to the development of food safety regulatory institutions.","[Bruszt, Laszlo] European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Florence, Italy; [McDermott, Gerald A.] Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [McDermott, Gerald A.] IAE Business Sch, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",European University Institute; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Austral University,"Bruszt, L (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Florence, Italy.",,,,,,,,116,21,21,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Nevertheless, the question whether economic growth causes structural change, or changes in the economic structure cause aggregate growth is still unanswered. To shed more light on this question, this article examines a Granger causality test in a panel environment to determine the relationship of economic growth and structural change, measured either in terms of employment shares or real value added shares. Estimation and analysis of the annual data of seven OECD countries, covering the period from 1960-2004, show that although the causality appears to be heterogeneous among these countries, some general conclusions can be drawn. Aggregate economic growth decelerates structural change in the very short run but accelerates it with some lag in time. The aggregate effect depends on whether structural change is measured in terms of employment or in terms of real value added. Conversely, structural change supports aggregate economic growth, irrespective of which measure of structural change chosen.","Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Law & Econ, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Dietrich, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Law & Econ, Marktpl 15, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany.",dietrich@vwl.tu-darmstadt.de,,,,,,,98,38,44,1,37,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

But do these benefits extend to maintaining a healthy body weight, as the economic theory of health investment suggests they should? They do not. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), I find that entry into marriage among both men and women aged 51-70 is associated with weight gain and exit from marriage with weight loss. I evaluate three additional theories with respect to the cross-sectional and longitudinal variation in the data. First, it may be that a broader set of shared risk factors (such as social obligations regarding meals) raises body mass for married couples. However, the shared risk factor model predicts that the intra-couple correlation should increase with respect to marital duration. Instead, it declines. Second, scholars have recently promoted a crisis model of marriage in which marital transitions, not marital status, determine differences in body mass. The crisis model is consistent with short-term effects seen for divorce, but not for the persistent weight gains associated with marriage or the persistent weight loss following widowhood. And transition models, in general, cannot explain significant cross-sectional differences across marital states in a population that is no longer experiencing many transitions, nor can it account for the prominent gender differences (in late middle-age, the heaviest group is unmarried women and the lightest are unmarried men). Third, I argue that pressures of the marriage market, in combination with gendered preferences regarding partner BMI, can account for all the longitudinal and cross-sectional patterns found in the data.

Regression results show that height limits, which are imposed in draconian fashion in India, cause spatial expansion of its cities, as predicted by the theoretical model of Bertaud and Brueckner (2005). The regression coefficients, by yielding the implied reduction in the area of an average city from a marginal increase in its height limit, allow computation of the annual saving in commuting cost for the city's edge household when the limit is relaxed. This cost saving, which is an exact measure of the common welfare gain for each urban household, can be scaled up to yield the aggregate consumer gain in a typical city from relaxation of India's restrictive height limits. For a moderate height-limit increase, this gain equals 106 million rupees. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It turns out that the marginal cost exceeds the demand price (bid rent) of housing close to the city center and is exceeded by it close to the boundary. In both cases, the excess burden of the deviations from marginal cost pricing, either by fiscal or zoning instruments, is the cost of reducing the excess burden of unpriced transport congestion. Efficient deviation from marginal cost pricing requires that any marginal (in terms of the movers' size) residential relocation does not change the aggregate excess burden of both distortions. The present study also shows that FAR optimal regulations render urban growth boundary (UGB) redundant but it cannot always replace the fiscal instruments for achieving the second-best utility.

What do the Russian uprisings reveal about popular challenges to authoritarian rule and the political trajectory of contemporary Russian authoritarianism? This study identifies two models of citizen mobilization against authoritarian leaders, one focusing on street-based protests and the other using elections as the key arena for launching popular challenges. Three factors encouraging both models are analyzed: declining public support for the regime; growing evidence that leaders are no longer invincible; and changing political opportunities for the opposition. The extent to which these conditions are present in Russia and what this ledger suggests about plausible political trajectories there are evaluated.","[Koesel, Karrie J.] Univ Oregon, Dept Polit Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Bunce, Valerie J.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Oregon; Cornell University,"Koesel, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Polit Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",,,,,,,,58,24,30,2,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

However, studies of men's benefits from occupational segregation have neglected low-wage and diverse groups of workers. Using the representative US National Nursing Assistant Study (NNAS), the article examines organizational measures of inequality and discrimination wages, benefits and working conditions - to understand whether a glass escalator exists among nursing assistants and how it is affected by gender, race, citizenship and facility characteristics. Though gender inequalities were present, citizenship, race, facility type and size emerged as the most important factors in determining advantages for workers, suggesting a revision of the glass escalator metaphor may be in order. NNAS results imply that identity characteristics like nationality and contextual factors like workplace matter and underscore the importance of using an intersectional approach to examine inequality.","[Price-Glynn, Kim] Univ Connecticut, Dept Sociol & Urban & Community Studies, Hartford, CT 06117 USA; [Rakovski, Carter] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA",University of Connecticut; California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Price-Glynn, K (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Sociol & Urban & Community Studies, Lib Bldg 418,1800 Asylum Ave, Hartford, CT 06117 USA.",kim.price-glynn@uconn.edu,,,,,,,66,31,44,1,69,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper explores smuggling from Benin and Togo into Nigeria. Nigeria has very high import tariffs and bans on certain products. Togo and Benin have deliberately maintained low import barriers to facilitate an Entrepot role vis-a-vis Nigeria and land-locked Sahelian countries. Togo competes at a geographic disadvantage relative to Benin for access to the Nigerian market and compensates with lower transit taxes. The volume and composition of cross-border trade is analysed using data obtained from Benin and Togo customs authorities, as well as interviews with traders and customs officials in both countries. Benin and to a lesser extent Togo are the origin of a very large volume of transshipment of precisely those products which are heavily protected in Nigeria, such as used cars, cloth and rice. It is common knowledge in Benin and Togo that these imports, although declared for domestic consumption or transit to other countries, are in fact overwhelmingly intended for Nigeria. Smuggling is a major source of income and employment in Benin and Togo, but provides a fragile and unreliable foundation for economic development.","Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA",Swarthmore College,"Golub, SS (通讯作者)，Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA.",,,,,,,,22,33,37,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2012,35.0,9,,,,,1139.0,1161,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01469.x,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,003UV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308637800005,0

The aim of this article is to focus on the employment determinants in the agro-food industry subdivided into nine sectors of activity. Estimates on panel data highlighted the effect of four variables i.e. the demand, the subsidy rate, the investment level and the labour cost. In contrast to the theoretical principles, the effects of labour productivity and of the value added rate are not empirically significant. The constant repeatedly found in the estimated equation suggests that other variables might exist which could not be used due to a lack of data. The results obtained indicate that production capacity should be strengthened by higher investments and that a lower increase in the wage costs compared to the production costs might be the best tool to create new jobs in the Tunisian agro-food sector.","[Soussi, Mouez] Ecole Super Sci Econ & Commerciales Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis,"Soussi, M (通讯作者)，Ecole Super Sci Econ & Commerciales Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2012,11.0,3,,,,,12.0,21,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,046MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311769300002,0

In our framework, a culture is a set of ideas held exclusively by residents of a location. In general in our model, the equilibrium path generates separate cultures in different regions. When we compare this to the situation where all workers are resident in one region, R&D workers become too homogeneous and there is only one culture.

On the whole, local indices add a moderate amount of explanatory power relative to metropolitan indices. In my sample, the metropolitan index explains 50-75% of the variation in home price shocks, and local indices add 3-7% more. In an index hedging framework, homeowners should be willing to pay 5-10% to hedge with a local index versus a metropolitan index alone.","[McDuff, DeForest] Princeton Univ, Firestone Lib, Ind Relat Sect, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [McDuff, DeForest] Quant Econ Inc, San Diego, CA USA",Princeton University,"McDuff, D (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Firestone Lib, Ind Relat Sect, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rmcduff@Princeton.edu,,,,,,,16,6,10,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The empirical data include information on household income, car ownership and motorcycle ownership in different regions from 1974 to 2009. The results show that, first, motorcycle ownership is asymmetrically cointegrated with household income in each region, and car ownership is asymmetrically cointegrated with household income in all regions except Taipei city. Second, both car and motorcycle ownership levels increase faster than they decrease in the asymmetric adjustment of their long-run relationship. Third, sensitivity tests for the period 1987-2009 show that the cointegration relationship of the car ownership equations vanished. Finally, we find evidence on the effects of household income on motorcycle ownership, and the effects of income variables on car and motorcycle ownership are dissimilar.

We propose modified two-stage least squares (2SLS) and modified 3SLS procedures where the conditional heteroskedasticity is taken into account, which are natural extensions of the traditional 2SLS and 3SLS estimators and which achieve a lower variance. We recommend the use of these modified 2SLS and 3SLS procedures in practice instead of alternative estimators like limited-information maximum likelihood/full-information maximum likelihood, where the non-existence of moments leads to extreme values, and also for ease of computation. It is shown theoretically and with simulation that in some cases 2SLS, 3SLS and our modified 2SLS and 3SLS procedures can have very severe biases (including the weak instruments case), and we present bias correction procedures to apply in practice along the lines of Flores-Lagunes (2007). Our new estimation procedures can also be used to extend the test for weak instruments of Stock and Yogo (2005) and to allow for conditional heteroskedasticity. Finally, we show the usefulness of our estimation procedures with an application to the demand and supply of fish.

For example, imagine that a government allocates a fixed number of licenses to private firms, or that it distributes equally divided lands to households. Anonymity in welfare is a condition of impartiality in the sense that it requires allocation rules to treat agents equally in welfare terms from the viewpoint of agents who are ignorant of their own valuations or identities.

Despite a strong grounding in theory, this aspect of optimal auction design has been frequently challenged in previous empirical research, particularly in the market for fine art. We adopt a valuation benchmark that incorporates sellers' reserve prices as well as high bids, and recognize censoring of works that fail to make reserve. Although the auction houses never divulge reserve prices, we exploit the fact that they can be observed indirectly via their impact on buy-in rates. Using the set of French Impressionist paintings brought to auction from 1985 to 2001, we estimate the distribution of reserve prices, establish their link to a proper valuation benchmark, and isolate the selection bias due to bought-in works on the perceived market value of fine art works. After controlling for the impact of reserve prices, and considering all works brought to auction, we find no evidence of bias in the experts' pre-sale estimates.

A well known example of this particular situation is the river sharing problem. We exploit the linear order of agents to transform the river sharing problem to a sequence of two-agent river sharing problems. These reduced problems are mathematically equivalent to bankruptcy problems and can therefore be solved using any bankruptcy rule. Our proposed class of solutions, that we call sequential sharing rules, solves the river sharing problem. Our approach extends the bankruptcy literature to settings with a sequential structure of both the agents and the resource to be shared. In the paper, we first characterise the class of sequential sharing rules. Subsequently, we apply sequential sharing rules based on four classical bankruptcy rules, assess their properties, provide two characterisations of one specific rule, and compare sequential sharing rules with three alternative solutions to the river sharing problem.","[Ansink, Erik] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Weikard, Hans-Peter] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Wageningen University & Research,"Ansink, E (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",erikansink@gmail.com,"Ansink, Erik/N-1613-2019; Weikard, Hans-Peter/O-1120-2013","Ansink, Erik/0000-0003-4094-2468; Weikard, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-5209-9845",,,,,35,60,66,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2012,38.0,2,,,,,187.0,210,,10.1007/s00355-010-0525-y,0.0,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,896QV,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300585700001,0

We use panel data to explore household responses in the catfish-producing Mekong delta between 2002 and 2004 and find that income growth was significantly slower among households relatively more involved in catfish farming in 2002. This is explained by a relative decline in both catfish income and revenues from other miscellaneous farm activities. Labor supply did not adjust, most likely because of off-farm employment limitations. Households more exposed to the shock reduced the share of investment assigned to catfish while substituting into agriculture.","[Brambilla, Irene; Porto, Guido] Univ La Plata, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Tarozzi, Alessandro] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",National University of La Plata; Pompeu Fabra University,"Brambilla, I (通讯作者)，Univ La Plata, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",,"Tarozzi, Alessandro/D-6762-2013; Tarozzi, Alessandro/AAX-9747-2021","Tarozzi, Alessandro/0000-0002-8374-2856; Tarozzi, Alessandro/0000-0002-8374-2856",,,,,33,31,34,0,25,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This paper proposes a migration model with heterogeneous agents and persistent cross country income differentials that features temporary migration. In equilibrium there exists a positive relation between the stock of migrants and the income differential, while the net migration flow becomes zero. Consequently, existing empirical migration models, estimating net migration flows, instead of stocks, may be misspecified. This suspicion appears to be confirmed by our investigation of the cointegration relationships of German migration stocks and flows since 1967. We find that (i) panel-unit root tests reject the hypothesis that migration flows and the explanatory variables are integrated of the same order, while migration stocks and the explanatory variables are all I(1) variables, and (ii) the hypothesis of cointegration cannot be rejected for the stock model.","[Bruecker, Herbert] Univ Bamberg, Inst Employment Res IAB, Bamberg, Germany; [Schroder, Philipp J.

For this reason, the relationship between international tourism and economic growth would seem to be an interesting and topical empirical issue. The paper investigates whether tourism specialization was important for economic development in 159 countries over the period 1989-2008. The results from panel threshold regressions show a positive relationship between economic growth and tourism. Instrumental variable estimation of a threshold regression is used to quantify the contributions of tourism specialization to economic growth, while correcting for endogeneity between the regressors and error term. The significant impact of tourism specialization on economic growth in most regressions is robust to different specifications of tourism specialization, as well as to differences in real GDP measurement. However, the coefficients of the tourism specialization variables in the two regimes are significantly different, with a higher impact of tourism on economic growth found in the low regime. These findings do not alter with changes in the threshold variables. The empirical results suggest that tourism growth does not always lead to substantial economic growth.","[Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Khamkaew, Thanchanok] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Econ, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Khamkaew, Thanchanok] Maejo Univ, Fac Econ, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University; Chiang Mai University; Maejo University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Kyoto University,"Chang, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 250 Kuo Kuang Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan.",changchialin@nchu.edu.tw,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X",,,,,42,58,61,0,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

However, the quantity and quality of local private amenities, such as grocery stores and restaurants, can also have important quality-of-life implications for neighborhood residents. In the current article, the authors develop neighborhood-level metrics of retail access and analyze how retail services vary across New York City neighborhoods by income and by racial composition. The authors then examine how retail services change over time, particularly in neighborhoods undergoing rapid economic growth. Results indicate that lower income and minority neighborhoods have fewer retail establishments, smaller average establishments, a higher proportion of unhealthy restaurants, and in certain cases, less diversity across retail subsectors. In addition, the rate of retail growth between 1998 and 2007 has been particularly fast in neighborhoods that were initially lower valued and experienced relatively high housing price appreciation compared with the city overall.","[Meltzer, Rachel] New Sch, Milano Sch Int Affairs Management & Urban Policy, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Meltzer, Rachel] New Sch, Milano Sch Management & Urban Policy, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Schuetz, Jenny] Univ So Calif, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, Los Angeles, CA USA",The New School; The New School; University of Southern California,"Meltzer, R (通讯作者)，New Sch, Milano Sch Int Affairs Management & Urban Policy, 72 5th Ave,Room 503, New York, NY 10011 USA.",meltzerr@newschool.edu,,,,,,,44,68,76,1,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

However the tasks in the project are usually of various kinds with different dependency on human factor. There should be a relevant value of concealed time reserve for each concrete task. Within real projects the three-point PERT estimate is often adapted to suit specific requirements and project needs. Possible modification of the three-point PERT estimate offers many options which incorporate the human factor into the projects. Usually, only the pessimistic and the optimistic parameters of the three-point PERT estimate are precisely set. The pessimistic and optimistic parameters can be used for the estimate of a concealed time reserve. The concealed time reserve is needed for the time estimate purging within the Critical Chain method. The correct time estimate purging with various concealed time reserve for each task can bring saving costs of the project.

Each of them processed their experience in an individual and original manner, just as each human being is unique. They typically have been through several employments and professions, and they have gathered a load of valuable information and experience. The time of their life, ability to compare and distance gave them an opportunity to acquire detached view, composure and internal balance. (Morawitzova, 2012) As Capova (2012) puts it, and as she adds, the main advantage of the employees of the age category 50+ on the labour market is, from the point of view of HR managers, their long term experience in the field. HR managers further appreciate their experience acquired over the years at work which is often more valuable than theoretical knowledge. The 50+ category employees are not only practically oriented in their field, but they have valuable contacts and bonds as well. On the other hand, as Morawitzova (2012) puts it, the main problem of the employees 50+ is slower pace at which they process new information and, to certain extent, reduced flexibility. Occasional fluctuation in attention may make them feel insecure. However, it has been proved that the 50+ employees can compensate these deficiencies by their experience and competence acquired through training and practice. This also leads them to better consistency and thoroughness and the use of efficient methods and alternative solutions to problems. In contradiction to the prejudices, many persons in 50+ age category seek further training, follow new trends in their profession, use modern technologies and try to keep pace with the times. The article presents some results of quantitative and qualitative research performed for the author's dissertation thesis focused on specific aspects of HR management of employees of the age category 50+ in conditions of Czech and Slovak organizations and further for the grant project of TACR (Technological Agency of the Czech Republic), Program Supporting Applied Social Research and Experimental Development OMEGA, registration number TD010129, Performance Potential of 50+ Category Employees and Specific Forms of Management of Human Resources in Organizations. On the basis of study and analysis of domestic and foreign expert monographs, series, and/or internet sources it appears that certain (stereotypical) characteristic features and attributes are attributed to the 50+ category employees. The compliance rate of the represented characteristic attributes and features of employees of 50+ categories are the main topic of this article. The article brings an answer to the question which characteristic features and attributes are perceived by HR managers in the same way as by the 50+ category employees and vice versa. The total of 22 characteristic features and attributes representing the 50+ category employees were selected. The statistic comparison of the compliance rate of the answers of HR managers and employees of the age category 50+ was performed on the basis of McNemar's test (symmetry test) in the R program.","[Bejtkovsky, Jiri] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,bejtkovsky@fame.utb.cz,"Bejtkovsky, Jiri/B-2001-2018","Bejtkovsky, Jiri/0000-0003-1600-3487",,,,,16,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,870.0,879,,,,,,10,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700090,0

Specifically, we examine the size and speed of adjustment of money market rate and banks' lending rate to changes in the 'cost of funds' rate and their stability by employing two cointegration methods: Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares and Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model. The results reveal the existence of a cointegrating relationship among the interest rate series with an almost complete long-run adjustment. However, the size and speed of short-run adjustment of lending rate is quite low and sluggish, implying that in the short-run, the domestic monetary policy may have a limited impact on the interest rate channel.

Exploring the analytic institutions created by IOs provides insights into how they make their member states 'legible' and how greater legibility enables them to construct cognitive authority in specific policy areas, which, in turn, enhances their capacity to influence changes in national frameworks for economic and social governance. Studying the indirect influence that IOs can exert over the design of national policies has, until recently, often been neglected in accounts of the contemporary roles that IOs play and the evolution of global economic governance. By 'seeing like an IO', we can increase our understanding of the cognitive and organisational environment that guides an IO's actions and informs its policy advice to states, which enables a more comprehensive picture of how the everyday business of global governance works in practice. Instead of 'black boxing' IOs, the contributors to this special issue demonstrate how studying IOs from the inside out expands our understanding both of the policy dialogue between IOs and their member states and how IOs and states learn from each other over time.","[Broome, Andre] Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Seabrooke, Leonard] Copenhagen Business Sch, DBP, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Birmingham; Copenhagen Business School,"Broome, A (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",a.j.broome@bham.ac.uk; ls.cbp@cbs.dk,"Seabrooke, Leonard/F-7091-2013; Broome, André/E-5847-2012","Seabrooke, Leonard/0000-0001-5581-3293;",,,,,69,106,111,3,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This framework stresses the fragilities and destabilizing feedback mechanisms that are potential features of all major markets-those for goods, labor, and financial assets. We use a Tobin macroeconomic portfolio approach and the interaction of heterogeneous agents on the financial market to characterize the potential for financial market instability. Though the study of the latter has been undertaken in many partial models, we focus here on the interconnectedness of all three markets. Furthermore, we study what potential labor market, fiscal and monetary policies can have in stabilizing unstable macroeconomies. In order to study this problem we introduce, besides money, long term bonds and equity into the asset market. We in particular propose a countercyclical monetary policy that sells assets in the boom and purchases them in recessions. Modern stability analysis is brought to bear to demonstrate the stabilizing effects of the suggested policies. The policies suggested here could help the Fed in its search for an appropriate exit strategy after its massive intervention in the financial market.","[Chiarella, Carl] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Flaschel, Peter; Koeper, Carsten] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; [Proano, Christian; Semmler, Willi] New Sch Univ, New York, NY USA",University of Technology Sydney; University of Bielefeld; The New School,"Chiarella, C (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",carl.chiarella@uts.edu.au; pflaschel@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de; carsten.koper@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de; christian.proano@googlemail.com; semmlerw@newschool.edu,,"Proano, Christian/0000-0002-5148-7635",,,,,16,0,0,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The impact of cost reduction affects both the financial dimension, and the human and material resources required in any field Perhaps the greatest impact of spending cuts is outlined on human resources, both in their education and training, as well as its remuneration for their work.

This is regarded as one of the reasons why many strategic alliances fail to be successful. The use of a structured partner selection process could be a way to build one's alliance capability and create a better fit and higher alliance performance. In this paper, drawing from quantitative and qualitative research, we argue that alliances are more likely to increase alliance success when the partners pay particular attention to aspects with legal dimension within their partner selection process. Our key argument is that, as inter partner conflicts are the main reasons for alliance failure, by taking a legal perspective and providing adequate governance structure as instruments early on during the partner selection process, may diminish those conflicts and increase alliance success. Our findings from a quantitative study among alliance professionals suggest that the use of negotiation and standard governance is highly effective in helping firms to increase their alliance success. As our study indicates that including clear steps regarding legal aspects of alliance selection, we further explored the role 'the law' (contracts and lawyers) plays and may play in (to optimizing) a successful selection process. We not only show the added value of taking a legal perspective, we also suggest which and when legal elements may be organized in such a way that they support a successful partner selection process.","[Duisters, Danielle] Eindhoven Univ Technol, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Kamminga, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Law, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Duysters, Geert] Tilburg Univ, Eindhoven Univ Technol, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tilburg University; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Duisters, D (通讯作者)，Eindhoven Univ Technol, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",d.duisters@hszuyd.nl; y.p.kamminga@vu.nl; g.m.duysters@tm.tue.nl,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,5,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,654.0,+,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500108,0

Multiculturalism is seen as an experience enriching someone's experience, but this new experience needs to be addressed against an already established cultural background. A discussion of Tilden 's interpretation rules, integrated by more recent studies is also given. As observation techniques have been used, some specific examples from the interpretation material as present in selected spots of the historical park have been selected. Such analysis demonstrates the need of better balance of interpretation material for non-Thai speakers within the park itself A major critique about the difficulty of interaction between social scientists, heritage experts and archaeologists and heritage management is raised, as they have trouble to deal coherently in a way both beneficial to local stakeholders as well as heritage itself Moreover, suggestions about ticketing and different pricing are offered.","[Gozzoli, Roberto B.] Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Bangkok 10700, Thailand",Mahidol University,,,"Gozzoli, Roberto B/N-1006-2013",,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,167.0,+,,,,,,4,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600016,0

On windy days, Denmark tends to export electricity to its neighbours, and to import power on calm days. Storing electricity in this way thus allows the country to deal with the intermittency of wind generation. We show that this kind of behaviour is theoretically optimal when a region with wind and thermal generation can trade with one based on hydro power. However, annual trends in Denmark's trade follow its output of thermal generation and are inversely related to Nordic production of hydro power and the amount of water available to Scan-dinavian generators, with no correlation with wind generation. We estimate the cost of volatility in Denmark's wind output to equal between 4% and 8% of its market value.","[Green, Richard] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Vasilakos, Nicholas] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Vasilakos, Nicholas] Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Imperial College London; University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Green, R (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, London SW7 2AZ, England.",r.green@imperial.ac.uk; n.vasilakos@uea.ac.uk,,"Green, Richard/0000-0002-8671-8966; Vasilakos, Nicholas/0000-0003-3279-2885",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council via the Supergen Flexnet Consortium [EP/E04011X/1],Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council via the Supergen Flexnet Consortium,"This research is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and our industrial partners, via the Supergen Flexnet Consortium, Grant Number EP/E04011X/1.

In addition the researcher used the Ordinal Logistic Regression Analysis to model the relationship between Human Resource Function and the predictor variables. The main findings of the study are that there is a positive significant relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable. Basing on the study it was suggested that for proper adoption of IT in the HR Function within the Kenyan public universities it is important to ensure there is an IT policy that employees are aware of. Second, there is need to have a well planned and organized IT implementation procedure. Third, Management should promote and organize IT literacy skills training and finally, provide adequate IT infrastructure to facilitate IT adoption.","[Kinanga, Robert] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Nairobi, Kenya",Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology,,rongeta@yahoo.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,636.0,654,,,,,,19,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700066,0

At their peak, these emergency credit lines provided nearly $600 billion in financing to economies starved of dollars. This case represents an archetypal example of 'sovereign international last-resort lending'. The article explores this case in order to engage the following two questions. First, what criteria qualify a state to play the role of international lender of last resort (ILOLR)? Second, under what conditions will a state with the capacity to act choose to do so? The article argues that the primary factor from which states derive the capacity to act as ILOLR is the international status of their national currency. Additionally, it contends that states with the capacity to act as ILOLR do so for defensive reasons. Examining the Fed's swap programme, three spillover effects are identified that threatened the US economy and motivated the US central bank to engage in defensive international last-resort lending during the crisis: financial system exposure, interest rate concerns, and a dramatic appreciation in the dollar's exchange rate.","Univ Virginia, Woodrow Wilson Dept Polit, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"McDowell, D (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Woodrow Wilson Dept Polit, POB 400787, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",dem4b@virginia.edu,,,,,,,50,42,45,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

As such, the key research objective is to investigate the core challenges and dimensions of KM in large organizations in South Africa. A review of the existing literature reveals a lack of comprehensive KM research during the ERP implementation phase and particularly, in emerging economies.

Strategies that bloggers use to represent the other are analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative examination is strengthened by a comparative perspective: the representations of Russian people by Chinese bloggers are contrasted with those of Chinese people by Russian-language bloggers. The qualitative examination of blogging posts is underpinned by a genre approach which leads the authors to the conclusion that the blogger's choice of genre, such as personal journal, futuristic fiction or 'letter into the blogosphere', is an important strategy in online identity construction and the representation of the other.","[Rulyova, Natalia] Univ Birmingham, CREES, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Zagibalov, Taras] Brandwatch UK, Brighton BN1 3XE, E Sussex, England",University of Birmingham,"Rulyova, N (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, CREES, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",n.e.rulyova@bham.ac.uk; taras@brandwatch.com,,,,,,,48,3,4,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,8,,,SI,,1524.0,1545,,10.1080/09668136.2012.712280,0.0,,,22,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,008TA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308978300010,0

The literature has underlined the role of international factors, such as globalization and adoption of the euro. In this paper we emphasize the role and dynamics of capital accumulation investigating the impact of the introduction of information technology on capital and production in the Italian economy and the extent to which that is being affected by skills in the labour force. The model is specified and estimated as continuous-time general disequilibrium framework. It presents original features: it analyzes the effects of the introduction of the ICT technology on the Italian economy not in a partial equilibrium context of a single market but from a macro point of view where input markets interact; it does not assume that these markets instantaneously clear but rather that there are imperfections and frictions; it does not impose the condition that the economy necessarily converges to a steady state. The model behaves quite well in replicating the dynamics of the Italian economy. It also shows however that there remains some structural inefficiency that worsened in recent years. In fact, our main finding shows that there exists a permanent gap between optimal and actual output which increased in the latter part of the sample period. While a fraction of this gap can be attributed to unavoidable (market and non market) adjustment costs some is associated to efficiency losses.","[Saltari, Enrico; Wymer, Clifford R.; Giannetti, Marilena] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy; [Federici, Daniela] Univ Cassino, Cassino, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Cassino,"Saltari, E (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.",enrico.saltari@uniroma1.it; wymer@mail.com; d.federici@unicas.i; marilena.giannetti@uniroma1.it,,"saltari, enrico/0000-0001-9599-3962",,,,,39,8,9,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Yet in several important respects this antithesis creates a problematic lens through which to see some significant components of the financial crisis. This is particularly apparent if we sufficiently account for the role that the two privately owned but congressionally chartered American mortgage corporations, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, played in the crisis. These two huge companies were placed into conservatorship by the American federal government in September 2008. This move gave direct operational control over the corporations to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) - an independent federal regulatory agency. At the same time, the American government took effective responsibility for the liabilities of the corporations, which totalled $5.4 trillion. Strikingly, this move was not so much a moment of discontinuity brought about by the explosion of the financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, but in an important sense the culmination of a long-standing relationship between the American state and the two corporations, which had already played its part in the development of the crisis through the subprime-boom.","Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1RX, England",University of Cambridge,"Thompson, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, 17 Mill Lane, Cambridge CB2 1RX, England.",het20@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,9,9,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Our results are robust to a battery of robustness checks.

The main results from the analysis of the demand curve show that the flexibility of the crop plan and competition between irrigated crops are linked to the land constraint, in particular irrigable land. These results show also that the determination of an incentive price for the use of new irrigation technologies is located on the segment where the function of the demand is elastic. In this segment, the farmer's behavior becomes more rational to save water in arid zones like in the south of Tunisia where the water is a limiting factor for the irrigated agriculture.","[Jeder, Houcine; Sghaier, Mongi] Inst Reg Arides IRA, Lab Econ & Soc Rurales, Medenine, Tunisia; [Ben Khalifa, Ahmed] Fac Sci Econ & Gest, Unite Rech Environm Ressources Naturelles Agr, Tunis, Tunisia",Institut des Regions Arides,"Jeder, H (通讯作者)，Inst Reg Arides IRA, Lab Econ & Soc Rurales, Medenine, Tunisia.",,"Sghaier, Mongi/AAV-9326-2020; JEDER, HOUCINE/ABG-6113-2020","JEDER, HOUCINE/0000-0003-1953-8209",,,,,16,2,2,1,7,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2014,13.0,4,,,,,46.0,53,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CD5HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351118700006,0

We aim to obtain the empirical distribution of the expenditure and price elasticities. Note that, the expenditure and price elasticities are obtained using the parameter estimates included in the AIDS model. In the past, a few studies report both the elasticity estimates and their standard errors obtained from the Delta method, but most of studies show only the elasticity estimates (i.e., statistical tests have not been done in most of the past studies). Applying MBB and PB methods to the AIDS model and using Japanese monthly household expenditure data from January, 1975 to December, 2012, we show in this paper that a few elasticities are statistically insignificant. We also compare the standard errors based on the bootstrap method with those based on the Delta method. We obtain the results that the differences between the Delta method and the bootstrap method are not negligible. In addition, the validity of the linear approximated AIDS (LA-AIDS) model which is commonly used in empirical studies is examined. In consequence, we find that the LA-AIDS model shows a poor performance, compared with the AIDS model, because the LA-AIDS model yields inconsistency on the elasticity estimates.","[Mizobuchi, Ken-ichi] Matsuyama Univ, Dept Econ, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908578, Japan; [Tanizaki, Hisashi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Tanizaki, H (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",kmizobuc@cc.matsuyama-u.ac.jp; tanizaki@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Mizobuchi, Kenichi/0000-0002-6637-4238",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23243038] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,32,1,2,1,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Over the past years, several interventions and policies have been implemented to stimulate this mode shift. However, information concerning the effectiveness of these interventions and policies is still limited. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the effectiveness of interventions designed to stimulate a shift from car use to cycling or walking and to obtain insight into the intervention tools that have been used to promote and/or implement these interventions. Methods: Five databases were searched and articles published in English, Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish were included. Only studies that focussed on a mode shift from car use towards active transport in a general adult population, which were published in peer reviewed journals and which investigated effectiveness were included. Intervention tools used were categorized by using the model of Hoogerwerf & Herweijer, as either legal, economic (subsidy, reward system, penalty), communicative (written materials, behavioural tools) and physical tools (providing bicycles, providing better bicycle facilities at work, adjustment of the environment). Results: Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Studies included described work-place-based interventions, architectural and urbanistic adjustments, population-wide interventions, and bicycle-renting systems. Nearly all studies (except three) showed positive effects concerning a mode shift. Most of the included studies used more than one intervention tool and the tools used differed between types of interventions. However, information about the statistical significance of these results was often lacking and the study methodologies used were not of high quality. Conclusion: Nearly all studies showed results in a positive direction. However, the quality of the included studies was mostly low and intervention characteristics were poorly described.

We show that when spillovers within R&D sectors are higher than spillovers across the two R&D sectors, the equilibrium is unstable. However, when spillovers between sectors are higher than within, the equilibrium is a saddle-path. This result emphasizes the need for empirical research that compares quantitatively the importance of these two types of spillovers and highlights the importance of studying intersectoral effects between the two R&D sectors. We describe plausible paths of economic development after changes in crucial parameters and uncover some transitional effects that were impossible to detect in the steady-state analysis. We also show that this model's transition dynamics can mimic the main features of the process of productivity slowdown that began in the 1970s.","[Sequeira, Tiago Neves] Univ Beira Interior, Fac Ciencias Sociais & Humanas, CEFAGE UBI Res Ctr, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal; [Ferreira-Lopes, Alexandra] Inst Univ Lisboa, ISCTE IUL, ISCTE Business Sch Econ Dept, BRU IUL Business Res Unit, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gomes, Orlando] ISCAL Lisbon Polytechn Inst, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gomes, Orlando] BRU IUL Business Res Unit, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Sequeira, TN (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, Fac Ciencias Sociais & Humanas, CEFAGE UBI Res Ctr, Estr Sineiro, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal.",sequeira@ubi.pt,"Gomes, Orlando/JAC-2919-2023; Ferreira-Lopes, Alexandra/B-5994-2009; Sequeira, Tiago/B-5900-2009; Gomes, Orlando/B-6043-2009","Gomes, Orlando/0000-0002-7251-8736; Ferreira-Lopes, Alexandra/0000-0002-9034-846X; Sequeira, Tiago/0000-0002-5501-1562;",,,,,19,1,1,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Using the German Establishment Panel of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), we find differences across the years before, during and after the Great Recession. Furthermore, we analyze the importance of firm characteristics and that of certain, specific measures with respect to the skill shortage. The empirical analysis reveals that the relative skill shortage in the service sector during the Great Recession was more substantial than before and after 2009. The opposite pattern is observed for working time accounts. Firms with a high share of female workers typically experience usually less difficulty in finding qualified employees to fill jobs. However, during the Great Recession, the opposite was observed. Young firms facing competitive pressure, high wages, and without working time accounts that did not hoard skilled workers in the past tend to skill shortage. The estimations confirm that apprenticeship and further training serve to reduce the number of unfilled, high-skill jobs. It is also helpful when the firm has developed a plan for its personnel requirements. Other measures such as retaining older workers or hiring foreign workers were not successful. Ultimately, a skill shortage within a firm is often only a short-term phenomenon and less often observed over a longer period.","[Bellmann, Lutz] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Bellmann, Lutz] Inst Employment Res, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Huebler, Olaf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, IAB Nurnberg, IZA Bonn, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Leibniz University Hannover; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Bellmann, L (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",lutz.bellmann@iab.de; huebler@ewifo.uni-hannover.de,,"Hubler, Olaf/0000-0003-4872-6954",,,,,52,9,9,1,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We investigate the market impact of the announcement that fails-to-deliver have occurred for a sample of real estate investment trusts (REITs). We find little evidence that this announcement affects returns or has any market manipulation ability. We find that fails-to-deliver are most consistent with a 1 to 3 days delivery difference between the short sale and offsetting covering trades. These results hold independent of the type of REIT (equity or mortgage REITs).

EU actors have long acknowledged limits in the EU's strategy towards its southern neighbourhood, which largely bypasses the demands of local populations. The article analyzes the EU's efforts at recreating an 'enhanced' framework of support for political reforms in the south. It concludes that the EU and local partners in the south still have different 'visions' regarding democratic change, which shows the limitations of the EU's understanding of the MENA region.","[Pace, Michelle] Roskilde Univ, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Pace, M (通讯作者)，Roskilde Univ, Dept Soc & Globalisat, Univ Vej 1,POB 260, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",mpace@ruc.dk,,,,,,,54,40,41,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

On the one hand, they contribute to the prestige of the area; on the other hand, they are large generators/attractors of traffic. The ability to successfully balance the pros and cons of the urban location of these large traffic-generating institutions is crucial for their success and for the livability of the city. In this paper this issue has been analyzed selecting as a representative case the University of Trieste. The aim of the research is to understand: (a) how mode choice decisions are made by the teaching and administrative staff and by the students at the various locations where academic activities take place, and (b) how they would be affected by 8 different transport management policies. It is found that changing the parking regulations (via the annual permit cost, the hourly parking fee, the number of parking spaces and the location of the parking lots) greatly influences mode choice in favor of bus use, especially for teaching and administrative staff and in the suburban locations. The students would be impacted by such changes only if an hourly parking tariff is introduced. The alternative approach of fully subsidizing the bus services would also have a large impact on bus ridership, affecting the mode choice in particular of the teaching staff and in the main university suburban sites. Since the implementation of these bus-favoring policies could face the opposition either of the university staff or of the bus company, two more balanced policy mixes were tested: the first one, increasing parking price and imposing new parking restrictions, would increase bus ridership by 19%; the second one, reducing both bus and parking subsidies, would increase bus ridership by 13%.

This paper addresses the potential disconnect by endogenously selecting forecast models from a broad set of fundamentals. The procedure shows that exchange rates are not disconnected from fundamentals, but fundamentals vary in their predictive content at different forecast horizons and for different currencies. Performing model selection out-of-sample is challenging. At short horizons, the method cannot outperform a random walk, although the performance is improved at long horizons. These findings are confirmed across currencies and forecast evaluation methods.

In the standard DD game, if the sum of players' demands is less than or equal to a dollar, each player receives what he demanded; if the sum of demands is greater than a dollar, all players receive zero. We modify this second part, which involves a harsh punishment. In the modified game , if the demands are incompatible, then players have one more chance. In particular, they play an ultimatum game to avoid the excess. In the two-player version of this game, there is a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in which players demand (and receive) an equal share of the dollar. We also provide an -player extension of our mechanism. Finally, the mechanism we propose eliminates not only all pure strategy equilibria involving unequal divisions of the dollar, but also all equilibria where players mix over different demands in the first stage.","[Cetemen, Esat Doruk] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14327 USA; [Karagozoglu, Emin] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",University of Rochester; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Karagözoglu, E (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",ecetemen@z.rochester.edu; karagozoglu@bilkent.edu.tr,"Karagözoğlu, Emin/R-7976-2019","Karagözoğlu, Emin/0000-0003-2442-6949; Cetemen, Esat Doruk/0000-0002-1934-4685",,,,,26,8,10,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2014,77.0,2,,,,,223.0,236,,10.1007/s11238-013-9394-z,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AL2ZX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338995800004,0

The politics of bank ownership,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Foreign bank ownership; banking sector protectionism; bank regulation; bank supervision; financial instability; European debt crisis,FINANCE; CRISIS; UNION; WORLD,"By 2014, there was significant variation across the global economy in the levels of domestic and foreign bank ownership among states. While major emerging and most advanced countries continued to protect domestic control over the bulk of their banking assets, a number of developing and transition economies had opened their banking markets to unprecedentedly high levels of foreign bank ownership. This introduction to a special issue on the politics of bank ownership examines why states have taken such divergent paths, and maps out some of the major consequences of disparate foreign bank ownership levels. The special issue finds that banking sector protectionism against a backdrop of globalization has generated new conflicts and costs for states. Paradoxically, it is the large, powerful countries that are most susceptible to such costs and conflict, in contrast to their more open, if weaker, counterparts. In addition, we find that high levels of foreign bank ownership have not resulted in significant vulnerability for host states, as some scholars had predicted. In some cases, foreign bank ownership can even improve a weak state's power position. Finally, we conclude that states' varying approaches to banking sector protectionism and openness complicate efforts to supranationalize bank regulation and supervision, exacerbating financial instability.","Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Epstein, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",,,,,,,,82,19,21,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The key feature of this character is the marked ability of French and German banks to resist unsolicited takeover bids, especially - although not exclusively- those from foreign competitors. We present an institutional perspective to account for the restrained character of takeovers in French and German banking. Our perspective is composed of two elements. First, institutional arrangements are important since they structure power relations among firm stakeholders by providing opportunities, as well as imposing constraints, to influence the decision-making process in which takeover transactions take place. Second, institutional arrangements provide firm stakeholders with several potential opportunities, not just one, to block unsolicited bids since takeover contests are composed of sequences of decisions for which approval is needed at each stage. French and German banks have used different mixes of institutional arrangements, themselves located at different stages of takeover transactions, to secure restrained markets for corporate control. Our institutional analysis, in turn, also illustrates an important shortcoming of banking sector protectionism, namely the contribution of protection from unsolicited takeover bids to the building of banks carrying systemic risks.","[Goyer, Michel] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [del Real, Rocio Valdivielso] Univ Warwick, Ctr Globalisat & Regionalisat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; University of Warwick,"Goyer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",,,"Goyer, Michel/0000-0002-1342-0384",,,,,82,13,15,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It contributes to two specific modelling issues: latent modal captivity and working with multiple repeated crossectional datasets. In this paper latent modal captivity refers to captive reliance on a specific mode rather than all feasible modes. Three household travel survey datasets collected in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) over a ten-year time period are used for empirical modelling. Datasets collected in different years are pooled and separate year-specific scale parameters and coefficients of key variables are estimated for different years. The empirical model clearly explains that there have been significant changes in latent modal captivity and the mode choice preference structures for commuting in the GTHA. Changes have occurred in the unexplained component of latent captivities, in transportation cost perceptions, and in the scales of commuting mode choice preferences. The empirical model also demonstrates that pooling multiple repeated cross-sectional datasets is an efficient way of capturing behavioural changes over time. Application of the proposed mode choice model for practical policy analysis and forecasting will ensure accurate forecasting and an enhanced understanding of policy impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We test whether consumer behavior leads to potentially unstable market conditions with price bubbles. Our results suggest that appreciation expectations are based on past price appreciation but at the same time they depend on the fundamental factors such as, locational and structural.

The Case of the Czech Republic,EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The quality of democracy depends on both politicians and citizens. While most attention has focused on politicians, this paper looks at citizens. There has been some scepticism about whether the postcommunist public is prepared to rule their countries. The legacies of communism and the rigours of the transition may have produced citizens whose opinions are unstable and ill-informed and therefore a poor basis for democratic policy making. This paper tests this proposition by considering the nature of public opinion in the Czech Republic. Its main conclusion is that postcommunist public opinion is more reasonable than conventional wisdom suggests. Opinions on most policies change slowly if at all and when they do change the changes are prompted more by gradual shifts in mores than by political manipulation. This suggests that citizens in the region are prepared to have a significant voice in policy making.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Roberts, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",aroberts@northwestern.edu,"Roberts, Andrew/X-5831-2019","Roberts, Andrew/0000-0002-0416-5975",,,,,42,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,AUG,2014,66.0,6,,,,,925.0,944,,10.1080/09668136.2014.900973,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AM9GK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340188700004,0

The second, new to the real estate securities literature, tests for economically significant effects through two tests specifically designed to compare multiple forecasts to a benchmark, White's (Econometrica, 1097-1126, 2000) Reality Check and Hansen's (J Bus Econ Stat 23(4):365-380, 2005) Superior Predictive Ability test. The standard approach tells us that while some effects have disappeared over time, statistically significant calendar anomalies persist. However, the tests of White and Hansen strongly suggest that they are not economically significant and thus should not be the basis of an investor's trading strategy nor be considered as a challenge to market efficiency, as has been claimed previously.","[Hui, E.

In this paper, we explore how geographical basis risk of rainfall based derivatives can be reduced by regional diversification. Minimizing geographical basis risk requires knowledge of the joint distribution of rainfall at different locations. For that purpose, we estimate a daily multi-site rainfall model from which optimal portfolio weights are derived. We find that this method allows to reduce geographical basis risk more efficiently than simpler approaches as, for example, inverse distance weighting.","[Ritter, M.; Musshoff, O.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Ritter, M.; Odening, M.] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",University of Gottingen; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Ritter, M (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Invalidenstr 110, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",Matthias.Ritter@agrar.hu-berlin.de,"Odening, Martin/AAV-9918-2020; Ritter, Matthias/G-2391-2017; Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Ritter, Matthias/0000-0003-2543-3673; Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Odening, Martin/0000-0001-6427-1641",German Research Foundation via the Humboldt-University Berlin [CRC 649],German Research Foundation via the Humboldt-University Berlin,"The financial support from the German Research Foundation via the CRC 649 'Economic Risk', Humboldt-University Berlin, is gratefully acknowledged.

Although rational institutionalist explanations point to the role played by the constraining rules of the World Trade Organisation, countries have largely remained open in areas where they have not legally bound their liberalisation. While accounts emphasising the increasing interdependence of global supply chains have some merit, I show that such explanations do not tell the full story, as integration into the global economy is not always associated with support for free trade during the crisis. In response, I develop a constructivist argument which highlights how particular ideas about the global trading system have become rooted in policy-making discourse, mediating the response of policy elites to protectionist pressures and temptations. Trade policy-makers and a group of leading economists have constructed an ideational imperative for continued openness (and for concluding the Doha Round, albeit less successfully) by drawing on a questionable reading of economic history (the Smoot-Hawley myth); by continually stressing protectionism's role as one of the causes of the Great Depression non-liberal responses to the current crisis have been all but ruled out by all except those willing to question the received wisdom.","Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Siles-Brügge, G (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,"Siles-Brugge, Gabriel/0009-0004-6340-3218",,,,,136,16,17,1,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It is striking that the European Union (EU) has until recently preferred a transversal approach to youth, considering youth unemployment as an issue among others. Moreover, the difficulty of the EU to co-operate with a wide spectrum of youth organizations is obvious, especially with those in favour of a far more protective approach against youth employment. However, we seem to witness the rise of a corporatist system in the field of youth, in which a few organizations are considered as legitimate interlocutors, even if they are consulted on issues which are the less sensitive at the expense of youth unemployment policies.","[Chabanet, Didier] Sci Po Cevipof, Paris, France; [Chabanet, Didier] Ecole Normale Super Lyon Triangle, F-69342 Lyon 07, France",Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON),"Chabanet, D (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super Lyon Triangle, 15 Sq Rene Descartes,BP 7000, F-69342 Lyon 07, France.",didierchabanet@hotmail.com,"CHABANET, Didier/HGU-4791-2022",,,,,,36,10,12,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

However, since the late 1990s this stability has been disrupted by a number of factors. The EU reform agenda has been the most important of these. Following a structural-conduct-performance plan, the European Commission has forced changes on players, scenarios and exchange mechanisms through legislative action in order to build a new energy model based on those operating in the United States and the United Kingdom. The main point of this article is that despite these actions, many features of the traditional model have been modified but not removed, and many changes have not brought the results initially expected. These results are mainly due to the fact that the power relations among the main players of the pre-reform model are still in place.","[Fernandez, Rafael; Palazuelos, Enrique] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Pozuelo De Alarcon 28223, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Fernandez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Econ, Pab 2,304 Campus Somosaguas, Pozuelo De Alarcon 28223, Madrid, Spain.",rafernan@ccee.ucm.es,,"Fernandez, Rafael/0000-0003-0602-4233",,,,,37,4,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The long-term individual and societal benefits of investing resources during early childhood make it an unrivaled opportunity for policy. Over the past 30 years, states have gained increasing control over the major policies for families with young children through the devolution of federal programs to states. States have also expanded their innovation and adoption of early childhood education programs during this time, such as prekindergarten. Policy makers need to understand how the differences in these policies across states affect policy effectiveness and child well-being, yet there is limited research, especially during early childhood.

We show that the crisis coincided with dramatic changes in productivity and that many of these changes were sustained in the long run. In particular, an increasing number of industries experienced decreases in average firm productivity during the crisis and did not recover. Further, we find that changes in industrial productivity in the recovery period are driven not by increases in the productivity of existing firms, but rather by the entry of new firms and changes to the reallocation of market share. Finally, we find that foreign exporters' productivity was the least impacted by the crisis, suggesting that only access to alternate forms of both capital and international markets can help to smooth investment and maintain productivity over a financial crisis.","[Poczter, Sharon] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Gertler, Paul] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rothenberg, Alexander D.] RAND Corp, Arlington, VA USA",Cornell University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; RAND Corporation,"Poczter, S (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Rothenberg, Alexander D./O-5556-2019","Rothenberg, Alexander D./0000-0001-9063-248X",,,,,21,6,7,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2014,37.0,5,,,,,705.0,731,,10.1111/twec.12086,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AG4QQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335405700007,0

The 2004 enlargement of the European Union introduced a new partnership entity to the mix-the Visegrad Group of states, comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia-which offers its members a useful model to discuss and represent common interests in a collective manner within the regional and international political landscape. The article provides a reflection on the evolution of the Visegrad Group of states since 2004. It examines four key policy areas (institutional candidacy, energy policy, eastern neighbourhood and defence policy) where the group has either learned some difficult lessons or is seeking to apply those lessons. The article suggests that the Visegrad Group's greatest strength lies in its flexibility to become more responsive to the challenges it faces and it is likely therefore to remain appealing to its member states and to be a permanent feature within the wider cohort of European Union subregional partnerships.","[Toero, Csaba] Hungarian Inst Int Affairs, H-1016 Budapest, Hungary; [Butler, Eamonn] Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland; [Gruber, Karoly] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Gyor, Hungary",University of Glasgow; University of Istvan Szechenyi,"Töro, C (通讯作者)，Hungarian Inst Int Affairs, Berc Utca 13-15, H-1016 Budapest, Hungary.",cs.toro@hiia.hu; eamonn.butler@glasgow.ac.uk; kgruber85@hotmail.com,"Törö, Csaba/GRX-7221-2022",,,,,,46,23,23,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,MAR 16,2014,66.0,3,,,SI,,364.0,393,,10.1080/09668136.2013.855392,0.0,,,30,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AE4KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333950100003,0

These few studies reveal mixed empirical results, and surprisingly only one study has examined bilateral FDI flows. Moreover, few of these studies use multiple governance indicators separating the 'pluralism' effect of democratic institutions from the 'good governance' effect, there are no studies on democratic institutions' various effects on the level of FDI relative to trade, and there are no studies of democratic institutions' various effects on the selection of countries into FDI. We focus on three contributions. First, we examine the simultaneous effects of the World Bank's (six) Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGIs) - which allow separating the effects of pluralism from those of five other good governance measures - on bilateral trade, FDI and FDI relative to trade using state-of-the-art gravity specifications. Second, we find strong evidence that - after accounting for host governments' effectiveness in various roles of good governance - a higher level of pluralism as measured by the WGIs' Voice and Accountability Index reduces trade levels, likely by increasing the 'voice' of more protectionist less-skilled workers, but not FDI levels. Moreover, we find qualitatively different effects of other WGIs - such as political stability - on trade versus FDI flows. Third, we account for firm heterogeneity alongside a large number of zeros in bilateral FDI flows using recent advances in gravity modelling. We distinguish between the (country) intensive and extensive margins and show that pluralism affects FDI inflows negatively at the intensive margin, but positively at the extensive margin.","[Berden, Koen] ECORYS, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Berden, Koen; van Etten, Eva] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Dept Finance, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] Univ Notre Dame, Kellogg Inst Int Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; Ifo Institut,"Berden, K (通讯作者)，ECORYS, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,72,32,33,1,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2014,37.0,3,,,,,353.0,386,,10.1111/twec.12135,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AD7LK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333445200001,0

The welfare analysis of mobility often fails, however, to account for the cost of the variability of periodic incomes around permanent incomes. This paper assesses the net welfare benefit of mobility by assuming both an aversion to inequality in permanent incomes and an aversion to variability in periodic incomes. The paper further investigates the combined (and comparative) impact of mobility and the tax system (another presumed income equalizer) on the dynamics of income across time and on the inequality of income across individuals. Using panel data, we find that Canada's tax system limits significantly the redistributive impact of mobility while also lowering considerably the cost of income variability. The permanent income equalizing effect of taxes can reach up to 23 % of mean income at the higher values of inequality aversion that we use. Globally, the net social welfare effect of both mobility and taxation is (almost always) positive and substantial, often amounting to around 30 % of mean income. For all choices of parameter values, the tax effect exceeds substantially the net effect of mobility on inequality and social welfare.","[Bibi, Sami] Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Duclos, Jean-Yves] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ GIV 0A6, Canada; [Duclos, Jean-Yves] Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ GIV 0A6, Canada; [Duclos, Jean-Yves] Inst Anal Econ CSIC, Barcelona, Spain; [Araar, Abdelkrim] Univ Laval, PEP, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Araar, Abdelkrim] Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University; Laval University; Laval University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Laval University; Laval University,"Duclos, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ GIV 0A6, Canada.",sbibi@ecn.ulaval.ca; jyves@ecn.ulaval.ca; aabd@ecn.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,27,3,3,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2014,42.0,3,,,,,503.0,527,,10.1007/s00355-013-0749-8,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AD1XZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333028300001,0

As a matter of fact a number of transit promotion policies explicitly based on qualitative factors and specifically high architectural standards are being adopted in designing new railways stations and several examples of remarkable architecture applied to railways stations can be found all round the world. In spite of this, the literature in transportation modelling has not yet analyzed the impact of the hedonic quality on travelers' behaviour quantifying whether and by how much it increases their propensity to use rail services. A binomial logit model, simulating the choice between a traditional rail line and a new line open in 2009 in the northern area of Naples - Italy (high architectural and aesthetic standards railways) was specified and estimated for trips having both routing options between the same origin-destination pair. The model was specified with serial correlation in residuals and estimated using RP-SP data for different users' segments. The main difference between the two alternatives in the real scenario was the stations architectural quality as all other attributes, including travel time, frequency, access and egress times, trains and riding comfort, security, were basically the same. In Stated Preference experiments several scenarios were presented to users with four levels of level of service attributes and factorial fractional design. The results show a significant impact of stations architectural quality on users' choices and allow to estimate reciprocal substitution coefficients with respect to other level of service attributes. The average monetary value of stations quality was quantified in 35 Euro cents/trip for students and in 50 Euro cents/trip for commuters (+43%). Alternative-specific waiting time coefficients showed a context effect for both students and commuters (respectively 31% and 35% lower values for traditional stations) but they did not explain entirely the preference for high architectural railways line. It also resulted that female travelers showed a significant preference for stations quality (+33% with respect to male). Other results related to access and egress time suggest that, if everything else being equal, the high architectural line have a larger catchment area with respect to a traditional rail of approximately 400 meters by walking. The results of this research should be compared with those from other contexts as they have a potential impact for railways planning showing that architectural quality of stations should be considered as an explicit design variable and could be compared with other, possibly more expensive, improvements (e.g. frequency increases, accessibility improvements) and poses new challenges for modelling user behaviour and quality-related measures.

Previous research argued that the proliferation of outsourcing, divestment and non-standard employment results in a dualism' between a core of secure workplaces and a growing fringe of precarious jobs. Evidence from two key sectors, metalworking and telecommunications, however, suggest that this clear-cut division is replaced by a fragmented landscape of labour relations. In terms of institutional change, the analysis reveals a specific form of incremental transformative change, namely a shift in the meaning of formally stable legal-political institutions. Even in the allegedly stable core areas, the institutions of labour relations are gradually transformed from market-constituting institutions to market-dependent variables. Vertical disintegration plays an important role in this process of institutional commodification. It not only moves the core-periphery boundary; it is also deployed to subjugate collective bargaining, workplace co-determination and the utilization of labour law to firm-level economic calculations.","[Holst, Hajo] Univ Jena, Inst Sociol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Holst, Hajo] Univ Jena, German Res Fdn Res Grp Postgrowth Soc, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Holst, H (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Inst Sociol, Carl Zeiss Str 2, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",hajo.holst@uni-jena.de,,,,,,,48,59,61,0,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

From the beginning it has focused on the reforestation and soil regeneration of 50 ha through the extensive use of large-scale commons so as to ensure the biodiversity of plants and animals in the entire region. The hill formations of Senou protected by Centre Mampuya represent a botanical refugium, a kind of living repository of genetic material for both endangered and well established and flourishing tree species. The Centre has become a model for committed people (most of whom are women) in the region and in the entire country. Since this is a project taking place in the peri-urban area of Dakar, in Toubab Dialaw, it is important to mention the situation around the Centre, which is surrounded by uncontrolled urbanization (i.e., a chaotic layout of half-developed plots going down to the sea). This unregulated urban development is the result of speculation on the part of many local and foreign investors and local field owners (farmers) following the construction of the new airport, located 8 km away; it is also partially explained by the proximity of the sea (Petite Cote). Centre Mampuya has become a model for revitalization, agro-forestry, production and preservation of seeds in specific seed-banks and the production of scions and cuttings of endangered wild plants in a tree-nursery. Working together with farmers, the Centre is developing strategies of self-reliant sustainability (www.sahel-vert.org).","[Bassoum, S.] Ctr Mampuya, BP31, Popenguine, Senegal",,"Bassoum, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Mampuya, BP31, Popenguine, Senegal.",ghiggi@antonghiggi.com,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-08-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1021.0,,,,,,367.0,372,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1021.33,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB5GQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343861400033,0

These characteristics are presented and described and where possible their theoretical and empirical backing is given. Only a few visual characteristics in road design have been subjected to empirical perception studies, so their importance for road users and residents remains unclear. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The former is the simple variance (or standard deviation) of test scores. Its selection is informed by consideration of two measurement issues that have typically been overlooked in the literature: the implications of the standardization of test scores for inequality indices, and the possible sample selection biases arising from the Program of International Student Assessment (PISA) sampling frame. The measure of inequality of educational opportunity is given by the share of the variance in test scores that is explained by pre-determined circumstances. Both measures are computed for the 57 countries in which PISA surveys were conducted in 2006. Inequality of opportunity accounts for up to 35 percent of all disparities in educational achievement. It is greater in (most of) continental Europe and Latin America than in Asia, Scandinavia, and North America. It is uncorrelated with average educational achievement and only weakly negatively correlated with per capita gross domestic product. It correlates negatively with the share of spending in primary schooling, and positively with tracking in secondary schools.","[Ferreira, Francisco H.

All of the pesticide levels fell below the FAO/WHO recommended levels, except gamma-BHC (Lindane) and beta-BHC, whose levels dropped significantly (p<0.05) but were still higher than the FAO/WHO recommended levels. From the results of the analyses, storing cabbage for 14 days could remove all traces of Aldrin, Dieldrin and Endosulfan sulphate. Organochlorine pesticides are banned for vegetable production in Ghana; therefore, the detection of these organochlorine pesticides residues in cabbage samples indicates misuse of agrochemicals among cabbage producers in the forest ecozone, and these cabbages therefore pose health hazards for consumers, particularly if they are consumed soon after harvest.","[Kumah, P.; Amoako, P.

A growing chorus of observers believes this dollar-centered order is coming to an end. While much commentary revolves around changes in the distribution of power, measures are only loosely related to the material basis for currency dominance. A proper understanding of the dollar's global role requires a quantitative assessment of the United States' monetary capabilities and currency influence relative to potential rivals. Moreover, while there is general recognition that a shift in power capabilities away from the United States is an insufficient, although necessary, condition for the prevailing currency hierarchy to reverse, there exists no systematic exploration of how power is exercised when converting monetary capabilities into currency influence. This paper offers a systematic assessment of the monetary capabilities and currency influence of all countries in the world as well as an analysis of how the three faces of power sustain dollar hegemony.","Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Norrlof, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,"Norrlof, Carla/V-5834-2019",,,,,,81,53,62,5,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

However, most research has neglected the role played by indigenous underutilized species, even though increasingly it is recognized that promoting these species (which include African indigenous vegetables - AIVs), will be a crucial factor in the development of more resilient, sustainable farming systems for sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, although fewer varieties of AIVs are being used today, certain species are still very popular and in high demand. Understanding to what extent and how AIVs are currently being produced in UPA is an essential step towards developing a coordinated strategy for research and development efforts to support the production of these species. This paper analyses primary data on the production systems for AIVs in UPA in four West African cities: Cotonou and Lokossa in Benin, and Abidjan and Yamoussoukro in Cote d'Ivoire. The AIVs which contribute most to farmers' income for both countries include Abelmoschus esculentus, Amaranthus spp., Corchorus olitorius and Solanum macrocarpon/S. aethiopicum. Certain locations appear to be specializing in particular AIVs, e.g., C. olitorius in Lokossa. In Cote d'Ivoire, urban locations had higher AIV diversity than peri-urban locations. Intercropping of the most commercially important AIVs was widespread in urban locations in Cotonou, Abidjan and Yamoussoukro. Pesticide use was common in all locations except in peri-urban Yamoussoukro. Inorganic fertilizer was used by 85-100% of farmers in UPA in Cotonou and Abidjan, and in urban Yamoussoukro. Organic inputs were used by over 90% of farmers in urban Cotonou, Abidjan and Yamoussoukro, mainly in the form of chicken manure. Comparison of production practices and farmer motivation suggest that production of AIVs in Benin is more market-oriented than in Cote d'Ivoire. The paper concludes with recommendations for future work.","[Pasquini, M.

In order to do that, preferences of households need to be taken into account, which can be expressed by an appropriate utility function. Performance measures used in the market are strongly focused on linear models such as CAPM. It was there assumed that an increase of risk should be compensated by a proportional growth of expected return. Households, characterized by an increasing and concave utility function, expect a non-linear increase of the expected rate of return in exchange for the extra risk taken. It is important to find a performance measure that takes into account household indifference curves. For example, it might be the Generalized Sharpe Ratio (GSR), proposed by (Hodges, 1998), or a measure proposed by (Leland, 1999) modifying the traditional beta of CAPM so that it incorporates investor's utility function, that was suggested to replace Jensen's alpha.","[Pietrzyk, Radoslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Financial Investments & Risk Management, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Pietrzyk, R (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Financial Investments & Risk Management, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",radoslaw.pietrzyk@ue.wroc.pl,"Pietrzyk, Radoslaw/S-2267-2016","Pietrzyk, Radoslaw/0000-0002-6583-8424",,,,,15,0,0,0,4,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-43-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,145.0,+,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367244900015,0

Several papers find a positive relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and the domestic performance of firms. In this paper, we address the FDI - export' relationship to better understand this trend. Furthermore, by presenting results on firm's post-divestiture employment growth at home, we are able to provide a more comprehensive view on firm performance after stepping in and out of foreign markets. We apply a propensity score matching technique in combination with a difference-in-difference estimator to analyse the performance dynamics of French firms that either invested abroad or carried out foreign divestitures during the period 2000-2007. FDI has, on average, a positive effect in terms of export share, operating turnover and employment in firm's domestic market. Industry differences reveal that firms in high-tech industries experience a strong increase in their domestic performance, whereas firm performance in low-tech industries increases only moderately in post-investment periods. In contrast, the divestiture impact on the post-divestiture performance is rather negligible.","[Engel, Dirk] Univ Appl Sci Stralsund, Stralsund, Germany; [Engel, Dirk; Procher, Vivien] Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Essen, Germany; [Procher, Vivien] Berg Univ Wuppertal, Jackstadt Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat Res, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Wuppertal, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Wuppertal,"Engel, D (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Stralsund, Stralsund, Germany.",,"Engel, Dirk/ABD-8170-2021","Engel, Dirk/0000-0002-8203-7530",,,,,46,10,13,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2013,36.0,12,,,,,1478.0,1493,,10.1111/twec.12068,0.0,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,273CN,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328511500002,0

Existing studies largely ignore the intersector labour movement between the manufacturing and service sectors by focusing only on the intrasector movement within the manufacturing sector. However, by decomposing the aggregate labour demand in the United States, we find that the intersector movement is more substantial than intrasector movement. Motivated by the decomposition results, this study presents a three-sector model that includes a manufacturing sector and two service sectors at varying skill intensities. The model shows that offshoring might translate into smaller-than-expected wage changes because of the intersector labour movement. In line with the theoretical predictions, two notable empirical results are presented. First, an occupation's exposure to offshoring has non-significant, albeit negative, effects on wages. Second, the more an occupation is exposed to offshoring, the lower its employment in the manufacturing sector as a share of its total employment. Furthermore, these effects are larger for more routine occupations or those requiring less education.","[Feng, Ling] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhiyuan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhiyuan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Adv Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhiyuan] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Feng, L (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,17,0,1,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2013,36.0,12,,,,,1542.0,1565,,10.1111/twec.12088,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,273CN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328511500005,0

Chinese scholars in the field of IPE have until recently rarely used constructivism as an approach to study IPE for two reasons. The first, like Western IPE, is the short history of constructivism as a theoretical perspective. The second, unlike Western IPE, stems from the long-standing dominance of Marxism, China's official state ideology, in the academic field. In China, Marxism's materialist core shapes the basic research questions of IPE. Unsurprisingly then, constructivist analysis is quite alien to the dominant intellectual discourse in China. Nonetheless, of late, more Chinese scholars have begun to apply constructivist analysis. This paper surveys these developments and is divided into three sections. The first section provides an overview of how Chinese Marxist scholars approach the major issues of IPE as they relate to China. The second section provides an overview of the work of liberal-minded Chinese scholars who work on major IPE issues, another counterpoint to the Marxist school. The third section, which is the major focus of this paper, examines how Chinese scholars have applied the constructivist concepts to study major IPE issues in the Chinese context.","[Wang, Qingxin K.] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Blyth, Mark] Brown Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Tsinghua University; Brown University,"Wang, QXK (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,41,4,7,1,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We examine the economic and emissions impacts of this goal using renewable fuel produced from a Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process from renewable oils. Our approach employs an economy-wide model of economic activity and energy systems and a detailed partial equilibrium model of the aviation industry, If soybean oil is used as a feedstock, we find that meeting the aviation biofuel goal in 2020 will require an implicit subsidy from airlines to biofuel producers of $2.69 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. If the aviation goal can be met by fuel from oilseed rotation crops grown on otherwise fallow land, the implicit subsidy is $0.35 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. As commercial aviation biofuel consumption represents less than 2% of total fuel used by this industry, the goal has a small impact on the average price of jet fuel and carbon dioxide emissions. We also find that, under the pathways we examine, the cost per tonne of CO2 abated due to aviation biofuels is between $50 and $400. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Shifts in the thinking of Chinese scholars correlate with China's own changing role and location in a system still most profoundly influenced by the United States. But real and perceived changes in America's position have also influenced the way in which Chinese IPE scholars are now reconceptualizing the nature of global authority and the international position of China. In one generation, the mainstream of China's IPE scholarship has moved away from its rigid Marxist origins and converged in substantial part with Anglo-American ideological traditions, now prominently including liberal institutionalism. Nevertheless, scholarship informed by other traditions, including a re-imagined Confucianism, flourishes. Major policy-changing events clearly affect the work of Chinese IPE scholars, a phenomenon hardly unknown elsewhere.","[Yong, Wang] Peking Univ, Sch Int Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Pauly, Louis] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",Peking University; University of Toronto,"Yong, W (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Int Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,79,16,18,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The literature on factor models has often made assumptions that preclude the three effects to occur simultaneously. In this paper I propose a conditionally heteroskedastic factor model that takes into account the presence of both the conditional skewness and leverage effects. This model is specified in terms of conditional moment restrictions and unconditional moment conditions are proposed allowing inference by the generalized method of moments (GMM). The model is also shown to be closed under temporal aggregation. An application to daily excess returns on sectorial indices from the UK stock market provides strong evidence for dynamic conditional skewness and leverage with a sharp efficiency gain resulting from accounting for both effects. The estimated volatilitypersistence from the proposed model is lower than that estimated from models that rule out such effects. I also find that the longer the returns' horizon, the fewer conditionally heteroskedastic factors may be required for suitable modeling and the less strong is the evidence for dynamic leverage. Some of these results are in line with the main findings of Harvey and Siddique () and Jondeau and Rockinger (), namely that accounting for conditional skewness impacts the persistence in the conditional variance of the return process.

The first question examines the existence of agglomeration economies in the hospital service industry. The second considers whether the sharing of intermediate inputs contributes to spillovers from spatial concentration of hospital services. These questions are addressed by estimating a bivariate probit model that explicitly controls for potential correlations between whether a service is provided and how the service is provided. Three key findings are obtained. First, hospitals in more concentrated areas are more likely to outsource intermediate services to specialized intermediate service suppliers. This suggests that agglomeration economies exist in the hospital service industry and are generated in part through the sharing of intermediate inputs. Second, the presence of nearby small hospitals increases the tendency to outsource, which is consistent with a Chinitz effect identified elsewhere in the literature. Third, the agglomeration effect attenuates geographically. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using a new database on Michigan banks, we employ probit and survival duration analysis to examine the effectiveness of the RFC's loan program (the policy tool employed before March 1933) and the RFC's preferred stock purchases (the policy tool employed after March 1933) on bank failure rates. We find that RFC's purchases of preferred stock-which did not increase indebtedness or subordinate depositors-increased the chances that a bank would survive the financial crisis, but RFC loans did not. Preferred stock assistance not only contributed to loan supply by reducing failure risk; conditional on bank survival, RFC preferred stock assistance was associated with significantly higher lending by recipient banks from 1931 to 1935.

We view vulnerability as the burden caused by the threat of poverty. Exposure to states of the world where hardship may strike causes distress ex-ante, even if ex-post the dice are benign and poverty (consumption below a critical norm) does not materialise. We ensure our measures meet a set of desirable axioms-in the case of aggregate vulnerability, this set includes sensitivity to the degree of correlation of outcomes across individuals. We argue that individual vulnerability levels are not enough to compose the aggregate picture, e.g. because society may be wary of the threat of simultaneous, widespread poverty. We illustrate with data from Ethiopia, where rainfall risks are found to raise vulnerability to poverty despite sustained increases in consumption.","[Calvo, Cesar] Univ Piura, Piura, Peru; [Dercon, Stefan] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",Universidad de Piura; University of Oxford,"Dercon, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",cesar.calvo@udep.pe; stefan.dercon@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,39,48,0,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2013,41.0,4,,,,,721.0,740,,10.1007/s00355-012-0706-y,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,219ZR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324551000001,0

A divergence with respect to the list/transaction prices and the expected effort levels between seller and agent will create a principal-agent interest conflict. This conflict in some cases results in an agent change before the house is sold. The change will reduce the relative bargaining power of the seller, affecting the observed marketing time and transaction price. This study estimates the effects of an agent change on marketing time and transaction price after controlling for degree of overpricing, list-price revisions, marketing time, and endogenous selection bias. Our results show that: (1) on average, an agent change increases the marketing time by about 3 months and adversely affects the transaction price by about 2.7 %. Furthermore, we found that an agent change before the expiration of the listing contract, compared to that of after the expiration, has a smaller effect on the marketing time (2.3 vs. 3.8 months) and has a smaller transaction price discount (2.1 % vs. 4.2 %).","[Daneshvary, Nasser; Clauretie, Terrence M.] Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Daneshvary, N (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, 4505 S Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",nasser.daneshvary@unlv.edu; mike.clauretie@unlv.edu,,,,,,,29,10,10,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We use proprietary information on short sales between June 2006 and September 2008 to examine how short sales and short sale constraints affect the variation in monthly REIT NAV premiums using panel vector autoregression models. We find that variation in short sale activity across individual REITs can account for at least one-third of the variation in NAV premiums. Short sale constraints tend to be binding when there is strong demand and limited supply of shares to short. Excess demand leads to overvaluation and the correction of the overvaluation explains the under-performance of premium REITs.,"[Brounen, Dirk] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Ling, David C.] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Prado, Melissa Porras] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal",Tilburg University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Brounen, D (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",d.brounen@uvt.nl; ling@ufl.edu; melissa.prado@nova.sbe.pt,,"Porras Prado, Melissa/0000-0001-5616-1135",,,,,49,14,14,0,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SEP,2013,41.0,3,,,,,481.0,516,,10.1111/reec.12004,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,217AZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324330200002,0

Hence, independence between experiments cannot be presumed if subjects participate repeatedly.

Yet, after nine years of full membership, eastern European (EE) corporations stay away from EU-level policy-making. This article argues that the institutional structures emerging in post-socialist countries constitute obstacles to firms developing the necessary capabilities for supranational lobbying. While firms in London and Brussels become increasingly professional in their lobbying strategies, large post-socialist firms handle lobbying exclusively at the highest level of the organizational hierarchy through informal interpersonal networks. It is argued in the article that the confinement of lobbying strategy to the top echelon of corporate management reduces its effectiveness and scope.

How etiquette shapes PEV drivers' vehicle charging behavior,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Etiquette; Electric vehicle; Charging; Rules; Infrastructure,,"Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) engage drivers in an essential new behavior plugging the car into the electrical grid to charge the vehicles' batteries. Broadly, it has been assumed that (1) away-from-home charging is necessary to grow the PEV market and (2) if away-from-home charging infrastructure is in place and PEV drivers know of it, they will perceive opportunities to charge. The experiences of early PEV drivers cause us to rethink at least the second of these assumptions. Drivers report a lack of what they call etiquette, i.e., rules to guide their behavior and their expectations of how they and other PEV drivers ought to behave in these new social interactions. PEV drivers want widely shared, understood, and practiced guidelines to feel comfortable and confident in charging their vehicles away from home. This study uses inductive thematic analysis of transcripts of interviews of 28 PEV driving households conducted in San Diego County, California in spring, 2012. Themes about etiquette emerged within two types of away from home charging. First, public chargers (available to any PEV driver) were the sites of situations in which drivers' perceived a lack of rules or conflicts between different systems of rules; both were described as inhibiting use of public chargers. Second, workplace charging (typically available only to employees of the entity where the charger is located) adds an additional layer of rules and possibly resources that may either inhibit or encourage PEV charging by employees. As PEV markets and charger networks grow, charging will be shaped by additional systems of rules and regulations, e.g., those governing financial transactions. Our results suggest that absent efforts to help PEV drivers develop, learn, and practice the new rules, they may create as much uncertainty as guidance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a strong connection between PT infrastructures and real estate markets since the former may generate externalities that can influence sales prices. This paper aims at estimating the actual effect of implementing a commuter train service between a major city (Montreal, Canada) and its southern periphery occurring in 2000-2003. Using a difference-indifferences (DID) estimator in the hedonic price model for single-family house sales between 1992 and 2009, the paper estimates the direct marginal price impact of a new commuter train service following changes in access to stations. Results suggest that the opening of a new commuter train service on the Montreal South Shore generates a location premium for houses located in the stations' vicinity (as measured through walking distance and car driving time) as opposed to houses that do not experience any improvement in accessibility to the commuter train service, either in space or in time. In addition, the new service raises property tax income for involved municipalities by several million dollars a year through enhanced property values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is based on a sample of 33 countries. Variations in gender distribution are assessed using a reliable measure of occupational segregation, marginal matching. The analysis uses recent survey data (collected between 2002 and 2006) and a differentiated occupational classification scheme at the ISCO-88 3-digit level.

Evidence from four cases in the Middle East and North Africa,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Autocracy; rush to free trade; trade and capital account liberalization; IMF surveillance power; Morocco; Tunisia; Egypt; Jordan,POLITICAL-ECONOMY; POLICY; IMF,"This paper argues that within autocracies the beginning of IMF-friendly trade and capital account reforms is highly contingent on the ability of alternative policy regulations to provide respective regimes with domestically needed amounts of convertible foreign exchange. A longitudinal comparison of four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan) between the 1960s and the early 1990s in the Middle East and North Africa region shows a historical sequencing of reforms. Before the implementation of orthodox policy change, foreign exchange scarcity was managed primarily by rising restrictions, accumulation of debt and a number of unilateral country-specific strategies, including broader economic openings (infitah) and selective capital account liberalizations. However, IMF-friendly reforms only became a political option after the failure of these alternative policies and the simultaneous drying up of unconditional finance. These findings complement recent debates about the rush to free trade in at least two aspects. First, they point to distinct causal mechanisms depending on the type of political regime (e.g., autocracy versus democracy), explaining the beginning of trade and capital account liberalizations among developing nations. They specify, second, one important contextual condition in regard to the effectiveness of IMF surveillance power.","GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Inst Middle East Studies, Hamburg, Germany",German Institute of Global & Area Studies,"Richter, T (通讯作者)，GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Inst Middle East Studies, Hamburg, Germany.",,"Richter, Thomas/AAA-4169-2021","Richter, Thomas/0000-0003-4812-0725",,,,,75,2,2,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

All Eurosceptic messages are critical of European integration; they do not all vilify similar aspects of the European Union. This article proposes a framing model of the effects of Euroscepticism on citizens' domestic political attitudes. EU critiques that are framed in terms of democratic deficit' lead citizens to consider which political values are desirable in democratic society and may promote support for liberal democratic norms among citizens exposed to these messages. Eurosceptic rhetoric is built into framing experiments that vary the content of EU-critical messages. Subjects in the United Kingdom and Bulgaria are randomly exposed to a cultural threat' or democratic deficit' criticism of the EU. Both Eurosceptic frames reduce support for integration, but subjects exposed to the deficit frame' more strongly embrace liberal democratic values.

I show that, similar to the recent computerization episode, the electrification of the manufacturing sector led to a hollowing out of the skill distribution whereby workers in the middle of the distribution lost out to those at the extremes. OLS estimates show that electrification increased the demand for clerical, numerical, planning and people skills relative to manual skills while simultaneously reducing relative demand for the dexterity-intensive jobs which comprised the middle of the skill distribution. Thus, early twentieth century technological change was unskill-biased for blue collar tasks but skill-biased on aggregate. These results are in line with the downward trend in wage differentials within U.S. manufacturing up to 1950. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, it uses Kyrgyzstan as a case study to test the argument that environmental concerns mobilized people to engage in protest and in ways different from other kinds of protest. This essay presents the first systematic study of public opinion about the environment in Kyrgyzstan. It includes results from a 2009 nationwide survey, over 100 expert and elite interviews, and newspaper content analysis. Furthermore, it spatially analyzes these results to identify geographical variation in public perception and political event occurrence patterns. Protest engagement is a complex process determined by the interaction of several factors, and is not explained solely by affluence, rationality, or grievances. Eco-mobilization - collective political action about the environment - represents a class of protest events that offers a different view into mass discontent in the former Soviet Union and neo-patrimonial societies. The study finds that these political actions about the environment are not necessarily elite driven; there is a basic foundation of national concern and salience of these issues, and demonstrated environmental beliefs do help to explain protest behavior.","Bucknell Univ, Environm Studies Program, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Wooden, AE (通讯作者)，Bucknell Univ, Environm Studies Program, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",amanda.wooden@bucknell.edu,,"Wooden, Amanda/0000-0003-0094-0214",,,,,111,23,23,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Using data for the world economies, the US states, the EU regions, and the Italian regions, we find that despite the distribution of income per capita for both the world economies and for the Italian regions is multimodal, only in the former case absolute convergence can be rejected. Similarly, although the distributions for the EU regions and the US states are both unimodal, convergence is unambiguously taking place in the latter case only. We show that these results are consistent with the neoclassical model of growth in the presence of non-convexities in production.

This paper analyses the accessibility impacts for first/last mile transport connectivity to/from the major transit line using two most common feeder transit services - fixed route transit (FRT) and demand responsive transit (DRT). Analytical results show that for impedance decay factor (beta) values equal to 1, the potential accessibility is a monotonically increasing function with respect to number of fixed stops visited by the FRT shuttle and number of passenger demands served by the DRT. The value of beta greater than 1 results in maximizing the potential accessibility at an optimal number of fixed stops for FRT and an optimal number of passenger demand being served in a cycle for DRT. However, with a fractional value for beta, there is no maximum or minimum potential accessibility that can be obtained either for the FRT or the DRT. Further, we illustrate the effects of impedance decay factor on accessibility using sensitivity analysis for the FRT and using simulations with real feeder like services operating in Denver, Colorado for the DRT. The handy formulas and equations developed in this paper can be extremely useful to transit planners and policy-makers in quickly deciding on an optimal feeder service operating policy for maximizing accessibility to/from a major transit line stop.

Synthesising evidence from the global environmental justice and feminist and international political economy (IPE) literatures, it analyses the changing social property relations of global recycling chains. The authors argue that, although recycling more would seem to make good ecological sense, corporate programmes can rely on and further ingrain social patterns of harm and exploitation, particularly for the burgeoning labour force that depends on recyclables for subsistence living. Turning the waste stream into a profit stream also relies on prison labour in some places, such as in the United States where the federal government operates one of the country's largest electronics recycling programmes. The ongoing corporatisation of recycling, the authors argue further, is devaluing already marginalised populations within the global economy. Highlighting the need to account for the dynamism between social and environmental change within IPE scholarship, the article concludes by underlining the ways in which green commerce' programmes can shift capital's contradictions from nature onto labour.","[Dauvergne, Peter] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Dauvergne, Peter; LeBaron, Genevieve] Univ British Columbia, Liu Inst Global Issues, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Dauvergne, P (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, 6476 NW Marine Dr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",peter.dauvergne@ubc.ca; genevieve.lebaron@ubc.ca,"LeBaron, Genevieve/JJF-3645-2023; /K-2994-2013","Dauvergne, Peter/0000-0003-2887-8168; /0000-0003-0083-6126",,,,,65,22,25,1,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Evidence from a social experiment,EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Monitoring; Moral hazard; Public social insurance; Survival analysis; Instrumental variables,THREAT,"During the last decade several empirical studies have stressed the importance of norms and social interactions for explaining sickness-absence behavior. In this context, public discussions about the intentions of the insurance, and of the rights and duties of the receivers, may be important for reducing the sickness absence. In this article, we study whether information meetings about the Swedish sickness insurance affect the length of sickness-absence spells. The study is based on experimental data on individuals with weak labor market attachments. The displacement of when the call to the meeting was sent out was randomized. Comparing the survival functions of those called immediately with those whose calls were delayed (by about 30 days) makes it possible to study whether the length of sickness absence is affected by receiving the call earlier. The result suggests that the length is reduced by, on average, 20%. In the long term (12 months later), there is no effect of the information meeting. This suggests that attendance to the information meeting does not change individuals' long-term behavior.","[Johansson, Per; Lindahl, Erica] Uppsala Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Lindahl, E (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Stockholm, Sweden.",erica.lindahl@ifau.uu.se,"Johansson, Per/AAD-2929-2020","Johansson, Per/0000-0001-6140-9123",,,,,27,9,9,1,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We believe that a Cartesian product structure is a pertinent way to describe individual rights in the social choice theory since it discriminates the personal features comprised in each social state. First we define some conceptual and formal tools related to the Cartesian product structure. We then apply these notions to Gibbard's paradox and to Sen's impossibility of a Paretian liberal.

The findings suggest that LCC-airport relationships tend to establish with institutional approach when the capacity of the airport is nearly saturated. In contrast, they establish the relationships with negotiation approach when the capacity of the airport is under-utilized. The power differences determine the equality or inequality of exchange of compromise and support between the LCC and the airport; the dependence determines their willingness to compromise, provide support to each other, and also the strength of their attachment; the mutual dependence determines the total strength of the attachment of both parties, hence the solidity of their relationships.

Existing models of social preferences make ad hoc parametric assumptions about the nature of this duality. This creates a problem of experimental identification of preferences since without such assumptions it is impossible to distinguish whether consumption or social concerns are driving the behavior. Given observed choice, the Axiomatic model of preferences in this article makes it possible to unambiguously determine personal and social utility without any assumptions about their relationship. The unique separation can be achieved only if the individual choices in different subgroups of other people are available. Preferences over consumption and status are used as an example to demonstrate how the utility is constructed. The model shows what kind of information about choice is needed to empirically determine the nature of social preferences without making restrictive assumptions. This can help to estimate whether personal consumption or social value is more important in economic decisions.","Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Vostroknutov, A (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",a.vostroknutov@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Vostroknutov, Alexander/AAC-8089-2020",,,,,,34,2,2,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2013,74.0,4,,,,,509.0,537,,10.1007/s11238-011-9291-2,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,084JS,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314535800003,0

We consider both default risk and prepayment risk. What makes the role of prepayment penalty interesting and more complicated is that a borrower's contract choice could send conflicting signals to the lender about that borrower's default and prepayment risk type. This is different from earlier theoretical models of mortgage choice under asymmetric information where a certain aspect of the contract (e.g., discount points or loan-to-value ratio) is explored as a screening mechanism for a single risk dimension (default risk or prepayment risk) of the borrower type. We show the existence of separating equilibria where different default and prepayment risk types choose contracts with different combinations of prepayment penalty and interest rate. For certain parameter combinations, the model also generates a pooling equilibrium where all borrower types obtain the same contract. Our analysis could offer a partial explanation for the observation that contracts with prepayment penalties are a lot less prevalent than contracts with points.","[Bian, Xun] Longwood Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Farmville, VA 23901 USA; [Yavas, Abdullah] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sch Business, Dept Real Estate & Urban Land Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Longwood University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Bian, X (通讯作者)，Longwood Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Farmville, VA 23901 USA.",bianx@longwood.edu; ayavas@bus.wisc.edu,,"Bian, Xun/0000-0002-4372-9382",,,,,16,4,5,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2013,41.0,1,,,,,193.0,224,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2012.00336.x,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,096KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315402800007,0

Empirical evidence for that population indicates that fertility increases with men's income.","[Black, Dan A.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Black, Dan A.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Black, Dan A.; Taylor, Lowell J.] NORC, Chicago, IL USA; [Kolesnikova, Natalia] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Kolesnikova, Natalia] Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA; [Sanders, Seth G.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Taylor, Lowell J.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",University of Chicago; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University of Mississippi; Duke University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Black, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD065563, R21 HD069778, R24 HD065563] Funding Source: Medline; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0915733] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,28,75,101,2,30,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In this article we assess the impact of joint concessions of parking meters and underground parking facilities, firstly by considering a radial pattern around the location of the underground facility, and secondly by proposing GA which analyzes different patterns. The results corroborate that providing free parking generates excess demand and high cruising for parking. Furthermore, they support joint provision of above ground and underground parking concessions because otherwise there can be too high level of competition in a small area, which may erode potential bidders incentives -specially when local authorities expect that the concession rights be reinvested into social needs.

The most general of these approaches is Klein and Vella (J Econom 154:154-164, 2010), which models the conditional variances semiparametrically. While this is attractive, as identification is not reliant on parametric assumptions for variances, the nonparametric aspect of the estimation may discourage practitioners from its use. This paper outlines how the estimator can be implemented parametrically. The use of parametric assumptions is accompanied by a large reduction in computational and programming demands. We illustrate the approach by estimating the return to education using a sample drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Accounting for endogeneity increases the estimate of the return to education from 6.8 to 11.2%.","[Farre, Lidia] Inst Anal Econ, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Klein, Roger] Rutgers State Univ, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Vella, Francis] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC USA",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Newark; Georgetown University,"Farré, L (通讯作者)，Inst Anal Econ, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",lidia.farre@iae.csic.es; klein@economics.rutgers.edu; fgv@georgetown.eud,"Farre, Lidia/AAA-1991-2019",,,,,,30,13,16,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Rental rates reflect the value of the services provided by the property and can have a significant impact on the ability of its owners to make monthly debt obligations. We investigate commercial property rent dynamics for 34 large metropolitan areas in the U.S. The dynamics are studied from the second quarter of 1990 through the second quarter of 2009 and the results are compared across four property types or uses (office, industrial, flex, and retail). There is substantial heterogeneity in both the long and short run responses to changing demand and supply conditions. In general, the office market is the slowest to adjust back towards equilibrium while industrial and flex markets adjust back to the long run equilibrium very quickly. For industrial and office types, the speed of adjustment is substantially faster within quality segments and is strongest for grade A properties.","[Ibanez, Maria R.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pennington-Cross, Anthony] Marquette Univ, Dept Finance, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Pennington-Cross, Anthony] Marquette Univ, Ctr Real Estate, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Chicago; Marquette University; Marquette University,"Pennington-Cross, A (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Dept Finance, Straz Hall 328,POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",Maria.ibanez@chicagobooth.edu; Anthony.pennington-cross@marquette.edu,"Ibanez, Maria/K-3961-2017","Ibanez, Maria/0000-0002-0261-5397",,,,,33,21,24,1,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The agent's decisions are made by a learning classifier system, and after classifying the information of a given pair of binary lotteries, the agent chooses one of them. The condition part of a classifier consists of two types of conditions: the conditions identifying probabilities and payoffs of a given pair of binary lotteries, and the conditions identifying characteristics of the lotteries known by several models that describe the behavioral regularities of choices under risk. We compare the result of the simulation with that of the experiment by Selten et al. (Theory Decis 46:211-249, 1999), and demonstrate the similarity between them. From the similarity, we consider a mechanism of human choices under risk.

A finite set of n vertically differentiated indivisible objects are assigned to n agents who live n periods. At each period, a new agent enters society, and the oldest agent retires, leaving his object to be reassigned. We define independent assignment rules (where the assignment of an object to an agent is independent of the way other objects are allocated to other agents), efficient assignment rules (where there does not exist another assignment rule with larger expected surplus), and fair assignment rules (where agents experiencing the same circumstances have identical histories in the long run). When agents are homogenous, we characterize efficient, independent and fair rules as generalizations of the seniority rule. When agents draw their types at random, we prove that independence and efficiency are incompatible, and that efficient and fair rules only exist when there are two types of agents. We characterize two simple rules (type-rank and type-seniority) which satisfy both efficiency and fairness criteria in dichotomous settings.","[Bloch, Francis] Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France; [Cantala, David] Colegio Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Colegio de Mexico,"Bloch, F (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France.",francis.bloch@polytechnique.edu; dcantala@colmex.mx,"Bloch, Francis/IAO-6799-2023",,,,,,22,19,21,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2013,40.0,1,,,,,1.0,25,,10.1007/s00355-011-0566-x,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,070BC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313479800001,0

We compare these static and dynamic losses to the gains that would instead arise under full-employment conditions, assumed by most of the theoretical literature on offshoring.

This interpretation has been driving policy efforts to tighten the regulation of oil derivatives markets. This survey reviews the evidence supporting this view. We identify six strands in the literature and discuss to what extent each sheds light on the role of speculation. We find that the existing evidence is not supportive of an important role of speculation in driving the spot price of oil after 2003. Instead, there is strong evidence that the co-movement between spot and futures prices reflects common economic fundamentals rather than the financialization of oil futures markets.","[Fattouh, Bassam; Mahadeva, Lavan] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford OX2 6FA, England; [Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Oxford; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kilian, L (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",bassam.fattouh@oxfordenergy.org; lkilian@umich.edu; lavan.mahadeva@oxfordenergy.org,"Sabra, Hayssam/D-4644-2015","Sabra, Hayssam/0000-0001-5125-2863",,,,,65,207,221,2,46,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,34.0,3,,,SI,,7.0,33,,10.5547/01956574.34.3.2,0.0,,,27,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,173NB,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321085100002,0

In particular, we examine whether trading volume is significantly informative for investors when attempting to apprehend potential changes in volatility dynamics, and hence, in the evolution of market risk. To this end, we apply recent nonlinear modeling tools, namely Switching Transition Regression (STR) models that are robust to asymmetry and nonlinearity as well as TARCH models to check for the nature of transition between volatility regimes. Our findings show that volatility dynamics exhibit nonlinearity and switching regimes for which the transition is smooth rather than abrupt. Furthermore, one regime is associated with low volatility and a weak relationship with trading volume while in the second regime, the causality relationship is stronger and volatility is high. The paper's novelty is to show that not only does trading volume contribute to explaining market volatility, but also that the change in volatility dynamics is performed through the change in its relationship with trading volume.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, F-91025 Evry, France; [Jawadi, Fredj] France Business Sch Campus Amiens, F-91025 Evry, France; [Ureche-Rangau, Loredana] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, CRIISEA, Pole Univ Cathedrale, F-80027 Amiens 1, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV),"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91025 Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,,"JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,69,9,9,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The competitiveness of a region does no longer depend solely on individual companies, but more and more on innovative practices of entire industries and sectors. This paper aims to illustrate cluster strengths and weaknesses, their potential benefits and positive effects using a practical example of a cluster created in Vukovar-Sirmium County. Although association and networking of companies should create competitive advantage, boost productivity and innovation, and stimulate growth both at the level of businesses and at the County level, research using methods such as description and compilation has indicated that in practice there is a large gap between the expected and the reality. More attention should be paid to cluster policies at the County and regional levels so that clusters could make headway during their life cycle and stabilize their own business environment. This form of cooperation between business entities is a good example showing how to maintain stability within a certain area by connecting and cooperating with each other. Learning from the experience of foreign countries, studying best practices and connecting with education institutions, are some of the guidelines for creating a competitive and successful cluster.

In addition, experiments with shearing are also designed to simulate the real dissolving process of carbon dioxide in oil under reservoir conditions, which can be influenced by the mechanical dispersion. The results demonstrated that the molecular diffusion coefficients are 10-6m2/s for 600r/min at 105 degrees C, however the molecular diffusion coefficients are 10-7m2/s in the case without stirring at 105 degrees C, the mass transfer process is accelerated by stirring.","[Liang, Tao; Fan, Hongfu] China Univ Geosci, Sch Energy Resource, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liang, Tao; Zhang, Hongjun; Zhao, Peng] Drilling & Prod Technol Res Inst, Panjin 124010, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lina] E&D Res Inst Inst Liaohe Oilfield Co, Panjin 124010, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Beijing,"Liang, T (通讯作者)，China Univ Geosci, Sch Energy Resource, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,18.0,,,,,,141.0,147,,,,,,7,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BA4DZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335479600030,0

It is informed by three distinct discourses: travel behaviour change, the mobility biographies approach, and cohort analysis. The data used is the German Mobility Panel (GMP) 1994-2008 in which households and their members are asked three times in three subsequent years to report the trips they made over a week. The changes reported are regressed to key events over the life course, cohort effects and period effects, while various sociodemographic and spatial attributes are controlled. Due to the non-independent nature of panel observations, a cluster-robust regression approach is used. The findings suggest that behind the aggregate stability in travel mode use over time there is much change 'under the surface', induced by life course changes, individual and household sociodemographic, and spatial context. The changes found induced by life course related key events favour the notion of mobility biographies. However, taken over all key events seem to be relatively loosely associated with mode use changes. Nonetheless, various significant effects of baseline variables suggest that mode use may change even in the absence of a key event. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This is often attributed to a lack of jobs for the low-skilled, but it may as well be caused by a lack of incentives to work. Low-skilled workers are easily substitutable and therefore have little bargaining power. Hence, they are typically dependent on low-paid jobs. This may create disincentives to work, if the achievable market wage does not sufficiently exceed the welfare level. Workfare could be an efficient strategy to overcome such disincentives by introducing a work requirement for unemployed welfare recipients. In our paper we investigate the importance of such a supply side policy. We evaluate a pilot workfare project of a Berlin city community to integrate young people in social assistance into the labor market. Reference data are generated in collaboration with the German Employment Office. The participation effect is found to be positive and of relevant size, but not statistically significant. This indicates that selection biases detected in the allocation process of individuals to the program can be adjusted by econometric techniques, but only at the prize of reduced significance levels. Given the small sample sizes of pilot projects this calls for social experiments in controlled project designs.","[Schneider, Hilmar; Uhlendorff, Arne] Univ Mannheim, DIW Berlin, Forschungsinstitut Zukunft Arbeit IZA, IZA Bonn, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Uhlendorff, Arne] IAB Nurnberg, Nurnberg, Germany; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] CEPS Brussel, CEPR London, IZA Bonn, Brussels, Belgium; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] CCIS Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA USA",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Mannheim; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Schneider, H (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, DIW Berlin, Forschungsinstitut Zukunft Arbeit IZA, IZA Bonn, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",schneider@iza.org; uhlendorff@uni-mannheim.de; zimmermann@iza.org,"Uhlendorff, Arne/AAS-6187-2020",,,,,,31,0,0,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The paper aims at the analysis and presentation of means used to measure the causal effect (i.e., the changes in related variables in response to the intervention on specific set of variables) in a causal diagram. Among the significant features of the presented method ranks the ability to compute (under certain conditions) considered causal effect without necessity to employ all model variables. The impact of this methodology is important in situations with unmeasured variables involved. Additionally, this type of model provides a possibility to deal with scenarios where controlled experiments are impossible to be performed because of the costs or either ethical or legal obstacles.

However, as high-tech import dependence declines, high-end components will be manufactured independently and trade gains will rise. However, because of production networks is dominated by multinational companies, imbalance distribution of the trade interests can lead to uncertainty effects on the industrial upgrading of ASEAN countries in the process of participating in production networks. If important core parts blindly rely on imports, it may be locked in labor intensive links forever, and only by accumulating the effect of learning by doing and through independent innovation can ASEAN countries will break through the trap of poor growth.

Are these data reliable? Can we evaluate whether successive revisions of the first estimate bring additional information, or whether they are due to the correction of earlier inaccuracies of bias, which does not add any useful information to economic analysts? The response is that a statistical technique, known in economic literature as news versus noise analysis can be used to answer these questions. These concepts were first introduced in ground breaking articles by Mankiw et al. (1984) on revisions to money stock and Mankiw and Shapiro (1986) on revisions to Gross National Product in the United States. This method claims that the proximity of the first estimate to the definitive one can be a clue as to its quality. Many studies investigate the magnitude and nature of errors contained throughout the National Account System estimates; however, economic literature offers no option for judging accuracy and reliability in the main Regional Account aggregates, and therefore, this methodology is adopted to assess the accuracy and reliability of the revision process of the Gross Value Added (GVA) growth rates at basic prices, 1995 Base, within the Spanish Regional Accounts (CRE-95). For that purpose, this study examines five comprehensive revisions analyses for a range of eighteen Autonomous Communities (NUTS-2) during 1999. Main conclusions are: the quality of the estimates tends to increase over time; and the process can be explained better as reflecting new information than as correcting measurement errors so that the National Statistics Institute's procedure can be deemed to be suitable.","Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ & Business, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Cañal-Fernández, V (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ & Business, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",vcanal@uniovi.es,"Cañal-Fernández, Verónica/B-6570-2014","Cañal-Fernández, Verónica/0000-0002-3477-4595",,,,,24,0,0,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The policy and management implications of these results are discussed.","[Correia, Antonia; Pimpao, Adriano; Tao, Manuel] Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, CEFAGE, P-8000117 Faro, Portugal",Universidade do Algarve,"Correia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, CEFAGE, Campus Gambelas, P-8000117 Faro, Portugal.",acorreia@ualg.pt; apimpao@ualg.pt; mtao@ualg.pt,"Correia, Antónia/A-5353-2010; Pimpao, Adriano/AAE-4167-2021","Correia, Antónia/0000-0002-6707-8289;",,,,,27,8,9,0,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In particular, we show that the time path of the oil price, on the one hand, and the extraction rate, on the other hand, seem to follow a U-shaped and an inverted U-shaped relationship, respectively, which is confirmed by simple non-parametric estimations. Next, we present a theoretical model where a monopolistic resource owner maximizes inter-temporal profits from exploiting a non-renewable resource where the price of the resource depends on the extraction rate and on cumulated past extraction. The resource is finite and only a part of the resource is known while the rest has not yet been discovered. The analysis of that model demonstrates that the extraction rate and the price of the resource show the empirically observed pattern if the stock of the initially known resource is small.","[Greiner, Alfred] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Semmler, Willi] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Mette, Tobias] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia",University of Bielefeld; The New School; Tallinn University of Technology,"Greiner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",agreiner@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,,"Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159",,,,,17,5,6,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

It shows that in this framework the existing economic ties between countries are likely to affect adversely the interest of functional bureaucracy to support regional integration given that cutting existing connections is often more promising from the point of view of the budget expansion. Hence, the interaction of national and supranational bureaucracies is unlikely to generate impetus for increasing regional cooperation, which, surprisingly, can, however, be supported by adverse economic shocks. The results are validated using the experience of two low-level politics sectors of interaction in the post-Soviet space: electricity and transportation.","[Libman, Alexander] Frankfurt Sch Finance Management, Frankfurt, Germany; [Libman, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Moscow V71, Russia; [Vinokurov, Evgeny] Eurasian Dev Bank, Ctr Integrat Studies, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan","Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences","Libman, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance Management, Frankfurt, Germany.",,"Vinokurov, Evgeny/F-1668-2014","Vinokurov, Evgeny/0000-0002-9584-3494; Libman, Alexander/0000-0001-8504-3007",,,,,42,6,8,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It has been argued that the cooperative movement developed in areas where small and middle-sized farms were relatively important. This paper seeks to complement this explanation by analysing the role played by the pre-existing stock of social capital. The prior importance of institutions built around the use and management of collective resources is explored as an alternative proxy for social capital in pre-industrial economies. The results show that the social networks built around common lands and irrigation communities were a key element, together with relatively high levels of human capital and the existence of a wide layer of middle size farms, in facilitating the emergence of the cooperative movement in rural areas.","Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England",University of Oxford,"Tapia, FJB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",francisco.beltran@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,"Beltran Tapia, Francisco/H-4337-2015","Beltran Tapia, Francisco/0000-0002-7354-5699; Nedanov, Aleksandar/0000-0002-4238-9275",,,,,88,42,44,0,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

It attempts to examine the potential of transport policies to improve PT systems and the pedestrian road safety level by bettering traffic arrangements on the intention to shift from car to PT and walking. The study uses an integrated approach consisting of a descriptive analysis; a factor analysis to create attitudinal factors; and an intention model that is developed, based on a stated-preference survey, with attitudinal factors among the explanatory variables, in regard to the use of public transportation for commuting. The approach, set within a theoretical framework that is also developed, is applied to a case study of Arab cities in the Galilee region of northern Israel. The results support the hypothesis that perception of the risk of being involved in road crashes positively affects sustainable travel behavior, as expressed by the level of intention to use public transport: concern for and knowledge of environmental problems, in contrast, exerts no significant effect on the intention to shift to FT. The results showed that people have a higher intention to shift to public transport for work trips than for other purposes. Improving the PT system and the pedestrian road-safety level promote the intention to shift to PT, in particular for commute trips. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Traffic on two busy freeways, the I-710 and the I-110, and some heavily trafficked arterial roads was analyzed to estimate the health impacts caused by drayage truck emissions of particulate matter (PM) for four different years: 2005, which serves as a baseline for various pollution inventories, as well as 2008, 2010 and 2012. These years correspond to deadlines for the Clean Truck Program (CTP), which was put in place to improve air quality in the Alameda corridor. Results show that the health costs from particulate matter (PM) emitted by drayage trucks exceeded 440 million dollars in 2005. However, these costs decreased by 36%, 90%, and 96% after accounting for the requirements of the 2008, 2010, and 2012 CTP deadlines. These results quantify the magnitude of the social costs generated by drayage trucks in the Alameda corridor, suggest that these costs justified replacing drayage trucks operating there, and indicate that the Clean Truck Program likely exceeded its target.

It is focused in interurban services because it is a growing problem in most of major cities, yet new in the literature. The layout of interurban bus routes and the locations of transfer stations in the main city are the key factors to provide a competitive public transportation service to commuters in a metropolitan area. The number of commuters in huge urban concentrations is growing due to the difficulties of living near the city center. The objective function of the first level is defined with the aim of reducing user and agency costs. In the second level the performance of users is addressed. Furthermore, a local search method based on the Tabu Search algorithm was carried out to guide the exploration in the solution domain. The results obtained in a set of test problems have demonstrated that the restart parameters of the algorithm play a significant role in the efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, implementation in the large network of Barcelona (Spain) reduces the total cost by 5% with regard to the present situation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, investigations into the comparative experiences of men and women in KIFs remain sparse, and little is known about women's participation in the processes of innovation and knowledge exchange and combination that are core features of KIFs. The article reports on the findings of a study in the UK and Ireland involving 498 male and female knowledge workers in KIFs. Despite equal levels of qualification and experience, women are more likely to be in lower status and less secure jobs. They also predominantly occupy roles featuring less variety and autonomy than men and, despite comparable levels of knowledge exchange and combination, are less likely to be in a position to translate this into the innovative work behaviours necessary for career advancement. The findings suggest that women's experiences of and participation in knowledge processes within KIFs differ fundamentally from men's.","[Truss, Catherine] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, People Management & Org Grp, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Conway, Edel; Monks, Kathy] Dublin City Univ, Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland; [d'Amato, Alessia] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Hannon, Enda] Kingston Univ, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England; [Kelly, Grainne] Dublin City Univ, Leadership Innovat & Knowledge Res Ctr LInK, Human Resource Management & Org Psychol Grp, Dublin 9, Ireland",University of Kent; Dublin City University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Kingston University; Dublin City University,"Truss, C (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, People Management & Org Grp, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.",k.truss@kent.ac.uk,"Bailey, Catherine/JPK-5151-2023","Bailey, Catherine/0000-0002-8741-3072; Flood, Patrick/0000-0002-2465-7432; kelly, Grainne/0000-0002-8112-3015",ESRC [ES/F037031/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037031/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,92,28,31,2,57,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

David; Chadwick, Clint",,,"Performance, Expectations, and Managerial Dismissal: Evidence From the National Football League",JOURNAL OF SPORTS ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,managers; dismissal; NFL; expectations; cap,PROFESSIONAL SPORTS; TURNOVER,"Researchers in many disciplines have shown that lower overall firm performance motivates the termination of top managers. Some have also suggested that managerial dismissal stems particularly from shortfalls of performance relative to expectations, whether in relation to corporate executives or the managers of professional sports teams. But relatively few have investigated the role of expectations empirically, owing to difficulties in measuring them. In this article, we address this question theoretically by framing the interaction of performance, expectations, and the use (and potential dismissal) of managers as a labor demand problem, using applied microeconomic tools to demonstrate how variation in expectations and performance can alter how a National Football League (NFL) organization employs player and coaching talent. Empirically, we take advantage of an institutional change-the NFL's adoption of a salary cap and free agency in the early 1990s-to isolate an exogenous change in performance expectations. While the salary cap constrained the amount clubs could spend annually on player talent, it placed no constraint on expenditures for managerial (coaching) talent. This may have led clubs to allocate more resources toward coaching talent and consequently place higher expectations on head coaches, resulting in a greater probability of dismissal in the postcap period. Using data on NFL head coaches from 1979 to 2006 and probit models of turnover, we find that the probability of coach dismissal increased in the postcap era and that concrete measures of an organization's player talent, coaching talent, and on-field performance gained importance as determinants of turnover from the pre- to the postcap era, indicative of increased expectations.","[Allen, W.

The standards impose minimum limits on the percentage of casein coming from fluid milk. We develop a theoretical model to investigate the implications of Canadas compositional cheese standards while accounting for Canadas trade policy. We illustrate why a type of cheese that is not directly impacted by the standards might be the most affected. We show that the standards can decrease the domestic demand for milk or the value of imports.

We document, for the first time, evidence for asymmetric volatilities and correlations in CMBS and REITs. Due to their high levels of leverage, REIT returns exhibit stronger asymmetric volatilities. Also, both REIT and stock returns show strong evidence of asymmetries in their conditional correlation, suggesting reduced hedging potential of REITs against the stock market downturn during the sample period. There is also evidence that corporate bonds and CMBS may provide diversification benefits for stocks and REITs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that default spread and stock market volatility play a significant role in driving dynamics of these conditional correlations and that there is a significant structural break in the correlations caused by the recent financial crisis.","[Zhou, Yinggang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business Adm, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jian] Univ Colorado, Sch Business, Denver, CO 80217 USA; [Yang, Jian] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Leung, Wai Kin] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Zhou, YG (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business Adm, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Jian.Yang@ucdenver.edu; ygzhou@baf.cuhk.edu.hk; Leungwk@cuhk.edu.hk,"Zhou, Yinggang/AAE-9923-2020; Yang, Jian/J-5089-2013","Yang, Jian/0000-0002-4073-9796",,,,,37,61,63,1,63,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Subsequent attempts to amend the approach have had similarly limited impact. This article examines the restructuring of teachers' work during the last Labour government under the auspices of 'workforce remodelling', a policy intended ostensibly to reduce workload pressures on teachers. Rather than this outcome, the result was the further division of labour and increased intensity and control of teachers' work through the extension of managerial hierarchies within schools. These developments, it is argued, are best captured and explained by an analysis informed by labour process theory. The account is based on the results of two years' funded research involving extensive interviews with education officials and trade union officers at national and local authority level, and head teachers and other staff in 12 schools located in three contrasting local authorities.","[Carter, Bob] De Montfort Univ, Dept HRM, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England; [Stevenson, Howard] Lincoln Univ, Ctr Educ Res & Dev, Lincoln, England",De Montfort University; University of Lincoln,"Carter, B (通讯作者)，De Montfort Univ, Dept HRM, Hugh Aston Bldg, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.",rcarter@dmu.ac.uk,"Carter, Bob/CAA-1957-2022","Stevenson, Howard/0000-0002-5172-1807",,,,,51,35,37,1,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The findings show that several measures of United States economic activity and different proxies for the unemployment of Mexican nationals living in the United States do not appear to have a strong impact on remittance transfers. On the other hand, this study finds that United States housing variables do seem to affect remittance transfers. In particular, there is a special prominence of the impact shown by the number of housing starts in the United States. Overall, the results seem to suggest that there is not a single United States economic factor that is responsible for the decrease of remittances to Mexico but rather a combination of factors.

We estimate separate models of medal production for men and women over the last four Summer Olympic Games. The production of medals is a function of capital, labor, and total factor productivity (TFP). We use real GDP per capita and population - two variables that appear in almost all Olympic studies - as proxies for capital and labor. Our measure of TFP is a vector of variables that captures a nation's willingness and ability to marshal its resources to promote Olympic performance and variables that determine its willingness to support its women. Because the dependent variable is a count measure, we estimate the production function using a negative binomial framework. We find that the determinants of success by a nation's women closely resemble the determinants for its men. We also show that some determinants of gold medal counts differ from the determinants of silver and bronze medals. Our findings suggest that nations can improve the medal performance of men and women by following policies that increase the political and economic participation of women.","[Leeds, Eva Marikova] Moravian Coll, Dept Econ & Business, Bethlehem, PA 18018 USA; [Leeds, Michael A.] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Leeds, EM (通讯作者)，Moravian Coll, Dept Econ & Business, Bethlehem, PA 18018 USA.",marik@moravian.edu; mleeds@temple.edu,"Leeds, Michael/S-6715-2019",,,,,,17,20,20,1,30,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Evidence from an Asymmetric Gravity Model,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; EQUATION,"Anderson and vanWincoop developed what has become the standard framework for framing and interpreting empirical work using the gravity model. Their framework relies heavily on an assumption of symmetry among countries. For issues related to North-South trade, this assumption is problematic. In this paper, we develop an asymmetric extension of the AndersonvanWincoop framework appropriate to the analysis of North-South trade, where Northern countries produce differentiated goods and Southern countries homogenous ones. In addition, we use an appropriately extended version of Baier and Bergtrand and Taylor linear expansion thus permitting its estimation using (good old) OLS. The result is an empirical model that (i) is better suited to the analysis of North-South trade, (ii) is easy to estimate and compute comparative statics, not requiring a customised NLS routine and, given the way the South is included, (iii) provides a simple explanation of zero trade flows between some country pairs, a fact still not fully explained in the literature.

Service unions initially adopted innovative strategies to organize these workplaces, in response to threats and opportunities presented by the rapid growth of a new 'sector'. However, the new conglomerate service union, ver.di, has been unable to sustain these alternative strategies due to both institutional and organizational factors. The increasingly fragmented character of the German industrial relations system provides growing exit options for employers, while the union is disadvantaged by declining membership, resource scarcity and an organizational structure reflecting past industry (and union) boundaries. Ver.di thus finds itself in an institutionally enhanced innovation dilemma. Sustaining innovations necessary to organize new workplaces would require organizational slack and redundant resources.

Its ambitious policy agenda promotes interference which does not block free choice when agents fall short of fully informed and rational choice. Their implicit version of the informed desire view of welfare either provides no, or potentially erroneous, guidance to planners. LP thus faces significant implementation problems. To address these LP might adopt a weaker version of the information requirement on desires or an alternative view of welfare. Nonetheless, informational and bounded rationality considerations suggest that LP should be rethought and its level of ambition reduced.","Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Qizilbash, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",mozaffar.qizilbash@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,21,22,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2012,38.0,4,,,,,647.0,658,,10.1007/s00355-011-0620-8,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,918PI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302262200007,0

This index does not, in general, satisfy two standard index-number tests. The reversal test requires the index value for the reverse change to be the reciprocal of the original index. And the circular test requires the product of index values for successive price changes to be equal to the index value for the whole change. We show that both tests are satisfied if and only if the Bergson-Samuelson indirect social-welfare function is homothetic in prices, a condition which does not require individual preferences to be homothetic. If individual preferences are homothetic, however, stronger conditions on the Bergson-Samuelson indirect must be satisfied. Given these results, we ask whether the restrictions are empirically reasonable and find, in the case that individual preferences are not homothetic, that they make little difference to estimates of the index.","[Donaldson, David] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6R 3B2, Canada; [Pendakur, Krishna] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of British Columbia; Simon Fraser University,"Donaldson, D (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, 4408 W 15th Ave, Vancouver, BC V6R 3B2, Canada.",dvdd@telus.net; pendakur@sfu.ca,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2012,38.0,3,,,,,407.0,429,,10.1007/s00355-011-0536-3,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,902NG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301044600002,0

Yet, there is little conceptual work or empirical evidence on pharmaceutical pricing strategies or on the time paths of these prices. This study provides a conceptual framework describing the interplay between quality and product differentiation in determining the preferred pricing strategy. We hypothesize that higher quality products will engage in price skimming strategies in markets where products are sufficiently differentiated, but will choose a market penetration strategy in markets that are less differentiated. We apply an empirical analysis to brand name antidepressants during the years 1999-2002, a market where differences in quality are modest. A nationally representative data set on drug utilization and expenditures is combined with a physician survey on the quality attributes of drugs to examine the effect of drug quality on pharmaceutical pricing strategies. Results indicate that higher quality antidepressants engage in a market penetration strategy, charging initially lower prices that rise over time. At approximately 6-7 years post-entry, prices of the antidepressant drugs examined converge. Prices of higher quality antidepressants continue to increase thereafter, eventually becoming the highest priced drugs in the therapeutic class. These findings are consistent with a market in which product differentiation is modest and consumers learn which drug works best for them through experience.","[Chen, Jie] CUNY, Dept Polit Sci Econ & Philosophy, Coll Staten Isl, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Prevent Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; College of Staten Island (CUNY); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Chen, J (通讯作者)，CUNY, Dept Polit Sci Econ & Philosophy, Coll Staten Isl, 2800 Victory Blvd,Room 2N-229, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA.",jie.chen@csi.cuny.edu; John.Rizzo@stonybrook.edu,"Chen, Jie/G-8894-2012",,,,,,57,5,6,0,20,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The primary aim is to assess his merit in the re-establishing the institutions of the Catolich Church in the Eastern Slavonia, and his role in the renewal of the Diocese of Bosnia or Dakovo, the diocesian estate and the organisation of the religious life in the first decades after the liberation from Ottoman power. The paper relies on the analysis of published and unpublished historical documents and previous historiographical results. Juraj Patacic de Zajezda was the bishop of Bosnia or Dakovo from 1703 till 1716. He was the son of count Nikola Patacic and countess Marta Orsic and therefore a member of one of the most prominent Croatian noble families. According to literature, he was born in 1670 in Vidovec near Varatdin, while some historical documents recorded that he was born in the family estate Novi Marof. At the age of sexteen, he joined the Jesuit order in Zagreb where he studied humaniora and Greek philosophy and began to study theology. He left the Jesuit order because of poor health and continued the studies in the Hungarian Illirian course in Bologna where he received his doctoral degree. At a time when he took the office of bishop of Bosnia or Dakovo he was thirty-three years old. Besides the bishops, he held a number of other religious and secular services: he was an archdeacon in Varatdin, a canon in Zagreb and a provost in Potega; a rector of the Hungarian Illirian course in Bologna, the imperial advisor and the participant in the national parliament in Pressburg in 1708 and 1714. Juraj Patacic was the first bishop of Bosnia or Dakovo who continuously resided in his diocese after Slavonia was freed from Ottoman power in the late 17th century. The conditions in the diocese were difficult: the incomes of churches and clergy were low, the diocesian estete was devasteted and, in general, the religious circumstances were not good. Bishop Patacic resolutely approached the material and spiritual renewal of his diocese, and was very active and busy with the various episcopal functions, not only in his own diocese but also in the surrounding dioceses in which their bishops have not resided. Among the other things, on the ruins of the old cathedral in Dakovo he build a new one in 1706. He also renovated and adapted former Ibrahim Pasha Mosque which he consecrated into the parish church of St. George. In 1706 he built a wooden bishop's residence whereas the construction and equipping of the Franciscan monastery in Dakovo lasted from 1711 to 1714. Patacic also granted the benefits and properties to the Franciscan monastery and the parish priests in Dakovo, defined the incomes from the stola, preached, consecrated churches, confirmed, inaugurated the priests in the holy orders not only in his own but also in the surrounding dioceses. He died in March in 1716 at the age of forty-six. According to his own desire, he was buried in the Franciscan church in Dakovo.","[Bogovic, Dubravka Bozic] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Philosophy, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,,dbozic@ffos.hr,"Božić Bogović, Dubravka/JMR-0151-2023","Božić Bogović, Dubravka/0000-0001-6979-3908",,,,,9,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,338.0,346,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600038,0

The following article contributes to the economic analysis of identifying the differences of these separate types of unbundling by concentrating on competition effects and the possibility to conceal true marginal costs. Via simulation, we find that legal unbundling yields the lowest prices in a market under Cournot competition.

Therefore, geotourism emerges to meet the new demand for nature based tourism. It is a new form of sustainable tourism which aims to educate people the aesthetic, cultural, recreational and aesthetic value of geological heritage resources and plays as a solution for the apparent conflict between economic growth and environmental quality. With proper enforcement emplaced, this idea of protection through usage should lead to an increase in geological, environmental and socio-cultural awareness among geotourists and local guardians of geological heritage. On the other hand, the growing economic significance of nature tourism might trigger temptation to ignore any possible negative environmental and socio-cultural impacts (e.g. visitor over capacity, unaware and consumptive tourists, inadequate knowledge and enforcement during the construction of tourism infrastructures and amenities etc) consequently resulting in the same harmful effects as that of mass tourism which may put geoheritage resources under a serious threat and there rises the possibility of net loss of geotourism due to greater costs to compared to the benefits. The economic concept of value refers to any net change in the welfare of society. Hence, the measurement of the relative costs (direct, indirect and intangible) and benefits (economic, social, environmental and landscape) of geotourism is important in order to understand the impact of geotourism on the community as a whole, to protect community wellbeing, and to ensure the long term viability of the natural area tourism product. Thus this paper addresses the needs for geotourism valuation to ensure the sustainable development of geoheritage resources and provides a conceptual framework to measure the costs and benefits of geotourism which is vital to the success of a tourism development strategy based on the equitable distribution of benefits between all actors.","[Ehsan, Sofia] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Environm & Dev Lestari, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Leman, Mohd Shafeea] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Inst Environm & Dev Lestari, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, 43600Y Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [Begum, Rawshan Ara; Komoo, Ibrahim] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Environm & Dev Lestari, Southeast Asia Disaster Prevent Inst Seadpri, 43600 Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Ehsan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Environm & Dev Lestari, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",sofia.mmu@gmail.com; shafeea@ukm.my; rawshan@ukm.my; ibrahimkomoo@yahoo.com,"Komoo, Ibrahim/AAN-4785-2020; Ehsan, Sofia/ISS-2197-2023; Begum, Rawshan/C-9837-2012","Begum, Rawshan/0000-0003-2478-8317","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) [GUP 2011-272, K003281]",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM),"This research was financially supported by the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) (Grant No. GUP 2011-272, K003281).",,9,1,1,0,21,HONG KONG EDUCATION SOC,TSEUNG KWAN O,"FLAT 16E BLOCK 3 THE PINNACLE, 8 WANG HANG RD, TSEUNG KWAN O, NEW TERRITORIES 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-988-19750-3-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,466.0,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BET96,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318122400083,0

Nevertheless, owing to a lack of unified classification standards and effective selection strategies, it is in the predicament to select an appropriate IUR model. To solve these problems, this paper firstly points out that the IUR model, from an economic perspective, is in nature a model of innovation resource allocation. And then, it analyzes the innovation resources of IUR and superior resources of each innovative partner.

Sustainable development is assumed to be economically viable, socially acceptable and an environmentally sound process. This paper focuses to gauge the relationship between sustainable economic development and poverty in the Asian transitional economies. The methodology of the study is designed to answer two questions. Firstly, how has the global food prices affected the level of poverty in the selected transitional economies of Asia namely: Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Thailand? Secondly, how could increasing poverty in the region be an obstacle to SED? The poor are very sensitive to food prices because they spend approximately 60 percent of the total budget on food items; therefore, any change in food prices will significantly affect their livelihood. The study uses various reports of the developlopment aid agencies to investigate the socioeconomic profile of the poor in the Asian region. Based on these reports, the study reveals that 44 million people in the developing countries have been pushed into extreme poverty due to higher food prices and a further 10 percent rise in domestic food prices in developing Asia (3.3 billion people) could push an additional 64.4 million into poverty, based on the $1.25-a-day poverty line. Furthermore, the impact of higher food prices more adversely affected rural India followed by Bangladesh and Pakistan respectively, while Bhutan and Thailand are the least affected economies of the region. The findings of the study suggest that poverty adversely affects all the pillars of sustainable development, because it restricts access to the basic facilities, resulting in the social and environmental issues. Finally, the paper concludes that the objective of sustainable economic development cannot be achieved without caring for the poor and the marginalized population of the transitional Asian economies.","[Khan, Zahoor; Sulaiman, Jamalludin] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Georgetown, Pulau Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,,"Khan, Zahoor/R-5965-2019","Khan, Zahoor/0000-0002-7101-2979",,,,,11,0,0,1,10,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,771.0,780,,,,,,10,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600068,0

When designing a tariff system, there are several approaches of designing the tariff. One of them is dividing the region into the tariff zones. The price of traveling in such system is determined by the number of traveled tariff zones by the passenger. In this article we analyze the problem, introduce a mathematical model of the tariff zones design problem based on counting zones and introduce two approaches for determining the quality of solution. We will focus on solving this problem using a universal optimization tool Xpress, on test data set of the selected region.

Having no data on second hand market or rental prices, the geometric profile is derived from average service lives. As an alternative, the geometric depreciation profile is applied on the data on most important types of assets for non-market producers sector. As a consequence, the impact on gross domestic product of such change is evaluated. Also the gradual change of service lives was tested on assets with long service lives.

As a result, the paper finds that most English learners in China are unconsciously misusing Sinclair's open-choice principle in translation, because they lack of prefabricated chunks so that they don't know how to correctly put different collocations together.

It argues that the pattern of presidential discourse reveals that both presidents have regarded Russia's nuclear weapons as primarily political rather than military instruments. Both Putin and Medvedev demonstrated a sustained desire to pursue strategic nuclear arms reductions through negotiations, particularly on a bilateral basis with the United States, and an interest in minimum nuclear deterrence. The shifts in position taken by both presidents on US plans for missile defence in particular reveal that they each attached as much, if not more, importance to Russia being regarded as an equal partner by the United States than to any strategic gains that might be achieved through preventing the deployment of an effective missile defence system.","Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Int Polit, Aberystwyth SY23 3DA, Dyfed, Wales",Aberystwyth University,"Mathers, JG (通讯作者)，Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Int Polit, Aberystwyth SY23 3DA, Dyfed, Wales.",zzk@aber.ac.uk,,,,,,,74,3,3,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,3,,,SI,,495.0,519,,10.1080/09668136.2012.661930,0.0,,,25,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,943ZT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304167900006,0

In addition, there are many years of experience in the production, the old tradition, a sufficient number of highly trained personnel and quality of research institutes in that area. Production of agricultural products is relatively well developed in relation to the other regions in Croatia. However, production of certain agricultural products is not sufficiently developed and represented in relation to the natural capacities (fruits, vegetables industrial crops and cattle products). In the Eastern Croatia, there are certain capacities for processing of agricultural products. That processing involves mostly so-called basic food industry, namely, production of sugar, flour, meat, milk and to some extent edible oil. In the past several decades, the development of agricultural product processing was not sufficiently monitored the possibilities of the agricultural production. Because of that, the basic food industry was not enough developed and less than above mentioned was developed the food industry with higher level of product finalization. Croatia, but especially the Eastern Croatia is lagging in the production of foods preserved by low temperatures, cooling and freezing. In this paper, the production, import, export and consumption of food in Croatia from 1997 to 2010 years were analyzed. The priority programs of processing of agricultural products and other conditions necessary to initiate the development of these processing, were defined too. Guidelines of structural sowing changes in agricultural production were given and identified the other problems important for development of agricultural processing.","[Pozderovic, Andrija; Pichler, Anita; Paragovic, Kristina] Fac Food & Technol, Osijek 31000, Croatia",,,andrija.pozderovic@ptfos.hr; anita.pichler@ptfos.hr; kristina.paragovic@ptfos.hr,"Pichler, Anita/GLN-2604-2022",,,,,,7,0,0,1,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,118.0,127,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600013,0

This approach decomposes the timetabling problem into three parts, where each stage is optimally solved and the outputs are used as inputs in the next stage. At first teachers are assigned to courses, then courses are assigned to time slots, and finally time slots are assigned to classrooms. This approach enables solving the timetabling problem in a reasonable time.

Yet despite the widespread use of the concept of regulatory capture, its precise mechanisms are not well understood. This paper empirically investigates this hypothesis by examining one important institution of global financial governance that has been subjected to intense private sector lobbying at the transnational level: the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Using extensive archival material as well as interviews with participants in the generation of the Basel II Capital Accord, I argue that while private sector lobbyists had unprecedented access to the regulatory policymaking process, this access did not always translate into influence. Furthermore, when influence was present, it sometimes had the effect of increasing regulatory stringency, rather than weakening regulation. As such, I argue that our understanding of the process of transnational policy formation would benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the contingency of private sector 'influence' over the regulatory process, rather than the extensive, all-or-nothing depiction of regulatory 'capture' that currently prevails within the IPE literature.","Princeton Univ, Niehaus Ctr Globalizat & Governance, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Young, KL (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Niehaus Ctr Globalizat & Governance, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,"Yoon, DongJoon/E-9146-2014",,,,,,79,114,128,1,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Offshore ferry services help satisfy the transport needs of underprivileged communities on offshore islands by providing below-cost transportation to locationally disadvantaged groups or regions. Particularly low volume routes frequently operate at a loss because they are socially necessary but not commercially viable. Thus, the government offers financial support for offshore ferry routes as operating losses and investment needs increase. Because budgetary resources for low volume ferry routes are limited, this study offers a method to help governments set targets for individual low volume ferry routes with regard to future performance. Furthermore, this study helps determine which targets should be linked to government resources allocated to individual low volume offshore ferry firms. Following this criterion, the study discusses public transportation subsidy policies and evaluates whether the current ferry subsidies policy is adequate in Taiwan. Allocation-based data envelopment analysis (ABDEA) proposed by Beasley [2] and modified by Amirteimoori and Kordrostami [1] are then used to allocate the limited subsidy budget to low volume ferry routes, while output targets are determined for each low volume offshore ferry firm.

The paper presents a simulation model developed by authors that incorporates major elements of the market, including customers, suppliers, storage, etc. The proposed simulation has an important advantage over a traditional approach, as it allows to predict the market behaviour on the basis of the model parameters which are identifiable and measurable a priori, i.e. infrastructure parameters and market participants behavioural parameters. that are acquirable with the use of existing sociological tools and models. The simulation model assumes the independence of action of every entity (agent) with certain regulatory and physical constrains, such as the supply routes capacity, environmental conditions, enforced minimal reserves, the individual customer priority over commercial entities, etc. The primary benefit of the model and the simulation environment is the possibility of observing the market under various hypothetical scenarios.","[Zachara, Marek] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Comp Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Palka, Dariusz] Pedag Univ Cracow, Dept Comp Sci, Krakow, Poland",AGH University of Krakow; Pedagogical University of Cracow,"Zachara, M (通讯作者)，AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Comp Sci, Krakow, Poland.",mzachara@agh.edu.pl; dpalka@ap.krakow.pl; ewa@zachara.name,"Zachara, Marek/E-5076-2012","Zachara, Marek/0000-0002-8560-9696",,,,,12,2,2,0,5,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,1004.0,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900172,0

Therefore, the improvement of their technical performance would allow mitigating these risks. A DEA model was applied to analyze the technical efficiency of a sample of growers in the region of Bizerte. The results reveal a resource use inefficiency of 19% on average under VRS assumption and of 31% under CRS assumption. Hence, there is considerable scope for progress. In order to explain the variability of the technical efficiency scores, the estimation of the Tobit model, shows that the growers' age, the land tenure, the water source and the irrigation system are some determinants which have to be taken into account when providing guidance for policy measures aimed at improving the farms' technical performance.","[Chemak, Fraj] Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie INRAT, Tunis, Tunisia; [Allagui, Leila] Ecole Super Agr Mograne ESAM Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia; [Ali, Yassine] Grp Interprofess Legumes GIL Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia",,"Chemak, F (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie INRAT, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,9,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2014,13.0,4,,,,,72.0,80,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CD5HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351118700009,0

Our analysis demonstrates that the most important factor explaining current differences in stature among nations of European origin is the level of nutrition, especially the ratio between the intake of high-quality proteins from milk products, pork meat and fish, and low-quality proteins from wheat. Possible genetic factors such as the distribution of Y haplogroup I-M170, combined frequencies of Y haplogroups I-M170 and R1b-U106, or the phenotypic distribution of lactose tolerance emerge as comparably important, but the available data are more limited. Moderately significant positive correlations were also found with GDP per capita, health expenditure and partly with the level of urbanization that influences male stature in Western Europe. In contrast, male height correlated inversely with children's mortality and social inequality (Gini index). These results could inspire social and nutritional guidelines that would lead to the optimization of physical growth in children and maximization of the genetic potential, both at the individual and national level.

According to this theory, the level of the long-term interest rate is determined by expectations of future short-term rates. Keynes' thinking contained several notions - such as the preferred habitat of lenders, the theory of forward markets, and risk premiums - which Hicks used to give a more complete theory of the term structure of interest rates. Besides implementing these notions in his own theory, Hicks introduced the concepts of the preferred habitat of borrowers, the liquidity risk premium, and arbitrageurs who can take advantage of spreads between spot and forward rates and eliminate risk premiums.","Univ Paris 01, PHARE, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Brillant, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, PHARE, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",lucy.brillant@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,16,6,7,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

A two-stage least squares estimation method is used to avoid selection bias problems. Panel data covering 116 countries between 1984 and 2007 and two other subsets of this panel data are used. The results indicate an improvement in access to international financial markets when an IMF programme is announced. The improvement increases as the sample consists of better-performing countries.

The analysis focuses on programs designed to privatize public housing in Israel. The government programs provided the tenants with a call (real) option to purchase their rental unit at a discounted exercise price. We employ a large panel of transactions over the 1999-2008 period to evaluate whether the tenants used prior program price reductions as anchors in their purchase decisions. The results of hazard model estimation provide strong evidence of anchoring in the timing of home purchase. Further, model simulation suggests that by accounting for the anchoring heuristic, program managers could have both accelerated purchases and significantly increased government revenues associated with privatization. We also find evidence that anchoring varies with individual and market characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We use information on annual mean concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and ozone measured at monitoring station level to build province-level indicators of pollution. Hence, we estimate a regression model for hospital admissions, where we allow our aggregate measures of pollution to be subject to measurement error and correlated with the error term. We also adopt standard errors for estimates that are robust to serial and spatial correlation in the error term, to allow for temporal persistence and geographical concentration of unobservable risk factors. We find that higher levels of particulate matter are associated with higher levels of hospitalisation for children, while ozone plays an important role in explaining hospital admissions of the elderly. Other factors that appear to have an effect on hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are precipitation and provincial unemployment rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This article argues that the picture is more nuanced than suggested by the conventional wisdom: legitimacy-seeking and interinstitutional bargaining arguments, which have been applied effectively to account for the expansion of the EP's power in the past, highlight the conditions under which the EP's struggle for more institutional power is either met with success (as in the case of the single supervisory mechanism) or faces virtually insurmountable obstacles (as in the case of the Troika and the European Stability Mechanism).","Univ Munich, D-80538 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Rittberger, B (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",berthold.rittberger@gsi.lmu.de,,"Rittberger, Berthold/0000-0002-8806-6455",,,,,20,67,68,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Increasing numbers of women have entered the judiciary and their job satisfaction is a key route to understanding their experiences of this elite role. This paper applies concepts of job satisfaction to the judiciary and investigates gender differences. Data from two national surveys demonstrate that women and men across the Australian judiciary express very high levels of overall job satisfaction, though areas of dissatisfaction exist, in particular regarding work-life balance. Gender differences do not appear to be direct, but mediated by other characteristics which are gender-related. Broadly, these findings demonstrate that a full understanding of job satisfaction now requires attention to family/domestic demands and commitments and the workplace context, as well as to the intrinsic nature of the work and the extrinsic characteristics of the job.","[Anleu, Sharyn Roach; Mack, Kathy] Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Anleu, SR (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Social & Policy Studies, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",judicial.research@flinders.edu.au,,"Roach Anleu, Sharyn/0000-0002-7892-0099; Mack, Kathy/0009-0003-9486-8985","University-Industry Research Collaborative Grant; Flinders University; Association of Australian Magistrates (AAM); Australasian Institute of Judicial Administration (AIJA); Australian Research Council (ARC) [LP210306]; ARC [DP 0665198, DP1096888]; Australian Research Council [DP1096888] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",University-Industry Research Collaborative Grant; Flinders University; Association of Australian Magistrates (AAM); Australasian Institute of Judicial Administration (AIJA); Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); ARC(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This research was initially funded by a University-Industry Research Collaborative Grant in 2001 with Flinders University and the Association of Australian Magistrates (AAM) as the partners and also received financial support from the Australasian Institute of Judicial Administration (AIJA).

This article determines the marginal value of a fraction of demand (or a consumer) switching to RTP, conditional on smart meters installation. First, it establishes sufficient conditions for the marginal value of RTP to be decreasing as the fraction of customers on RTP increases. Second, it derives this marginal value for a simple yet realistic specification of demand. Finally, using data from the French power market, it estimates that, for the vast majority of residential customers whose peak demand is lower than 6 kVA, the net surplus from switching to RTP is lower than 1 (sic)/year for low demand elasticity, 4 (sic)/year for high demand elasticity. This finding casts a doubt on the economic value of rolling out smart meters to all residential customers, for both policy makers and power suppliers.","Toulouse Sch Econ, IAB, IDEI, CRM, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Léautier, TO (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, IAB, IDEI, CRM, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",thomas.leautier@iae-toulouse.fr,,,Electricite de France,Electricite de France,"I am grateful for insightful comments to Claude Crampes, Schmuel Oren, Richard Green, two anonymous referees, seminar participants at the Toulouse School of Economics and the Paris School of Economics, and participants to the 2011 Conference on Energy Markets in Toulouse, and to the 2012 Cambridge Electricity Policy Research Group Spring Seminar.

This paper aims to make a contribution to this growing literature by investigating individuals' engagements in joint activities and activity companion choices. Using activity-travel diary data collected in Hong Kong in 2010, this study examines the impact of social network attributes on the decisions between solo and joint activities, and for joint activities, the choices of companions. Chi-square difference tests are used to assess the importance of social network variables in explaining joint activity behavior. We find that the inclusion of social network attributes significantly improves the goodness-of-fit of the model with only socioeconomic variables. Specifically, individuals receiving emotional support and social companionship from family members/relatives are found to more likely undertake joint activities with their family members/relatives; the size of personal social networks is found to be a significant determinant of companion choices for joint activities; and activity companions are found to be significant determinants of travel companions. The findings of this study improve the understanding about activity-travel, especially joint activity-travel decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A ruler governing a large country faces severe agency problems. Given his monitoring difficulties, his agents have strong incentives to extort the taxpayers. This forces him to keep taxes low to prevent revolts. Economic expansion could aggravate corruption and cause further fiscal weakening. To support the model's predictions, I show that the Chinese state taxed and administered sparingly, especially in regions far from Beijing. Furthermore, its fiscal capacity contracted steadily during the prosperous eighteenth century, sowing the seeds for the nineteenth-century crises. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Even without observing fundamentals of WTI oil futures we can assess whether preferences lean towards a symmetric or asymmetric loss function. Our empirical evidence is robust across information sets and shows that overall loss preferences of WTI 1-month oil futures are rather optimistic and thus the underlying loss function is asymmetric. This implies that if one disregards this asymmetry the WTI oil futures should not be viewed as rational. We further provide statistical tests that allow deviations from a symmetric loss function. As part of a sensitivity analysis, and given the long span of our sample, we perform a novel analysis for detecting breakdowns in our series over time. Based on this analysis we re-examine the shape parameters of the loss function for WTI oil month futures for sub-periods. Interestingly, preferences of WTI 1-month oil futures have shifted towards optimism post 2008 period, marking the collapse of Lehman Brothers.","Univ Sussex, Business Management & Econ Sch, Falmer BN1 9SL, England",University of Sussex,"Mamatzakis, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Business Management & Econ Sch, Jubilee Bldg, Falmer BN1 9SL, England.",e.mamatzakis@sussex.ac.uk,"MAMATZAKIS, E/JFA-7402-2023; MAMATZAKIS, E/ABE-3804-2021","MAMATZAKIS, E/0000-0002-2623-0029;",,,,,32,1,1,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

To alleviate such problems, one solution is to promote households to purchase small-displacement (engine) cars (SDCs). Based on the theory of planned behavior, we develop a theoretical framework to examine how influencing factors such as environmental attitude, subjective norm, self-image and environmental knowledge motivate SDC purchasing behavior through SDC purchasing intention in China. We further extend the research framework to examine whether the factor of economic incentives moderates the relationships between SDC purchasing intention and behaviors. Using an empirical study with 232 usable questionnaire responses, we observe that SDC purchasing intention partly mediates the relationship between three of four influencing factors (environmental attitude, self-image, environmental knowledge) and SDC purchasing behavior. Statistical results also show that the factor of economic incentives moderates the relationship between SDC purchasing intention and behavior. Our results indicate that three of four influencing factors can yield SDC purchasing behavior, especially when SDC purchasing intention exists. Economic incentives such as financial support from the government could promote SDC purchasing intention to transform into purchasing behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First, because more legal imports are associated with a bigger number of transporters and therefore with a bigger supply of potential drug smugglers. Second, because, as the number of legal shipments grows, the individual inspection probability decreases, lowering the risk born by the smugglers and thus their compensation. The cocaine market provides evidence of a complementarity between legal and illegal trade.","[Russo, Francesco Flaviano] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, Naples, Italy; [Russo, Francesco Flaviano] CSEF, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Russo, FF (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, Naples, Italy.",,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2014,37.0,9,,,,,1290.0,1314,,10.1111/twec.12107,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AQ4FJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342748400006,0

In this paper the authors discuss the fact that, owing to tourists' seasonal preferences, papers based on HBS that do not use spending information covering the whole year for each household are seasonally biased. The authors show that this bias occurs as a result of either the design of the HBS or inadequate treatment of the data by researchers. When the bias occurs, tourism expenditure estimates are misleading. Analysing the issue in detail, the authors argue that it underestimates the participation rate and exerts a downward bias on income elasticity values. These hypotheses are tested empirically with Spanish microdata, showing that the seasonal bias severely affects the results obtained. In this regard, previous literature on tourism expenditure affected by this seasonal bias should be revisited.","[Alegre, Joaquin; Pou, Llorenc] Univ Illes Balears, Appl Econ Dept Edifici Jovellanos, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Pou, L (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Appl Econ Dept Edifici Jovellanos, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",joaquin.alegre@uib.es; llorens.pou@uib.es,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,10,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The data supports the distinction of risk behavior into these three categories of prospects, Further, probability weighting and diminishing sensitivity of utility as predicted by PT are observed.

It critically assesses the extent to which tourism and tourism-associated activities conform to their low-wage stereotype and finds this to be true in general, but not universally. It then considers the possibility that wages in US tourism and tourism-associated industries can be explained by observable characteristics of these industries. Recent research suggests that the use of wage data at the level of highly detailed occupations is an effective alternative to other ways of capturing underlying skill differences. Accordingly, data from the US Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) were used to provide this detail. The results strongly support the importance of difference in wages between occupations in understanding differences between industries. They also support the importance of a number of industry characteristics, including profitability, multi-factor productivity and demand growth. The paper also considers the relevance of an industry wage premium or discount for tourism and tourism-associated activities in the USA over the same period. It estimates an industry wage model separately for five individual occupations across all industries that employ for the occupation concerned. The analysis shows that workers in the two more highly paid occupations exhibit evidence of a tourism and tourism-associated discount but that workers in the three more lowly paid occupations exhibit a tourism and tourismassociated wage premium.","Bournemouth Univ, Sch Business, Poole BH8 8BS, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"Webster, A (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Sch Business, Holdenhurst Rd, Poole BH8 8BS, Dorset, England.",awebster@bournemouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,6,6,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This article explores how changes in regulations and immigration policies have affected gross immigration to Norway. As in previous econometric studies, it finds that income differences and income distribution have a bearing on immigration, as well as aspects of the labour market. Various immigration policies have largely had the expected effects, and Norway's membership of the European economic area since 1994 and inclusion in the Schengen area in 2001 have resulted in higher immigration. The enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007 substantially increased immigration to Norway. By 2010, the EU-related changes in regulations increased total immigration by some 20 per cent compared to a counterfactual situation where Norway did not become party to either of these agreements.

The lead/lag approach provides a richer picture of the economic dynamics generating the data and allows one to investigate which variables lead or lag others, and whether the lead or lag pattern is short term or long term in nature. This technique is applied to monthly sectoral level employment data for the USA and shows that among the ten industrial sectors followed by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, six tend to lead the other four. These six have high correlations indicating that the structural shocks generating the data movements are mostly in common. Among the four lagging industries, some lag by longer intervals than others and some have low correlations with the leading industries. These low correlations may indicate that these industries are partially influenced by structural shocks beyond those generating the six leading industries, but they also may indicate that lagging sectors feature a different transmission mechanism of shocks.","[Cassou, Steven P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Vazquez, Jesus] Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Facultad Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Depto Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Bilbao 48015, Spain",Kansas State University; University of Basque Country,"Vázquez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Facultad Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Depto Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Av Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",scassou@ksu.edu; jesus.vazquez@ehu.es,"Vazquez, Jesus/D-3067-2019","Vazquez, Jesus/0000-0003-4788-4838",,,,,25,2,2,1,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Our study builds on representative household survey data, providing information on various socio-demographics, household electricity consumption, and ownership of photovoltaic facilities.

A Thurnstone scale was constructed to measure the likelihood that farmers will cooperate and a composite index was designed and applied to measure the farmers'stock of social capital. Results show that social capital, human capital, leadership and the problems farmers face in terms of input supply are important determinants of collective action. The results are of both theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, this study suggests that social capital, human capital, leadership and economic environment characteristics are important determinants of collective action in post-communist transition country agriculture. Practically, the results can provide support to government agencies concerning three issues: (i) better targeting the potential farmers' groups, (ii) improving preconditions for collective action through an increase in the stock of social capital to assist the farmers in their first collective action experience, and (iii) designing and implementing capacity-building and leadership programmes.","[Kola, Rezear; Skreli, Engjell; Osmani, Myslym] Agr Univ Tirana, Fac Econ & Agribusiness, Tirana, Albania; [Tanku, Anla] Minist Finance Albania, Tirana, Albania",,"Kola, R (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Tirana, Fac Econ & Agribusiness, Tirana, Albania.",,"Skreli, Engjell/AAL-9197-2020",,,,,,30,10,10,0,13,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2014,13.0,2,,,,,20.0,27,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AM7XC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340081000003,0

S. states had adopted some form of research and development tax credits. The forces driving the rapid rise and spread of this policy remain unclear. This event history analysis finds adoption to be associated with higher state unemployment levels, supporting the notion of policy-making from disadvantage. Yet higher patenting activity is also associated with adoption, suggesting that having a strong preexisting research and development (R&D) infrastructure facilitates adoption. In the 1980s, having a Republican governor apparently propelled adoption, but partisan influences disappeared in later years. Having a governorship with constitutionally strong budgetary power and having a centralized governing board for higher education are associated with adoption, and interaction analyses indicate that the combination of a centralized board and a higher number of research universities are especially positive forces in adoption. The socioeconomic, political, and structural influences found in this article suggest several potentially fruitful directions for future analyses.","[Hearn, James C.; Warshaw, Jarrett B.] Univ Georgia, Inst Higher Educ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Lacy, T.

If we consider that energy demand is related to travel demand, the changes in fuel prices may have asymmetric effects on highway travel demand via fuel price uncertainty. In other words, when in general fuel price is steadily rising, the highway traffic volume decreases by a small percentage. On the other hand, the highway traffic volume increases by a large percentage when fuel prices are falling. We hypothesize that the uncertainty in fuel prices generates this kind of asymmetric effect on highway traffic volume in Korea. We use the Korean monthly fuel price and highway traffic volume data from 2001 to 2009, and define the intra-month (weekly) fuel price changes as monthly fuel price volatility which is a proxy for monthly fuel price uncertainty. We found that the direction of the change in fuel prices had asymmetric effects on highway travel demand and that the fuel price uncertainty led drivers to respond asymmetrically to the changes in fuel prices.

For this, we use a discrete-time stochastic volatility model based on Auto-Regressive-Gamma (ARG) dynamics for the volatility. First, ARG processes are presented both under historical and risk-neutral measure, in an affine stochastic discount factor framework. The model parameters are estimated exploiting the informative content of historical high frequency data. Secondly, option pricing is performed via Monte Carlo techniques. This framework allows us to measure the quality of different volatility estimators in terms of mispricing with respect to real option data, leaving to the ARG volatility model the role of a tool. Our analysis points out that using high frequency intra-day returns allows to obtain more accurate ex post estimation of the true (unobservable) return variation than do the more traditional sample variances based on daily returns, and this is reflected in the quality of pricing. Moreover, estimators robust to microstructure effects show an improvement over the realized volatility estimator. The empirical analysis is conducted on European options written on S&P500 index.","[Sanfelici, Simona] Univ Parma, Dept Econ, I-43125 Parma, Italy; [Uboldi, Adamo] European Commiss, DG AGRI, Unit L2 Econ Anal, Brussels, Belgium",University of Parma,"Sanfelici, S (通讯作者)，Univ Parma, Dept Econ, Via JF Kennedy 6, I-43125 Parma, Italy.",simona.sanfelici@unipr.it,"Sanfelici, Simona/ABA-2383-2021","Sanfelici, Simona/0000-0002-2335-5619",,,,,33,1,1,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

AI models are widely applied, but how these models learn or whether they learn the right things is not easily unveiled. Extant studies especially regarding neural networks have attempted to extract reliable rules/features from AI models. However, if these models make mistakes, then the decision maker may establish paradoxical beliefs. Therefore, extracted rules/features should be justified via the prior thoughts, and vice versa. That is, with these extracted rules/features, a practitioner may need either to update his or her belief or to disregard the AI models. This study sets up a finance demonstraion for the proposed process. The proposed guide demonstrates an abductive-reasoning effect.","[Tsaih, Rua-Haun] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Lin, Hsiou-Wei William] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Ke, Wen-Chyan] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Finance & Cooperat Management, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; National Taiwan University; National Taipei University,"Ke, WC (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Finance & Cooperat Management, Taipei, Taiwan.",wenchyan@gm.ntpu.edu.tw,"Tsaih, Rua-Huan/R-1277-2018","Tsaih, Rua-Huan/0000-0001-8537-8915",,,,,24,0,0,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

J,"Copeland, P",,,,"Copeland, Paul",,,Central and Eastern Europe: Negotiating Influence in an Enlarged European Union,EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article analyses the influence and status of the Central and Eastern European states within an enlarged European Union. It analyses two European Union policy negotiations: the Services Directive and the European Union's Financial Crisis Rescue Plan. Central to understanding the influence of a member state within negotiations are its economic size and knowledge of the Brussels policy-making apparatus. Nevertheless, as the new member states from Central and Eastern Europe have gained experience of the European Union policy negotiation process, they remain limited in their ability to influence outcomes. Therefore it can be concluded that while knowledge during negotiations is a necessary condition for successfully influencing outcome, alone it is insufficient because economic weight is particularly pertinent to those outcomes. As a result, the status of the new member states within the European Union is best described as being that of a junior partner, despite the assumed parity of Union membership.","Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London E1 4NS, England",University of London,"Copeland, P (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, ArtsOne Bldg,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",p.copeland@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,80,10,10,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,MAR 16,2014,66.0,3,,,SI,,467.0,487,,10.1080/09668136.2013.866756,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AE4KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333950100007,0

Theoretical research clearly supports forecast aggregation but conflicting results exist in the empirical literature. We search the literature for empirical regularities. One important issue often cited is estimation error and papers which are unsupportive of forecast aggregation often have short spans of data. A second empirical regularity is that researchers frequently use a relatively small number of disaggregates. Our work finds that the greatest benefits to aggregation are realised when a large number of disaggregates are used. This is a natural consequence of the theoretical results. A second critical issue in forecast aggregation is model selection. We suggest a simple guide to model choice based on the empirical properties of the data. In this regard, the extent of comovements between the constituent series determines model choice.","[Bermingham, Colin] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland; [D'Agostino, Antonello] European Stabil Mech, L-1347 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"D'Agostino, A (通讯作者)，European Stabil Mech, 6a Circuit Foire Int, L-1347 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",colin.bermingham@centralbank.ie; a.dagostino@esm.europa.eu,,,,,,,25,16,18,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We report on an experiment designed to capture this feature of communication. The messages available to the sender imperfectly describe the state of the world; however, the sender can improve communication, at a cost, by increasing the complexity or elaborateness of the message. Here the sender learns the state of the world, then sends a message to the receiver. The receiver observes the message and provides a best guess about the state. The incentives of the players are aligned in the sense that both sender and receiver are paid an amount which is increasing in the accuracy of the receiver's guess. We find that the size of the language endogenously emerges as a function of the costs of communication. Specifically, we find that higher communication costs are associated with a smaller language. Although the equilibrium predictions do not perform well, this divergence occurs in a manner which is consistent with the experimental communication literature: overcommunication. We find that the sender's payoffs, relative to equilibrium payoffs, are decreasing in the cost of communication. We also find that the receiver's payoffs, relative to equilibrium payoffs, are increasing in the cost of communication. Finally, we find imperfections in coordination on the basis of the experimental labels.","[Duffy, Sean] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, Camden, NJ 08102 USA; [Hartwig, Tyson; Smith, John] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, Camden, NJ 08102 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Camden; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Camden,"Smith, J (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, 311 North 5th St, Camden, NJ 08102 USA.",smithj@camden.rutgers.edu,"Smith, John/HJB-2300-2022; Smith, John/GYJ-1302-2022; Smith, John/Y-2316-2019","Smith, John/0000-0001-6885-1117",,,,,17,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2014,76.0,3,,,,,395.0,417,,10.1007/s11238-013-9380-5,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AC4US,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332517200006,0

While empirical studies have begun to explore product-specific factors that drive consumer adoption of AFVs, an integrative framework of a comprehensive set of AFV adoption factors and its theoretical foundation as well as empirical validation is still missing. By drawing on theory of innovation adoption and theory of reasoned action we show that consumers' perceptions of AFV attributes lead to a general attitude formation towards AFV. In conjunction with consumers' subjective and personal norm, this in turn determines AFV adoption behavior. Concerning AFV attributes, compatibility, design, and relative advantage of AFVs exhibit the strongest influence on consumers' attitude formation toward AFV. We derive implications for future research and policy makers. The latter include suggestions on how to develop and communicate AFV in order to stimulate AFV adoption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
