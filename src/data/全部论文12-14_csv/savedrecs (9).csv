Arrangements for health financing also have important implications for national and household budgets and broader macroeconomic conditions. The latest evidence from Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu shows these five South Pacific countries have substantial-and changing-health challenges, especially given rapid population growth and the rise of non-communicable diseases. Yet each country faces important constraints to expanding public expenditure on health. Several options for obtaining better health outcomes from health expenditure are canvassed; improving technical and allocative efficiency is the most urgent, affordable, and practical option.

Governments can put institutions in place that allow citizens to hold public servants to account, but citizens must participate in those institutions if accountability is to be achieved. Thus, citizens face a social dilemma - participate in holding public servants to account at a cost in terms of time and effort or free ride, i.e. do not participate, while benefiting from the efforts of those who do. If this characterization of accountability is valid, we would expect more cooperatively inclined citizens to participate in accountability institutions, while the less cooperatively inclined do not. We test the validity of this characterization by investigating the correlation between individual behavior in a simple public goods game and their participation in local and national accountability institutions in Albania. We involve a nationally representative sample of 1800 adults with children in primary school. We find significant correlations between cooperativeness and participation in school accountability institutions and national elections, both at the individual level and the district level. These correlations are robust to the introduction of many controls in the analysis and, in the case of national elections, to the use of official election turn-out statistics in place of self-reported turn-out.

We start with a baseline duopoly model and compare the solutions under quantity and price competition, and the way they are affected by product substitutability. This allows us to show that partial privatization, strategic delegation and other specific government's commitments on the objective function of the public management can be looked at as special cases of these optimal rules, and to evaluate the viability of these policies under the two modes of competition. In this framework, we also discuss the equivalence between manipulation of the objective function and Stackelberg leadership. Since optimal manipulation rules change as new dimensions are added, we also derive the optimal rules under oligopoly, quadratic costs, and competition of international firms. This fairly general unified framework allows to discuss the impact of these factors on the government's implementation policies of the optimal manipulation rules.","[Benassi, Corrado] Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Benassi, Corrado; Scrimitore, Marcella] RCEA, Rimini, Italy; [Chirco, Alessandra; Scrimitore, Marcella] Univ Salento, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Lecce, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Salento,"Benassi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",corrado.benassi@unibo.it; alessandra.chirco@unisalento.it; marcella.scrimitore@unisalento.it,,"CHIRCO, Alessandra/0000-0001-5008-3201; BENASSI, CORRADO/0000-0003-0001-6187",,,,,29,6,6,0,18,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Specifically, we allow the cointegrating equation to switch between m states, according to a first-order Markov process. First, we find evidence that regime-switching exists in the relative pricing relationship, and that two is the optimal number of states. Once we control for shifts in the cointegrating vector, we find that natural gas and crude oil prices are cointegrated, and an error correction model (ECM) of their long-term equilibrium relationship is properly specified. This finding broadens the ECM model of their relationship to longer and more varied sample periods. Also, in a direct comparison of the two and one state cointegrating equations, we found evidence of the potential superiority of the two-state equation, in that it may be robust to shifts in the cointegrating vector which are missed by standard tests for a unit root. Further, our analysis finds evidence that natural gas and crude oil prices did not permanently 'decouple' in the early 2000s, but rather experienced a temporary shift in regimes. We find that forecasts of the relative pricing of natural gas and crude oil should be conditioned on state probability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We study non-cooperative trade policies, first for each individual instrument and then for the situation where all instruments can be set simultaneously, and contrast those with the efficient allocation. We show that in this general context there are four motives for non-cooperative trade policies: the correction of monopolistic distortions; the terms-of-trade manipulation; the delocation motive for protection (home market effect); the fiscal-burden-shifting motive. The Nash equilibrium when all instruments are available is characterized by first-best-level wage subsidies, and inefficient import subsidies and export taxes, which aim at relocating firms to the other economy and improving terms of trade. Thus, the dominating incentives for non-cooperative trade policies are the fiscal-burden-shifting motives and terms-of-trade effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Even though the agent is presumed to know the model, the optimal policy is computed by solving a conventional robust control problem. That is, robustness is induced here by objectives rather than uncertainty, and so is an example of the duality between risk-sensitivity and robustness.

We provide a foundation of these simple extensions of Gale's top trading cycles algorithm from strict preferences to weak preferences. We show that Gale's top trading cycles algorithm with fixed tie-breaking is characterized by individual rationality, strategy-proofness, weak efficiency, non-bossiness, and consistency.

We show that in the presence of heterogeneous firms, the aggregate volume of emissions is influenced by a reallocation effect resulting from an increase in the relative size of more productive firms. The relative importance of this reallocation effect and the scale effect well-known from the literature is affected by the emission intensity at the firm level. Domestic emissions decrease as a result of a unilateral tariff reduction if and only if firm-specific emission intensity decreases strongly with increasing firm productivity. As a result of the induced change in foreign emissions, domestic pollution can increase even if domestic emissions decrease.","[Kreickemeier, Udo] Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Kreickemeier, Udo] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Richter, Philipp M.] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Ifo Institut; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Kreickemeier, U (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",udo.kreickemeier@uni-tuebingen.de; prichter@diw.de,,"Kreickemeier, Udo/0000-0002-3063-9337",,,,,30,60,68,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Since student's age in a grade may be endogenous, we use an instrumental variable estimation strategy exploiting the exogenous variations in the month of birth coupled with the entry school cut-off date. We find that younger children score substantially lower than older peers at the fourth, the eighth and the tenth grade. The advantage of older students does not dissipate as they grow older. We do not find any significant effect of the relative age of a child with respect to the classmates' age. Finally, we show that secondary school students are more likely to be tracked in more academic schools rather than in vocational schools if they are born in the early months of the year. From a policy point of view our results suggest that it might be useful to postpone the entry at school of children, or at least pupils should be prevented to anticipate the age of their entry at school.

This paper inquires into the presence of electoral cycles in federal government transfers, presenting evidence on how the Argentine national government has allocated, since the reestablishment of democracy in 1983, two different types of discretional transfers - cash and in-kind - among the subnational governments. There is an electoral manipulation of total transfers that favors subnational governments that are politically affiliated to the national government; cash transfers show that same pattern.

Multiplier decomposition is used to calculate intra-regional multipliers and spillover effects between the two regions. Results show that a significant percentage (46.3-70.8%) of the total secondary impacts of a shock to Alaskan industries leaks out of Alaska and flows to the RoUS. An analysis of household multipliers indicates that over 60% of the total secondary effects of an increase in Alaska household income accrues to the RoUS households.

In addition to a rich field setting for testing social preferences, we interviewed male and female spouses separately providing novel gender disaggregated data and intra-household measures. We find that income is positional for two-thirds of the respondents, with a fifth willing to continue foregoing absolute income to maintain their relative position. Unlike earlier results, we find that women are more positional on average than men. Our results suggest that one's sensitivity to positionality is related to changes in one's relative position over time; respondents reporting a higher standard of living at the time of marriage were associated with a higher degree of positionality.

Based on a least-squares Monte Carlo simulation, we study the economic implications of basis and liquidity risks.

Two related ideas are proposed and are popularly used in the literature, namely, cognitive hierarchy and cognitive capacity. While these two often meet in the same set of experiments and observations, few studies have formally addressed their relationship. In this study, based on six series of 15- to 20-person beauty contest experiments and the associated working memory tests, we examine the effect of cognitive capacity on the observed cognitive hierarchy. It is found that cognitive capacity has a positive effect on the observed cognitive hierarchy. This effect is strong in the initial rounds, and may become weaker, but without disappearing, in subsequent rounds, which suggests the possibility that cognitive capacity may further impact learning. We examine this possibility using the Markov transition dynamics of cognitive hierarchy. There is evidence to show that subjects with different cognitive capacities may learn differently, which may cause strong convergence to be difficult to observe.","[Chen, Shu-Heng; Du, Ye-Rong] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, AI ECON Res Ctr, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Yang, Lee-Xieng] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Psychol, Res Ctr Mind Brain & Learning, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; National Chengchi University,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, AI ECON Res Ctr, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",chen.shuheng@gmail.com; yerong.du@gmail.com; lxyangip@nccu.edu.tw,"Yang, Lee-Xieng/GOJ-9302-2022","YANG, LEE-XIENG/0000-0002-5421-9249; Chen, Shu-Heng/0000-0003-4584-7646",,,,,64,12,12,0,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Many have proposed the use of historical cost accounting, promoting its ability to avoid the amplification of systemic risk. We caution against focusing on the accounting rule in isolation, and instead emphasize the interaction between accounting and the regulatory framework. First, historical cost accounting, through incentives that arise via interactions with complex capital adequacy regulation, does generate market distortions of its own. Second, while mark-to-market accounting may indeed generate fire sales during a crisis, forward-looking institutions that rationally internalize the probability of fire sales are incentivized to adopt a more prudent investment strategy during normal times which leads to a safer portfolio entering the crisis. Using detailed, position- and transaction-level data from the US insurance industry, we show that (a) market prices do serve as early warning signals', (b) insurers that employed historical cost accounting engaged in greater degrees of regulatory arbitrage before the crisis and limited loss recognition during the crisis, and (c) insurers facing mark-to-market accounting tend to be more prudent in their portfolio allocations. Our identification relies on the sharp difference in statutory accounting rules between life and P&C companies as well as the heterogeneity in implementation of these rules within each insurance type across US states. Our results indicate that regulatory simplicity may be preferred to the complexity of risk-weighted capital ratios that gives rise, through interactions with accounting rules, to distorted risk-taking incentives and potential build-up of systemic risk.

The investment goals are set to achieve a higher return than the benchmark by setting the portfolio's risk profile identical to the primary index risk factors. Return differences between the index and the tracking portfolio are classified as positive and negative series. Multiple time-scale features of each series are extracted by the method of empirical mode decomposition. Then the positive return deviations are modeled by trend-like low frequency behavior and the negative return deviations are modeled by a trendless high frequency behavior. By adopting an immunity-based multi-objective optimization algorithm, the solutions for the process optimal enhanced index tracking are developed. Five data sets drawn from major world markets are adopted to implement our approach. The computational results show the superiority of our model. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

According to standard macroeconomic models, this should have greatly reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy and increased the efficacy of fiscal policy. However, these models also imply that asset prices and private-sector decisions depend on the entire path of expected future short-term interest rates, not just the current level of the monetary policy rate. Thus, interest rates with a year or more to maturity are arguably more relevant for asset prices and the economy, and it is unclear to what extent those yields have been affected by the zero lower bound. In this paper, we apply the methods of Swanson and Williams (2013) to medium-and longer-term yields and exchange rates in the U.K. and Germany. In particular, we compare the sensitivity of these rates to macroeconomic news during periods when short-term interest rates were very low to that during normal times. We find that: 1) USD/GBP and USD/EUR exchange rates have been essentially unaffected by the zero lower bound, 2) yields on German bunds were essentially unconstrained by the zero bound until late 2012, and 3) yields on U.K. gilts were substantially constrained by the zero lower bound in 2009 and 2012, but were surprisingly responsive to news in 2010-11.

A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was specified to perform a multi-level analysis of cross-sectional hierarchical data from 16 DMPs in the Netherlands. Multiple imputation, sub-group analysis per disease and analysis from both the health care and the societal perspectives were also performed. Our model showed that age, the presence of cardiovascular disease, multi-morbidity and payments on top of the payment for the usual care had positive relation with costs, while better quality of life was associated with lower health care costs. In the COPD sample, physical activity and employment were associated with health care costs. Our study showed that there is great variability in health care costs among patients included in DMPs and identified patient and organizational explanatory factors.

The author concludes that there is a larger potential of the organic market and hence the number of farmers in developing countries who can potentially benefit from growing organic products.","Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Kleemann, L (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",linda.kleemann@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 19,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201414.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-14,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1MM,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339610300001,0

Improving on earlier papers, this study has used World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) as the proxy of institutional development in dynamic panel data models estimated by generalized method of moments (GMM). Our results show, first, financial liberalization by itself has no impact on enhancing efficiency of stock market. Second, for countries with high level of institutional development, the interaction of trade openness and financial openness become significant. Third, for the same group of countries, interaction effect of financial liberalization and institutional development leads to more efficiency in stock market. Hence, our finding demonstrates the utmost importance of institutional development and its role on liberalization. Our results conclude that institutional development and trade openness are pre-requisites for a country to benefit from financial openness. Our study further provides empirical evidence to theoretical model proposed by Basu and Morey (2005) that governance is the missing link between stock market efficiency and financial liberalization. Our findings suggest that policy makers in developing economies should enhance the quality of their institution in order to optimize the benefits of financial liberalization.","[Naghavi, Navaz; Lau, Wee-Yeap] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Naghavi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",navaz.naghavi@um.siswa.edu.my,"LAU, WEE YEAP/B-2772-2010","LAU, WEE YEAP/0000-0002-3447-9895",,,,,53,9,12,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We analyse the developments in Germany, the EMU's periphery countries Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain along with the United States over the period 1980 to 2010. Apart from the contribution of productivity to nominal wages, we take into account the contributions of prices, unemployment, replacement rates and taxes by means of an econometrically estimated nonlinear equation resulting from a wage bargaining model. We further study the downward rigidities of nominal wages. The findings show that in past times of low productivity, price inflation and reductions in unemployment still put significant upward pressure on nominal wage growth. The periphery countries are far from aligning nominal wage growth with productivity growth. German productivity is a major wage determinant, but surely not the only one. Within the context of a free bargaining process between employers and labour unions, policy-makers can effectively use the replacement rate to steer the nominal wages outcome.","[Peeters, Marga] Royal Acad Arts & Sci, Netherlands Inst Adv Study, Wassenaar, Netherlands; [den Reijer, Ard] Sveriges Riksbank, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden",Sveriges Riksbank,"Peeters, M (通讯作者)，Royal Acad Arts & Sci, Netherlands Inst Adv Study, Wassenaar, Netherlands.",huber@tinamargapeeters.eu,,,,,,,41,4,4,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We analyse the optimal national trade policy when local authorities might offer subsidies to convince a multi-national enterprise (MNE) to invest in their jurisdiction. With centralised decision-making or with allocation of investment to particular localities, the central authority's optimal policy is to use a high tariff to avoid payment of any subsidy to the MNE. Despite this, some socially undesirable (but locally desirable) FDI cannot be avoided. If local authorities compete to offer subsidies to attract local investment, then the central government's optimal policy is to try to discourage FDI by choosing a low tariff. Despite this, some socially undesirable - and even locally undesirable - FDI prevails. We conduct our analysis both assuming an upper bound on tariffs, as would be consistent with trade liberalisation, and allowing tariffs to vary freely. The effect of increasing trade liberalisation depends heavily on the system of granting local subsidies: if the system is centralised, trade liberalisation decreases the range of parameters for which FDI occurs; if the system is decentralised and competitive, it increases this range.

In this paper, we build a theoretical model to compare investment and production levels under these two contracts. Our model results show that PSCs lead to higher investment levels than buyback contracts. Moreover, investment level increases with international oil companies' (IOCs') share under buyback contracts. The comparison of optimal oil production depends on IOCs' share under PSCs and the host government's marginal operating costs from oil production under buyback contracts. When IOCs' share of gross revenues or the host government's marginal operating costs are low, optimal oil production is higher under buyback contracts; otherwise, optimal oil production is higher under PSCs. Based on such a comparison, we investigate the host government's best decisions on revenue division under these two contract types. We demonstrate that optimal share ratios exist for the host government to obtain maximum oil revenues under both contract types. We also find that under both contracts the discount factor and oil price positively affect optimal investment and production levels, respectively. Our results can provide policy implications for the host government when selecting upstream oil contracts in international oil cooperation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We incorporate spatial peer interaction, defined as a child's nearest geographical neighbors, into a production function of child cognitive development in Andhra Pradesh, India. Our peer group definition takes the form of networks, whose structure allows us to identify endogenous peer effects and contextual effects separately. We exploit variation over time to avoid confounding correlated with social effects. Our results suggest that spatial peer and neighborhood effects are strongly positively associated with a child's cognitive skill formation. Further, we explore the effect of peer groups in helping to provide insurance against the negative impact of idiosyncratic shocks to child learning. We find that the data reject full risk-sharing, but cannot rule out the existence of partial risk-sharing on behalf of peers. We show that peer effects are robust to different specifications of peer interactions and investigate the sensitivity of our estimates to potential misspecification of the network structure using Monte Carlo experiments.","[Helmers, Christian] Santa Clara Univ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Santa Clara University,"Helmers, C (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",chelmers@scu.edu; manasa.patnam@ensae.fr,,,ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,86,18,22,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

It is found that economic policy uncertainty in interaction with firm-level uncertainty depresses firms' investment decisions. When firms are in doubt about costs of doing business due to possible changes in regulation, cost of health care and taxes, they become more guarded with investment plans. The effect of economic policy uncertainty on firm-level investment is greater for firms with higher firm-level uncertainty and during a recession. News-based policy shock has a significantly negative long-term effect on firms' investment. Federal expenditure forecast interquartile range shock has a significant negative effect in the short- and long-run.

It has been more difficult to explore the labour demand of firms, as a result of limited data availability. We use the Quarterly Employment Statistics survey, an enterprise survey conducted by Statistics South Africa, to explore how South African firms create and destroy jobs, thereby shedding light on many of the policy questions that are relevant in a high unemployment society like South Africa. We find that job creation and destruction rates are similar to those found in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. There is little evidence that labour legislation creates rigidities that prevent firms from hiring or firing workers. We also find that larger firms are better net creators of jobs than small firms and that net job creation rates are negative in manufacturing. Our research has important policy implications - particularly for the South African National Planning Commission's 2030 plan, in which new jobs are envisaged to come mainly from small- and medium-sized firms.

This paper presents the results from an experiment measuring the demand for reward and punishment by 'unaffected' third parties, separately and jointly. We find that the demand for costly punishment is substantially lower when individuals are also given the ability to reward. Similarly, the demand for costly reward is lower when individuals can also punish. The evidence indicates the reason for this is that costly punishment and reward are not only used to alter the material payoff of others as assumed by recent economic models, but also as a signal of disapproval and approval of others' actions, respectively. When the opportunity exists, subjects often choose to withhold reward as a form of costless punishment, and to withhold punishment as a form of costless reward. We conclude that restricting the available options to punishing (rewarding) only, may lead to an increase in the demand for costly punishment (reward).","[Nikiforakis, Nikos] CNRS, GATE, Lyon, France; [Nikiforakis, Nikos] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany; [Nikiforakis, Nikos] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Mitchell, Helen] Australian Govt, Dept Foreign Affairs & Trade, Barton, Australia",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Max Planck Society; University of Melbourne,"Nikiforakis, N (通讯作者)，CNRS, GATE, Lyon, France.",n.nikiforakis@gmail.com,,"Mitchell, Helen/0009-0003-5799-4413",,,,,43,33,39,0,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Using both income and expenditure distributions, we found that the economy was on a steady descent towards greater inequality between 1983 and 1993, and that this was followed by a 10-year period of recovery and growth, and gradual improvements in inequality levels. The economy's path to sustainable and equitable growth carried on towards the late 2000s, but this was interrupted by the 2007-08 global financial crisis which caused income inequality levels to deteriorate. Our SD tests show that the country's tax and transfer programmes have been consistent in moderating elevated levels of inequities observed in incomes over time, particularly in periods following economic contraction. Our subgroup results also show strong evidence of long-term disparities in the relative welfare levels of male-headed over female-headed households, of households with children over those without, and of couple-parents families over their single-parent counterparts.","[Valenzuela, Ma Rebecca] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield, Vic, Australia; [Lean, Hooi Hooi] Univ Sains Malaysia, Econ Program, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia; [Athanasopoulos, George] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic, Australia",Monash University; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Monash University,"Valenzuela, MR (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield, Vic, Australia.",rebecca.valenzuela@monash.edu,"Lean, Hooi Hooi/A-5754-2010","Lean, Hooi Hooi/0000-0002-6847-0274; Athanasopoulos, George/0000-0002-5389-2802",,,,,24,9,9,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

A prominent explanation for this pattern is that physical growth and cognitive development share childhood inputs, inducing a correlation between adult height and two productive skills: strength and intelligence. This paper explores the relative roles of strength and intelligence in explaining the labor market height premium among Mexican men. While cognitive test scores account for a limited share of the height premium, roughly half of the premium can be attributed to the educational and occupational choices of taller workers. Taller workers obtain more education and sort into occupations with greater intelligence requirements and lower strength requirements, suggesting a possible role for cognitive skill.

The analysis explicitly considers bottled gas as a substitute for piped gas and therefore uses a simple utility maximization model that yields both a gas-type choice model and a demand specification whose parameterization allows examining households' responses to regulated price changes. The results show that relative gas prices and household features explain households' piped gas usage. They also provide insights on the distribution of welfare changes.

By conditioning the current capacity utilisation of firms on their current and planned price adjustments, a micro-level NIRCU is defined as the level of capacity utilisation at which there is no need for the firm to adjust its prices. In contrast to other measures of inflationary pressure, this measure (1) is timely available without revisions and (2) does not imply any need for rather arbitrary methods or concepts such as statistical filtering or potential output. In accordance with the results in Koberl and Lein (Can J Econ 44: 673-694, 2011), we find that the NIRCU performs well as a driving variable of Austrian inflation in various Phillips Curve estimations.

Bruckner and Ciccone (2011) document that a significant effect of democratic change may be triggered by negative transitory economic shocks, and that rainfall can open a democratic window of opportunity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). As a complement, this paper uses within-country variation in the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) as a source of transitory negative income shocks to SSA countries. The BDI reflects the cost of utilizing dry bulk carriers, which are specially designed vessels for transporting primary goods internationally, where these goods dominate the output and export sectors of the SSA economies. We find that positive BDI cost shocks are followed by significant contraction in income through trade channel and significant improvement in democratic institutions, where BDI can open a window of opportunity for democratic improvement.

Demographic factors including total population, urbanization and population density are found to be significant factors, particularly with respect to non-renewable energy consumption. The results also reveal that while total population and urbanization positively influence non-renewable energy consumption, population density has a negative impact on non-renewable energy consumption. From the demographic factors only total population has a significant impact on renewable energy consumption. Granger causality results indicate that there is unidirectional causality from non-renewable energy use to population density in the short run. However, no causal linkage is found between urbanization and non-renewable energy use. Likewise, no causal direction is seen between renewable energy use and any of the demographic factors.

It applies a dynamic conditional correlation based methodology that uses fractionally differenced data along with controls for structural breaks and non-interest-rate related factors that influence house prices. The key finding made is that the financial crisis had a long-term structural impact on the monetary transmission relationship. For example, we find that the mean conditional correlation between house prices in England and Wales and the three-year fixed mortgage rate rose by 6.6 percentage points. Similarly, the mean correlation between prices and the standard variable mortgage rate increased 6.4 percentage points to 54%. These findings suggest to us that interest-rate-based monetary policy still has an important role to play in the housing market. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The study primarily employs two dominant frontier approaches of efficiency measurement in banking literature. The study also estimates the soundness score of the banks by using Z-score methodology and attempts to explore the relationship between efficiency and financial stability of banks. The results based on the data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) approaches report that CBs are more efficient than their Islamic counterparts. On the contrary, Z-score reports that IBs were financially more stable than CBs. However, the dominance of IBs has been drastically lost afterwards. This might be originated by the decrease of Z-score of IBs in Bahrain, Kuwait and UAE, which were found as main front-runners among IBs in terms of financial stability. To the best of authors' knowledge, it is the first study that examines the efficiency of IBs versus CBs using two different frontier efficiency analyses and collates the result of frontier efficiency methods with stability indicator. The practical implication of the findings for IBs is to explore additional investment opportunity and for CBs is to uphold more financial stability.","[Mobarek, Asma] Stockholm Univ, Sch Business, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kalonov, Alovaddin] Stockholm Univ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Stockholm University,"Mobarek, A (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Sch Business, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",amo@fek.su.se,,,,,,,40,46,50,0,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This is because of potential variations in the cost economies, reimbursement structures and quality-adjusted outcome mandates of the reformed health care system. As such, the production technology structure and resource use flexibility implications in adult compared with paediatric physical therapy would tend to differ. Specifying a Generalized Translog (GTL) cost-minimization model, the core innovation in this article is investigating the cost structure differences between for-profit' adult and paediatric physical therapy operations. Using a uniquely rich data set of 4552 bi-weekly, site-specific operations across 27 US states with measurements on output, labour inputs (clinical, technicians, support staff) and capital, we separately model the economic contents of adult and paediatric physical therapy clinics. Results suggest that paediatric clinics do, indeed, have a statistically different operational cost structure compared with adult centres. The estimated factor demand elasticities of pair-wise factor substitutions (own and cross-price, Morishima and Shadow) and scale economies also differ, among other technological characteristics. These results have operational policy implications.","[Lubiani, Gregory G.] Xavier Univ, Dept Hlth Serv Adm, Cincinnati, OH 45207 USA; [Okunade, Albert A.] Univ Memphis, Dept Econ, Off FCBE 450BB, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",University System of Ohio; Xavier University; University of Memphis,"Lubiani, GG (通讯作者)，Xavier Univ, Dept Hlth Serv Adm, 3800 Victory Pkwy, Cincinnati, OH 45207 USA.",lubianig@xavier.edu,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that both rational speculators and uninformed investors (often mistaking Motors Liquidation for the new, reorganized GM) have purchased the stock. We develop a theoretical asset-pricing model that includes both types of agents. We present two major results. First, the most frequent state is one where a small fraction of rational agents ensure that the share price behaves as if all agents are rational. A second state exists where all rational agents exit and the share price is inflated. Second, fitting the model to Motors Liquidation, we find evidence of irrational asset pricing for this firm. We find little evidence of similar behavior in the share prices of the thirty stocks that compose the Dow Jones Industrial Average.","[Ahn, Tom; Sandford, Jeremy] Univ Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Shea, Paul] Bates Coll, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA",University of Kentucky,"Shea, P (通讯作者)，Bates Coll, 271 Pettengill Hall, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA.",pshea@bates.edu,,"Ahn, Tom/0000-0002-0185-6471",,,,,15,1,1,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We estimate an econometric model using appropriate panel data techniques for the EU-27 countries over the period 1995-2009. The analysis is also performed at subgroups of countries within the EU27, such as the Core, Periphery, High Technology, and the New EU Member countries. Overall, the results suggest that trade openness exerts an equalizing effect, while financial globalization through FDI, capital account openness and stock market capitalization has been the driving force of inequality in the EU-27 since 1995. The highest contribution to inequality stems from FDI. Although the trade impact remained robust, disparities were observed in the financial globalization effects within a certain group or among country groups. The recent financial crisis led to a significant rise in inequality only in the EU-periphery and the New Member states. The impact from the other control variables was either minor or insignificant.

However, these two qualities might also be beneficial to municipalities (resulting in a direct increase in their revenue or fiscal capacity). By estimating an equation of the expenditure needs and the fiscal capacity of Spanish municipalities with more than 75,000 inhabitants, we find that the central costs incurred by large municipalities are offset by their greater fiscal capacity, but that the same is not true for municipalities that serve as political/administrative capitals.","[Bosch, Nuria; Espasa, Marta; Montolio, Daniel] Univ Barcelona, IEB, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Bosch, N (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, IEB, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Bosch, Nuria/R-5335-2018","Bosch, Nuria/0000-0003-1313-4203",Generalitat de Catalunya [2009SGR102]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-37131],Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"We wish to thank participants at the XIX Encuentro de Economia Publica (University of Santiago de Compostela, 2012), the Jornada sobre Haciendas Locales (University of Zaragoza, 2012) and the 51st Congress of the European Regional Science Association Conference (University of Barcelona, 2011) for insightful comments.

The probability of remaining in these global value chains in a changing and unstable competitive environment is expected to be higher for suppliers that provide the most sophisticated goods, i.e. goods that incorporate the most advanced economies' capabilities. In order to check this hypothesis, we investigate the determinants of export survival in the auto industry, a sector highly involved in cross-border production sharing, using a discrete time duration model. Product sophistication has been measured by the sophistication index proposed by Hausmann et al. (2007) and the complexity index developed by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009). Our estimates show that, indeed, the risk of interruption of trade relationships decreases with the complexity of the products and also with geographical and economic proximity, previous export experience and with the degree of integration in the international-scale networks.

First, this article summarizes recent advances in the measurement of quality, distinguishing between measurements of provider knowledge and provider effort. Second, it looks at the determinants of practice quality variation in low-income settings, highlighting the limited role of structural constraints such as infrastructure, the supply of materials including drugs, and provider training-the mainstay of much of global health policy today. In contrast, practice quality variation is clearly linked to provider effort, an aspect of provider behavior that can be altered through a variety of means. Third, it provides a broad economic framework to interpret the findings. We look for evidence of specific market failures in the provision of primary care and emphasize that the key difficulty is (and always was) the transaction-specific nature of medical advice. Providers can do too much or too little (or both), and the extent of either depends on the specific patient and the specific disease. We document specific ways in which it is difficult for both consumers and governments to monitor every transaction to detect potentially errant behavior.","[Das, Jishnu] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Das, Jishnu] Ctr Policy Res, New Delhi 110021, India; [Hammer, Jeffrey] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",The World Bank; Princeton University,"Das, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jdas1@worldbank.org; jhammer@princeton.edu,,"Das, Jishnu/0000-0002-5909-3585",,,,,62,96,108,0,19,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The advanced economies strongly influence Chinese export performance, with subsequent effects on output growth. Using a production function, this article examines to which extent regional GDP growth in China is export driven. In a panel of 28 Chinese provinces, series are splitted into common and idiosyncratic components, the latter being stationary. The results indicate cointegration between the common components of GDP, the capital stock and exports. In equilibrium, exports increase GDP by more than their impact expected from the national accounts. While exports and capital are weakly exogenous, GDP responds to deviations from the long run. A similar adjustment pattern can be detected for most regions, except for some provinces in the Western part of the country.","[Dreger, Christian] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Dreger, Christian] European Univ Viadrina, D-15230 Frankfurt, Germany; [Zhang, Yanqun] CASS, Beijing, Peoples R China",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Dreger, C (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",cdreger@diw.de,"zhang, lin/IZQ-4870-2023; Dreger, Christian/AAF-6719-2020",,,,,,26,2,3,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We address two issues (international sharing of macroeconomic risks and coordinated growth stimulation) which are at the heart of the sustainability of EMU.

I argue that it is the price of imported goods relative to the price of domestic goods but not the terms of trade that determine measured output and productivity. The simulated results show that shocks to the price of imports account for about half of the output deviation (from trend), one third of the TFP deviation and two thirds of the labor deviation in 1998. For the quantitative results, the extent to which the usage of imported goods is distorted is critical and substantially larger than tariffs because of significantly sizable non-tariff distortions.

We also study risk estimates from various subsamples of workers, such as those who switched to a different manufacturing industry (or out of the manufacturing sector altogether). Finally, we use these estimates to conduct a welfare analysis evaluating the benefits or costs of trade through the income risk channel.

Using Benford's Law, the analysis employs 84,870 positive earnings observations for all publicly listed US and Taiwan companies from 1990 to 2011. The empirical results show that, regardless of developed markets and emerging markets, the phenomenon of cosmetic earnings management exists. In contrast to developed markets, corporate managers of emerging markets have stronger incentives to manipulate earnings. More importantly, it was found that the degree of earnings management is significantly less after implementing corporate governance regulations both in developed and emerging markets. This result suggests that the implementation of corporate governance regulations plays an important role in reducing the earnings manipulative behavior. The findings of the study add more evidence to the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of corporate governance regulations in preventing earnings management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The answer will lie, in the nature of human curiosity and the corresponding growth of knowledge and in the particular instituted rules of the game that induce the self transformation of each particular economic order. The essential idea is this; the manner of self transforming is contingent on the manner of self-ordering, so that different instituting frames have different dynamic consequences. The notion of order provides the bridge to the systemic properties of the economy, the nature of its parts and the manner of their interconnection, while the notion of transformation provides the link with evolution and the open-ended, essentially unpredictable, development of capitalism. From my perspective capitalist economies are ignorance economies, in which highly specialised individuals and teams know a great deal about very little, so that the productive strength of the system, its collective knowing, depends on how the pools of specialised, narrow understandings are connected. Connectivity requires organisation and organisation depends on rules of the game and on belief and trust so that we can rely upon the testimony and actions of others. Failure of trust leads to failure of connectivity and a corresponding loss of system coherence. Order is central to the notion of economic evolution and, in practice, economic configurations demonstrate immense richness and subtlety but order is not equilibrium. Systems in equilibrium do not evolve. That the day to day structures of capitalism are the product of ordering processes in the epistemic as well as the material realm seems to me self evident and it is equally self evident that these structures are restless, that their development is open-ended and unpredictable.","Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",,"Metcalfe, S (通讯作者)，Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester, Lancs, England.",stan.metcalfe@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,10,13,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Thus, using a multiple regression statistical model, we have analyzed the appraisal systems in place in 28 countries to identify factors that influence the development of economic assessment of military expenditure.

For the reasoning of the model there was used a literature that describes a phenomenon of human resource assessment and allows penetrating of connection with organizational climate in its conception. As there was a phenomenological research performed, while examining the phenomenon it was likely this phenomenon shows up in these organizations. By this study there was a striving to gather as much information on influence of human resource assessment to organization's climate as possible; therefore there were purposefully studied big organizations of public sector in Lithuania, in which this phenomenon exists. Assessment of human resources in the article is analyzed as a process. It is represented by eighty five questions that were joined together by the help of factor analysis and reliability analysis into five essential stages of human resource assessment during the process: assessment methodology, organization of assessment, assessors of employees, informational sources and discussion on assessment. By using methodology of questionnaire there was analyzed an influence of process stages mentioned to additive construct of organization's climate which is constructed of thirty nine primary items. This allowed knowing properly organizational climate and constructing of index of wide range organizational climate. Data were processed using the method of one-dimensional regression because it allowed assessment of every connection separately and thus knowing better a phenomenon of influence of assessment of human resources to organization's climate. Findings showed that all process from methodology of assessment to discussion influences organizational climate. The article presents an empirical model of influence of assessment of human resources to organization's climate, which figures structurally a connection between assessment of human resources and organizational climate that shows up in big organizations of Lithuanian public sector. The article is original because the study it described allowed envisaging which stages of human resource assessment process influence organization's climate directly and which are influencing through mediators. The study is restricted by the fact that assessors of employees in the organizations studied were only external.

In anticipation of the post 2013 design, it is widely agreed that the forthcoming CAP should be more understandable to taxpayers. In this study, the social preferences towards the budgetary allocation of this policy, its equity, and its co-financing are investigated by means of the Choice experiment methodology to shed light on how to shape the future CAP to gain social legitimacy.

The sample is European Champions League group stage matches played between 1997-1998 and 2009-2010. We begin by developing a characterization of teams' strategies (extent of offense or defense) using principal component analysis. This is used to estimate the relationship between a team's probabilities of scoring and conceding goals and its chosen strategy. Knowing that relationship, it is then possible to derive a team's optimal strategy, and to study how this varies in different situations (such as playing at home or away). A comparison between optimal and actual strategy reveals that teams appear to adopt more defensive strategies than is optimal. A notable feature of our study is that we model a team as choosing a strategy at the start of each match and also at half time, thereby incorporating a dynamic element.","Trinity Univ, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA",Trinity University,"Santos, RM (通讯作者)，Trinity Univ, Dept Econ, One Trinity Pl, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA.",rsantos@trinity.edu,,,,,,,11,0,1,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Our assessment starts, firstly, by estimating a country-level demand model to determine the GDP influences of an individual country on oil demand. Secondly, it estimates the impact of world aggregate demand on oil prices. This two-stage approach enables us to estimate the effect of the GDP growth of an individual nation on oil demand globally and the global price of oil. The estimated demand model is applied to quantify the effect of the Chinese GDP growth on the price of oil through simulations of a range of scenarios for each year over the period 2009 to 2030. We find that China's excessive growth adds a premium to the price of oil which increases over time. The results have policy implications in terms of the sustainability of the Chinese faster growth rate from the perspective of its negative externalities to the world. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We study the relationship between the predictions of the Single Agent model (the standard in the literature) versus a simple model extension (the Demographics model) where deterministic changes in household size and composition affect optimal consumption decisions. We show theoretically that the Demographics model is conceptually preferable to the Single Agent model as it captures economic mechanisms ignored by the latter. However, our quantitative analysis demonstrates that differences in predictions for consumption are negligible across models, when using standard calibration strategies.

We focus on counseling and monitoring which may reduce search costs for employers, but which may also have ambiguous effect on the employer-employee matching quality and thus on firms' performance. Using a large scale experiment which was conducted in Denmark in 2005-2006 and induced a greater provision of activation, we find that small firms hiring in the districts where the social experiment was conducted changed their hiring practices in favor of unemployed workers and experienced greater turnover than other firms. Treated firms also experienced no change or a marginal reduction in value added and total factor productivity during the first years after the experiment. These results are consistent with the idea that monitoring creates compulsion effects which counteract the possible improvement in the matching process expected from job search assistance.

These discussions show that adding agglomerative forces can change the results considerably. In our paper, we introduce a public sector into a Footloose Capital model: Capital income is taxed according to the residence principle and any tax revenue is spent for providing a public commodity. Thus, public policy changes the sectoral split of total expenditures, which is central for determining international factor rewards and thus for factor mobility. We modeled this factor mobility process - along the lines of a replicator dynamics - in discrete time and studied its local and global properties. We showed that multiple equilibria are possible, involving cyclical and chaotic attractors; and that the basins of attraction may exhibit a highly complex structure. In that environment, the long run outcome of the dynamics process may depended highly sensitive to initial conditions and/or parameters. Public policy trying to attract industrial capital to one country may trigger a dynamic process actually leading to agglomeration in the other country.","[Commendatore, Pasquale] Univ Naples Federico II, I-80134 Naples, Italy; [Kubin, Ingrid] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dipartimento Econ, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",University of Naples Federico II; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Commendatore, P (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Via Mezzocannone 16, I-80134 Naples, Italy.",pasquale.commen-datore@unina.it; ingrid.kubin@wu.ac.at,"Commendatore, Pasquale/AAQ-9669-2021","Commendatore, Pasquale/0000-0003-2938-168X; Kubin, Ingrid/0000-0002-0974-0174",,,,,42,2,2,0,17,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

A unique feature of the intervention was that students were free to choose the type of cultural event they participated in. So the intervention relied on the intrinsic motivation of students to participate in high cultural events, while there was no reason to assume that this motivation was present given the existing literature. We find that Cultural and Artistic Education increased the participation in high culture, but not the participation in popular culture. The effect of the intervention is, however, small. Student characteristics do not influence high cultural participation, but the fraction of immigrant students in the class does: the lower this fraction, the more students participate in high cultural events. Finally, the effect seems to represent (at least partly) the intrinsic motivation of students for high culture.","[Damen, Marie-Louise] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Van Klaveren, Chris] Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res TIER, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Maastricht University,"Van Klaveren, C (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res TIER, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",m.l.c.damen@vu.nl; cp.vanklaveren@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Damen, Marie-Louise/F-2149-2013","Van klaveren, Chris/0000-0001-5975-4454",,,,,24,1,1,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2013,161.0,4,,,,,447,462,,10.1007/s10645-013-9217-1,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,248HV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326690000004,0

Our main focus is on how the equilibrium probability that fiscal policy is distorted in any region (the political budget cycle, PBC) differs across fiscal regimes. With centralization, there are generally two effects that change the probability of a PBC. One is the possibility of selective distortion: the incumbent can be reelected with the support of just a majority of regions. The other is a cost diversification effect, which is present unless costs are perfectly correlated across regions. Both these effects work in the same direction, with the general result that the PBC probability is lower under centralization when decentralization also involves PBC. Welfare analysis shows that voters tend to be better off when the PBC probability is lower, so voters prefer centralization when decentralization involves PBC. Our results are robust to a number of changes in the specification of the model.","[Gonzalez, Paula; Porteiro, Nicolas] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain; [Hindriks, Jean] Catholic Univ Louvain, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universite Catholique Louvain,"González, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain.",pgonzalez@upo.es; Hindriks@core.ucl.ac.be,"González, Paula/H-3949-2015; Gonzalez, Paula LM/IAR-4710-2023","González, Paula/0000-0003-1630-9726; Gonzalez, Paula LM/0000-0003-0154-0087",,,,,27,4,5,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

It is shown that deflationary stagnation policies have prevailed since 2010 and have meant massive real gross domestic product (GDP) losses and some improvements in price competitiveness of the crisis countries, but considerable and persistent current account imbalances, reductions in government deficit-GDP ratios with continuously rising trends in government gross debt-GDP ratios, a further recession for the euro area as a whole, the risk of deflationary stagnation in major parts of the euro area, and an increasing threat of a final collapse of the euro as a currency. Therefore, an alternative macroeconomic policy approach tackling the basic contradictions of finance-dominated capitalism and the deficiencies of European economic policy institutions and economic policy strategies, in particular, the lack of an institution convincingly guaranteeing public debt and the lack of a stable and sustainable financing mechanism for acceptable current account imbalances, is outlined.","Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Hein, E (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany.",,"Hein, Eckhard/HQY-4102-2023","Hein, Eckhard/0000-0002-6542-6630",,,,,38,36,38,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

However, the Fed seems more reluctant to decrease the fund's rate during recessions. On the contrary, monetary authorities react symmetrically and forcefully to inflation in booms and busts.

The results show that capital investment in agriculture by both government and farmers has risen significantly in the past two and a half decades, particularly in recent years. As China remains in the early stages of agricultural policy transition, its political economy would suggest that there will likely be more public investment in, and more subsidies to, agriculture in the coming years. Increased public investment in agriculture appears to have also induced increased farmers' capital formation in agriculture. Credit policy, the overall growth of farmer's income, rural wages, and comparative advantage of commodities are important factors that may facilitate farmers' investment in agriculture. The results also show that the successful growth of China's agriculture has been associated with its high TFP growth. Both public and private agricultural capital formations have played an important role in raising China's agricultural productivity. The TFP decomposition analyses show that technological change is a primary driver of the TFP growth in China's agriculture.","[Ma, Hengyun] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Oxley, Les] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand","Henan Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Waikato","Ma, HY (通讯作者)，Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 95 Wenhua Rd, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.",h.y.ma@163.com; jkhuang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; loxley@waikato.ac.nz,"Oxley, Les/JDW-1971-2023; Oxley, Les T/A-6075-2008; Ma, Hengyun/P-8034-2019","Ma, Hengyun/0000-0003-4405-3078; Oxley, Les/0000-0003-3621-2323",,,,,35,3,4,0,147,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1535-3516,,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

This study introduces the simultaneous autoregressive model for the underlying spatial dependence across coefficients, where the coefficients for one observation are affected by the sum of those for the other observations.

The proposed models are applied to estimate the Japanese residential water demand function, which is an example of the discrete/continuous choice model.","Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University,"Miyawaki, K (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan.",miyawaki.koji@kwansei.ac.jp,,,,,,,28,0,2,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

It is assumed that there exist disparities in efficiencies between male and female labour due to skewed access to education and health, and differences in their spending patterns leading to differential effects of respective wages on their nutrition. The results indicate that tariff cut may reduce gender wage inequality, but may have detrimental effects on welfare; while foreign capital inflow may accentuate the inequality, despite improving the welfare of the economy. However, government policies to increase the provision of education and health have favourable effects on gender wage inequality but may be welfare deteriorating. Thus, the article provides a theoretical explanation to empirical evidences of diverse effects of liberalisation on gender wage inequality and explains the possibility of a trade-off between gender inequality and social welfare.","[Mukhopadhyay, Ujjaini] Behala Coll, Dept Econ, Kolkata, India; [Chaudhuri, Sarbajit] Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, Kolkata, India",University of Calcutta,"Chaudhuri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, Kolkata, India.",sarbajitch@yahoo.com,"CHAUDHURI, Sarbajit/AAE-6343-2019; Mukhopadhyay, Ujjaini/AAF-1549-2020","Mukhopadhyay, Ujjaini/0000-0002-0492-1056; Chaudhuri, Sarbajit/0000-0003-1471-0460",,,,,53,2,3,0,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Using city-level data and a difference-in-difference (DID) model, this paper estimates the changes in healthcare supply in response to the regulatory reform. Based on the DID estimates, in Weifang between 2006 and 2008, the reform led to a 39.3% increase in the number of doctors per 10,000 residents and 40.1% increase in the number of health workers per 10,000 residents. Similarly, in Suzhou between 2005 and 2008 the reform led to increases of 60.5%, 30.8% and 36.6% for hospital beds, doctors and health workers per 10,000 people, respectively. Moreover, the magnitude of this impact appears to increase over time. Furthermore, the effect of the reform is consistent regardless of whether the separation reform takes place inside or outside the government. These findings lead us to conclude that the government should focus only on the regulation of healthcare markets, while leaving hospital operation to the free market.

We present both a characterization of this value by means of properties and combinatoric formulae for calculating it. In simple majority games, the greatest power accrues to 'moderate' players who are located neither at the extremes of the spectrum nor in its center.

As Titmuss (1970) famously pointed out, providing monetary incentives to blood donors may crowd out blood supply as purely altruistic donors may feel less inclined to donate. In this paper we examine how favouring different types of incentives is related to the likelihood of donating blood by exploiting a large sample representative of the population of fifteen European countries that contains information on both donation and attitudes towards incentives. Our results show that those who favour monetary rewards for blood donation are less likely to be donors and those who favour non-monetary rewards are more likely to have donated. This is consistent with the idea that while monetary rewards may crowd out blood donation, non-monetary rewards do not.","[Costa-Font, Joan] London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Costa-Font, Joan] London Sch Econ, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Jofre-Bonet, Mireia] City Univ London, Dept Econ, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Yen, Steven T.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; City University London; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture,"Costa-Font, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Costa-Font, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.costa-font@lse.ac.uk; mireia.jofre-bonet@city.ac.uk; syen@utk.edu,"Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/V-8673-2019; Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/0000-0002-2055-2166; Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919; Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/0000-0001-6168-0407",,,,,44,29,34,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2013,66.0,4,,,,,529,551,,,,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,VI4GX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000484792500001,0

We examine this question in the context of a field experiment in urban Chinese hospital outpatient clinics.

We then show that gift giving creates externalities for third parties. If two patients, A and B are perceived as unrelated, B receives worse care when A gives a gift. However, if A identifies B as a friend, then both A and B benefit from A's gift giving.

Relative to the empirical work, the theory can clarify a number of important questions: What determines the strength of the savings response by males (or households with a son)? Can women (or households with a daughter) dis-save? What are the conditions under which aggregate savings would go up in response to a higher sex ratio? This theory can potentially help to understand the savings patterns in China, India, Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong, and other economies that have experienced a dramatic increase in the pre-marital sex ratio.

In the share contest a contestant receives a share of the rent equal to her share of rent-seeking expenditures, while in the lottery contest a contestant wins the entire rent with probability equal to her share of rent-seeking expenditures. In share contests average expenditures converge to equilibrium levels when subjects only get feedback about own earnings, and additional feedback about rivals' choices and earnings raises average expenditures. In lottery contests information feedback has an opposite, and even stronger, effect: when subjects only get feedback on own earnings we observe high levels of rent dissipation, usually exceeding the value of the rent, and additional feedback about rivals' choices and earnings has a significant moderating influence on expenditures. In a follow-up treatment we make information feedback endogenous by allowing contestants in a lottery contest to make public or private expenditures. Subjects make the vast majority of expenditures privately and overall excess expenditures are similar to the lottery contest with own feedback. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

As a first step, demand for bundles of services, as well as the associated services, is modeled as a discrete choice problem with a potentially large number of products. A unique invoice based consumer level data set from Portuguese telecommunications firms is collected. This choice based data set is combined with survey data to characterize the market shares of all potential combinations of services available. Several discrete choice models are estimated. A Cross-Nested logit model is the most parsimonious description of the substitution patterns between the large number of products available. The demand model used, coupled with the definition of choice alternatives proposed, generates flexible substitution patterns, which produce reasonable price elasticities of demand. The demand for triple-play products is elastic, with own-price elasticities for the larger firms ranging between 32 and 1.3, and a market own-price elasticity of 1.4. Some of the products analyzed are found to be complementary. Our results indicate that triple-play bundles are a relevant product market. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We use two-stage estimation methods to identify the determinants behind the choice of whether or not to adopt NHRE as well as about the amount of electricity to produce from renewable energy sources. We find that NHRE diffusion accelerates with the implementation of economic and regulatory instruments, higher per capita income and schooling levels, and stable, democratic regimes. In contrast, increasing openness and aid, institutional and strategic policy support programs, growth of electricity consumption, and high fossil fuel production appear to delay NHRE diffusion. Furthermore, we find that a diverse energy mix increases the probability of NHRE adoption. Finally, we find a weak support for a positive influence of the Kyoto Protocol on NHRE diffusion and no evidence for any influence resulting from financial sector development. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I examine the effects of coaching changes for National Football League (NFL) teams between the 1995 and 2012 seasons. A variety of factors contribute to an NFL team's performance reverting towards league-average levels between seasons. Thus, a nominal improvement in team performance could be due to improved management or it could simply be mean reversion. I find that, after accounting for the highly significant mean reversion effect during this time period, firing a coach reduces a team's expected performance during the next season and the team's average performance over the next two seasons. This effect is present when wins are used to measure performance, but also when performance is measured by point differential and playoff appearances, two variables that avoid some shortcomings of using team wins as a measure of performance. I conclude that teams are firing coaches an inefficiently high percentage of the time.","Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA",Middle Tennessee State University,"Roach, MA (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.",michael.roach@mtsu.edu,,,,,,,10,4,4,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; JAPANESE; DAMAGES; SCALE,"Climate change and global warming become a major policy issue in the world. Economic activities produce not only desirable outputs (e.g., electricity) but also undesirable outputs (e.g., CO2 emission). The important policy issue is how each nation can balance between economic development and environmental protection to attain a sustainable society. In attaining the sustainable society, environmental assessment is increasingly important because it can serve as an initial step toward the green growth of each nation. For the purpose, this study proposes a new use of DEA (Data Environment Analysis) for environmental assessment in a time horizon. The proposed use of DEA incorporates Malmquist index to examine the degree of a frontier shift among multiple periods. The frontier shift indicates a technology progress and/or managerial innovation during an observed period. The index is conceptually separated into six subcomponents, which are further divided into twelve different subcomponents (six subcomponents x two disposability concepts) under the natural and managerial disposability. In the index measurement, it is necessary for us to consider a frontier crossover among different periods because technology innovation usually has a time lag until it really appears. As an empirical application, this study utilizes the proposed approach to identify the relationship among fuel mix, electricity and CO2 of ten industrial nations. This study finds three important empirical findings. First, there is a time lag in technology innovation on electricity generation and CO2 emission reduction. Consequently, it is necessary to consider the existence of a frontier crossover in assessing the electric power industry. Second, nuclear generation, as found in France, as well as hydro and renewable energy, as found in Netherlands, are important for the development of a sustainable society although the former is associated with a very high level of risk and the latter has a limited generation capacity. Finally, the electric power industry has been making a corporate effort to reduce the amount of CO2 emission by utilizing nuclear and renewable energy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The adaptation policy entails the accumulation of a particular sort of capital that will eliminate or reduce the catastrophic damage of an abrupt climate change when (and if) it occurs. The occurrence date is uncertain. The policy problem involves balancing the tradeoffs between the (certain) investment cost prior to occurrence and the benefit (in reduced damage) that will be realized after the (uncertain) occurrence date. For stationary economies the optimal adaptation capital converges monotonically to a steady state. In most cases, investment begins immediately. However, if the initial adaptation capital exceeds a pre-specified threshold level, which lies above the optimal steady state, investment is delayed while the capital stock decreases (due to depreciation) and commences only when it reaches this threshold level. For growing economies the optimal adaptation capital stock approaches the maximal economic level above which further accumulation is ineffective.","[Tsur, Yacov] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Withagen, Cees] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HAV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Withagen, C (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HAV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",tsur@agri.huji.ac.il; cwithagen@feweb.vu.nl,,"Tsur, Yacov/0000-0001-6374-3838",,,,,18,16,17,0,26,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We use unique Norwegian data on crime and internet adoption to shed light on this question. A public program with limited funding rolled out broadband access points in 2000-2008, and provides plausibly exogenous variation in internet use. Our instrumental variables estimates show that internet use is associated with a substantial increase in both reports, charges and convictions of rape and other sex crimes. We present a conceptual framework that highlights three mechanisms for how internet use may affect reported sex crime, namely a reporting effect, a matching effect on potential offenders and victims, and a direct effect on sex crime propensity. To investigate the importance of these mechanisms, we use data on individual reporting behaviour, police investigations, and criminal charges and convictions. None of the analyses we perform suggest that the positive relationship between internet use and sex crime is driven by changes in reporting behaviour. Our findings suggest that the direct effect on sex crime propensity is positive and non-negligible, possibly as a result of increased consumption of pornography.","[Havnes, Tarjei; Leuven, Edwin] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Mogstad, Magne] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Oslo; University of London; University College London,,,,,,,,,58,84,88,2,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

This study investigates the role of working time preferences and hours mismatch for well-being among couples. The empirical evidence indicates that well-being is generally lower among those with working time mismatch. Particularly underemployment is detrimental for well-being. We further provide first evidence on spillovers from the partner's working time mismatch that are, however, no longer significant once we control for the partner's well-being. This suggests that well-being is contagious, and that the spillover is due to caring preferences. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This makes the agents' beliefs dispersed and alleviates the overreaction problem. Moreover, we compare the welfare effect of the aggregate information announcement with that of a separate announcement.

While taking context into account, I explain why the literatures overlap in significant ways and I propose an analytical map which relies on and matches the three central questions of both literatures. The three central questions on identity identification, individuation and multiple social identities - are coupled respectively with the three central questions on the firm - the nature of the firm, internal organization and firm boundaries. This identity-based extension of the economics of the firm contributes to the organization of the literature by extending the analysis of identity to questions that go beyond the primary question of identification. In doing so, it identifies two key research agendas: the role of internal organization in enabling individuation and the role of firm boundaries in enabling collective intentions.","[Boulu-Reshef, Beatrice] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Boulu-Reshef, Beatrice] Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia; University of Virginia,"Boulu-Reshef, B (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",boulu-reshefb@virginia.edu,,"Boulu-Reshef, Beatrice/0000-0001-6265-2926",,,,,61,5,5,0,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Using monthly data over the past decade, we estimate models of inflation to identify the importance of the factors contributing to CPI inflation and three of its major components: cereal prices, food prices, and non-food prices. Our main finding is that movements in international food and goods prices, measured in domestic currency, determined the long-run evolution of domestic prices. In the short run, agricultural supply shocks affected food inflation, causing large deviations from long-run price trends. Monetary policy seems to have accommodated price shocks, but money supply growth affected short-run non-food price inflation. Our results suggest that when analyzing inflation in developing economies with a large food share in consumer prices, world food prices and domestic agricultural production should be considered. Omitting these factors can lead to biased results and misguided policy decisions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The Chinese government frequently threatens that meetings between its trading partners' officials and the Dalai Lama will be met with animosity and ultimately harm trade ties. We run a gravity model of exports to China from 159 partner countries between 1991 and 2008 to test the extent to which bilateral tensions affect trade with autocratic China. In particular, we empirically investigate whether countries that receive the Dalai Lama despite China's opposition experience a significant reduction in their exports to China. In order to account for the potential endogeneity of meetings with the Dalai Lama, the number of Tibet Support Groups and the travel pattern of the Tibetan leader are used as instruments. Our empirical results support the idea that countries officially receiving the Dalai Lama at the highest political level are punished through a reduction of their exports to China. However, this 'Dalai Lama Effect' is only observed for the Hu Jintao era and not for earlier periods. Furthermore, we find that this effect is mainly driven by reduced exports of machinery and transport equipment and that it disappears in the second year after a meeting took place.

A strong inverse correlation of the time required to register a property with the growth in services imports is confirmed for the OECD and middle-income countries and the growth in services exports for the low-income countries. Internet diffusion and the strength of legal rights are strongly positively correlated with services exports in the OECD countries while the strength of legal rights is also strongly positively correlated with services imports in the middle and low-income countries. The growth of world income has a strong positive effect on the growth of services exports in the OECD and middle-income countries while domestic income growth strongly impacts on the growth in services imports across the three income category of countries.

We test the sensitivity of T-Bonds on MSE on interest rate changes and determine that duration and convexity jointly are a more accurate measure as approximation of bond prices changes than duration only. Our final conclusion is that T-Bonds traded at MSE are not sensitive on interest rate changes due to institutional investors' permanent higher demand, while at the same time the market has a limited offer of risk-free instruments.","[Ivanovski, Zoran] Univ Tourism & Management Skopje, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia; [Stojanovski, Toni Draganov] Univ Informat Sci & Technol St Paul Apostle, Ohrid, Macedonia; [Ivanovska, Nadica] Cent Cooperat Bank, Skopje 1000, Macedonia",,"Ivanovski, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Tourism & Management Skopje, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia.",z.ivanovski@utms.edu.mk; toni.stojanovski@uist.edu.mk; nadica.ivanovska@ccbank.com.mk,"Ivanovski, Zoran/N-6344-2019",,,,,,9,3,3,1,14,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Bilateral cross-border M&A data for nine emerging Asian economies covering 2000-2009 are analyzed with a sample selection model and a panel data model. The estimation results show that although the banking sector still plays a crucial role in facilitating cross-border M&A, the role of equity markets has increased in importance because, in addition to cash, the issuance of common stock and the exchange of stocks have become popular forms of payment for M&A deals. Because of the relatively thin market, the primary corporate bond market plays a limited role in supporting cross-border M&A, which is in contrast to the primary public bond market. However, for the secondary market, the corporate bond market is more effective in facilitating cross-border M&A. The results also show that financial development in terms of stock and bond markets in their home countries tends to become more important when the target firms reside in more developed countries. In addition to financial development, the paper shows that most cross-border M&A are invested in technology-related and resource-based industries while cheap labor industries are relatively less attractive.","[Jongwanich, Juthathip] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Management, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand; [Brooks, Douglas H.] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City 1550, Philippines; [Kohpaiboon, Archanun] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok 10200, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology; Asian Development Bank; Thammasat University,"Jongwanich, J (通讯作者)，Asian Inst Technol, Sch Management, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand.",jjongwanich@ait.ac.th; dbrooks@adb.org; archanun@econ.tu.ac.th,,,,,,,20,13,16,1,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The promise of these indicators is that they can be used to identify specific reforms that policymakers and aid donors can target in their efforts to improve the regulatory and institutional environment. Doing so, however, requires evidence on the partial effects of the many specific policy choices reflected in such datasets. In this paper we use Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to document the cross-country partial correlations between detailed policy indicators and several measures of regulatory and institutional outcomes. We find major instability in the set of policy indicators identified by BMA as important partial correlates of similar outcomes: specific policy indicators that matter for one outcome are, on average, not important correlates of other closely-related outcomes. This finding illustrates the difficulties in using highly-specific policy indicators to identify reform priorities using cross-country data.","[Kraay, Aart] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Tawara, Norikazu] Akita Int Univ, Akita 0101292, Japan",The World Bank; Akita International University,"Kraay, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",akraay@worldbank.org; ntawara@aiu.ac.jp,,,,,,,25,9,9,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

China, as the largest re-importer, has imported more from itself than from the U.S. since 2005. As the first empirical study on re-imports, this paper shows that China's re-imports are at least partially driven by the imperfection of the value-added tax (VAT) rebate policy for processing trade. In principle, firms should be able to claim input VAT credits after selling their finished products in China, or receive input VAT rebates after exporting their products. Some processing firms, however, are not qualified for the credits or rebates when selling in China; hence, they may export their products to obtain rebates. Some downstream processing firms can benefit from re-importing these products duty-free as inputs because they cannot obtain the rebates when buying inputs in China even after exporting their final goods.

We show that under an open access resource regime: i) a resource-rich, capital-poor economy may experience a natural resource curse phase and under certain conditions, may even follow a non-sustainable path leading to complete natural resource depletion; ii) a labor inflow results in a higher steady-state per capita income, with unchanged natural resources, though it makes the economy more prone to reach a path that converges to resource collapse; iii) the introduction of a small import tariff or export tax results in larger steady-state natural resources and commodity output and renders the economy less vulnerable to resource collapse. We also contrast the open access case with the other polar case of perfect property rights, showing that in this case the economy experiences neither a resource curse nor a resource collapse.

The number of electrified villages (an indicator of economic progress) is statistically significant, showing that economic progress has a positive impact on electricity demand.

We find that it explains relatively little in terms of firm performance, but it does explain some of the differences between firms in Russia's Far East and the rest of Russia. Firms that have always been in private ownership perform better than state-owned firms. While management practices may not yet affect firm performance in a measurable way, they may do so in the future. This conjecture motivates us to look at the determinants of firms' adoption of good management practices. We find that market pressure, both in the product and the labour market, has some impact on adoption of management practices, in particular in the Far East. It thus appears that the economy in Russia's Far East may function according to different rules than in the rest of Russia, as market forces seem to be stronger there, in particular, because the Far East is more exposed to foreign competition than the rest of Russia.","[Schweiger, Helena] European Bank Reconstruct & Dev, London EC2A 2JN, England; [Friebel, Guido] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Friebel, Guido] CEPR, London, England; [Friebel, Guido] IZA, Bonn, Germany",European Bank of Reconstructon & Development; Goethe University Frankfurt; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Schweiger, H (通讯作者)，European Bank Reconstruct & Dev, 1 Exchange Sq, London EC2A 2JN, England.",schweigh@ebrd.com; gfriebel@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,21,6,6,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

However, in the existing empirical literature these phenomena are mainly studied in isolation from each other. Therefore, using SOEP panel data for the years 1984-2007, this study offers an integrated investigation of the implications of these three phenomena for the dynamics of individual life satisfaction. I focus on the short and long-run effects of income and social reference income, but I control for similar dynamics with respect to a large set of control variables. GMM estimates for instrumented income variables in an error-correction model indicate an insignificant future income effect, a significant and positive current income effect, and an insignificant long-run income effect on life satisfaction with significant hedonic adaptation. Social reference income has a significant, negative and strong impact in the long run, but not in the short run. Consequently, increasing own income and reference income by the same percentage tends to have an insignificant effect in the long term, but a significant and positive effect in the short term. Adaptation to an income shock and reinforcement of a reference income shock take place for more than 90% within three years. On the basis of these results a more comprehensive explanation of the Easterlin Paradox than those given in the literature is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Constant turnover between long-time traders and newcomers in market activities, combined with restricted trading opportunities, introduces a feedback from the stock market to real activity, making stock prices non-redundant for the business cycle. We show that strict inflation targeting can lead to equilibrium indeterminacy, even if the policy rule satisfies the Taylor principle. A belief-driven shock to stock price generates relative volatilities of key financial variables which are very close to what is observed in U.S. data. This result hints to the possibility that the financial instability witnessed since the mid-to-late 1990s was the result of waves of (rational) exuberance and pessimism in financial markets. Our analysis suggests that a mild response to stock prices in the central bank's policy rule can restore equilibrium determinacy and therefore rule out non-fundamental volatility.

This paper considers by far the largest firm level dataset (more than 90,000 firms) used by any study on the spillover effects of FDI. The main novelty of the paper is the explicit control for various sources of firm heterogeneity when accounting for different effects of FDI on firm performance. This work shows that the heterogeneity of firms in terms of absorptive capacity, size, productivity and technology levels affect the results. Controlling for these variables leads to some interesting results, which contrast with the previous empirical work in the field. We find that horizontal spillovers have become increasingly important over the last decade, and they may even become more important than vertical spillovers. Positive horizontal spillovers are equally distributed across size classes of firms, while negative horizontal spillovers seem to be more likely to accrue to smaller firms. Moreover, positive horizontal spillovers seem more likely to be present in medium or high productivity firms with higher absorptive capacities, while negative horizontal spillovers are more likely to affect low to medium productivity firms. These findings suggest that both direct effects from foreign ownership as well as the spillovers from foreign firms substantially depend on the absorptive capacity and productivity level of individual firms. In addition, these results show that foreign presence may also affect smaller firms to a larger extent than larger firms, but this impact may be in either direction.

I find a fall in the Catholic population compensated by increases in non-Catholic participation and nonaffiliation. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the scandal generated about $3 billion dollars in donations to non-Catholic faiths. Those leaving Catholicism frequently chose dissimilar alternatives: Baptist churches gained significantly while the Episcopal Church did not. These results challenge several theories of religiosity and suggest that policies or shocks specific to one religious group could have effects on other groups.,"[Hungerman, Daniel M.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Hungerman, Daniel M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Notre Dame; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hungerman, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, 439 Flanner Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",dhungerm@nd.edu,,,,,,,79,23,33,0,10,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

Targeting interventions to achieve this goal is important because institutions have limited resources and would thus require to know how best to deploy these resources to combat poverty. The relationship between gender and poverty may indicate a targeting strategy for poverty reduction. However, empirical evidences are quite equivocal. This study therefore sought to determine if FHHs are poorer than MHHs in Nigeria using wealth index as a poverty measure. We analysed the household data from the last Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (2008 NDHS) which is a nationally representative survey of 34,070 households in the country. Using binary logistic regression for our multivariate analysis, we found FHHs less likely to be poor than MHHs contrary to the claim in the 2008 NDHS Report. We therefore suggest that without neglecting FHHs, poverty-reduction interventions should be focussed more on MHHs which are more predominant in the country in order to reach more of the poor in the country.

The solution of this program shows that the equilibrium value of the equity risk premium - the latter being measured by the difference between the expected equity portfolio return and the risk-free interest rate - is given by the product of the price of risk by the expected variance of stock returns. When returns are predictable, these two magnitudes are both time-varying and horizon-dependent. In accordance with this theoretical framework, our paper presents an econometric model of the equity risk premia for two traditional horizons: the one-period-ahead horizon (i.e. the 'short-term' premium) and the infinite-time horizon (i.e. the 'long-term' premium). Using annual US secular data from 1871 to 2008, and representing the expected returns by mixing the three traditional adaptive, extrapolative and regressive processes, large disparities in the dynamics of the two premia are evidenced. Concerning the determination of the equilibrium values of the two premia, the expected variances depend on the past values of the centered squared returns while the prices of risk (unobservable variables) are estimated according to the Kalman filter methodology, which enables us to capture the influence of hidden variables and of non-directly measurable psychological effects. A spread of interest rates adds to this determination. Possibly due to risky arbitrage and transaction costs, the results show that observed premia gradually converge towards their equilibrium values, this process being described by an error correction model. Overall, our model provides a rather satisfactory representation of 'short-term' and 'long-term' premia. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

What caused this trend? We develop a model of human capital accumulation that features a nondegenerate distribution of educational attainment in the population. We use this framework to assess the quantitative contribution of technological progress and changes in life expectancy in explaining the evolution of educational attainment. The model implies an increase in average years of schooling of 24%, which is the increase observed in the data. We find that technological variables and in particular skill-biased technical change represent the most important factors in accounting for the increase in educational attainment. The strong response of schooling to changes in income is informative about the potential role of educational policy and the impact of other trends affecting lifetime income.","Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Toronto; University of Southern California,"Vandenbroucke, G (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, 3260S,Vermont Ave,KAP 300, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",vandenbr@usc.edu,"; Vandenbroucke, Guillaume/I-5754-2016","Restuccia, Diego/0000-0002-4072-8712; Vandenbroucke, Guillaume/0000-0003-4056-3177",,,,,30,21,29,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

The study reports that Brazil, India, Russia, China and South Africa are strongly hit by the contagion shock during the Eurozone crisis period. However, Indonesia and South Korea report only interdependence and not contagion.

While household income inequality remained stable, farm income inequality increased during this period. Estimated Gini elasticities show that household income inequality is reduced by off-farm income and direct payments but is increased by market income. Both, the introduction of area-based direct payments in 1992 and the abandonment of farm household payments in 1999 have regional different effects. Agricultural policy should opt for measures that comply with regional requirements, as current direct payments cannot avoid that income from farming is drifting further apart.

This study conducts a structural analysis and suggests that institutional factors, particularly, a social insurance or safety net system and an employment-based health insurance system, can account for this puzzling finding. A dynamic equilibrium model is built that combines these two institutions with heterogeneous agents making endogenous decisions regarding saving, the labor supply and health insurance when they are young. The model, in which agents save in a precautionary manner, can generate Starr-McCluer's empirical finding. The result implies that Starr-McCluer's results are not inconsistent with the standard theory of saving under uncertainty, but it does indicate that the standard saving regression model is unable to reveal the precautionary saving motive.

Unfortunately, estimation routines for the long-term and short-term seasonal pattern are usually quite sensitive to extreme observations, known as electricity price spikes. Improved robustness of the model can be achieved by (a) filtering the data with some reasonable procedure for outlier detection, and then (b) using estimation and testing procedures on the filtered data. In this paper we examine the effects of different treatments of extreme observations on model estimation and on determining the number of spikes (outliers). In particular we compare results for the estimation of the seasonal and stochastic components of electricity spot prices using either the original or filtered data. We find significant evidence for a superior estimation of both the seasonal short-term and long-term components when the data have been treated carefully for outliers. Overall, our findings point out the substantial impact the treatment of extreme observations may have on these issues and, therefore, also on the pricing of electricity derivatives like futures and option contracts. An added value of our study is the ranking of different filtering techniques used in the energy economics literature, suggesting which methods could be and which should not be used for spike identification.

Whether customization choices are made simultaneously or sequentially is endogenously determined. Specifically, the customization stage of the game involves two periods. Each firm either selects its product type in period 1 or postpones this decision to period 2. We show that customization by one or both firms occurs only if the quality difference is sufficiently large. Flexibility of timing in the customization stage sometimes enables the firms to achieve an outcome that is Pareto superior to that if they were constrained to simultaneous customization choices. Although the high quality firm is more likely to customize, in some circumstances the low quality firm can obtain an advantage by becoming the first and only firm to adopt customization.

The link among inequality change, re-ranking of individuals and income growth is explained by isolating the source and subgroup contributions to the determinants of the inequality change over time. We show that the poverty change over time depends on the re-ranking of individuals and the change in relative disparities among poverty gaps. These determinants of the change in poverty inequality are then decomposed by source and subgroup, yielding a three-way decomposition which combines time, source and subgroup ways of decomposing.

The distinction between tradable and nontradable goods is key to understand real exchange rate fluctuations, but the introduction of distribution costs is not. Nontradable sector technology shocks explain about one third of real exchange rate volatility.

In addition, we account for oil prices in this model. The liquidity measures exhibit a persistent (highly autocorrelated) pattern. The intensity of trading appears to be relevant for the interrelationships of the liquidity measures. Stocks that are traded more often seem to be less sensitive to changes in liquidity. The main contribution of this study is that we introduce and test a specific causality pattern between trading activity, price impact, and spreads of energy stocks.

How can this be explained? Besides the obvious ease of computation, there are three good reasons for the persistence of VCS. (1) The Willig bounds on VCS usually give close upper and lower bounds on CV and EV, respectively, and are thus conservative in the estimation of EV.

In this paper we consider why firms sometimes prefer external to in-house development for their inventions, despite the costs of contracting and the risks of opportunistic behaviour and expropriation. We model the determinants of firms' choice of development pathway for their inventions using survey data from over 2,600 Australian inventions. Our results indicate that firms pursue collaborative development strategies in response to perceived project-level risk about the technical feasibility of the invention. Our findings also confirm that small to medium size enterprises; highly leveraged large firms; and firms with less experience patenting are more likely to pursue an external development strategy.","[Thomson, Russell; Webster, Elizabeth] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Thomson, Russell; Webster, Elizabeth] Univ Melbourne, IPRIA, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Thomson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",e.webster@unimelb.edu.au,"; Webster, Elizabeth M./C-2406-2019","Thomson, Russell/0000-0002-1359-7542; Webster, Elizabeth M./0000-0002-1030-9357",,,,,52,7,7,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In a baseline estimation, I find that the approach of Acemoglu et al. (2001) overestimates the importance of institutions for economic growth by 28 %, as a country's natural disease environment affected settler mortality during colonization and also has a direct impact on prosperity. The approach of La Porta et al.

Moreover, the benefits to the firm of matching are relatively small: profits are predicted to increase by only 2.3%, 4% if we restrict attention to cases where matching is possible.

Individual actions depend both on conscious deliberation and on a type reflecting unconscious drives. Temptations yield consumption value, but confidence in being the type of person who resists temptations yields self-esteem. We identify conditions for individuals to build an introspective reputation for goodness (moral capital) and for good actions to lead to a stronger disposition to do good. Bad actions destroy moral capital and lock-in further wrongdoing. Economic shocks that result in higher temptations have long-lasting effects on wrongdoing. We show how optimal deterrence can change under endogenous moral costs and how wrongdoing can be compounded as high temptation activities attract individuals with low moral capital.","[Dal Bo, Ernesto] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tervio, Marko] Aalto Univ, Aalto, Finland; [Tervio, Marko] HECER, Helsinki, Finland",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Aalto University,"Dal Bó, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dalbo@haas.berkeley.edu; marko.tervio@aalto.fi,,,,,,,44,16,17,2,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The empirical analysis pointed on the existence of large differences in the level of implementation of flexicurity policies across EU Member States, by which the least successful are NMS, especially with regard to active labour market and lifelong learning programs. As regards the relation between flexicurity variables and productivity growth, panel regression estimates showed that active labour market policies and participation in lifelong learning programs have a statistically significant positive association with labour and total factor productivity growth.

Participants receive a die which they roll privately. Since their payoff depends on the reported roll of the die, the subjects have an incentive to be dishonest and report higher numbers to get a higher payoff. This design has three advantages. First, cheating cannot be detected on the individual level, which reduces potential demand effects. Second, the method is very easy to implement. Third, the underlying true distribution of the outcome under full honesty is known, and hence it is possible to test different theoretical predictions. We find that about 20% of inexperienced subjects lie to the fullest extent possible while 39% of subjects are fully honest. In addition, a high share of subjects consists of partial liars; these subjects lie, but do not report the payoff-maximizing draw.

At the same time, it also built a multi-billion-dollar business empire for the elite class connected to the presidential palace. The increasingly arrogant and violent oppression by the state security apparatus ultimately sparked the revolutionary slogans demanding freedom, jobs, and dignity. This paper argues that little progress has been made to satisfy those demands because the transition governments (and opposition parties) have failed to put forward an alternative economic program to remedy the negative economic consequences of neoliberalism. Focusing exclusively on Tunisia and Egypt, this paper uncovers the neoliberal roots of economic inequality and socio-economic exclusion that have led to the uprisings. It further suggests that the original institutionalist theory of institutional adjustment provides the most adequate framework for achieving the ultimate goals of the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings. Finally, this paper concludes by outlining the institutional prerequisites for a successful transition to a post-neoliberal system in Tunisia and Egypt.","Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA",University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Kaboub, F (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",,,,,,,,25,17,19,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The results show that PBoC is constrained by the costs of its monetary policy instruments. PBoC tend to use less costly but market-distorting instruments such as the deposit interest rate cap and reserve-ratio requirements, rather than more market-oriented but more costly instruments such as central bank note issuance. These costs remain under control today, but may rise in the future as PBoC accumulates more foreign assets. This, in turn, will jeopardize the Chinese monetary authority's capability to maintain price stability. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We find that these alleged barriers indeed have significantly negative impacts on cross-border portfolio investment in East Asian economies. In addition, we find some support for the pecking order hypothesis in barriers on cross-border portfolio investment in the sense that barriers on post-trading efficiency and cost barriers are not effective unless barriers on market access are significantly lowered.","[Park, Daekeun] Hanyang Univ, Coll Econ & Finance, Seoul 133791, South Korea; [Shin, Inseok] Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Hanyang University; Chung Ang University,"Shin, I (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",parkdk@hanyang.ac.kr; ishin@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,37,1,2,1,19,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

No other member of the institutionalist group was as much involved in the professional discussion of institutional economics as J.M. Clark. In addition, Clark made a number of key contributions to institutionalist theory in the areas of psychology and economics, the costs of decision-making, overhead costs and business-pricing behavior, the accelerator mechanism and business cycles, workable and effective competition and competition policy, and social control. These contributions, together with the graduate students he trained at the University of Chicago and Columbia University, serve to place him in the center of the institutionalist movement and not on its periphery.","Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Rutherford, M (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",,,,,,,,45,1,3,0,10,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

A Kaleckian/Institutionalist Perspective,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES,,,English,Article,,,,,,budgetary austerity; full employment; government as employer of last resort,LAST RESORT,"Western economies have undergone a significant transformation over the last half a century as they have moved away from a commitment to full employment, going from activist fiscal policy to its abandonment with the adoption of budgetary austerity. This is not because of any technical or physical incapacity to achieve full employment. Analyzing the broad macroeconomic experience of Canada and the United States in the post- WWII era, the article finds that this growing unemployment has essentially resulted from a deliberate policy choice not to stimulate sufficiently demand via fiscal measures. Learning from the experience of the Great Depression, Michal Kalecki had offered an explanation for this type of policy response in favor of rising long-term unemployment. This article recognizes the relevance and appropriateness of Kalecki's analysis and seeks to determine whether the Minskian institutional proposal for achieving effective full employment (via government as the employer of last resort) would withstand an original Kaleckian critique.","Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Seccareccia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,,,,,,17,8,9,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Results confirm there are strong negative effects of liability euroisation on both investment and sales. Negative balance sheet effects and very small positive competitiveness effects are found as well, adding up to a negative overall exchange rate depreciation effect on sectoral performance.

The disparity in wages between primary and secondary workers, according to labour market segmentation theory, is not provided by worker characteristics, but rather by job characteristics. A standard way to assess this situation is by looking at the estimated coefficients in a standard regression for comparable workers across different labour market segments. In an attempt to avoid arbitrary modelling choices, we deploy mixture regression methods which allow for endogenous determination of the number of existing labour market segments. Using Italian data, our modelling strategy outlines stark differences in returns to human capital between homogeneous workers in different markets. Thus, future policies should consider these findings when implementing labour market measures.","[Battisti, Michele] Univ Palermo, I-90134 Palermo, Italy; [Battisti, Michele] Univ Luiss Guido Carli, Rome, Italy",University of Palermo; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Battisti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Studi Polit Diritto & Soc, Piazza Bologni 8, I-90134 Palermo, Italy.",michele.battisti@unipa.it,,"BATTISTI, Michele/0000-0003-3137-0373",,,,,51,1,2,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Using data for 207 banks across 10 Central and Eastern European countries, this paper empirically analyzes the disciplining role of interbank deposits. We find that market discipline has been effective in Central and Eastern Europe since the implementation of explicit deposit insurance. However, several factors affect the strength of this discipline. State-owned banks are not disciplined probably because they benefit from implicit insurance. Institutional and legal factors, and resolution strategies adopted by countries during banking crises also impact bank risk and the effectiveness of market discipline. Our results indicate that stronger regulatory discipline reduces risk but also weakens market discipline. Journal of Comparative Economics 41 (2) (2013) 544-560.

To measure these costs, we suggest using a new measure of linguistic distance. The Levenshtein distance is an easily computed and transparent approach of including linguistic distance into econometric applications. We show its merits in two different applications. First, the effect of linguistic distance in the language acquisition of immigrants is analyzed using data from the 2000 US Census, the German Socio-Economic Panel, and the National Immigrant Survey of Spain. Across countries, linguistic distance is negatively correlated with reported language skills of immigrants. Second, applying a gravity model to data on international trade flows covering 178 countries and 52 years, it is shown that linguistic distance has a strong negative influence on bilateral trade volumes.","[Isphording, Ingo Eduard; Otten, Sebastian] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, D-44780 Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Isphording, IE (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",ingo.isphording@rub.de,,"Otten, Sebastian/0000-0002-4714-7806",,,,,35,67,78,3,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We use a CES-impact function to identify the main channels of influence of the elasticity of substitution on the behavior in and the outcome of such a contest. We characterize the Nash equilibria of this game and carry out comparative-static exercises with respect to the elasticity of substitution among group members' efforts. If groups are homogeneous (i.e. all group members have the same valuation and efficiency within the group), the elasticity of substitution has no effect on the equilibrium. For heterogeneous groups, the higher the cornplementarity of efforts of that group, the lower the divergence of efforts among group members and the lower the winning probability of that group. This contradicts the common intuition that groups can improve their performance by solving the free-rider problem via higher degrees of complementarity of efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The investor's preferences are represented by the recursive multiple priors utility model developed by Chen and Epstein (2002). The investor's utility depends on both intermediate consumption and terminal wealth. Under the assumption of complete markets, I use the martingale method to solve the dynamic optimization problem in continuous time. I find that ambiguity can decrease the optimal consumption-to-wealth ratio, the intertemporal hedging demand and the optimal portfolio allocation, but magnifies the importance of hedging demand in the optimal portfolio allocation. In addition, ambiguity also increases riskless savings.","Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Liu, HN (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Hening.Liu@mbs.ac.uk,,"Liu, Hening/0000-0002-4982-9595",,,,,25,1,2,0,12,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Personal relationships with the performing arts industry make one more likely to attend as well as to attend more frequently.

Within this framework, we solve for the Nash equilibrium values of the migration policy instruments and compare them, to the extent possible, with the ones that emerge in a cooperative setting.","[Djajic, Slobodan] Grad Inst, Dept Econ, Geneva, Switzerland; [Michael, Michael S.] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus,"Djajic, S (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Dept Econ, Geneva, Switzerland.",slobodandjajic@yahoo.com,,"Michael, Michael/0000-0002-7642-1261",,,,,39,6,6,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Assuming constant human capital elasticities, human capital investment should be efficient under optimal linear policies, whether general equilibrium effects are present or not. Hence, education subsidies should not be used for distributional reasons. Due to general equilibrium effects, optimal linear income taxes may even become negative. Optimal non-linear policies exploit general equilibrium effects for redistribution. The high-skilled type optimally has a negative marginal income tax rate and a positive marginal education subsidy. The low-skilled type optimally faces a positive marginal income tax rate and a marginal tax on education. Simulations demonstrate that general equilibrium effects have only a modest effect on optimal non-linear policies.","[Jacobs, Bas] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Dept Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Jacobs, Bas] Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Jacobs, Bas] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Jacobs, Bas] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Tilburg University; Ifo Institut,"Jacobs, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Dept Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bjacobs@ese.eur.nl,,,,,,,39,4,5,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Although the decentralized regime gives rise to a tax-interaction effect, which induces policymakers to set lax environmental policies, it may also reduce the political pressure on enlarging allowed emissions. If the latter outweighs the former, then the decentralized regime will generate less pollution than the centralized regime. Moreover, we also show that the decentralized regime can be more efficient than the centralized regime, which provides an alternative theoretical support for the superiority of environmental federalism.","Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Taipei 11605, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Lai, YB (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Publ Finance, 64,Sect 2,ZhiNan Rd, Taipei 11605, Taiwan.",yblai@nccu.edu.tw,,"Lai, Yu-Bong/0000-0001-7032-8245",,,,,28,2,2,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In this paper, we provide a theory for how aspiring entrepreneurs choose an employer. We contrast 'transparent' employers (or firms) promoting personal accountability and employee empowerment with 'opaque' employers emphasizing team work and down-playing individual accomplishment. Markets use transparent firms' output to a larger extent to update employees' reputation since this output is more informative about individual talent. This has three effects. First, it harms employees who could become entrepreneurs if their reputation was maintained, but benefits the others. Second, it fosters effort, which raises wages, and thus the financial capital available to start a venture. Third, the perspective of entrepreneurship can induce employees to exert excessive effort, an effect that transparency exacerbates. We show that intermediate-reputation employees choose opaque firms, whereas higher- and lower-reputation employees choose transparent firms. Empirical implications follow.","[Loss, Frederic] Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Lab Econometrie, LIRSA, F-75003 Paris, France; [Renucci, Antoine] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, CREG, F-64010 Pau, France; [Renucci, Antoine] Univ Paris 09, Chaire Finance Entreprise, F-75775 Paris 16, France",heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM); Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Loss, F (通讯作者)，Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Lab Econometrie, LIRSA, Rue Conte, F-75003 Paris, France.",frederic.loss@cnam.fr,,,,,,,70,1,2,1,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

It turns out that the relative efficiency of these instruments depends, in general, on details. However, moderate standards are preferable to no environmental policy and tight (but not too tight) standards dominate liability. This provides under the given assumptions (neighborhood externalities, incomplete contracts) a justification for sensible standards for three reasons. First, unilateral allocations of property rights are biased that distort allocations even if ex post bargaining takes place. Second, a standard is superior in the following sense: if it is set equal to the outcome under any allocation of rights, it will be improved in the process of ex post bargaining. Third, unilateral property rights encourage strategic ex ante investments up to the point that committing to no bargaining would be beneficial (if possible).","Univ Vienna, Ctr Business Studies, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Wirl, F (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Ctr Business Studies, Brunnerstr 72, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",franz.wirl@univie.ac.at,"Wirl, Franz/P-2861-2019","Wirl, Franz/0000-0002-2168-8049",,,,,43,0,0,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We consider four possibilities: long-run equilibrium where varieties of producer services are non-traded, long-run equilibrium where varieties of producer services are traded, short-run equilibrium where varieties of producer services are non-traded and short-run equilibrium where varieties of producer services are traded. It is shown that in each case, under certain conditions, international outsourcing can increase skilled-unskilled wage inequality. In the first three cases, outsourcing affects wage inequality directly as well as indirectly. In the short-run equilibrium, where varieties of producer services are traded, international outsourcing increases skilled-unskilled wage inequality only through an indirect channel. In the short-run equilibrium, where all goods are traded, the impact of outsourcing on wage inequality depends solely on the relative size of the income share of capital. Furthermore, in the long-run equilibrium, outsourcing increases the productivity of the industrial sector. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In models that admit multiple steady states, the sign of the slope of the excess demand function is positive for some steady states and negative for others. To obtain stationarity of the net foreign asset position under incomplete financial markets I introduce the stationary inducing devices analyzed in Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003) and Ghironi (2006). For portfolio costs, a debt-elastic interest rate, or an overlapping generations framework the equilibrium dynamics around a steady state are unbounded if the excess demand function for the foreign traded good is increasing in the good's own price. Otherwise the dynamics are bounded and locally unique. By contrast, with Uzawa-type preferences, the equilibrium dynamics around a steady state are shown to be bounded and locally unique irrespective of the sign of the slope of the excess demand function.

Our analytical model shows that initial labor market rigidities in theory provide some scope for such a double dividend. However, the practical outcome of renewable energy promotion might be sobering. Our computable general equilibrium analysis of subsidized electricity production from renewable energy sources (RES-E) in Germany suggests that the prospects for employment and welfare gains are quite limited and hinge crucially on the level of the subsidy rate and the financing mechanism. If RES-E subsidies are financed by labor taxes, welfare and employment effects are strictly negative for a broad range of subsidy rates. The use of an electricity tax to fund RES-E subsidies generates minor benefits for small subsidy rates but these benefits quickly turn into significant losses as the subsidy rate exceeds some threshold value.

However, little quantitative evidence on its effect on economic development is known for the period before the twentieth century even though some stories exist about their effect on the Golden Age. Applying a VAR analysis on a new dataset on migration and growth for the period 1570-1800, we find that migration had a positive effect on factor accumulation during the whole period, and a positive direct effect on the per capita income during the Golden Age. This seems to confirm those studies that claim that the Dutch economy during its Golden Age at least partially benefitted from immigration.","[Foldvari, Peter; van Leeuwen, Bas; van Zanden, Jan Luiten] Univ Utrecht, Econ & Social Hist Dept, NL-3512 BS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Foldvari, Peter] Univ Debrecen, H-4012 Debrecen, Hungary; [van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [van Zanden, Jan Luiten] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",Utrecht University; University of Debrecen; University of Warwick; University of Groningen,"van Leeuwen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Econ & Social Hist Dept, Drift 17, NL-3512 BS Utrecht, Netherlands.",bas.vanleeuwen1@googlemail.com,"Foldvari, Peter/AAW-9861-2021","Foldvari, Peter/0000-0003-4557-8810; van Leeuwen, Bas/0000-0001-7817-5298",,,,,19,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2013,161.0,1,,,,,1,18,,10.1007/s10645-012-9197-6,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,096VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315432900001,0

Our results are, first, that a rise in the inflation rate or the Leading Index makes a hawkish speech more likely. Second, when Fed presidents make a speech in their home district, its content is influenced by both regional and national macroeconomic variables, whereas speeches given outside the home district are influenced solely by national information. Third, the influence of regional variables increases during (i) Ben Bernanke's tenure as Fed Chairman, (ii) recessions, and (iii) the financial crisis.

We find that this shock causes selection and reallocation at both firm and product levels and that its impact is highly heterogeneous at the intensive and extensive margins. Sales of smaller plants and more marginal products are compressed and are more likely to cease, whereas those of larger plants and core products seem relatively impervious to the shock. This implies a reallocation in terms of market shares within firms and between firms. We also show that the impact of expanded access to cheaper Chinese intermediate inputs has a similar effect, with larger plants benefiting more from the availability of cheaper imported inputs.

Implications for energy and climate policy in the United States,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fuel economy standard; Climate policy; Vehicles; CGE modeling,,"The United States has adopted fuel economy standards that require increases in the on-road efficiency of new passenger vehicles, with the goal of reducing petroleum use and (more recently) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Understanding the cost and effectiveness of fuel economy standards, alone and in combination with economy-wide policies that constrain GHG emissions, is essential to inform coordinated design of future climate and energy policy. We use a computable general equilibrium model, the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, to investigate the effect of combining a fuel economy standard with an economy-wide GHG emissions constraint in the United States. First, a fuel economy standard is shown to be at least six to fourteen times less cost effective than a price instrument (fuel tax) when targeting an identical reduction in cumulative gasoline use. Second, when combined with a cap-and-trade (CAT) policy, a binding fuel economy standard increases the cost of meeting the GHG emissions constraint by forcing expensive reductions in passenger vehicle gasoline use, displacing more cost-effective abatement opportunities. Third, the impact of adding a fuel economy standard to the CAT policy depends on the availability and cost of abatement opportunities in transport if advanced biofuels provide a cost-competitive, low carbon alternative to gasoline, the fuel economy standard does not bind and the use of low carbon fuels in passenger vehicles makes a significantly larger contribution to GHG emissions abatement relative to the case when biofuels are not available. This analysis underscores the potentially large costs of a fuel economy standard relative to alternative policies aimed at reducing petroleum use and GHG emissions. It further emphasizes the need to consider sensitivity to vehicle technology and alternative fuel availability and costs as well as economy-wide responses when forecasting the energy, environmental, and economic outcomes of policy combinations.

Secondly, we explore the strategic interactions of output, R&D investment and social welfare respectively in the mixed duopoly with a labor-managed and a profit-maximizing firms. Finally we analyze the effects of absorptive capacity on output decision, strategic investment decision and social welfare respectively. The research suggests that labor-managed firms employ less workers and produce less outputs while they invest more in R&D than that of profit-maximizing firms. Whether the effect of absorptive capacity increases R&D investment of labor-managed firms or not depends on the returns to scale.

The working premise is that debt has negative effects on growth, mainly because it stimulates consumption spending that ultimately crowds out capital accumulation. Since this is a controversial viewpoint among Keynesian economists, the paper first provides an impressionistic survey of empirical evidence that supports the working premise before turning to a family of two-class growth models in the Kaldor-Pasinetti tradition that provide a theoretical environment conducive to gaining a deeper understanding of the burden of debt, both across overlapping generations of workers and across social classes. These models show how public debt can have regressive effects on the distribution of income and wealth as well as negative effects on growth. The policy implication is that fiscal consolidation needs to address these regressive effects, thus shifting the conversation away from the productivity-based narrative associated with neoclassical theory to a distributional narrative in the classical and Keynesian traditions.","Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Michl, TR (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",tmichl@colgate.edu,,,,,,,48,5,6,2,17,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The results suggest that the Fisher hypothesis is the least likely to violate RIP, whereas uncovered interest parity (UIP) appears to be most commonly violated. Stability tests suggest that the RIP relationship has been stable in most cases and that the impact of the Asian crisis and the Plaza Accord appears to be transitory, and that the RIP relationships have strengthened in the aftermath of the 1997-1998 Asian crisis.","Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ & Finance, Hawally 32093, Kuwait",Gulf University for Science & Technology (GUST),"Nusair, SA (通讯作者)，Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ & Finance, POB 7207, Hawally 32093, Kuwait.",salnusair@yahoo.com,"Nusair, Salah A/J-1274-2019","Nusair, Salah A/0000-0002-9601-5164",,,,,51,1,1,0,9,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

It is still largely unclear what this concept implies for the task of assessing welfare (and, correspondingly, the need for and the scope of policy making) in a novelty-generating, knowledge-based economy. Is novelty desirable per se? Is a rise of living standards due to innovation always worth the risks involved? Standard welfare economics is inherently incapable of answering these questions. By examining Joseph Schumpeter's explicit and implicit reasoning on welfare and linking his thoughts to recent ideas, within normative economics, on how to redefine owell-being' when preferences are variable and inconsistent, we argue that in an evolving economy, well-being should not be conceptualised in static preference-satisfaction terms, but rather in partly procedural terms of oeffective preference learning'.","Max Planck Inst Econ, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Schubert, C (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",schubert@econ.mpg.de,,"Schubert, Christian/0000-0002-2578-0109",,,,,88,17,19,1,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

At the core of our analysis is the distinction between wage-led and profit-led demand regimes. The Kaleckian tradition in macroeconomics asserts that a higher wage share will have expansionary effects. Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) generalize the model by allowing for classical mechanisms. The paper presents a two-country short run model to clarify the key concepts surrounding a wage-led vs a profit-led demand regime. It distinguishes carefully between partial and total effects and it analyses demand regimes with respect to national as well as international changes in the wage share. We also review the empirical literature. Our reading is that the available evidence indicates that demand in most economies is domestically wage-led. Changes in functional income distribution also have supply-side effects. Available evidence suggests that higher wage growth induces higher productivity growth. Neoliberalism resulted in an increase in inequality and a decline in the wage share, but growth has nowhere been based on the profit-led growth process. Rather neoliberalism has given rise to either debt-led or export-led growth regimes. The paper concludes by outlining a wage-led growth strategy and by discussing its limitations.","[Stockhammer, Engelbert] Univ Kingston, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Onaran, Ozlem] Univ Greenwich, London SE18 6PF, England",University of Greenwich,"Stockhammer, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kingston, Kingston, ON, Canada.",,"Stockhammer, Engelbert/M-1744-2019","Stockhammer, Engelbert/0000-0002-5329-3535; Onaran, Ozlem/0000-0002-6345-9922",,,,,69,34,38,1,22,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Comparing the changes between the municipalities that created a SEZ in earlier rounds and those in later waves, I find that the SEZ program increases foreign direct investment not merely through firm relocation, and does not crowd out domestic investment. With dense investment in the targeted municipality the SEZ achieves agglomeration economies and generates wage increases for workers more than the increase in the local cost of living. The effects are heterogeneous: for zones created later the benefits are smaller while the distortions in firm location behavior are larger than those for the early zones. Municipalities with multiple SEZs experience larger effects than those with only one SEZ. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although males outperform females in the first period contest, we find no evidence of a male advantage in subsequent periods. Females even outperform males in later periods.

Endogenous variety adoption by firms raises average productivity and provides diversification benefits against variety-specific shocks. Firm-level and aggregate volatility thus decline as a by-product of the development process.

Contrary to studies in the United States and Canada (Magat and Viscusi, 1990; Laplante and Rilstone, 1996), and previous studies in China (Dasgupta et al., 2001), we find that inspections increase plants' self-reported pollution by 3.45%. We provide a model to analyze plants' strategic reactions to the pollution levy regulation in China. The model concludes that under the specific regulation, plants' actual pollution might increase with inspections. Our study provides a key policy implication that inspections by environmental authorities in China are effective for verifying plants' self-reported pollution but not for reducing their pollution.

The theorem states that the solution of a social planner's problem with the social welfare weights proportional to the inverse of the private shadow prices of externalities in an auxiliary Nash equilibrium is the Lindahl equilibrium without transfers. To verify the theorem constructively, an algorithm for finding the Lindahl equilibrium is developed.

The second experiment was conducted to test a scale that combines verbal expressions with numerical and graphical interpretations: a composite scale. The results of the study can be summarized in three key findings. First, the polychotomous choice method generates a higher proportion of 'yes' responses than the conventional dichotomous choice elicitation format. Second, the composite scale generates a significantly higher proportion of certain responses.

The manufacturer produces and sells a product at wholesale price to the retailer who in turn distributes it to consumers with retail price. The market demand is simultaneously affected by retail price, brand advertising of the manufacturer, and local advertising of the retailer. A Cobb-Douglas demand function is used to demonstrate the relationship between the parameters. Decision variables are two firms' prices and their advertising investments. The problem is modelled under integrated policy and Stackelberg game. Also, we examine Retail Fixed Markup (RFM) policy and investigate its performance on supply chain. Then, the solution under three policies compared by numerical study, and the Pareto-efficient strategy is derived. We found numerically that a properly designed RFM policy improves each member's profit and leads to Pareto improvement over Stackelberg policy. Besides, it improves the total supply chain's profit by 600% in average comparing to Stackelberg policy.","[Alaei, Saeed] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Azadi St Tehran, Iran; [Behravesh, Masoud] Islamic Azad Univ, Marand Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Marand, Iran; [Karegar, Nayere] Islamic Azad Univ, Marand Branch, Dept Econ, Marand, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Behravesh, M (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Marand Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Marand, Iran.",saeed.alaeii@gmail.com; behrawesh@yahoo.com; nayere.karegar@yahoo.com,"Alaei, Saeed/ABA-6178-2021","Alaei, Saeed/0000-0002-8375-1154",,,,,31,2,2,0,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

First of all, we identify political risk (PR) as any host government action and/or inaction or an action against a host government that could threaten business activities of firms; and PRA as the process of analysing and evaluating such risks. The research population will comprise a convenience sample of Czech international firms. The Information whether or not a firm has set up a PRA function will be obtained via a questionnaire survey. Previous studies aimed at PRA were concerned with firm's size, degree of internationalization, ownership and industry. By making use of firm value maximization and risk aversion and considering the rationale for risk management activities: (i) reducing the expected costs of financial distress; (ii) reducing the risk premiums payable to various partners; (iii) increasing investment possibilities; and (iv) reducing expected tax payments, we develop a number of determinants which can be employed In PRA studies; namely firms' complexity, location of subsidiaries, leverage, auditor type and investment opportunities. In addition to the above mentioned theories this concept makes use of the enterprise risk management (ERM) theory, and the determinants of the adoption of an ERM function.","[Benesova, Hana; Anchor, John R.] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Business, Dept Strategy & Mkt Queensgate, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England",University of Huddersfield,,hana.benesova@hud.ac.uk; j.r.anchor@hud.ac.uk,"Anchor, John/AFM-0328-2022","Anchor, John/0000-0003-2885-9450",,,,,22,1,1,0,12,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,36,45,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300004,0

How long does it take for the composition of government spending to change following a change in leadership? Or, do significant spending changes precede (rather than follow) elections, with incumbents using significant changes in spending composition as an electoral tool? Using a dataset we created on government expenditure composition in 71 democracies over 1972-2009, we examine the relation between elections and significant changes in the composition of government spending. We find that leaders' replacements have no significant short-run effect on expenditure composition, even after controlling for various political and economic variables. Over the medium-term leadership changes are associated with larger changes in expenditure composition, but only in developed countries. We also find that election years are associated with larger expenditure composition changes in established democracies, but not in new democracies, which were found in our previous work to increase their overall level of expenditures in election years.

The first model, originating from Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), is based on collateral constraints. The second, developed by Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997) and Bernanke et al. (1999), accentuates the role of external finance premia. We tweak the models and calibrate them in a way that allows for both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Next, we thoroughly analyze the two variants using moment matching, impulse response analysis and business cycle accounting. Overall, we find that the business cycle properties of the external finance premium framework are more in line with empirical evidence. In particular, the collateral constraint model fails to produce hump-shaped impulse responses and generates volatilities of the price of capital and rate of return on capital that are inconsistent with the data by a large margin.

The paper adopts an underlying legislative bargaining model proposed by Volden and Wiseman (2007) in which legislators with heterogeneous preferences divide a fixed budget between a public good and pork projects (local public goods). We show that voters have an incentive to strategically delegate to affect how the budget is divided at the legislative level. When voters' preferences for pork are not too strong, the incentives for strategic delegation exist to appoint representatives who will direct more money to the public good and not to pork projects. This generally results in at least as many representatives as districts that favor the public good. The comparative statics predict that when strategic delegation occurs, increasing the size of the legislature increases the fraction of the budget spent on the public good. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Many studies have been published that relate macro level determinants (such as GDP or unemployment level) with aggregated national level of SWB. There is a vast amount of economic literature which analyses few or even single demographic, socio-economic, social and attitudinal/cultural variables that influence life satisfaction at an individual level. But it is a rare case that study is done on a rich data set that includes all the aforementioned variables in a single analysis and is nationally representative. Moreover, there is no thorough analysis of micro level determinants of life satisfaction in Lithuania. The present study analyses Lithuanian data of Eurobarometer study on social capital that includes many variables that are considered by theoretical literature as likely determinants of SWB. Micro level analysis shows that most important determinants of general life satisfaction in Lithuania are satisfaction with health and financial situation. Employment status, educational level, marital status, community involvement, presence of children also tend to be significantly related to subjective wellbeing. The study also revealed that age in contrary to many previous studies should not be considered as an important determinant of SWB as its effect is explained by differences of health and financial satisfaction levels. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to reveal the nature of relations and interdependency of different variables and SWB more deeply. Further analysis of rich data sets that include many countries would also allow better understanding the influence of such variables as country development level or culture.","[Degutis, Mindaugas; Urbonavicius, Sigitas] Vilnius Univ, Sauletekio Av 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Degutis, M (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Sauletekio Av 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",mindaugas.degutis@ef.vu.lt; sigitas.urbonavicius@ef.vu.lt,"Urbonavicius, Sigitas/AAJ-5474-2020","Urbonavicius, Sigitas/0000-0003-4176-2573; Degutis, Mindaugas/0000-0001-5464-052X",,,,,44,12,12,2,30,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In particular, we explore this issue in a setting where individuals face idiosyncratic risk. Incomplete information also provides a transaction role for money so that monetary policy can be studied. While an active banking sector promotes risk sharing, we incorporate a market for equity by allowing individuals to trade capital across generations. In this manner, each asset and financial market in our model fulfills a distinct economic function. Consistent with recent empirical work, we find that the impact of access to a stock market may be indeterminate-the economy may respond with significant gains in capital accumulation and risk sharing, or there may be relatively little impact. We also show that the effects of monetary policy vary across the level of financial development. In economies with small stock markets, increasing the amount of liquidity will cause capital accumulation to decline.

The probability distribution function of a given cohort is a Poisson distribution that converges asymptotically to a normal of log size. However, due to firm entry propelled by horizontal R&D, the total distribution-i.e., when the entire population of firms is considered-is a mixture of overlapping Poisson distributions which is systematically right skewed and exhibits a fatter upper tail than the normal distribution of log size. Our theoretical results qualitatively match the empirical evidence found both for the cohort and the total distribution, and which has been presented as a challenge for theory to explain. Moreover, by obtaining a total distribution with a gradually increasing average over a long time span, the model is able to address complementary empirical evidence that points to a total distribution subtly evolving over time.","[Gil, Pedro Mazeda] Univ Porto, CEF UP, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Figueiredo, Fernanda] Univ Porto, CEAUL, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade do Porto,"Gil, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, CEF UP, Fac Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",pgil@fep.up.pt; otilia@fep.up.pt,"Gil, Pedro Mazeda/B-6850-2009","Gil, Pedro Mazeda/0000-0003-0887-5939; Figueiredo, Fernanda/0000-0003-0255-4106",,,,,43,8,8,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Among these, land reform was arguably the most important policy. Using a unique dataset of land expropriations, and a plausible exogenous variation in land concentration, this paper studies the causal effects this policy had on political support for the incumbent party in the central government. In a context where the incumbent was losing political support (and the power of the left wing was rising), municipalities affected by land reform voted by 3-5 percentage points higher for the incumbent than municipalities not affected by this process. Although it did not prevent the first democratically elected Marxist government, land reform decreased the political support for the left wing party. I discuss several theoretical mechanisms that can explain this empirical result.","[Gonzalez, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"González, F (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Econ, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",fagonza4@gmail.com,,,,,,,88,6,6,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

However, the lengthy discussions concerning the text of the aforementioned Regulations indicate that different actors conceive efficiency and tools how it can be achieved by using the EU funding differently. The way how a Member State (MS) approaches the efficient use of the funding is another and it will be reflected in the Partnership Agreement and Operational Programme(s), which shall be accorded with the European Commission in advance to the start of use of the EU funds. The aim of the article is to identify the potential of the tools that contribute to the efficiency and are used/ proposed to use in the EU funds' planning process. Firstly, it is identified, which tools are proposed to be used by the EU by revising the novelties introduced in the Draft Regulations, and which are planned to be implemented in the process of planning the EU assistance for the years 2014-2020 in Lithuania. Secondly, the tools are grouped into separate clusters that distinguish by a different level of a potential to be implemented.

The model replicates the growth patterns of developed and underdeveloped nations, clarifies the important role that capital plays in the difference between them, and presents several implications for interest-rate subsidies and official development assistance. Further, it shows that if a country enjoying long-run growth has little initial capital, its initial economic development will be based on capital accumulation.

All simulated results are highly consistent with the hypothesis that hiring discrimination may be an important component of the observed labor market disparity between African American and white workers in the U.

Additionally, while the simulations only generate a small proportion of the observed gaps in unemployment, it proves to be one of the few models capable of explaining simultaneous wage in unemployment gaps.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has facilitated local development in the SADC. Foreign-owned firms perform better than domestic firms, are larger, and locate in richer and better-governed countries and in countries with more competitive financial intermediaries. They are also more likely to export than domestic firms and evidence suggests that they might have positive spillover effects on domestic firms. Based on a standard empirical model, the SADC is attracting the inward FDI per capita that the region's level of income would predict. But this means that there are less capital inflows per capita to the region than there are to wealthier parts of the developing world. Moreover, the SADC is attracting less FDI than comparators for reasons that are possibly more fundamental than current income, namely, countries' past growth record, demographic structure and the quality of physical infrastructure. Interestingly, inward FDI is less sensitive to variation in income within the SADC than in other parts of the world, but is more responsive to changes in country's openness to trade.","[Xu, Lixin Colin] World Bank, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Lederman, Daniel] World Bank, PREM, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Mengistae, Taye] World Bank, Africa, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; The World Bank,"Xu, LC (通讯作者)，World Bank, Res Dept, MC 3-307,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",lxu1@worldbank.org,,,,,,,40,6,8,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We interviewed eighty one nascent entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic in 2011 and then again in 2012. The results of binary and multinomial logistic regressions show that nascent entrepreneurs who spent less time on developing their business, stayed longer in the just trying status and feared of failure were less likely to get their business operational within the next year. Previous industry experience and competition mapping lowered the probability of getting operational as well. On the other hand, entrepreneurial self-efficacy led to positive outcomes of venture creation effort. Finally, the study dealt also with growth expectations and found out that moderate expectations were increasing the probability of an actual launch.","[Lukes, Martin] Prague Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Managerial Psychol & Sociol, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Zouhar, Jan] Prague Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Lukes, M (通讯作者)，Prague Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Managerial Psychol & Sociol, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",lukesm@vse.cz; jan.zouhar@vse.cz,"Lukes, Martin/G-2677-2019; Zouhar, Jan/E-9659-2013","Lukes, Martin/0000-0001-9063-9251; Zouhar, Jan/0000-0002-1164-7948",,,,,32,17,19,0,34,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

According to the Fiscal Rule Strength Index developed by the European Commission, Poland's debt rule as of 1997 received the highest ranking. Poland also received the highest score based on the aggregated Fiscal Rules Index in 2009.

Does financial integration within Europe matter for the international transmission of business cycles between the United States and Europe? We find that it does, and that as European countries become more financially integrated among themselves, European business cycles start to 'decouple' from those in the United States. We show that this is true for three macro indicators of economic activity: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), consumption and investment, and for five alternative measures of the degree of financial integration. We also show that the effect of trade linkages becomes insignificant once financial factors are accounted for. Our work has interesting policy implications since it unveils the importance of further integration in the EU to slow down the transmission of aggregate shocks among industrialized nations.","[Olivero, Maria Pia; Madak, Robert] Drexel Univ, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Olivero, MP (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, LeBow Coll Business, 3141 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",maria.olivero@drexel.edu,,,,,,,29,4,5,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The ultimate reasons and the proximate causes underlying Indonesia's economic growth since the mid-1960s are still unclear. In the literature there have been at least three ways of investigating the driving forces of economic growth in Indonesia, namely: growth accounting system, regression and causality. The difference and improvement in this article is that we employed a two-step bounds testing approach to cointegration, which has not been done before; it uses the endogenous growth model to consider 12 policy variables and two external factors that potentially affect per capita income, this number is more than that has been done before. The empirical results that we obtained using this two-step bounds testing approach help us draw policy implications that if or when implemented would be expected to increase the growth of real per capita income, as well as the welfare of the people of Indonesia. Economic growth in Indonesia is largely driven by government policy, so the ability to increase Indonesia's economic growth rate, in the long run, will largely depend on the implementation of appropriate government policies.","[Parjiono; Beg, A.

We rely on a Choice Experiment (CE) to derive utilities and estimate the monetary value of angling site characteristics and then also use the utilities derived in a visitation frequency using a two-stage budgeting approach. The visitation frequency is then used to extract values for fishing license sales and business-related income. The case study illustrates how CBA can provide useful insights into the potential economic returns of environmental restoration projects. Our case study also indicates that the results in terms of Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) and visitation frequency are general findings - i.e. they appear similar across angling sites - which is particularly useful from a policy point of view because it supports the use of benefit transfer for more cost-effective river management.,"[Paulrud, Anton] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, SE-43245 Varberg, Sweden; [Paulrud, Anton] Swedish Agcy Marine & Water Management, S-40439 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Laitila, Thomas] Univ Orebro, Dept Stat, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden; [Laitila, Thomas] Stat Sweden, S-70189 Orebro, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Orebro University; Statistics Sweden,"Paulrud, A (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, Garvaregatan 10, SE-43245 Varberg, Sweden.",Anton.Paulrud@slu.se,,,,,,,43,19,19,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To the contrary, I argue that it has only just begun, and so has the process of rethinking the economic theories and models that have framed the subfield of transition economics. Specifically, I point out that the many surprises economists have encountered when confronted with the actual results of the transition process reveal deep flaws in the analytical framework that informs their analyses and policy prescriptions. If protecting existing theories and models is of primary importance, we should indeed call an end to economic transition and the subfield it has engendered.

Using public use state-level panel data from 1990 to 2005, I analyse how state implementation of welfare reform simultaneously affects the caseload, employment and out-of-wedlock births (henceforth, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) objectives). Because endogeneity and simultaneity could not be rejected, I use Three-Stage Least Squares (3SLS) method. Results indicated that most of the steep decline in the caseload is attributed to welfare reform, while the economy's overall effect paled in comparison. However, lagged and contemporaneous unemployment individually ranked second and third behind the Hispanic share of state population. The conservative tilt over the period studied ranked forth, followed in declining order by full family sanctions, Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) payments, time limits (lagged by length), access to abortion clinics, lump-sum TANF diversion payments, and TANF benefit payments. Findings also suggest that policy does not always work as intended: caseloads are found to be higher in states that have highly regarded family formation and job retention TANF programs; and EITC payments are associated with lower not higher caseloads. The most compelling finding in this study is that low-income families likely turn first to unemployment insurance and then to TANF assistance.","N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Greensboro, NC 27214 USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University,"Snarr, HW (通讯作者)，N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 1601 E Market St, Greensboro, NC 27214 USA.",hwsnarr@ncat.edu,,,,,,,52,6,10,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Now, 20 years from the start of transition, all former socialist countries are market economies at the middle stage of economic development, and convergence with neighbours, if not with the developed world, is largely achieved. With hindsight, it is clear that economists have spent too much time debating proper sequencing of reforms and the fine-tuning of reform packages. At the same time, the magnitude of the output and consumption fall in some countries was vastly underestimated, while the benefits of reforms have taken longer to materialize than expected. Successful practitioners of reform praise perseverance during and after the initial setbacks and willingness to make political compromises. At the conclusion of the natural experiment, transition economics has all but vanished as an academic discipline, although it played a crucial role in the formation of modern political economics.","New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",New Economic School,"Sonin, K (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia.",ksonin@gmail.com,"Sonin, Konstantin/Q-5660-2019; Sonin, Konstantin/C-1146-2014","Sonin, Konstantin/0000-0003-1581-9951;",,,,,16,17,17,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Accounting for the effect of the nominal loss amount allows for an examination of the reputational damage caused by operational loss events. The analysis is based on a sample of 136 operational losses stemming from a database of the Association of German Public Sector Banks (Bundesverband offentlicher Banken, VOB). All operational loss events affect European financial institutions with settlements reported by the press between January 2000 and December 2009. In line with previous literature, I find a significant negative stock price reaction to the first press announcement of operational losses. Results show that the stock market also reacts negatively to the settlement announcement as losses are confirmed and the loss amount is known. Even after accounting for the nominal loss amount, cumulative abnormal returns are negative following the date of the initial news article and the settlement date indicating damages to the reputation of the firm suffering the operational loss. Multivariate regression results suggest that reputational damages are rather influenced by firm characteristics than characteristics of the operational loss event: companies with a high ratio of liabilities to total assets suffer more severe damages to reputation from operational losses than companies with more equity.

Using an artefactual field experiment, we show that parents use transfers to compensate for differences between their teenage children when incomes are independent of children's actions. However, when a potential incentive problem is introduced, parents generally move away from compensating transfers. In addition, we find that the teenage children are more likely to take unfair bets when their behavior is not detectable by their parents.","[Messer, Kent D.] Univ Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Unur, A.

The results of the analysis show that, while the majority of taxpayers benefitting from this exemption are in the upper income brackets, its elimination would not make the income tax more progressive. As to removing the favourable tax treatment for corporate income, the distributional effect is of relevant magnitude and the income tax becomes significantly more progressive. Generally speaking, the results suggest that income taxation in Chile is less progressive than it appears and that it is feasible to give it a more important redistributional role in reducing income inequality.","[Agostini, Claudio A.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile; [Martinez A, Claudia] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Barbara] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Microdata Ctr, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Agostini, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile.",claudio.agostini@uai.cl; cmartineza@econ.uchile.cl; barflore@fen.uchile.cl,"Agostini, Claudio A./HLG-7336-2023; Flores Arenas, Barbara/AFO-7812-2022","Agostini, Claudio A./0000-0002-3916-1501; Flores Arenas, Barbara/0000-0003-4253-242X",,,,,30,2,2,0,16,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,DEC,2012,,108,,,,,175,201,,,,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,125KM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317538700010,0

The study draws on the international TIMSS 2003 and the British longitudinal NCDS data. The level of school violence is high in most countries but seems not to increase over time. Besides gender, social and migration background and the appearance of students determine being bullied, hurt or stolen from by fellow students. Being a victim has a significantly negative impact on contemporary and later student performance. In addition, the level of educational attainment is affected while there is no direct link to earnings when controlling for education, non-cognitive skills and appearance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Workers who experience favorable market conditions during their tenure on the job have higher wages, and work fewer labor hours. Unobserved differences in productivity, such as varying job quality, or match-specific productivity are not likely to explain this variation. The results instead point to the importance of contractual arrangements in wage determination. In economies with decentralized bargaining practices, such arrangements resemble self-enforcing insurance contracts with one-sided commitment (by the employer). On the other hand, in countries with strong unions and centralized wage bargaining, wage behavior is better approximated by full-commitment insurance contracts. The co-movement of hours and wages further confirms a contractual framework with variable worker hours. Despite the strong prevalence of contracts in Europe, however, the elasticity of labor supply is considerably smaller compared to the U.S. labor market. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed model has the advantage of handling intervention data with both a majority of zero observations and conditional heteroscedasticity. Thus, the model provides better estimates of the intervention function than such conventional models as the standard Tobit, OLS, Probit, and traditional GARCH models. Results show that the intervention behavior of the BoJ is affected more by its half-year long-term target than its previous-day short-term target, and the BoJ generally follows the policy of leaning against the wind. The US-JP interest rate spread was never a trigger of BoJ's interventions during the sample period. The BoJ did not respond to the domestic stock index by the sales-intervention of the JPY, even when the economy was sluggish during the lost decade (1992-2004).

Consistent with previous studies, there is substantial variation in energy system configurations across the AME scenarios, a reflection of the inherent uncertainty in how countries might undertake climate mitigation and associated energy system decisions. The paper also explores the degree to which scenarios from individual models retain regional differences in energy system configurations over time. The scenarios are mixed in this regard. Some models tend to converge toward common energy systems that focus on the utilization of a common set of options across regions, while others retain strong differences among regions. A review of modeling approaches indicates that the participating models are constructed to represent many, but not all, of the real-world forces leading to regional variation. The models do not have the capability to represent some of the most important social and political factors that influence energy technology decision making, raising important questions about how decision makers should interpret regional variations across models, particularly over the medium to long term.

In contrast, the capital outflows are found to be consistently procyclical and proactive, suggesting that the outflows are more significantly associated with domestic business cycle fluctuations than the capital inflows. In addition, it is found that the cyclical relationships between the capital inflows and the business cycle components of exports, household consumption and gross fixed investment are generally procyclical, except for portfolio inflows, which have a counter-cyclical relationship with fixed investment. In contrast, the capital outflows are counter-cyclically associated with exports and household consumption, and procyclically associated with fixed investment.","[Gossel, Sean J.; Biekpe, Nicholas] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Biekpe, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",nicholas.biekpe@gsb.uct.ac.za,"Biekpe, Nicholas/GNH-1675-2022; Biekpe, Prof Nicholas/AHB-9529-2022; gossel, sean/ABC-3931-2021","gossel, sean/0000-0002-9156-1959; Biekpe, Nicholas/0000-0002-9702-1232",,,,,64,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Our main result is that mortality changes and growth of income contributed to the fertility transition. The fertility reduction triggered by falling mortality, however, is not enough to overcompensate the positive effect of falling mortality on population growth. This means that growth of income per capita is essential to explain the observed secular decline of population growth. These results are robust to alternative estimation methods, potential outliers, sample selection, different measures of mortality, the sample period, the inclusion of education as an explanatory variable, and the use of different data sets. In addition, our causality tests suggest that fertility changes are both cause and consequence of economic development.","[Strulik, Holger; Vollmer, Sebastian] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Herzer, Dierk] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany; [Vollmer, Sebastian] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of Gottingen; University of Hamburg; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Until recently, though, the application of production functions with specifically non-unitary substitution elasticities (i.e., non-CobbDouglas) was hampered by empirical and theoretical uncertainties. As recently revealed, normalization of production-technology systems holds out the promise of resolving many of those uncertainties. We survey and assess the intrinsic links between production (as conceptualized in a production function), factor substitution (as made most explicit in Constant Elasticity of Substitution functions) and normalization (defined by the fixing of baseline values for relevant variables). First, we recall how the normalized Constant Elasticity of Substitution function came into existence and what normalization implies for its formal properties. Then we deal with the key role of normalization in recent advances in the theory of business cycles and of economic growth. Next, we discuss the benefits normalization brings for empirical estimation and empirical growth research. Finally, we identify promising areas of future research.","[Klump, Rainer] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [McAdam, Peter] Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Surrey,"Klump, R (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,103,110,119,5,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

However, the per capita projections for energy demand in these particular sectors often seem to be very low compared to the OECD average until 2050, and it is clear that the scenario assessments of final energy demands in these sectors include large uncertainties. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis have been carried out to study the impact of higher rates of energy demand growths in the non-OECD Asia on global mitigation costs. The long term energy and emission scenarios for China, India and South-East Asia have been contributed as a part of Asian Modeling Exercise (AME). The scenarios presented have been modeled by using a global TIMES-VIT energy system model, which is based on the IEA-ETSAP TIMES energy system modeling framework and the global ETSAP-TIAM model. Our scenario results indicate that the impacts of accelerated energy demand in the non-OECD Asia has a relatively small impact on the global marginal costs of greenhouse gas abatement. However, with the accelerated demand projections, the average per capita greenhouse gas emissions in the OECD were decreased while China, India, and South-East Asia increased their per capita greenhouse gas emissions. This indicates that the costs of the greenhouse gas abatement would especially increase in the OECD region, if developing Asian countries increase their final energy consumption more rapidly than expected.

Despite this, we argue that two main conclusions can be drawn from a sceptical reading of the evidence. First, large-scale asset purchases reduce government bond rates, especially at the longer end of the yield curve. However, this effect may be temporary and is small if bond rates are already low, while initial waves of QE are more effective than subsequent programmes. Second, QE appears to have been effective in late 2008 and 2009, preventing even larger declines in output and inflation than were experienced. We argue that the literature is limited, relying on similar methodologies and largely originating in central banks. Exploration of alternative approaches to QE would be useful in widening an evidence base that is currently too narrow.","[Martin, Christopher] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Milas, Costas] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",University of Bath; University of Liverpool,"Martin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",c.i.martin@bath.ac.uk; costas.milas@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Milas, Konstantinos/0000-0002-9789-384X; Martin, Chris/0000-0001-7861-8968",,,,,20,47,49,0,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We estimate Taylor rules and find no evidence that monetary policy stabilized inflation, even allowing for changes in the inflation target. While monetary policy was stabilizing with respect to inflation forecasts, the forecasts systematically under-predicted inflation following the 1970s recessions and this does not constitute evidence of stabilizing policy.

We also apply decomposition methods to examine the extent to which gaps in child development can be attributed to child health conditions. While most physical health conditions have small and insignificant effects, mental health conditions, in particular hyperactivity, have a large and significant effect on development. Mental health conditions account for 14%36% of the gap in cognitive ability and for 23%24% of that in verbal ability. Thus, policies aimed at reducing disparities in child development and socioeconomic inequalities later in life should focus more on the early diagnosis and effective treatment of mental health conditions.","[Salm, Martin] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Schunk, Daniel] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, D-6500 Mainz, Germany",Tilburg University; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Salm, M (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands.",m.salm@uvt.nl; mail@daniel-schunk.de,,,,,,,0,11,13,1,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

This paper tests how accurately theoretical models of dynamic pricing describe sellers' behavior in secondary markets for event tickets, a classic example of a perishable good. It shows that the simplest dynamic pricing models describe very accurately both the pricing problem faced by sellers and how they behave, explaining why sellers cut prices dramatically, by 40 percent or more, as an event approaches. The estimates also imply that dynamic pricing is valuable, raising the average seller's expected payoff by around 16 percent.","[Sweeting, Andrew] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Sweeting, Andrew] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Sweeting, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,"Sweeting, Andrew/0000-0002-6351-5162","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0850441] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,46,68,96,0,53,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,,,J POLIT ECON,J.

This paper discusses the implications of greenhouse gas emission reductions for major Asian regions (China, India, Indonesia, South-East Asia, Japan and Korea) based on results from the IMAGE modelling framework. Energy use in regions and economic sectors is affected differently by ambitious climate policies. We find that the potential for emission reduction varies widely between regions. With respect to technology choices in the power sector, we find major application of CO2 storage in Indonesia and India, whereas Korea and India apply more solar and wind. Projections for Japan include a (debatable) large share of nuclear power. China and, India, and South-East Asia, show a diverse technology choice in the power sector. For the industry sector, we find that the recent rapid growth in China limits the potential for emission reduction in the next decades, assuming that recently built coal-based industry facilities are in use for the next decades. For the residential sector, the model results show that fewer households switch from traditional fuels to modern fuels in GHG mitigation scenarios. With respect to co-benefits, we find lower imports of fossil energy in mitigation scenarios and a clear reduction of air pollutant emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We propose an explanation for regulatory persistence based on regulatory fog, the phenomenon by which regulation obscures information regarding the value of counterfactual policies. We construct a dynamic model of regulation in which the underlying need for regulation varies stochastically, and regulation undermines the social planner's ability to observe the state of the world. Compared to a full-information benchmark, regulation is highly persistent, often lasting indefinitely. Regulatory fog is robust to a broad range of partially informative policies and can be quite detrimental to social welfare. Regulatory experiments, modeled as costly and imperfect signals of the underlying state, do not eliminate the effects of regulatory fog. We characterize their effects and provide a framework for choosing amongst a set of potential regulatory experiments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reassesses the intertemporal asset management problem with a poverty trap model and shows that we would expect to see asset smoothing, not consumption smoothing, in the neighborhood of critical asset levels at which optimal accumulation behavior bifurcates. We then employ threshold estimation techniques to empirically confirm the co-existence of consumption and asset smoothing regimes using a household panel data set from West Africa. Households above the estimated threshold almost completely insulate their consumption from weather shocks, whereas those below the threshold do not.

Evaluating the effects of specific reforms is complicated by the lack of exogenous variation in institutions, the difficulty of measuring institutional performance, and the temptation to cherry pick estimates from among the large number of indicators required to capture this multifaceted subject. We evaluate one attempt to make local institutions more democratic and egalitarian by imposing participation requirements for marginalized groups (including women) and test for learning-by-doing effects. We exploit the random assignment of a governance program in Sierra Leone, develop innovative real-world outcome measures, and use a preanalysis plan (PAP) to bind our hands against data mining. The intervention studied is a community-driven development program, which has become a popular strategy for foreign aid donors. We find positive short-run effects on local public goods and economic outcomes, but no evidence for sustained impacts on collective action, decision making, or the involvement of marginalized groups, suggesting that the intervention did not durably reshape local institutions. We discuss the practical trade-offs faced in implementing a PAP and show how in its absence we could have generated two divergent, equally erroneous interpretations of program impacts on institutions.

Specifically, I merge the unified growth models of Galor and Weil [American Economic Review 90 (2000), 806-828] and Hansen and Prescott [American Economic Review 92 (2002), 1205-1217] to capture the importance of human capital formation, fertility decline, and the transition from agriculture to industry in transition from stagnation to growth. Moreover, I also incorporate young adult mortality into the model. Initially, the aggregate human capital and return to education are low and the mortality rate is high; therefore parents invest in quantity of children. Once sufficient human capital is accumulated and mortality rates are reduced, thanks to increasing life expectancy, with the activation of the modern human capital-intensive sector, parents start to invest in the quality of their children. The simulation of the model economy improves upon the quantitative performance of the existing literature and successfully captures the evolution of fertility, population, and GDP in the British economy between 1750 and 2000.","Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Elgin, C (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, Natuk Birkan Binasi, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",ceyhun.elgin@boun.edu.tr,"Elgin, Ceyhun/D-3123-2014","Elgin, Ceyhun/0000-0001-8796-2429",,,,,28,4,4,2,35,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

There is a continuum of firms, each consisting of a party who can reduce production cost and a party who can discover information about demand. Both parties can make specific investments at private cost, and there is a machine that either party can control. As in incomplete-contracting models, different governance structures (i.e., different allocations of control of the machine) create different incentives for the parties' investments. As in rational-expectations models, some parties may invest in acquiring information, which is then incorporated into the market-clearing price of the intermediate good by these parties' production decisions. The informativeness of the price mechanism affects the returns to specific investments and hence the optimal governance structure for individual firms; meanwhile, the governance choices by individual firms affect the informativeness of the price mechanism. In equilibrium, the informativeness of the price mechanism can induce ex ante homogeneous firms to choose heterogeneous governance structures.","[Gibbons, Robert] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of New South Wales Sydney; Northwestern University,"Gibbons, R (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Powell, Michael/KCY-3126-2024","Powell, Michael/0009-0004-5297-615X",,,,,36,13,13,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Rich households generate more emissions per capita than poor households via both their direct energy consumption and their higher expenditure on goods and services that use energy as an intermediate input. An econometric analysis confirms a positive relationship between emissions and income and establishes a slightly increasing marginal propensity to emit (MPE) over the relevant income range. The redistribution of income from rich to poor households is therefore shown to reduce aggregate household emissions, suggesting that the twin pursuits of reducing inequality and emissions can be achieved in tandem.

We develop a general equilibrium overlapping generations model with endogenous discrete schooling choice. The production technology features capital-skill complementarity as in Krusell et al. (2000). ISTC, through capital-skill complementarity, raises the relative demand for skilled labor, while demographic variation affects the skill premium by changing the age structure and hence the relative supply of skilled labor. We find that ISTC is the key element driving the skill premium in the postwar U.S. economy. And it is quantitatively important for the dynamics of the college enrollment rate.

We also quantify the size and persistence of these connections through the analysis of Volatility Impulse Response Functions (VIRF) for two historical shocks, namely the 2008 Financial Crisis and the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. We observe that Brent and Dubai crude are highly responsive to market shocks, whereas WTI crude shows the least responsiveness of the three benchmarks, which creates questions about its predominance as a benchmark crude oil. Furthermore, we fit the density of the VIRF at different forecast horizons. These fitted distributions are asymmetric, showing that the probability of observing a large impact of a shock is lower while the probability of a relatively smaller impact is much higher. Finally, we simulate the VIRF for a given probability of a random shock. The VIRF shows that only a large shock (derived from a smaller probability) will result in an increase in expected conditional volatilities. These results provide useful insights into the volatility transmission mechanism in crude oil markets and their associated risk estimation, and may have significant implications for various market participants and regulators.

Fortunately, the moment explosion property under the Heston model is examined systematically in Andersen and Piterbarg (2000). Incorporating with their results, we present explicit formulas for moment generating function of log price and for power option prices under the circumstances when the corresponding moments are finite. In case that the corresponding moment explodes, we provide two numerical methods to derive prices of power put and capped power call options.

In particular, we study the behaviors of technological firms, patent brokers and patent trolls and explore their consequences on the amount of R&D investments of the economy. We show that patent brokers, in their pure form, are R&D increasing (i.e. they increase the R&D investments of both supplier and manufacturing firms) while patent trolls, in their pure form, are R&D decreasing. We also show that, paradoxically, an optimal positive level of trolling may exist if the probability to secure market transactions and the probability to encounter trolls are positively correlated. Then we discuss the normative implications of this research. Among others, we argue that changes in patent laws are needed in order to limit the possibility of trolling; however, the difficulty is that those changes might also affect the development of technological firms and brokers. Several possible evolutions of international patent laws are hence discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A stated preference survey and discrete choice model were developed to understand household decisionmaking associated with cooking stove choice in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study found that, with the exception of price and usage cost factors for the high wealth group, the product-specific factors that were investigated significantly affect stove and fuel choices. The relative strength of factors was assessed in terms of Marginal Willingness to Pay and provides some evidence that consumer preference for higher quality fuels and stoves tends to increase with increasing wealth.

This paper considers the problem of warrant pricing when the underlying asset follows the GARCH diffusion model. An analytical approximate solution for European option prices is derived by means of Fourier transform. The approximate solution can be quickly computed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations show that this approximate solution is correct and the FFT is accurate and efficient, and hence it enables us to investigate the volatility smile implied by the GARCH diffusion model. Then a method is developed to provide the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the GARCH diffusion model based on the efficient importance sampling (EIS) procedure. Furthermore, the empirical performance of the GARCH diffusion model applied to the valuation of Hang Seng Index (HSI) warrants traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) is investigated. Empirical results show that the GARCH diffusion model outperforms the Black-Scholes (B-S) model in terms of the pricing accuracy, indicating that the pricing model incorporated with stochastic volatility can improve the pricing of warrants.

We assume that there are two market segments: one in which operators compete on equal terms, with a new technology, and the other in which the entrant is at a disadvantage since the technology it offers is inferior to the incumbent's. Results show that asymmetric regulation can create favorable conditions that allow the entrant to strengthen its market positioning, and enhance consumer net utilities and social welfare. This highlights the importance of the degree of network asymmetry and the ways in which consumers are split between the two market segments. Lastly, we show that asymmetric regulation can create greater investment incentives for the entrant which could effectively enhance social welfare.

It considers multiple dimensions of both enforcement and financial status. Regarding enforcement, the paper considers both the likelihood of enforcement, as captured by the likelihood of inspections conducted at regulated facilities, and the severity of enforcement, as captured by the size of sanctions imposed on polluting facilities found violating their effluent limits. As indicators of corporate financial status, the paper considers measures of liquidity, solvency, and profitability [a proxy for corporate managerial skill], all of which can influence the likelihood that a firm faces liquidity and/or bankruptcy constraints. The paper first develops a theoretical model of optimal abatement in the presence of liquidity and bankruptcy constraints and uses the model to investigate the impact of financial status on optimal abatement and the effectiveness of enforcement. Then the paper empirically examines the interactions between enforcement and financial status using data on wastewater discharges from US chemical manufacturing facilities for the years 1995 to 2001. Empirical results suggest that the financial status dimensions considered here in general play an important role in determining the incentives created by enforcement. As the most striking result, we show theoretically and empirically that, when financial dimensions are included in the analysis, the conventional wisdom regarding the effect of enforcement likelihood on abatement no longer holds, i.e., increased enforcement can actually lead to worse environmental performance.

In contrast to the modified zero conjectural variation approach of Eaton and Lipsey (1978) we assume that the players consider the threat of 'pressing out' of the market as a real possibility. We employ the concept of equilibrium in secure strategies (EinSS) as the generalization of the Nash equilibrium. The EinSS coincides with the Nash Equilibrium when Nash Equilibrium exists and postulates the incentive of players to maximize their profit under the condition of security against the actions of other players.

Nevertheless, we show that the burden of correcting budgetary disequilibria is entirely carried out by changes in the average tax rate, with a weakly exogenous government spending, possibly determined by the political process. We also document some rigidities of the tax instrument, in terms of downward inflexibility of the average tax rate with respect to its long-run level. Finally, we provide some evidence in favor of a nonlinear adjustment toward a sustainable long-run equilibrium, as the average tax rate adjusts faster the further away it gets from the equilibrium.

In such cases, enforcing one normative rule can lead to a sequence of mutual retaliatory sanctions, which we refer to as a feud. We investigate the hypothesis that normative conflict enhances the likelihood of a feud in a public-good experiment. Normative conflict in our experiment arises from the fact that individuals derive different benefits from the public good. We find that punishment is much more likely to trigger counter-punishment and start a feud when there is a normative conflict, than it is in a setting in which all individuals derive the same benefit from the public good and no such conflict exists. While the possibility of a feud sustains cooperation, the cost of feuding fully offsets the efficiency gains from increased cooperation.

I also characterize exactly when such a contract can provide monitors with the right incentives to perform. In doing so, I emphasize virtual enforcement and suggest its implications for the theory of repeated games.

Recent formal decision theories under Keynesian uncertainty are reviewed and their limitations explored, with particular reference to the insights that decision theory can bring to understanding the precautionary principle.

The models incorporate income growth expectations, income uncertainty, housing collateral, and other credit effects. These models therefore capture important parts of the financial accelerator. The evidence is that credit availability for U.K. and U.S., but not Japanese, households has undergone large shifts since 1980. The average consumption-to-income ratio rose in the U.K. and U.S. as mortgage down-payment constraints eased and as the collateral role of housing wealth was enhanced by financial innovations, such as home equity loans. The estimated housing collateral effect is similar in the U.S. and U.K. In Japan, land prices (which proxy house prices) continue to negatively impact consumer spending. There are negative real interest rate effects on consumption in the U.K. and U.S. and positive effects in Japan.

One of the elements supporting their diffusion has been the increase in volatility observed on many energy markets. Among the several available contracts, Quanto options are now becoming very popular for a simple reason: they take into account the strong correlation between energy consumption and certain weather conditions, so enabling price and weather risk to be controlled at the same time. These products are more efficient and, in many cases, significantly cheaper than simpler plain vanilla options. Unfortunately, the specific features of energy and weather time series do not enable the use of analytical formulae based on the Black-Scholes pricing approach, nor other more advanced continuous time methods that extend the Black-Scholes approach, unless under strong and unrealistic assumptions. In this study, we propose a Monte Carlo pricing framework based on a bivariate time series model. Our approach takes into account the average and variance interdependence between temperature and energy price series. Furthermore, our approach includes other relevant empirical features, such as periodic patterns in average, variance, and correlations. The model structure enables a more appropriate pricing of Quanto options compared to traditional methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To describe modernization of physical capital, the authors use a vintage capital model with the constant elasticity of substitution between capital and energy. The models take into account (i) availability of new more energy-efficient equipment under energy-saving technical progress, (ii) possibility of buying new capital with various combinations of energy parameters and prices, (iii) controlled scrapping of obsolete capital, and (iv) energy regulation quotas.

In fact today most young economists think that the word empirical simply means collect enough data to do a significance test. Tjalling Koopmans's influential book of 1957, Three Essays on the State of Economic Science, solidified the claim. A century of evidence after Student's t-test points strongly to the opposite conclusion. Against conventional econometrics we argue that statistical significance is neither necessary nor sufficient for proving commercial, human, or scientific importance. A recent comment by Thomas Mayer, though in parts insightful, does nothing to alter conclusions about the logic and evidence which we and others have assembled against significance testing.

We argue that the justice budget is likely to have a positive and significant impact on individuals' trust in justice, thanks to its role as a signal when individuals face uncertainty regarding the judicial environment. We test this hypothesis empirically using three different budget-related variables: the justice budget per incoming case, the number of magistrates and the intensity of legal aid. Across our three regressions, we find a positive and significant correlation between judicial resources and individuals' declared trust in the justice system. This positive relationship is robust to the introduction of socio-demographic, cultural, institutional and economic control variables. We finally offer empirical support to the intuition that the effect of the justice budget on trust in justice is likely to be greater when individuals are more satisfied with the level of democracy in their country.","[Roussey, Ludivine] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Defense, F-92000 Nanterre, France; [Deffains, Bruno] European Business Sch, Wiesbaden, Germany; [Deffains, Bruno] Univ Paris 04, Dept Law & Econ, Paris, France",European Business School (EBS) University; Sorbonne Universite,"Roussey, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Defense, F-92000 Nanterre, France.",l.roussey@gmail.com; bruno.deffains@u-paris2.fr,"Deffains, Bruno/F-2896-2018","Deffains, Bruno/0000-0001-9822-5272; Roussey, Ludivine/0000-0002-6014-3949",,,,,38,15,15,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The existence of such transactions may initially appear counter intuitive. However, this paper will show that active inter-bidder resale results from payoff maximizing decisions in the auction that take into account the incentives of a resale opportunity. Specifically, I examine how the existence of an inter-bidder resale opportunity impacts bidder behavior in an English clock auction, and to what extent altering the bargaining power of the final buyer and reseller in the resale market determines the strategies followed in the initial auction, in an attempt to understand the existence of these inter-bidder transactions. Theoretical and behavioral analysis is used to develop hypotheses of speculation (bidding above value) and demand reduction (bidding below value) which are directly tested in a controlled experimental setting. While value bidding is a dominant strategy in a standard English clock auction without resale, when resale is allowed, this theoretical claim is weaker. Demand reduction is observed when the bargaining power is shifted to the final buyer in resale and when the bargaining power is shifted toward the reseller, speculation is observed. The revenue achieved in the initial auction depends on the behavior observed in the auction. Regardless of bargaining power, revenue is shown to decrease below what would have been earned in an English auction without resale due to demand reduction. When the reseller has the bargaining power, and speculation is observed, this loss in revenue is somewhat mitigated by increased speculation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Immigrant-family children are much more likely to experience economic deprivation than native-family children. Research shows that immigrant families eligible for federal and state income and work supports, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps), access them at significantly lower rates than do native families. This study constructs an econometric model to identify variables associated with SNAP take-up among eligible immigrant families with citizen children. The results suggest broad-based state legislation restricting immigrant rights reduces program participation among these families. Stronger outreach efforts by state program administrators to promote SNAP among immigrant groups and make it easier for working parents to enroll in the program might encourage greater participation among eligible immigrant families in this important social safety net program.","Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Natl Ctr Children Poverty, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Skinner, C (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Natl Ctr Children Poverty, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,40,17,26,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Higher moments of the skill distribution have complex relationships with the organization of the labor force. First, labor endowments skewed toward high abilities exhibit positive assortment of workers across tasks, while countries with distributions of ability skewed towards low abilities exhibit underemployment. Second, greater dispersion improves aggregate productivity in countries that experience underemployment, but worsens productivity where there is assortative assignment. Furthermore, the shape and size of factor endowments are shown to jointly determine a global pattern of comparative advantage. Countries are more likely to export their abundant factors when labor markets organize heterogenous workers effectively. These predictions receive empirical support from Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries using measures of diversity constructed from educational attainment.","1285 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97405 USA",University of Oregon,"Sly, N (通讯作者)，1285 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97405 USA.",sly@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,25,2,3,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

For long run relation. the Johansen and Juselius (1990) maximum likelihood approach to cointegration was utilized. The test is also supplemented by the Breitung and Candelon (2006) and Lemmens et al. (2008) method. The quarterly data for the study covers 1969q3 to 2010q4. The findings suggest that consumers' price Granger-causes producers' price at an intermediate level of frequencies reflecting medium-run cycles, whereas producers' price does not Granger-cause consumers' price at any level of frequencies. Our study shows that consumers' price is a leading indicator of producers' price. Given that producers' price is used in making various macroeconomic indicators in real terms, the findings should help the Australian policymakers to gain control over the factors that affect consumers' price. The major contribution of the paper is to demonstrate unidirectional causality from consumers' price to the producers' price. Specifically, results show that consumers' price in Australian may have a significant predictive content in how the producers' price evolve. Furthermore, the application of the Breitung and Candelon (2006) and Lemmens et al. (2008) methodology in testing the Granger-causality in frequency domain is also relatively new.

Our empirical results show that allowing for cross-sectional dependency rejects the null hypothesis that all series in the panel have a unit root, implying that there is at least one stationary series in the panel. With the help of the results of the covariate test, we can distinguish the panel into a group of stationary and a group of non-stationary series. For robustness, the two groups of series are re-confirmed by the panel tests.

In our setting, a standard argument states that a tax should not be effective in raising contributions, because agents respond by reducing voluntary contributions by the amount of the tax. Our experimental design focuses in on this intuition by abstracting away from several potential confounds. We use a specification for the payoff function in which there is a dominant strategy for own-earnings maximizing agents, located interior to and in the upper half of the strategy space. The dominant strategy ensures that changes in contributions are attributable to the tax directly, rather than second-order effects due to responses to out-of-equilibrium play by other agents. The dominant strategy is made more transparent by the use of a novel graphical decision interface. We find that individuals robustly choose at or above the own-earnings dominant strategy level. Even with the controls of the design, crowd-out is incomplete, but the degree of crowd-out is higher than in previous studies. Analysis of individual-level decisions provides evidence of different player types. Behavior of subjects not choosing the dominant or Pareto-efficient contributions is well-organized by a model of warm-glow giving with a logit decision error. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Asian economies were, however, relatively unaffected: the contraction in their capital flows was limited to the most acute phase of the crisis in late 2008, followed by a rapid rebound. We show that this reflects both Asia's structural characteristics, such as limited reliance on international banking, and Asian specificities in the form of a limited impact of international bank exposure on capital flows.

The paper shows how subtle distinctions between the two costs can provide important differences in their effects upon consumer behaviour, competition and welfare. In addition, the paper also illustrates a simple empirical methodology for estimating separate measures of both costs, while demonstrating a potential bias that can arise if only one cost is considered.

For analysis, the sample is split into two sets of countries (advanced and developing). The findings suggest that the adoption of IT is an ideal monetary regime for developing economies and, in addition to reducing inflation volatility, can drive inflation down to internationally acceptable levels. Regarding advanced economies, the adoption of IT does not appear to represent an advantageous strategy.

In either scenario, under comparative advertising the firms never advertise together which they may do under non-comparative advertising. Moreover, under comparative advertising firms do not advertise when the informational value to consumers is small. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on financial shocks as they have received wide attention in the recent literature and in the policy debate after the global financial crisis. We estimate a panel VAR for 21 advanced economies based on quarterly data between 1985 and 2011, where financial shocks are identified through sign restrictions. We find robust evidence that financial shocks can be separately identified from other shock types and that they exert a significant influence on key macroeconomic variables such as GDP and (particularly) investment, but it is unclear whether these shocks are demand or supply shocks from the standpoint of their macroeconomic impact. The financial development and structure of a given country is found not to matter much for the intensity of the propagation of financial shocks. Moreover, we generally find that these shocks play a role not only in crisis times, but also in normal conditions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for monetary policy.

Drawing on an empirical study conducted in Shenzhen and Dongguan, China, a path-dependent nature of governance modality for initiating industrialization within the transitional context has been uncovered. The paper shows that the dirigiste globalized production system in Shenzhen, where the government exerted strong directive influence in the 1980s, has gradually evolved and reached a higher form of interactive RIS than the grassroots globalized production system in Dongguan, where innovation activities are few and are still passively managed by global players. The review of the evolutionary path of the electronics industry in Shenzhen and Dongguan reveals that the locational first-mover advantage in Shenzhen is further strengthened by the institutional first-mover advantage, incubating competitive and diversified firms in the business sector, which facilitate the interactive learning mechanism in RIS. Finally, policy implication is discussed for the construction of RIS under different governance modalities in the initial industrialization phase.","[Fu, Wenying] S China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Diez, Javier Revilla; Schiller, Daniel] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, Hanover, NH USA",South China Normal University,"Fu, WY (通讯作者)，S China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",,"Revilla Diez, Javier/J-2392-2019; Schiller, Daniel/A-1553-2019","Revilla Diez, Javier/0000-0003-2065-1380; Schiller, Daniel/0000-0002-8312-0547; Fu, Wenying/0000-0002-5617-4718",,,,,38,22,24,3,73,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In Latin America, 50% of salaried employees work informally. Three stylized facts characterize informality: (1) small firms tend to operate informally while large firms tend to operate formally; (2) unskilled workers tend to be informal while skilled ones have formal jobs; (3) ceteris paribus, secondary workers (a worker other than the household head) are less likely to operate formally than primary workers. We develop a model that accounts for all these facts. In our model, both heterogeneous firms and workers have preferences over the sector they operate and choose optimally whether to function formally or informally. There are two labor markets, one formal and the other informal, and both firms and workers act unconstrained in them. By contrast, a prominent feature of the preexisting literature is that workers' decisions play no role in determining the equilibrium of the economy. In our model, policies that reduce the supply of workers in the informal labor market at given wages will increase the level of formality in the economy. This has noteworthy implications for the design of social programs in developing countries. We also show that an increase in the participation of secondary workers would tend to raise the level of informality in the economy.

We analyse futures prices from the Dutch market, a market in which power is produced with storable fossil fuels, and futures prices from the NordPool market, where electricity is mostly produced by hydropower. We show that futures prices from markets in which electricity is predominantly produced by imperfectly storable fuels such as hydro, wind and solar contain information about expected changes in the spot price of electricity, whereas futures prices from markets in which electricity is predominantly produced with perfectly storable fuels contain information about both expected price changes and time-varying risk premiums. These findings provide insight in the applicability of forward price models: one cannot apply the same model to all electricity markets. Forward models for markets with imperfect indirect storability should depend heavily on price expectations and models should include time-varying risk premiums for markets with perfect indirect storability.

We focus on the determinants of convergence and divergence of crime rates across regions, focusing on the periods of economic turbulence such as the 1998 financial crisis. We also simulate the impact of the 2008-10 financial crisis on crime rates in Russia and identify the impact of government spending on reducing crime. Real income, unemployment level, and income inequality are found to be the most important factors explaining the crime rates. High levels of urbanization are also closely linked to higher crime rates. We find that the observed convergence in the regional crime rates during the 1998 crisis was driven mainly by the deteriorating crime situation in the regions with relatively low crime rates. The finding allows us to draw policy conclusions with respect to the role of the anti-crisis government programs in reducing crime. With respect to the types of crime, our analysis confirms that economic and property crimes tend to be the most responsive to the changing economic conditions.","[Ivaschenko, Oleksiy] World Bank, Social Protect Unit, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Nivorozhkin, Anton] Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany; [Nivorozhkin, Eugene] UCL, UCL Sch Slavon & E European Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England",The World Bank; University of London; University College London,"Ivaschenko, O (通讯作者)，World Bank, Social Protect Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,"Nivorozhkin, Eugene/J-5271-2013","Nivorozhkin, Eugene/0000-0002-7513-886X",,,,,46,6,8,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

J,"McKinnon, R",,,,"McKinnon, Ronald",,,"Carry trades, interest differentials, and international monetary reform",JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,International dollar standard; Hot money flows; Emerging markets; Carry trade,,"The international dollar standard is malfunctioning. Near zero U.S. short-term interest rates launch massive hot money outflows by carry traders into emerging markets (EM) in Asia and Latin America. Each EM central bank buys dollars to prevent its currency from appreciating but loses monetary control. Despite EM currency appreciation, average inflation in EMs is now much higher than in the old industrial economies-and world commodity prices are bid up sharply. This inflation on the dollar's periphery only registers in the U.S. CPI with a long lag. But the more immediate effect of the Fed's zero interest rate is to upset the process of bank intermediation within the American economy. Bank credit continues to be weak while employment languishes. Addendum (as of April 18, 2012) The (second) avalanche of hot money outflows into emerging markets (EM) began when the Fed reduced the interest rate on Federal Funds to virtually zero in December 2008-and other industrial countries followed suit. But the outbreak of a banking crisis in Europe with counter party risk in the summer of 2011 led to a global tightening of bank credit on which carry traders depend for financing hot money flows and long positions in primary commodities. So they had to sell off their foreign exchange (mainly EM) assets and long positions in commodities to get back into dollars or yen. The result is that EM currencies and commodity prices-with the exception of the price of oil-fell and remained weak through December 2011, while the dollar strengthened and the Japanese government intervened several time in the last half of 2011 to prevent the yen from appreciating. This cycle illustrates the main point of the paper: wide interest rate differentials across currencies make the world monetary system much more fragile whatever the exchange rate regime. Reform efforts should focus much more on international monetary harmonization that limits interest differentials while accepting the need for exchange rate buffers, such as capital controls, to limit hot money flows. Once the European banking crisis recedes (if ever), the large interest differential-near zero interest rates in the United States and much higher natural interest rates in the high growth EMs-will, in 2012, set off another cycle of hot money flows from the center to the periphery with rising commodity prices.

We generalise the approach of A.B. Atkinson and F. Bourguignon (1987) [3] to the case where the marginal distributions of needs can vary across the household populations under comparison. We assume that a sympathetic observer uses a utilitarian social welfare function in order to rank heterogeneous income distributions. Insofar as any individual can play the role of the observer, we take the unanimity point of view according to which the planner's judgements have to comply with a certain number of basic normative principles. We impose increasingly restrictive conditions on the household's utility function and we investigate their effects on the resulting rankings of the distributions.

A real option model is employed to accommodate irreversibility of investment and cost uncertainty. In the absence of abatement cost uncertainty, a bankable ETS reduces a firm's incentive for environmental investment, because the firm can utilize the banked permits for future compliance which act as substitutes for abatement investment. However, when cost uncertainty is prevalent, investment may reduce the opportunity cost of irreversible investment under the banking system, thereby increasing a firm's investment incentive. The condition is derived under which a bankable ETS provides higher investment incentives than a non-bankable ETS does. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We first clarify the channels through which concerns for market failure, as proxied by trust in market participants, and concerns for government failure, as proxied by perceptions of corruption, jointly affect individuals' demand for government regulation. We then investigate these effects empirically, using data from post-socialist countries. Our analysis confirms the previously established result that trust has a negative effect on demand for regulation. Perceived corruption, however, affects demand for regulation primarily via a negative interaction effect with trust. Our findings suggest that, in post-socialist countries, both concerns for market failure and concerns for government failure are indeed in citizens' minds and that concerns about the anticipated 'grabbing-hand' effect from government involvement are particularly salient.

In this paper the relevant Chinese policy changes are documented and evidence presented to gauge the relative importance of what turns out to be a systematic form of export management. Given the relatively high shares of imported content used in Chinese exports and the low profit margins of Chinese exporters, an increase in the VAT rebate of a single per cent is estimated to increase the profitability of beneficiary exporters by 12 per cent for the typical Chinese exporter, and by 18 per cent for those Chinese exporters operating in export processing zones.","[Evenett, Simon J.; Fritz, Johannes] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Evenett, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.",simon.evenett@gmail.com; johannes.fritz@unisg.ch; yeonglaw@gmail.com,"jing, yang/JDV-8487-2023",,,,,,22,9,10,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

What are the implications for the global environment and climate change if China surpasses the United States? There are major concerns with China's rapid rise because its economic and industrial structure is increasingly dependent on the consumption of energy raw materials, and electricity. In 2010, China's GDP was approximately 40 percent of the United States' GDP, yet it was the world's largest polluter and the biggest consumer of energy and electricity. This implies that the energy efficiency of the Chinese economy measured by energy consumption per unit of GDP is about one-third of that of the United States and one-fourth that of the EU and Japan. If the Chinese economy continues to grow as fast as it has in the past, without changing its structure and improving energy efficiency, China's growth will cause severe damage to the global environment.

Standard definitions of the household usually include some intersection of keywords relating to residency requirements, common food consumption, and intermingling of income or production decisions. Despite best practices intending to standardize the definition of the household, it is unclear which types of definitions or which intersections of keywords in a definition result in different household compositions. This paper conducts a randomized survey experiment of four different household definitions in Mali to examine the implications for household-level statistics. This approach permits analysis of the trade-offs between alternative definition types. We find that additional keywords in definitions increase rather than decrease household size and significantly alters household composition. Definitions emphasizing common consumption or joint production increase estimates of the levels of household assets and consumption statistics, but not on per adult equivalency asset and consumption statistics, relative to open-ended definitions of the household. In contrast, definition type did not affect production statistics in levels, though we observe significant differences in per adult equivalency terms. Our findings suggest that variations in household definition have implications for measuring household welfare and production. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Due to survey logistics, agricultural data are usually collected by asking respondents to recall the details of events occurring during past agricultural seasons, potentially leading to recall bias. The problem is further complicated when interviews are conducted over the course of several months, thus leading to recall of variable length. To test for recall bias, the length of time between harvest and interview is examined for three African countries with respect to several common agricultural input and harvest measures. The analysis shows little evidence of large recall bias impacting data quality. There is some indication that more salient events are less subject to recall decay.

We estimate the reaction of monetary policy to wealth composition and asset prices using: (i) a linear framework based on a fully simultaneous system approach in a Bayesian environment; and (ii) a nonlinear specification that relies on a smooth transition regression model. The linear framework suggests that wealth composition is indeed important in the formulation of monetary policy. However, the attempts of central banks to mitigate undesirable fluctuations in say, financial wealth, may disrupt housing wealth. A similar result can be found when we look at the reaction of monetary authority to asset prices, although price effects seem to play a weaker role. The nonlinear model confirms these findings. However, the concerns over wealth and its components are stronger once inflation is under control, i.e. below a certain target. Some disruptions between financial and housing wealth effects are still present. They can also be found in the reaction to asset prices, despite being less intense. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis uses microdata from the four available waves of the European social survey (2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008), including more than 160,000 observations of individuals living in 29 European countries. Our results reveal that fiscal and some forms of political decentralization have a positive and significant effect on the overall subjective well-being of individuals. However, fiscal decentralization has a different effect on the perception of institutions depending on whether we consider subnational expenditure or revenues. Similarly, the effect of political decentralization on the level of satisfaction with institutions also varies depending on whether the capacity of local governments to influence national politics or to exert authority over their own citizens is considered. The results also show that citizens seem to be more satisfied with the actual capacity of their local governments to deliver than with the general principle that they can have a say on their daily politics and policies.","[Diaz-Serrano, Luis] Dept Econ URV, Reus 43204, Spain; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Diaz-Serrano, L (通讯作者)，Dept Econ URV, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.",luis.diaz@urv.cat; A.Rodriguez-Pose@lse.ac.uk,"Diaz, Luis/AAV-2488-2020; Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Diaz, Luis/0000-0001-9479-5091; Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,28,37,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2012,65.0,2,,,,,179,193,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2012.00533.x,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,926VU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302860800003,0

HTM behaviour also generates greater volatility of the real exchange rate and of net exports, which likewise brings the model closer to the data.","[Kollmann, Robert] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Kollmann, Robert] Univ Paris Est, Paris, France; [Kollmann, Robert] CEPR, London, England; [Kollmann, Robert] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Monetary Policy Inst, Dallas, TX USA",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Kollmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium.",robert_kollmann@yahoo.com,,,,,,,48,22,23,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

As we move towards a more knowledge-intensive economy, academics face pressures to link their work more closely to economic needs, with potentially adverse long-term consequences. This has been characterised as a fundamental change in the 'social contract' between universities and the state, with the latter now having more specific expectations regarding the outputs sought from the former. Others have described this as a transition from 'Mode 1' to 'Mode 2' knowledge production, or in terms of the emergence of a 'Triple Helix' relationship between universities, government and industry. This article critically examines these claims, setting them in historical context. We analyse the history of the university and its evolving functions as it responded to changing external demands. Adopting an evolutionary model, we describe how different university 'species' emerged and co-evolved, each with different emphases on the functions of teaching, research and contributing to the economy and society. Turning to the current environment facing universities, we identify the main drivers for change and assess their likely impact, before arriving at conclusions about the future of the university and university research. What we are witnessing today appears to be not so much the appearance of a new (and hence worrying) phenomenon, but more a shift back towards a social contract for the university closer to the one in effect before the second half of the twentieth century-one which, as it did then, may bring about the emergence of new university species.","[Martin, Ben R.] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Ctr Sci & Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Martin, Ben R.] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Martin, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Freeman Ctr, SPRU Sci & Technol Policy Res, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England.",B.Martin@sussex.ac.uk,"Martin, Ben/E-3572-2018","Martin, Ben/0000-0002-5186-0903",,,,,134,92,104,2,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

What distinguishes our approach from prior work is that occupational choice and job matching are determined simultaneously, so that the opportunity costs of entrepreneurs are accounted for. Those who are relatively unmanageable, while possibly excellent managers themselves, become entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs compete and create value by building efficient organizations and offering potentially well-paid jobs to others. While the entry of an additional entrepreneur typically reduces some individual wages, we show that it always raises the average wage and depresses the average income of incumbent entrepreneurs.

Although it is a common concern that such extensions may themselves raise nonemployment durations, it is not known how recessions would affect the magnitude of this moral hazard. To obtain causal estimates of the differential effects of UI in booms and recessions, this article exploits the fact that in Germany, potential UI benefit duration is a function of exact age which is itself invariant over the business cycle. We implement a regression discontinuity design separately for 20 years and correlate our estimates with measures of the business cycle. We find that the nonemployment effects of a month of additional UI benefits are, at best, somewhat declining in recessions. Yet the UI exhaustion rate, and therefore the additional coverage provided by UI extensions, rises substantially during a downturn. The ratio of these two effects represents the nonemployment response of workers weighted by the probability of being affected by UI extensions. Hence, our results imply that the effective moral hazard effect of UI extensions is significantly lower in recessions than in booms. Using a model of job search with liquidity constraints, we also find that in the absence of market-wide effects, the net social benefits from UI extensions can be expressed either directly in terms of the exhaustion rate and the nonemployment effect of UI durations, or as a declining function of our measure of effective moral hazard.","[Schmieder, Johannes F.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston University; Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Schmieder, JF (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,,,,,,,40,107,140,4,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Labeling on the downstream market affects upstream price competition through two effects: a differentiation effect and a ranking effect. The magnitude of these two effects determines who in the supply chain will receive the benefits and who will bear the burden of labeling. For instance, whenever the ranking effect dominates the differentiation effect, the low-quality upstream firm loses from labeling while all downstream actors are individually better off. By decreasing the low-quality input price, the label acts as a subsidy and leads to an increase of the downstream market welfare. This analysis furthers our understanding of the economic consequences of labeling in cases like those of GMOs or restaurants. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

This outcome can be interpreted as a combination of the convergence of inflation rates and the convergence of investment barriers. On the one hand, the common monetary policy might have driven a stronger comovement in inflation rates, leading to increasingly similar hedging strategies among member countries. On the other hand, exposure to the common currency might have homogenized bilateral investment barriers, thus inducing increasingly similar portfolio allocations among member countries. We find that the comovement of inflation rates has not significantly increased after EMU inception, pointing toward an exclusive role for convergence in investment barriers.","[Giofre, Maela] Ctr Res Pens & Welf Policies CeRP, I-10024 Turin, Italy; [Giofre, Maela] CCA, I-10024 Turin, Italy; [Giofre, Maela] Univ Turin, I-10134 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Giofré, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Res Pens & Welf Policies CeRP, Via Real Coll 30, I-10024 Turin, Italy.",giofre@cerp.unito.it,"GiofrÃ©, Maela/JUU-7118-2023","Giofre', Maela/0000-0002-6766-0324",,,,,37,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Our analysis addresses the puzzle of high nursing wages. Employee data from the Current Population Survey are matched with detailed job descriptors from the Occupational Information Network. Nursing requires high levels of compensable skills and demanding working conditions. Standard log wage regression estimates indicate nursing wage advantages of about 40%. Accounting for job attributes reduces estimates to roughly 20%. Rather than transforming ordinary least squares log gaps to percentages, alternative methods measuring Mincerian gaps produce estimates of 15% or less. We conclude that nurses receive compensation that is much closer to opportunity costs than that seen in standard analyses, narrowing the shortage puzzle. Supply constraints in nurse licensing can produce wages above long-run opportunity costs but that are too low to clear short-run labor markets during periods of growing demand. The analysis provides broader implications for the conduct of wage analyses.","[Hirsch, Barry T.] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Schumacher, Edward J.] Trinity Univ, Dept Hlth Care Adm, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA; [Schumacher, Edward J.] Trinity Univ, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Trinity University; Trinity University,"Hirsch, BT (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",bhirsch@gsu.edu; eschumac@trinity.edu,"Hirsch, Barry/ABD-6572-2021",,,,,,56,15,20,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

In particular, we extend Benigno and Woodford [Journal of the European Economic Association 3 (6) (2005), 1-52] to obtain a second-order approximation to the expected utility of the representative household when the steady state is distorted and the economy is hit by oil price shocks. The main result is that oil price shocks generate an endogenous trade-off between inflation and output stabilization when oil has low substitutability in production. We also find, in contrast to Benigno and Woodford, that this trade-off is reduced, but not eliminated, when we get rid of the effects of monopolistic distortions in the steady state. Moreover, the size of the endogenous cost-push shock generated by fluctuations in the oil price increases when it is more difficult to substitute other factors for oil.","[Montoro, Carlos] Bank Int Settlements, Off Amer, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Montoro, C (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Off Amer, Torre Chapultepec Ruben Dario 281-1703,Col Bosque, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",carlos.montoro@bis.org,,,,,,,13,30,30,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

For that purpose, we consider an economy where some agents consume a sin good (reducing their survival chances) out of myopia, and regret their choices later on, whereas other agents make, because of their impatience, the same risky choices, which they never regret. We argue that, in the first-best, a government should only interfere with behaviors that agents will regret, but not with other behaviors. In the second-best, asymmetric information and redistributive concerns imply interferences not only with myopic behaviors, but also with impatience-based (rational) behaviors. Finally, we introduce heterogeneity in individual earnings, and show that the optimal tax on the sin good depends on the size of the myopic group, on the reactivity of sin good consumption to tax changes, and on the extent to which sin good consumption is correlated with labor earnings.","[Ponthiere, Gregory] Ecole Normale Super, F-75014 Paris, France; [Pestieau, Pierre] Paris Sch Econ, CORE, F-75014 Paris, France; [Pestieau, Pierre] CEPR, Paris, France; [Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Liege, B-4000 Liege, Belgium",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Paris School of Economics; University of Liege,"Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super, 48 Bd Jourdan,Bldg B, F-75014 Paris, France.",p.pestieau@ulg.ac.be; gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,,,,,,,48,6,6,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Within this framework we study the optimal education rate in the context of changes in labor demand (as represented by the elasticity of substitution across ages and qualification) and labor supply (as represented by a change in the population growth rates). Applying an age-structured optimal-control model, we derive features of the optimal age-specific education rate. Our results show that the relation between the elasticities of substitution of labor across ages plays a crucial role in the way the demographic changes affect (both in the short and in the long run) the optimal educational policy.

In the human capital literature a substantial amount of the family gap is left unexplained after controlling for schooling and experience. This paper suggests that differences in labor market behavior between mothers and non-mothers are an important factor in explaining the family gap. For college graduates, estimation results show that employed mothers search 70% less than non-mothers and more than 50% of the family gap can be explained by the labor market behavior differences between mothers and non-mothers. Such differences, however, can not explain the family gap for high school graduates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The question raised in this paper is whether the intervention of a government, who has a positive valuation of agreement and therefore offers a subsidy, will reduce such delays and inabilities to reach agreement? Based on a perfect Bayesian equilibrium in a sequential bargaining game with intervention, we show that in equilibrium intervention always reduces the ex ante equilibrium inefficiency and conditionally reduces expected delays in trade. However, for intervention in the form of a subsidy to take place, the aggregate of the seller's reservation price and the externalities must be (almost) as high as the buyer's upper valuation limit.","Univ Tromso, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Aanesen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tromso, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",margrethe.aanesen@uit.no,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Specifically, we assume the production of two district-specific public goods out of two complementary district-specific inputs in a taste-symmetric two-district setting. We compare equilibria in non-cooperative decentralization and cooperative centralization for different spillovers, degrees of complementarity and cost-division rules, and control for the effects of strategic delegation and the feasibility of cross subsidies to the input in the foreign district. We find that centralization welfare-dominates decentralization in most institutional settings and for a wide range of parameters. Yet, we also identify conditions for decentralization to welfare-dominate centralization even in our setup where preferences are homogenous. The setup features three structural novelties: Strategic delegation improves provision and welfare in decentralization. In the absence of cross-district transfers, decentralized provision and welfare increase in spillovers.

After briefly summarizing the current state of macro theory, I focus on what strikes me as the two most important developments in monetary policy in the last two decades - inflation targeting and dealing with financial crises. My analysis rejects the claims made by several authors to the effect that the proliferation of inflation-targeting regimes around the globe represents an application of well-established principles of macroeconomic theory. As for how monetary policy can promote financial stability, a subject on which most economists agree modern theory has been of little help, I argue that macroeconomics has lost touch with the fundamental raison d'etre of central banking. My diagnosis is that macroeconomic theory has become distracted by its preoccupation with states of equilibrium, a preoccupation that inhibits analysis of a market economy's coordination mechanisms. I conclude with a plea for a more diverse ecology of approaches to macroeconomic theory, one that finds room for agent-based computational economics as well as for more conventional equilibrium theories.

The analysis was conducted for both single and multiple output production functions, while efficiency was allowed to depend upon surgeon and practice characteristics. Multiple output models, due to an increase in the number of observations, can be more precisely estimated and, as there are multiple observations per surgeon, can be estimated with fixed effects. The results of the analyses suggest that efficiency averages around 50% for this sample and is convex in years of surgical experience.

In this context, the sharply divergent experiences of the four main Anglo-Saxon banking systems suggest that the crisis may not so much be one of liberal capitalism per se as it is of the neoclassical variety that characterises the British and American systems. Whereas these banking systems were very badly affected by the crisis, the Canadian and Australian systems were not. Our analysis suggests that this can be explained by differences in the way that economic liberalism was interpreted and translated into policy in the four countries during the period preceding the crisis. It also suggests that broad classifications of national business systems into 'liberal market' and other varieties of capitalism do not capture their inherent diversity, and that financial market liberalisation does not necessarily lead to instability, particularly when it is accompanied by appropriate supervision and prudential regulation.","[Konzelmann, Sue] Univ London, Dept Management, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Schnyder, Gerhard] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; University of London; King's College London,"Konzelmann, S (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Management, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",s.konzelmann@bbk.ac.uk,,"Schnyder, Gerhard/0000-0002-6681-6227",,,,,91,15,15,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The contributions of education and total factor productivity in the region's past economic growth remain relatively limited. We also make long-run growth projections for developing Asia by combining the growth accounting framework with growth regression approach. Our baseline projections based on the model of conditional convergence show that the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates of the 12 developing Asian economies covered by this paper will be consistently lower for the next two decades than their historical performance. However, policy reforms in education, property rights, and research and development can substantially raise GDP growth in the region and partly offset the slowdown in growth caused by the convergence phenomenon.

As distinguishing all games can be too costly (require too much reasoning resources) agents might partition the set of all games into categories. Partitions of higher cardinality are more costly. A process of simultaneous learning of actions and partitions is presented and equilibrium partitions and action choices characterized. Learning across games can destabilize strict Nash equilibria even for arbitrarily small reasoning costs and even if players distinguish all the games at the stable point. The model is also able to explain experimental findings from the traveler's dilemma and deviations from subgame perfection in bargaining games. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Essays in modern economic perspectives, 131-162, 1998), analyzes a simple model formulated by Hurwicz (Jpn World Econ 7:49-74, 1995) of two agents-a polluter and a pollutee-and two commodities: money (standing for an exchangeable private good desired by both agents) and pollution (a public commodity desired by the polluter but undesired by the pollutee). There is also a government that issues legal rights to the two agents to emit a certain amount of pollution, which can be bought and sold with money. It is assumed that both agents act as price-takers in the market for pollution rights, so that competitive equilibrium is possible. The Coase theorem (so-called by Stigler (The theory of price, 1966) asserts that the equilibrium amount of pollution is independent of the allocation of pollution rights. A sufficient condition for this was (in another context) obtained by Edgeworth (Giorn Econ 2:233-245, 1891), namely that preferences of the two agents be parallel in the money commodity, whose marginal utility is constant. Hurwicz (Jpn World Econ 7:49-74, 1995) argued that this parallelism is also necessary. This paper, which provides an exposition of the problem, raises some questions about this result and provides an alternative necessary and sufficient condition.","[Chipman, John S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Tian, Guoqiang] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Chipman, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 4-101 Hanson Hall,1925 4th St S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",jchipman@umn.edu; gtian@tamu.edu,,,,,,,43,12,12,1,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

To our knowledge presence of economies of scale for wireline broadband networks has not been tested, certainly not in rural United States. We use data supplied by more than 500 rural local exchange carriers and find economies of scale for small rural wireline broadband providers. Market size limitations appear to prevent rural telephone companies from fully exploiting unit cost savings.

We find that trust (as measured by the percentage of wealth invested in a trust game) is initially high in a treatment starting with equal endowments, but decreases over time. In a treatment with unequal endowments, trust is initially lower yet more robust. The disparity of wealth distributions across economies mitigates over time.

The observations show that the total unemployment rate is highly persistent, and that the persistence of the unemployment rate of unskilled workers is higher than that of skilled workers. To account for these observations, the paper develops a framework that features search frictions. Individuals are either high educated or low educated, and firms post two types of vacancies: the complex, which can be matched with the high educated, and the simple, which can be matched with the high and the low educated. On-the-job search for a complex occupation is undertaken by the high educated in simple occupations. A negative aggregate technological shock induces the high educated unemployed to compete with the low educated by increasing their search intensity for simple vacancies. As the high educated occupy simple vacancies, they crowd out the low educated into unemployment. This downgrading of jobs in a cyclical downturn, or the increase in the labor input of the high educated in simple occupations, and the subsequent crowding out of the low educated into unemployment, provide a possible explanation for unemployment persistence.","Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Steven G Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Khalifa, S (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Steven G Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",skhalifa@fullerton.edu,,,,,,,13,8,8,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Prior knowledge is normally formalized either directly on deep parameters' values ('microprior) or indirectly, on macroeconomic indicators, e.g. moments of observable variables ('macroprior'). We introduce a non-parametric macroprior which is elicited from impulse response functions and assess its performance in shaping posterior estimates. We find that using a macroprior can lead to substantially different posterior estimates. We probe into the details of our result, showing that model misspecification is likely to be responsible of that. In addition, we assess to what extent the use of macropriors is impaired by the need of calibrating some hyperparameters.

It contributes to the empirical literature by using different variables as proxies for institutions and by developing a deeper analysis of the issues arising from the use of weak and too many instruments in per capita income and growth regressions. The cross-section estimation suggests that institutions seem to matter, regardless if they are the only explanatory variable or are combined with geographical and integration variables, although most models suffer from the issue of weak instruments. The results from the growth models indicate that: there is mixed evidence on the role of institutions and such evidence is more likely to be associated with law and order and investment profile; government spending is an important policy variable; collapsing the number of instruments results in fewer significant coefficients for institutions.

They find that a DCFTA with the EU will likely result in substantial gains to Armenia, but they show that the gains derive from the deep aspects of the agreement. In order of importance, the sources of the gains are: (i) trade facilitation and reduction in border costs; (ii) services liberalization; and (iii) standards harmonization. A shallow agreement with the EU that focuses only on preferential tariff liberalization in goods will likely lead to small losses to Armenia primarily due to a loss of productivity from lost varieties of technologies from the Rest of the World region in manufactured products. Additional gains can be expected in the long run from an improvement in the investment climate.

Using grouped national household sample survey data on monthly household consumption expenditure at the sub-national level for the years 1999-2000 to 2006-2007, we examine the relationship between Financial Development (FD) and rural and urban inequality in India. The results indicate that FD is associated with a reduction in inequality, but only in the urban areas. Further, inequality is found to be higher in the richer states compared to less developed and low income states, and as state income increases, inequality also increases both in the rural and urban areas. Finally, our results show that increase in population per bank branch leads to higher inequality in urban areas but decline in rural areas.","Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University,"Arora, RU (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia.",r.arora@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,53,12,13,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In fact there are two general formulations of this equation. The purpose of this article is to check whether these two different formulations alter the first-order conditions.

A much more severe depression than the global slump of 2008-09 was prevented by determined state intervention in the form of bank bailouts and fiscal stimuli. Yet this bout of apparently successful Keynesianism has been followed by a turn to fiscal austerity justified in terms reminiscent of the Treasury View against which Keynes relentlessly polemicised in the 1930s. This article explores the sources of this policy shift. Among the factors considered are the ideology of neoliberalism, the economic and political power of the banks, and the relative weight of finance in individual economies. The broader context of financialisation is also considered. The conclusion is reached that an oscillation between bouts of austerity and laxer policies encouraging the development of asset bubbles may be built into neoliberalism as an economic policy regime. The implication is that alternatives to austerity must embrace broad institutional transformation.","Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Callinicos, A (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, London WC2R 2LS, England.",alex.callinicos@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,48,49,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In financial terms, the value of an interconnector is the same as a strip of real options written on the spread between power prices in two markets. We model the spread based on a seasonal trend, mean-reverting Gaussian process, and mean-reverting jump process and express the value of these real options in closed-form. The valuation tool is applied to five pairs of European neighboring markets to value a hypothetical one-year lease of the interconnector using different assumptions about the seasonal component of the spread, and different liquidity caps which proxy for the depth of the interconnected power markets. We derive no-arbitrage lower bounds for the value of the interconnector in terms of electricity futures contract and find that, depending on the depth of the market, the jumps in the spread can account for between 1% and 40% of the total value of the interconnector. The two markets where an interconnector would be most (resp. least) valuable are Germany and The Netherlands (resp. France and Germany).

The two main empirical findings are that household income has a positive and well-determined impact on education expenditure, whereas international transfers do not influence education spending.","[Cattaneo, Cristina] FEEM, Milan, Italy; [Cattaneo, Cristina] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Fondazione Mattei; University of Sussex,"Cattaneo, C (通讯作者)，FEEM, Milan, Italy.",cristina.cattaneo@feem.it,,"CATTANEO, Cristina/0000-0001-8273-0143",,,,,47,16,16,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

The study also examines whether volatility regimes and asymmetric basis effects can improve the forecasting accuracy. The main merit of the empirical model is that the basis effect is allowed to be asymmetric and to vary across volatility regimes. Empirical results suggest that the conditional mean and variance respond to the basis asymmetrically and nonlinearly, and that the responses of transition probabilities to the basis are symmetric. Furthermore, the conditional higher moments are sensitive to the absolute value of basis, and the heavy tailed characteristic can be greatly alleviated by taking into account the asymmetric basis effects and regime switches. Finally, the regime switches and asymmetric basis effects play decisive roles in forecasting return, volatility and tail distribution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Studying a generalization of the paradox, which we label the 'happiness puzzle', we analyse ways in which income growth affects happiness. In our model, those factors include agents' risk aversion; whether the economy experiences balanced or unbalanced growth; how non-pecuniary factors affect well-being; and the degree of market imperfections. We also demonstrate that the dynamic specification of habit formation rather than its mere existence matters for whether the happiness puzzle arises on a balanced growth path. Only when habit is modelled in ratio form, does this possibility open up. Our model thus bridges the gap between theory, empirics and social policy.

I argue that expert forensic scientists make errors. Juries are capable of making decisions based on complex forensic evidence if provided the knowledge within which to develop schema to evaluate that evidence. Competition between the defense and prosecution in presenting interpretations of scientifically valid evidence, as well as providing schema to enable the jury to evaluate the information, provides juries with the ability to arrive at a full information decision. Expert nullification of jury decision making should be halted and decision making returned to the jury.

Advocates of agriculture-led strategies emphasise agriculture's strong growth linkages and potential to raise rural incomes. The new economic geography literature, however, provides theoretical support for urban industry-led development, which generates positive agglomeration effects of concentrating populations and economic activity. This debate is important for Sub-Saharan Africa, where agriculture dominates but where rapid urbanisation is occurring. We use an empirically calibrated economy-wide model with migration and agglomeration to estimate impacts of three investment strategies for Uganda-a fast growing country with wide rural-urban and regional disparities. First, our results indicate that a transport corridor connecting poorer northern regions to the rapidly growing south provides marginal benefits to northern households since northern producers are constrained by low productivity. Secondly, investing in southern urban centres to harness agglomeration effects accelerates national growth, but has little effect on other regions' welfare because of weak growth linkages and small migration effects. Finally, raising agricultural productivity, while less effective at stimulating national growth, generates broad-based welfare improvements. Thus, even after accounting for migration and agglomeration gains from urban-led development, improving agricultural productivity remains crucial for significantly reducing poverty and promoting regional equity in Uganda.","[Dorosh, Paul] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Thurlow, James] United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Thurlow, J (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland.",thurlow@wider.unu.edu,"Thurlow, James/JQW-4545-2023","Dorosh, Paul/0000-0001-6049-6018",,,,,29,20,23,2,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Specifically, if physicians reduce their level of defensive medicine in the wake of liability reforms, this will show up as a reduction in the share of births in which a caesarean section was used. I discover after analysing panel data reflecting the rate of caesarean deliveries by states and for the years 1987, 1990 and 1993 that differences in rate of caesarean deliveries are partially the result of state-level liability reforms.

For the promotion of solar water heaters, new legislations and concerted efforts are taken by the government.

Long-term meteorological data from 47 stations are analyzed in order to evaluate the potential of solar water heater application at each site in Greece.

The key contribution is to compare economic outcomes of young fathers to young men whose partners experienced a miscarriage rather than a live birth. The results suggest that teenage fatherhood decreases years of schooling and the likelihood of receiving a high school diploma and increases general educational development receipt. Teenage fatherhood also appears to increase early marriage and cohabitation, and has mixed short-term effects on several labor market outcomes.

Basing on annual data concerning property crimes in Poland in the years 1970-2008, and employing general to specific strategy of modeling, seven structural models were estimated whose specifications rest on the following theories of crime: social disorganization theory, anomie, social conflict, routine activities theory, rational choice, social support, and subcultural theory. Although the initial set of explanatory variables was the same across all the models, the final set of regressors - corresponding to a given theory - differs across the models and so do the estimates. Moreover, each of the seven models passes numerous tests of statistical and essential acceptance. In effect, one ends up in an oversupply of hypotheses and practical use of the empirical outcomes based on various criminological doctrines is impeded unless one sympathizes with a given theory. An alternative to the afore-mentioned selection procedure is a unification approach which allows for the inherent uncertainty present while searching for 'the best model' because it uses all the information contained in all the models considered. The approach rests on the information theory, whereas the frequentist model averaging enables its practical implementation. This technique explicitly takes into account the impact of all the explanatory variables gathered as relevant in view of alternative theories of crime. Then one cannot raise the argument of bias caused by omitting any adequate variables. In the light of the results obtained in the research, the most significant variables affecting the property crime in Poland are best rooted in the deterrence theory as well as in the routine activities theory. Consequently, preventive and operation actions aimed at curbing crime should benefit from the conclusions and solutions proposed by these theories.","Uniwersytet Lodzki, Katedra Modeli & Prognoz Ekonometrycznych, Lodzki, Poland",University of Lodz,"Florczak, W (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Lodzki, Katedra Modeli & Prognoz Ekonometrycznych, Lodzki, Poland.",emfwaf@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,69,0,0,0,7,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2012,,6,,,,,735,764,,,,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,075DQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313864400004,0

International research shows that the persistence of the gender pay gap may be due to the fact that although the gap in characteristics between men and women is diminishing, changes in the wage structure counteract this change. This article will study whether this 'swimming upstream' phenomenon is also playing a role in the rather slow convergence between male and female wages in the Netherlands. Our results indicate that this is not the case; most of the changes in the Dutch wage structure have been rather favourable to women. The lacking convergence in wages has to be explained from the fact that despite the favourable changes, the Dutch wage structure still contains a considerable implicit gender bias.","[Fransen, Eva; Plantenga, Janneke; Vlasblom, Jan Dirk] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Univ Sch Econ, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Vlasblom, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Univ Sch Econ, Janskerkhof 12, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands.",J.Vlasblom@scp.nl,,,,,,,31,11,14,2,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This model, based on imported capital goods, uses Mauritius' data on capital investment, employment, export partners' growth and terms of trade to estimate price and income elasticities of export demand, total factor productivity growth and economies of scale. These elasticities are then used to assess how the growth in export partners' income is converted into domestic growth. The implications of the presence of low or high export demand elasticities are discussed by relating them to various strands of trade and growth literature.

The short-run dynamics conveys that there is a unidirectional Granger causality running from energy consumption to greenhouse gas emissions; from economic growth to greenhouse gas emissions and a weak unidirectional causality running from greenhouse gas emissions to energy consumption; from economic growth to energy consumption.

In contrast with previous related literature that found a substantial negative wage impact but minimal employment impact in samples of highly educated men, the empirical evidence presented here suggests a different outcome for the less well educated, and between the sexes. Women, but not men, who graduate high school in an adverse labor market are less likely to be in the workforce for the next four years, but longer-term effects are minimal. Further, while men increase their enrollment as a short-run response to weak labor demand, women do not; instead, they appear temporarily to substitute into home production. Women's wages are less affected than men's, and both groups' wages are less affected than the college graduates previously studied.","Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Hershbein, BJ (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",bjhersh@umich.edu,,"Hershbein, Brad/0000-0002-2534-8164","NICHD NIH HHS [T32 HD007339, R24 HD041028] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,34,46,56,0,27,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Nicaraguan emigrants are fairly evenly distributed between the US and Costa Rica. Poorer migrants overwhelmingly migrate to Costa Rica; richer migrants favour the US. This bi-directional flow provides an opportunity to examine the distributional impacts of remittances in a situation that offers distinct opportunities to different groups of prospective migrants. To this end, we use Heckman's (1979) sample selection method to predict counterfactual 'no-migration' consumption figures for Nicaraguan households whose members have emigrated. Using these estimates, we are able to compare the current situation to one in which migration had not occurred. We find that migration to Costa Rica results in increased per capita household consumption for poor households, while migration to the US leads to increase in middle class households. The rate, depth and severity of poverty as measured by the Foster, Greer, Thorbecke Indices (Foster et al., 1984) decrease, though only slightly. However, inequality appears to increase, likely because the middle class benefits from US migration, while the poor tend to make it no farther than Costa Rica.","[Jameson, Kenneth P.] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Hobbs, Andrew W.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6R 2X1, Canada",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of British Columbia,"Jameson, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, 260 Cent Campus Dr,Rm 343, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",jameson@economics.utah.edu,,,,,,,24,13,16,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In programme design leeway is left to regional actors. Using administrative data and Propensity Score (PS) matching, this article investigates the association between programme design and effectiveness, so as to provide insight on how to increase programme effectiveness. First, effects of different types of One-Euro-Jobs according to planned duration and weekly working hours compared to 'waiting' are estimated. Second, programme types are compared directly to disentangle selection and programme effects. As expected lock-in effects are larger for participations with a longer planned duration, but not for those with longer weekly working hours. One-Euro-Jobs do not generally increase the employment prospects for East German men beyond 2 years after programme start and longer and more intensive participations even decrease employment prospects. In West Germany, One-Euro-Jobs generally increase the employment chances and longer participations lead to slightly greater employment opportunities roughly 2 years after programme start. The initial advantages of short participations decrease over time. Following these results, a reallocation of participants might improve programme effectiveness.","Inst Employment Res, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Hohmeyer, K (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",katrin.hohmeyer@iab.de,,,,,,,37,12,12,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Findings of a significantly negative coefficient on income and a significantly positive estimate on the quadratic term are commonly taken as evidence supporting the inverted-U Kuznets curve. Although intuitive, Lind and Mehlum (2010) argued that the conventional approach is flawed and proposed an appropriate test for a U-shaped association. We revisit the validity of the Kuznets hypothesis by applying the novel testing strategy of Lind and Mehlum (2010) to annual US data over the period 1917 to 2007. Inconsistent with the Kuznets hypothesis, the test results overwhelmingly reject the combined null hypothesis of an inverted-U or monotone relationship in favour of a U-shaped linkage between income inequality and economic development. Moreover, the results are robust to changes in inequality measures and functional specifications.","[Yeh, Chih-Chuan] Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 407, Taiwan; [Huang, Ho-Chuan (River)] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan; [Lin, Yi-Chen] Tamkang Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Tamkang University,"Yeh, CC (通讯作者)，Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, 100 Chiao Kwang Rd, Taichung 407, Taiwan.",robert@ocu.edu.tw,,"Huang, Ho-Chuan/0000-0002-9763-0572",,,,,16,11,13,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The countries are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. I construct a search model for workers in temporary jobs which predicts that shorter duration raises search intensity. Calibration of the model to the ECHP data implies that at least 75% of the increase in search intensity over the life of a 2+ year temporary contract occurs in the last six months of the contract. I then estimate regression models for search effort that control for human capital, pay, local unemployment, and individual and time fixed effects. I find that workers on temporary jobs indeed search harder than those on permanent jobs. Moreover, search intensity increases as temporary job duration falls, and roughly 84% of this increase occurs on average in the shortest duration jobs. These results are robust to disaggregation by gender and by country. These empirical results are noteworthy, since it is not necessary to assume myopia or hyperbolic discounting in order to explain them, although the data clearly also do not rule out such explanations.

The ESG indicators thus become important performance benchmarks for investors in the European Union and other parts of the world. Performance indicators in the Czech manufacturing industry were researched in Project No. P403/11/2085 Construction of Methods for Multi-Factorial Assessment of Company Complex Performance in Selected Sectors at the Faculty of Business and Management, Brno University of Technology (BUT FBM), funded by Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (GACR). The article intends to propose performance indicators of corporate governance suitable for companies in manufacturing industries per CZ-NACE. These performance indicators of corporate governance are the result of an extensive review and a theoretical assessment of numerous literary sources, various materials of international organizations (such as GRI, UNCTAD, IFAC, IFRS, EFFAS-DVFA, CFA), OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, and EU Green Paper, the essence of which was incorporated into the questionnaires used in the survey. Seventy-nine companies were selected from the compiled data base and personally contacted. These were legal enterprises with more than 250 employees by the EU criteria. Selection of significant indicators proceeded from the inlet database, analysed and verified by cluster analysis. The objective of cluster analysis working with all initial input indicators, obtained by the analysis of available expert sources and empirical research, was the identification of particularities of variables, having any impact on the results of other methods of subsequent research stages. Selection of significant indicators for reviewed industry from the input database was the aim. The purpose was not to substitute identified database, but to establish an alternative file of appropriate variables. The objective of further data processing was the reduction of original broad file of indicators, namely by expert analysis and subsequent decision made by the team of authors, representing the input for subsequent application of multi-dimensional statistical method. The factor analysis yielded four categories of corporate governance measurement areas: 1) Monitoring and Reporting 2) CG Effectiveness 3) CG Structure 4) Compliance. The company itself should select its key Corporate Governance indicators on the basis of their significance and from the point of its strategy. These performance indicators should facilitate the companies to prove the progress towards sustainability objectives and to guarantee their environmental, social and economic impact coverage.

Our study using an event study approach examines the effects of OTIA (technology import and joint R&D) announcements of firms in Korea, one of the leading developing and highly innovative countries. We find that the announcements of OTIA produce positive average abnormal returns. Interestingly, unlike the prior studies on developed country firms, OTIA with firms in the homogenous industry leads to greater firm value than that involving firms in heterogenic industries. This implies an importance of a technological fusion with external firms in different industries for value of developing country firms.

We consider trade unions incentives to oppose or endorse labour-saving technology and firms incentives to invest in such technology. Increased flexicurity interpreted as less employment protection and a higher reservation wage for workers unambiguously increases firms incentives for technology adoption. If unions have some direct influence on technology, a higher reservation wage also makes unions more willing to accept technological change. Less employment protection has the opposite effect, as this increases the downside (job losses) of labour-saving technology.","[Lommerud, Kjell Erik] Univ Bergen, NO-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Minho, P-4704553 Braga, Portugal",University of Bergen; Universidade do Minho,"Lommerud, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, NO-5007 Bergen, Norway.",kjell-erik.lommerud@econ.uib.no; o.r.straume@eeg.uminho.pt,"Straume, Odd Rune/B-6090-2009","Straume, Odd Rune/0000-0002-6889-2717",,,,,40,18,18,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

The evidence suggest that during 1971-2000, FDI had no effect on either short-or long-run economic growth in Argentina, while privatisation had negative significant effects on economic growth in the long run only.","Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Naguib, RI (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",rania.naguib@plymouth.ac.uk,,"Naguib, Rania/0000-0001-8104-2971",,,,,80,5,5,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The multiple empirical evidence obtained allows us to conclude that the survival determinants of young SMEs are considerably different from those of the old SMEs: (1) determinants related to scale effects, financial situation and macroeconomic situation are of greater relative importance in explaining young SMEs' survival; and (2) a determinant related to technological intensity is of greater relative importance in explaining old SMEs' survival.

The principle hypothesis behind the work is that the ROA provides a foundation for long-term growth as a type of fundamental variable, and that this growth provides a buffer against systemic risk in the sense that sustainable growth provides resources for debt provision and employment stimulation. The emergence of a viable ROA is crucial for long waves of growth which stimulate both private sector profit and public sector tax receipts which (using conventional terminology) reduce the structural deficit for both sectors. Low rates of long-term growth, therefore, provide a good indicator of the emergence of long wave systemic risk (LWSR), which left such nations vulnerable to uncertainty, financial crisis and recession. The paper investigates the inability of growth for various decades to cover instabilities associated with the Great Crisis, leading to high rates of LWSR, especially for European and North American nations that bore the brunt of the crisis.","Global Polit Econ Res Unit, Bentley, WA, Australia",,"O'Hara, PA (通讯作者)，Global Polit Econ Res Unit, Bentley, WA, Australia.",philohara@yahoo.com,,,,,,,18,7,7,1,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,1,,,,,1,12,,10.2298/PAN12010010,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,916OR,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302113600001,0

The position of 27 Ukrainian regions was analyzed by the means of multivariate statistical methods respecting the multidimensional character of selected social economic variables. The current variables were obtained from the database of State Statistics Service of the Ukraine. Chosen data sets are suitable for describing fields such as Industry, Investment, Household Income, Wages and Their payment, Labour Market, Demographic situation, Environment. By the factor analysis the data sets were reduced and the authors of the article identified four regional competitiveness factors (Economic Development Factor, Industrial Production Factor, Migration and Employment Rate Factor, Labour Market Factor). Factor scores were obtained as an additional result of the factor analysis and consequently were used as input variables for the cluster analysis. As the result of the multivariate classification the groups of regions with similar levels of regional competitiveness were found. The results of cluster analysis were evaluated by means of a dendrogram in two linkage distances. When the higher distance level (linkage distance equal to 7, Ward method, Euclidean distance) was applied, the original number of 27 regions naturally formed two clusters. By decreasing the linkage distance from the original one to the new lower distance equal to 4, we can get a more detailed classification of Ukrainian regions. The created regional clusters are discussed in the article regarding their current regional competitiveness and economic development.","[Odehnal, Jakub; Sedlacik, Marek; Michalek, Jaroslav] Univ Def, Brno 66210, Czech Republic",University of Defence - Czech Republic,"Odehnal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Def, Kounicova 65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic.",jakub.odhnal@unob.cz; marek.sedlacik@unob.cz; michalek@fme.vutbr.cz,"Sedlačík, Marek/AAX-8360-2021",,,,,,23,5,5,0,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It is argued that uncertainty about future income and legal status (in case of immigrants) is a key component in the determination of the level of precautionary savings. Using the German dataset, we exploit a natural experiment arising from a change in the nationality law in Germany to estimate the importance of precautionary savings. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach, we find a significant reduction in savings and remittances for immigrants after the easing of citizenship requirements, compared to the pre-reform period. Our parametric specification shows that introduction of the new nationality law reduces the gap in marginal propensity to save between natives and immigrants by up to 80%. These findings suggest that many of the differences in terms of the savings behaviour between natives and immigrants are driven by the savings arising from the uncertainties about future income and legal status rather than cultural differences.","[Piracha, M.; Zhu, Y.] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England; [Piracha, M.] IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Kent; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Zhu, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",Y.Zhu-5@kent.ac.uk,"Zhu, Yu/F-2586-2010","Zhu, Yu/0000-0003-2805-4302; Piracha, Matloob/0000-0003-0885-349X",,,,,10,15,17,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Furthermore, Catholics attach more importance to thrift and are more risk averse, while Protestants combine a more external locus of control with a greater sense of financial responsibility. Religious households are more likely to save. Catholic households invest less frequently in the stock market. Economic attitudes are particularly helpful in explaining the financial decisions of Catholic households.","[Renneboog, Luc; Spaenjers, Christophe] Tilburg Univ, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Renneboog, L (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",luc.renneboog@uvt.nl; c.spaenjers@uvt.nl,"Spaenjers, Christophe/K-9105-2015","Spaenjers, Christophe/0000-0003-0087-9564",,,,,50,144,164,2,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Our analysis is conducted on a cross-section of 107 countries; we focus on national causes and consequences of the crisis, ignoring cross-country contagion effects. Our model of the incidence of the crisis combines 2008 changes in real GDP, the stock market, country credit ratings, and the exchange rate. We explore the linkages between these manifestations of the crisis and a number of its possible causes from 2006 and earlier. We include over sixty potential causes of the crisis, covering such categories as: financial system policies and conditions; asset price appreciation in real estate and equity markets; international imbalances and foreign reserve adequacy; macroeconomic policies; and institutional and geographic features. Despite the fact that we use a wide number of possible causes in a flexible statistical framework, we are unable to link most of the commonly cited causes of the crisis to its incidence across countries. This negative finding in the cross-section makes us skeptical of the accuracy of early warning systems of potential crises, which must also predict their timing.

The study finds a long-run equilibrium relationship between output and infrastructure along with other relevant variables, such as gross domestic capital formation (GDCF), labor force, international trade and human capital. The results reveal that GDCF, labor force, export and expenditure on human capital exhibit a positive contribution to output. More importantly, infrastructure development contributes significantly to output growth in South Asia.

With a set of newly available variables for the years 2002, 2004 and 2006 that measure individual health more accurately and including risk-attitudes towards health we find that possible endogeneity of the insurance choice is not a problem. A latent class approach that takes into account the panel structure of the data reveals that especially individuals who have few doctor visits, the low users, respond strongest to insurance status and income. In this group we find that more insurance increases the demand for physician visits and there is a pro-rich inequity in health care utilization. No such effects are found for the high users.","Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschafts Forsch RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Schmitz, H (通讯作者)，Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschafts Forsch RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",schmitz@rwi-essen.de,,"Schmitz, Hendrik/0000-0002-0253-102X",,,,,38,9,9,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We examine the validity of RIRP from the nonlinear point of view and provide robust evidence that clearly indicates that RIRP holds true for eight countries in this region. It implies that the choices and effectiveness of the monetary and fiscal policies in the East Asian economies will be highly influenced by external factors originating from China.

The South African government has set a goal of halving poverty by 2014, although the meaning of this goal has not yet been defined. This article frames government's stated target of halving poverty by 2014 in terms of specific measures of the poverty gap and poverty headcount ratio, using income and expenditure survey microdata. With the poverty line as defined here, approximately half the South African population falls below the poverty line. Despite this, the aggregate poverty gap is surprisingly small at about 3% of gross domestic product. Projections of poverty in 2014 under various growth scenarios indicate that growth alone will be insufficient to halve poverty by then, and that any worsening of distribution will put the target of halving poverty by 2014 far beyond reach. However, projections of the effects of a range of growth and distributional scenarios on poverty, using a new method for simulating pro-poor distributional change, indicate that halving poverty appears feasible with moderate growth rates and fairly mild pro-poor distributional change. The results are indicative as to the scale of distributional changes necessary to halve poverty under various growth scenarios.","Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Tregenna, F (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa.",ftregenna@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,44,7,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The process of financialisation that took place in the 1980s in the USA and then in the European Union was coupled with labour flexibility, wage moderation and soaring profits. The flexibility agenda of the labour market and the end of wage increases, along with the contraction of indirect wages (i.e. public social expenditure), diminished workers' purchasing power. This was partly compensated with increased borrowing opportunities and the boom of credit consumption, all of which helped workers to maintain unstable consumption capacity. However, in the long term, unstable consumption patterns derived from precarious job creation, job instability and poor wages have weakened aggregate demand. Hence, labour market issues such as flexibility, uneven income distribution, poor wages and the financial crisis are two sides of the same coin. Both have a direct impact on the economic crisis and the current global imbalances.","Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Tridico, P (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy.",tridico@uniroma3.it,,,,,,,59,82,86,4,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In this setup we show that there is a range of equilibria, from the zero profit one where low-risks implicitly subsidize high risks, to one where firms obtain profits with both types of consumers. Moreover, we show that rents only partially dissipate if we assume free entry. Along these equilibria, high risks always obtain full insurance, while the low risks' coverage decreases as the firms' profits increase.","[Willington, Manuel] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Recreo, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Alegria, Alexander] Pontificia Univ Javeriana Cali, Cali, Colombia",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Willington, M (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Recreo, Vina Del Mar, Chile.",manuel.willington@uai.cl; aalegria@javerianacali.edu.co,"Willington, Manuel/ABD-8214-2020; Willington, Manuel/H-4035-2018","Willington, Manuel/0000-0002-2803-6641; Willington, Manuel/0000-0002-2803-6641",,,,,38,1,1,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The second part is aimed at estimating the relative material deprivation in the Czech and Slovak regions using EU SILC 2006-2008 microdata, i.e. approximately 15 years after the split. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the relative material deprivation rates between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and among their regions. According to the results, the level of deprivation is higher in Slovakia, and deprived households are highly concentrated in the eastern part of Slovakia. The regions can be divided into five clusters, while the Czech Capital Prague Region has a special position. It has the highest level of housing deprivation and the lowest level of durables/economic strain deprivation.","[Zelinsky, Tomas] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Kosice, Slovakia; [Zelinsky, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic",Technical University Kosice; Charles University Prague,"Zelinsky, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Kosice, Slovakia.",tomas.zelinsky@tuke.sk,"Zelinsky, Tomas/D-1539-2010","Zelinsky, Tomas/0000-0001-7198-0278",,,,,48,15,15,0,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,3,,,,,335,353,,10.2298/PAN1203335Z,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,964RB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305713300006,0

To stabilize the market and protect farmers, many countries have introduced a target zone policy, together with product purchasing or price subsidy strategies. This article analyzes the effect of a target zone with different strategies operating in a coordinated manner. The results show that a target zone policy with agricultural product purchases does not necessarily stabilize agricultural product wholesale prices, but is able to stabilize manufacturing product prices, if the price effect is smaller than the sum of the wealth and asset effects for agricultural products and the price effect is larger than the interest rate effect for manufacturing products. On the contrary, a target zone policy with an agricultural product price subsidy will generate the honeymoon effect for agricultural product wholesale prices, but will result in unstableperformance of manufacturing product prices.

The central question is whether the wage cushion-i.e., the difference between actual wages and collectively agreed-upon (maximum) contractual wages-contributes to the fact that wages continue increasing at older ages. We follow the wages of individual workers in twenty-two sectors of industry in the Netherlands using administrative data for the period 2006-2010. In the public sector, we find no evidence of a wage cushion. Wage scale ceilings set in collective agreements are guiding for older workers' wages, and workers earning a contractual wage equal to a wage scale ceiling are not compensated with higher additional wages. In the private sector, we do find evidence of a wage cushion. Wage scale ceilings are less restrictive and workers earning a contractual wage exceeding the highest wage scale ceiling experience higher contractual wage growth. The private sector wage cushion enhances wage differentiation and allows for wages that continue increasing at older ages.","[Deelen, Anja; Euwals, Rob] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [Euwals, Rob] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Euwals, Rob] IZA, Bonn, Germany",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Tilburg University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Deelen, A (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.",A.P.Deelen@cpb.nl,,,,,,,15,6,6,2,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2014,162.0,4,,,,,433,460,,10.1007/s10645-014-9237-5,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS3IE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344170000007,0

The tax rates on positional goods are higher than in the absence of status effects, reflecting their Pigouvian role.

Using an open economy dynamic general equilibrium model with sticky prices, we investigate the economic implications of the loss of monetary policy flexibility associated with EMU for each of these economies. The main benefit of this general equilibrium approach is that we can directly evaluate the effects of monetary policy in terms of welfare. Our findings suggest that the Czech Republic and Poland may experience sizable welfare costs as a result of joining the EMU. Results for Hungary are less striking as welfare costs in this country seem to be negligible in the benchmark economy.

Structural oil price shocks add to our understanding of the 2008 stock market crash. I find that unexpected reductions in world oil supply do not affect stock returns in any of six OECD countries. Although an increase in global aggregate demand consistently raises oil prices and cumulative real stock returns, the effect is more persistent for oil exporters. Other, e.g., precautionary oil demand shocks have a detrimental impact on stock markets in oil-importing countries, a statistically insignificant effect for Canada, and a significantly positive effect for Norway. Oil price shocks account for a larger share of the variation in aggregate international stock returns than in national stock returns.","[Guentner, Jochen H.

We find some evidence that cash flow has a positive impact on the change in cash holdings (i.e. that the cash flow sensitivity of cash is positive) and that the positive impact of cash flow on the change in cash holdings is larger and more significant in the case of smaller and presumably more constrained firms than in the case of larger and presumably less constrained firms in both developed and developing economies. Both of these findings corroborate the importance of financial constraints in Asian firms. In addition, we find that the cash flow sensitivity of cash declined after the global financial crisis and that Tobin's q has a positive impact on the change in cash holdings, especially in the case of larger and presumably unconstrained firms.","[Horioka, Charles Yuji] Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Univ Philippines, Sch Econ, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka, Japan; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Terada-Hagiwara, Akiko] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; Osaka University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Asian Development Bank,"Horioka, CY (通讯作者)，Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Ohtemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan.",horioka@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Horioka, Charles Yuji/AFE-9181-2022",,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330083] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,23,15,15,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

With the introduction of the futures, the paper shows that an informed trader's position of futures usually motivates him or her to trade more aggressively in the stock market at the expiration day. This also worsens the adverse selection problem and makes the stock market become less liquid. Moreover, the increase of the informed trading accelerates the information revelation and improves market efficiency on the expiration date.

We find that income of cadre households was approximately 10 percent higher than that of non-cadre households on a per capita basis. The cadre income premium did not come from agricultural income but mainly from non-agricultural sources, especially the income from the village and the government. We also find that cadre income premiums were much larger and more significant in economically advanced regions than in less developed regions and in villages that exhibited higher income inequality than their counterparts. Furthermore, this study shows that newly elected cadre households acquired the economic gains immediately and cadre households lost the economic gains immediately when they lost their cadre status, which implies that the cadre economic gains were less likely attributable to human capital of cadres but mainly due to cadre status. Our findings provide evidence for the ongoing debate on distribution of economic gains during the process of transition in emerging market economies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Environmental damages due to economic activities may be irreversible and the level at which the degradation becomes irreversible is unknown. Particular attention is paid to the situation where agents are relatively impatient and/or do not care a lot about the environment and/or Nature regenerates at low rate. We show that the optimal policy of the uncertain problem drives the economy in the long run toward a steady state while, when ignoring irreversibility, the economy follows a balanced growth path accompanied by a perpetual decrease in environmental quality and consumption, both asymptotically converging toward zero. Therefore, accounting for the risk of irreversibility induces more conservative decisions regarding consumption and polluting emissions. In general, however, we cannot rule out situations where the economy will optimally follow an irreversible path and consequently will also be left, in the long run, with an irreversibly degraded environment.","[Le Kama, Alain Ayong] Univ Paris 10, EconomiX, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Pommeret, Aude] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Prieur, Fabien] INRA, UMR LAMETA, Montpellier, France; [Prieur, Fabien] Univ Montpellier I, F-34006 Montpellier, France",Universite Paris Nanterre; University of Lausanne; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Universite de Montpellier,"Le Kama, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 10, EconomiX, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",alain.ayonglekama@u-paris10.fr; apommeret@unil.ch; prieur@supagro.inra.fr,"PRIEUR, Fabien/AAT-9498-2020","Prieur, Fabien/0000-0002-6651-304X; POMMERET, Aude/0000-0002-9160-2095",,,,,26,14,14,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Decision makers switch between these forecasting heuristics based on satisficing evolutionary dynamics. We show that convergence toward an equilibrium consistent with the level of output and rate of inflation targeted by policymakers is achieved regardless of whether or not the satisficing evolutionary dynamics that guide the choices agents make between inflation forecasting strategies are subject to noise. We also show that full credulity-a situation where all agents eventually use the forecasting heuristic based on the target rate of inflation-is neither a necessary condition for realization of the inflation target nor an inevitable consequence of the economy's achievement of this target. These results demonstrate that uncertainty in decision making resulting in norm-based inflation expectations that are both heterogeneous and time-varying need not thwart the successful conduct of macroeconomic policy.","[Lima, Gilberto Tadeu] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Setterfield, Mark] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Setterfield, Mark] Trinity Coll, Dept Econ, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [da Silveira, Jaylson Jair] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Econ & Int Relat, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; The New School; Trinity College; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Lima, GT (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,"Silveira, Jaylson J.

Prior to the crisis, both the international and the domestic authorities issued warnings concerning the emergence of system-wide risks in the financial sector. However, these warnings did not result in significant changes in the behaviour of the banks, which were the main addressees of the warnings. The article analyses the practice and effectiveness of macroprudential warnings in relation to the European Central Bank and the competent Hungarian authorities.

In this context, the family environment plays a strategic role, as during childhood, it represents the most important institution for child development. This paper evaluates the long-term impact of various family difficulties during childhood on adult labor market outcomes. Evidence of negative impacts on employment probability and wages emerges from applying propensity score matching to the UK National Child Development Study. Simulation-based sensitivity analysis and standard parametric techniques support our findings. We also find that the intensity of the negative impact appears to increase with the number of recorded family difficulties, while the negative effect does not decline over the cohort's working life. Moreover, we find that housing and economic (financial and unemployment) problems are responsible for the more serious disadvantages, while disabilities of family members and familial disharmony do not produce statistically negative impacts per se but tend to do so only if associated with other family difficulties, including economic and housing difficulties.","[Millemaci, Emanuele] Univ Messina, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Ambientali & Meto, I-98100 Messina, Italy; [Sciulli, Dario] Univ G dAnnunzio, Dipartimento Econ, I-65127 Pescara, Italy",University of Messina; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Millemaci, E (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Ambientali & Meto, Via Cannizzaro 278, I-98100 Messina, Italy.",millemaci@unime.it; d.sciulli@unich.it,"SCIULLI, DARIO/C-2210-2016","SCIULLI, DARIO/0000-0003-1844-1851; Millemaci, Emanuele/0000-0002-9095-7513",,,,,46,4,4,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Which reform will be chosen depends on the initial degree of resource inequality between the elite and the mass. The probability of a successful revolution plays a role in implementing either economic or political reforms only when the resource disparity is not too severe. In this case political reform is more likely when the probability of revolution is lower and revolution is not costly and the introduction of market oriented system greatly improves the efficiency of the economy. It is also found that, when the introduction of market oriented system is enough for the prevention of revolution, the elite extract more from the mass with a higher tax rate as the probability of revolution becomes higher. With severe inequality in resource distribution, the elite give up their political power and democratic market oriented economic system is the only equilibrium outcome. We also consider conditions under which either economic or political reform is not enough to prevent revolution.","Hallym Univ, Dept Econ, Chunchon 200702, South Korea",Hallym University,"Noh, SJ (通讯作者)，Hallym Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Okchon Dong, Chunchon 200702, South Korea.",sjnoh@hallym.ac.kr,,,,,,,9,1,1,1,11,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

Conventional characterizations of the process of bringing new advanced manufacturing products to market usually leave out two important elements: One is proof-of-concept research to establish broad technology platforms that can then be used as a basis for developing actual products. The second is a technical infrastructure of infratechnologies that include the analytical tools and standards needed for measuring and classifying the components of the new technology; metrics and methods for determining the adequacy of the multiple performance attributes of the technology; and the interfaces among hardware and software components that must work together for a complex product to perform as specified. If the public-private dynamics are not properly aligned to encourage proof-of-concept research and needed infratechnologies, then promising advances in basic science can easily fall into a valley of death and fail to evolve into modern advanced manufacturing technologies that are ready for the marketplace. Each major technology has a degree of uniqueness that demands government support sufficiently sophisticated to allow efficient adaptation to the needs of its particular industry, whether semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, computers, communications equipment, medical equipment, or some other technology-based industry.","[Tassey, Gregory] Univ Washington, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Tassey, Gregory] NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA,"Tassey, G (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",gtassey@outlook.com,,,,,,,46,61,75,3,68,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The primary finding is that the price of imported inputs and nontradable sector productivity are the two most important sources of macroeconomic fluctuations in a typical emerging market economy. Interest rates and the price of imported final goods also play a significant role in driving investment and import fluctuations. The model also produces significant sectoral asymmetry, especially in response to interest rate shocks. Variable capital utilization acts as a strong propagation mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The authors experimentally investigate the role of imitation when participants face a task which is costly in cognitive terms. In order to disentangle different choice dynamics, they devise a laboratory experiment with a novel experimental task in which they model the choice of different alternatives through high or low cognitive costs and feedback information provided to subjects. Their results provide evidence for imitative behavior driven by under-confidence about own skills and by the beliefs regarding others' performance. They also find a temporal pattern in the distribution of choices, both in the high-cost and low-cost cognitive conditions, that may represent another cognitive shortcut.","[Cicognani, Simona] Univ Trent, Sch Social Sci, I-38100 Trento, Italy; [Mittone, Luigi] Univ Trent, Cognit & Expt Econ Lab, I-38100 Trento, Italy",University of Trento; University of Trento,"Cicognani, S (通讯作者)，Univ Trent, Sch Social Sci, I-38100 Trento, Italy.",simona.cicognani@unitn.it,,"Mittone, Luigi/0000-0001-6521-7698; Cicognani, Simona/0000-0001-6825-7038",,,,,25,1,1,0,6,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,NOV 4,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201436.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-36,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CL3ZZ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356893000001,0

Prior to NHI, government workers (the control group) possessed health insurance policies with comprehensive coverage for births and infant medical care services. Private sector industrial workers and farmers (the treatment groups) lacked this coverage. All households received coverage in 1995. Since stringent requirements for reporting births introduced in 1994 produced artificial upward trends in early infant deaths, we focus on post-neonatal mortality. The introduction of NHI led to reductions in this rate for infants born in farm households but not for infants born in private sector households. For the former group, the rate fell by between 0.3 and 0.6 deaths per thousand survivors or by between 8 and 16%.

These results are extended to discontinuous large generalized games assuming that only payoff functions are subject to perturbations. We apply our results in an electoral game with a continuum of Cournot-Nash equilibria, where the unique essential equilibrium is that only politically engaged players participate in the electoral process.

We relate the obtained overconfidence measures to trading activity in call and continuous experimental asset markets. Our results confirm prior findings that classical miscalibration measures are not related to trading activity. Misperception of signal reliability is positively related to trading volume in the continuous market for one of two treatments. In the other one, no relation is found except that highly overconfident subjects trade less. In addition, we find that men trade more than women at high levels of risk aversion, but the gender trading gap vanishes as risk aversion lessens. The reason is that the trading activity of women seems to be more sensitive to risk attitudes than that of men. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This parameter affects the equilibrium provision of productive individual labor (that increases the respective individual input contribution) but also the propensity to sabotage others (which decreases the input contributions of sabotaged individuals). The theoretical analysis shows that sharing rules in which more weight is put on equal sharing induce zero sabotage in equilibrium; however, they might also lead to inefficient underproduction. In contrast, sharing rules that are highly sensitive with respect to relative input contributions lead to destructive sabotage activities and moreover to inefficient overproduction.","TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Econ, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Franke, J (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Econ, Vogelpothsweg 87, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.",joerg.franke@tu-dortmund.de,,"Franke, Jorg/0000-0002-8525-1321",,,,,23,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Previous research suggests that PBCs should be larger when voters are uninformed about politician characteristics and politicians are less credible. Research on political parties suggests that older parties are more likely to attenuate problems of both information and credible commitment. The effects of party age are robust to controls for numerous other political characteristics of countries. In particular, the arguments and evidence here illuminate a mechanism underlying recent robust findings that PBCs are larger in younger democracies: party age fully accounts for these effects.

During the period of Bank of Canada forward guidance, market determined forward rates diverge considerably from the recommendations implied by the SMPC. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that the Bank of Canada and the SMPC coordinate their future views about the interest rate path. Finally, changes in views about future changes in policy rates for horizons beyond the next two interest rate decisions are difficult to explain. Our findings imply that there remain challenges in understanding the evolution of future interest rate paths over time.

It shows that increased substitutability weakens the interest groups' incentives to lobby and reduces tariff distortions. This may explain why empirical tests of PFS find surprisingly little impact of lobbies on the government's trade policy decision.

The purpose of this paper is to reconcile these results by considering nonlinear costs of information acquisition. The main result of this paper is a necessary and sufficient condition for welfare to increase with public information. Using it, we show that costs of information acquisition are linear if and only if welfare necessarily increases with public information. Thus, welfare can decrease with public information for any strictly convex costs. This is because convex costs mitigate the so-called crowding-out effect of public information on private information, thereby making the social value of public information with endogenous precision closer to that with exogenous precision.

The proposed hedonic approach simultaneously controls for time-invariant unobserved product effects and age effects, that can be interpreted as a proxy for time-variant unobservables. The results show that the non-adjusted price index largely overstates the increase in the cost of living induced by changes in car prices and that the previous evidence for this market has not measured the real extent of that bias, probably due to the omission of controls for unobservables. It is also shown that omitting age effects can lead to misleading conclusions. In particular, their omission would imply that the year-on-year Spanish Consumer Price Index would have been overestimated by around on average during the sample period. Excluding both the controls for age effects and time-invariant unobservables would have increased this bias to .

However, our analysis also shows that the inequality effects of capital tax reductions are lower over the transition period compared with the long run.","[Angelopoulos, Konstantinos; Malley, James R.] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Fernandez, Bernardo X.] Univ Catolica Boliviana San Pablo, La Paz, Bolivia",University of Glasgow,"Angelopoulos, K (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021140/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021140/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,42,4,4,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2014,81.0,324,,,,,747,767,,10.1111/ecca.12087,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AO8FL,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341588800007,0

The reform caused municipalities in NRW to increase their business and property tax rates. I study within the difference in difference (DD) and the spatial lag (SL) frameworks whether municipalities in NDS bordering NRW did react to the exogenous tax increases by NRW municipalities. The DD and SL results suggest that there are no interactions in tax rates. In contrast, traditional SL regressions that rely on variation in neighbors' demographic and political characteristics for identification provide strong evidence for immediate strategic interactions. These results indicate that most of the existing literature overestimates the importance of local tax mimicking. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Yet a small literature in economics has consistently found that traditional teaching raises test scores, while the effect of modern teaching appears to be small and sometimes even negative. This paper uses data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) to show that traditional and modern teaching practices promote different cognitive skills in students. In particular, traditional teaching practices increase students' factual knowledge and their competency in solving routine problems, but have no significant effect on their reasoning skills. The effects of modern teaching practices are exactly the opposite, with modern teaching fostering reasoning skills. I provide evidence that standardized tests do not measure reasoning skills well, which explains the finding of only small or negative effects of modern teaching on test scores in the literature. I discuss the implications of these results for the recommendations made by National Teaching Standards. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These measures overcome some of the limitations of traditional measures of intergenerational mobility such as the intergenerational elasticity, which are not well suited for analyzing directional movements or for examining differences in mobility across the income distribution. Data for each country include highly comparable, administrative data sources containing sufficiently long time spans of earnings. Our most basic measures of directional mobility, which simply compare whether sons moved up or down in the earnings distribution relative to their fathers, do not differ much across the countries. However, we do find that there are clear differences in the extent of the movement We find larger cross-country differences in downward mobility from the top of the distribution than upward mobility from the bottom. Canada has the most downward mobility while the U.S. ha's the least, with Sweden in the middle. We find some differences in upward mobility but these are somewhat smaller in magnitude. An important caveat is that our analysis may be sensitive to the concept of income we use and broader measures such as family income could lead to different conclusions. Also, small differences in rank mobility translate into rather large differences in absolute mobility measured in dollars, due to large differences in income inequality across countries.

The efficiency in producing good matches of the formal market is compared to that of social networks. It is assumed that links between workers represent favoring relationships: workers recommend each other for any kinds of jobs, regardless of the quality of the resulting match. This study shows that as the fraction of ties connecting similar agents (homophily) increases, the level of mismatch decreases. If this fraction is sufficiently high, networks provide good matches at a higher rate than the formal market, for any efficiency level of the market. In this case, the mismatch level is lower in economies with social networks than it would be if workers did not use social contacts for job search. Hence, the presence of social networks can reduce mismatch despite favoritism. Implications of mismatch creation for the expected wages of jobs obtainable through different search methods are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A parsimonious explanation is that incentives that appeal to self-regarding economic motives may crowd out noneconomic motives such as altruism, reciprocity, intrinsic motivation, ethical values, and other social preferences, leading to disappointing and sometimes even counterproductive incentive effects. We present evidence from behavioral experiments that crowding may take two forms: categorical (the effect on preferences depends only on the presence or absence of the incentive) or marginal (the effect depends on the extent of the incentive). We extend an earlier contribution (Bowles and Hwang, 2008) to include categorical crowding, thus providing a more general framework for the study of optimal incentives and as a result, an expanded range of situations for which the sophisticated planner will (surprisingly) make greater use of incentives when incentives crowd out social preferences than when motivational crowding is absent.","[Hwang, Sung-ha] Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Bowles, Samuel] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM USA",Sogang University; The Santa Fe Institute,"Hwang, SH (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, 35 Baekbeom Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",sunghah@sogang.ac.kr; samuel.bowles@gmail.com,"Hwang, Sung-Ha/AAB-4907-2021; Hwang, Sung-Ha/A-9942-2017",,,,,,30,6,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Equilibrium effort increases in team size when substitutability is low relative to returns to scale. Effort levels are actually strategic complements when returns to scale exceed the substitutability of members' effort. Moreover, even with equal shares the well-known 1/n problem is determined by returns to scale and becomes worse as returns increase. While a target scheme can support the optimal output level as an equilibrium, it does not completely deter free riding. A team member will accommodate shirking by increasing their own effort within a remarkably large accommodation zone where the additional effort cost is less than the bonus. This accommodation of shirking by others exists for different returns to scale and even for very low levels of substitutability.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"McGinty, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",mmcginty@uwm.edu,,,,,,,23,3,4,1,15,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We construct an empirical model of the monetary policy rule, justify the choice and the inclusion of explanatory variables, analyse the statistical properties of time series, and verify the alternative forms of econometric models. Our analysis showed that the development of monetary policy rate in the reporting period can be explained by the past and present development of four explanatory variables: yearly inflation rate, exchange rate, ECB main refinancing rate and growth rate of M2.

Many economists have recently proposed even higher inflation targets to reduce the incidence of the zero lower bound constraint on monetary policy. In this survey, we show that the conduct of monetary policy should be analyzed by appropriately accounting for the positive trend inflation targeted by policymakers. We first review empirical research on the evolution and dynamics of U.S. trend inflation and some proposed new measures to assess the volatility and persistence of trend-based inflation gaps. We then construct a Generalized New Keynesian model that accounts for a positive trend inflation. In this model, an increase in trend inflation is associated with a more volatile and unstable economy and tends to destabilize inflation expectations. This analysis offers a note of caution regarding recent proposals to address the existing zero lower bound problem by raising the long-run inflation target.","[Ascari, Guido] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Ascari, Guido] Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Sbordone, Argia M.] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA",University of Oxford; University of Pavia; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Ascari, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,"Sbordone, Argia M/C-1721-2008","ASCARI, GUIDO/0000-0002-5037-1964",,,,,131,98,111,0,36,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

For the majority of students, the CEE score is the single determinant in whether they gain admission into a college and to what college they enter. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether and how well the CEE score predicts college academic success. We also consider high school achievement and admission route in predicting college grades. We obtain administrative data on CEE and undergraduate GPAs from two Chinese universities with very different rankings. We find that, for both universities the CEE total score predicts undergraduate GPAs for all four years in college. Even the size of the estimates for CEE is similar for the two universities. High school achievement and admission routes are also significant predictors of college grades. However, we do not find consistent results as to which CEE subject test scores predict students' academic performance in college. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

An autoregressive distributed lag model developed for cointegration-error correction analysis is estimated using data for the U.S. public sector for 1956Q1-2010Q2. The most important finding is that in the long run, there is no crowding out associated with the net effect of equal percentage changes in government purchases of domestic consumption and investment. Contrary to some previous results, public investment has a significant crowding in effect on private investment while military purchases have a significant crowding out effect, with an elasticity of -0.52. The evidence also indicates that there is an important investment role for profit growth, but not for the real interest rate in the long run. The results are generally consistent with post Keynesian views of fiscal policy and support those who argue that the 2009 stimulus package was not well-suited for generating a sustained recovery in the U.S. economy.","Le Moyne Coll, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13214 USA",,"Blackley, PR (通讯作者)，Le Moyne Coll, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13214 USA.",,,,,,,,42,4,6,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

By contrast, reference-dependent loss aversion (as in Prospect Theory) (Koszegi and Rabin, 2006; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) predicts that risk aversion decreases as wealth moves away from the reference point in either direction. In terms of continuing to play, as well as a more aggressive playing style, we find strong evidence for the break-even effect, the increased pursuit of risk as a player is losing within a session. Players' behavior also appears consistent with existing evidence on reference-dependent labor supply, in their tendency to reduce effort and risk-taking in response to being ahead.

Economics has focused on the transfers in the market and almost completely neglected the question of initiation and termination of property in normal production and consumption (not in some original state or in the transition from common to private property). The institutional mechanism for the normal initiation and termination of property is an invisible hand function of the market - the market mechanism of appropriation. Does this mechanism satisfy an appropriate normative principle? The standard normative juridical principle is to assign or impute legal responsibility according to de facto responsibility. It is given a historical tag of being Lockean, but the basis is contemporary jurisprudence, not historical exegesis. Then, the fundamental theorem of the property mechanism is proven, which shows that if Hume's conditions (no transfers without consent and all contracts fulfilled) are satisfied, then the market automatically satisfies the Lockean responsibility principle - i.e., Hume implies Locke. As a major application, the results in their contrapositive form, Not Locke implies Not Hume, are applied to a market economy based on the employment contract. I show that the production based on the employment contract violates the Lockean principle (all who work in an employment enterprise are de facto responsible for the positive and negative results), and thus Hume's conditions must also be violated in the marketplace (de facto responsible human action cannot be transferred from one person to another - as is readily recognized when an employer and employee together commit a crime).","Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Ellerman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",,"Ellerman, David/AAI-9466-2020","Ellerman, David/0000-0002-5718-618X",,,,,54,1,1,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The procedures used in EXIOBASE involve a high degree of interrogation and adjustment throughout the construction of the data set, whilst the Eora MRIO relies on single-step mathematical programming techniques and high-performance computing. We unravel the effect of the different approaches taken to develop the databases by undertaking a number of combinatorial experiments in which we exchange parts of the construction process between the EXIOBASE and Eora build pipelines. We conclude that Eora's highly automated data reconciliation approach produces MRIO databases that are of comparable quality to those constructed with EXIOBASE's multi-step approach.

The significance of these black market measures survives even when we include standard macroeconomic indicators in our forecasting model. In line with standard economic theory, activity in the black market has dried up subsequently. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These latter environments may differ from the typical cluster policy examples that are usually specialised global centres of dynamically growing industries. Using census-type data of Hungarian firms, we test the effect of major cluster indicators - regional specialisation and spatial concentration of industries - and the impact of FDI on regional productivity and employment growth in Hungary. Our results suggest that regional specialisation does not affect regional growth, while the spatial concentration of industries is found to influence productivity and employment growth with an overwhelmingly negative effect. Furthermore, regional employment growth is associated negatively with the initial level of regional specialisation. Results suggest that Hungary has evolved into a dual economy in which previously specialised regions and geographically concentrated industries have lost their pace, while the main factor that favoured regional economic growth was the presence of large foreign companies. Therefore, economic policies fostering regional specialisation and the spatial concentration of industries - such as cluster policy - may have minor effects unless the interaction of foreign-owned and domestic companies is encouraged.","[Lengyel, Balazs] Hungarian Acad Sci MTA KRTK KTI, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budapest, Hungary; [Lengyel, Balazs] Int Business Sch, Budapest, Hungary; [Kano, Izabella Szakalne] Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Szeged, Hungary",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Szeged University,"Lengyel, B (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci MTA KRTK KTI, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budapest, Hungary.",lengyel.balazs@krtk.mta.hu; kano.izabella@eco.u-szeged,"Kanó, Izabella Szakálné/AAS-1499-2020","Kanó, Izabella Szakálné/0000-0002-4149-1243; Lengyel, Balazs/0000-0001-5196-5599",,,,,53,12,14,0,23,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We test whether urbanization occurs sooner in places with higher agricultural potential and comparatively lower transport costs, using worldwide data that divide the earth's surface at half-degree intervals into 62,290 cells. From an independent estimate of each cell's rural and urban population history over the last 2,000 years, we identify the date at which each cell achieves various thresholds of urbanization. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across countries through fixed effects and using a variety of spatial econometric techniques, we find a robust association between earlier urbanization and agro-climatic suitability for cultivation, having seasonal frosts, better access to the ocean or navigable rivers, and lower elevation. These geographic correlations become smaller in magnitude as urbanization proceeds, and there is some variation in the effects across continents. Aggregating cells into countries, we show that an earlier urbanization date is associated with higher per capita income today.","[Motamed, Mesbah J.] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA; [Florax, Raymond J.

COOPER; SUPPLY CHAIN; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; DEA; DAMAGES; SCALE,"Environmental assessment and protection are important concerns in modern business. Consumers are interested in corporate effort and investment for environmental protection. It can be easily imagined that they avoid purchasing products from dirty-imaged companies even if their prices are much less than the ones produced by green-imaged companies. A green image is recently a very important concern for corporate survivability in a competitive global market. By extending previous works on environment assessment and corporate sustainability, where companies need to consider both economic prosperity and pollution prevention in their operations, this study discusses a new use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment by utilizing its radial and non-radial measurements. The proposed radial and non-radial approaches may guide corporate leaders, managers and policy makers by providing not only quantitative assessment on their efforts for environmental protection but also information regarding how to invest for technology innovation on abatement of undesirable outputs. The empirical investigation identifies that the green investment in U.S. energy industry is useful for improving its unified (operational and environmental) performance if operational performance is measured by ROA (Return on Assets) and an amount of CO2 emission reduction because the industry is the largest emitter among seven industry sectors examined in this study. The green investment makes it possible that firms can increase their net incomes by a good corporate image. However, if the financial measure is replaced by a corporate value (i.e., Tobin's q ratio, mainly measured by stock price), the energy industry does not exhibit the best investment opportunity because the effect of green investment is limited on enhancing its corporate value. The energy industry is a very large process industry so that the green investment does not immediately increase its corporate value as found in the other industrial sectors such as information technology industry.

Instead, the formally decentralized system of public goods and service provision accommodates the informal one, and informal decentralization in public order provision tends to compete with the existing and ineffective formal system.

The results suggest that the investment channel plays a more important role than the consumption channel in Australia, while the contributions of the two channels are indistinguishable in the Euro area and the USA.

However, irrigation inefficiency is pronounced, with water buyers being more inefficient than tube-well owners. A bootstrap truncated regression is used to investigate the determinants of technical and irrigation efficiency.

Detailed bottom-up electricity models generally have embedded load duration curves with the electricity price determined by the marginal cost of generation. This study incorporates a simple representation of electricity generation with these bottom-up features directly into the GTAP general equilibrium model. The motivation for this study is to help project generation adjustments and macroeconomic costs associated with policies and shocks affecting the electricity sector. Various scenarios are shown using a simple hypothetical model with Base, Mid and Peak generation types: introducing an incremental output tax on Base generation, assuming mobile capital and then fixed capital; flattening the load duration curve; and introducing an intermittent generation source. Key results are: different responses in electricity generation, price and GDP to a simple constant elasticity of substitution treatment; higher macroeconomic costs associated with a faster tax introduction due to merit order switching and capital decommissioning; an increase in GDP and a shift towards Base generation from flattening the load duration curve; and a displacement of Base generation from the introduction of an intermittent generation source, with variability leading to an increase in Peak generation and a cost to GDP.

This period is characterized by increasing fear of further defaults by corporations (including banks) or even by countries. In reaction, investors began shifting their assets to more stable and secure investments and this resulted in stock market crashes. Various policy interventions were initiated to restore stability. In this article, we analyse the impact of these interventions on stock liquidity, proxied by a new liquidity measure. The interventions, which we consider, are published by the Federal Reserve Bank (FED) in the form of a crisis timeline. Here, they are further combined to the following categories: bank liability guarantees, liquidity and rescue interventions, unconventional monetary policy and other market interventions. The results indicate that the market reacts positively to liquidity and rescue interventions, whereas bank liability guarantees reduced stock liquidity. In addition, we show that international events have a significant impact on the domestic market. By analysing the spreads of different trading volumes, an asymmetric effect can be detected, where the impact on lower trading volumes is substantially more pronounced compared to higher trading volumes.","[Busch, Thomas] UBS, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lehnert, Thorsten] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Sch Finance, L-1246 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",University of Luxembourg,"Lehnert, T (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Sch Finance, L-1246 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",thorsten.lehnert@uni.lu,"Lehnert, Thorsten/GLR-2903-2022","Lehnert, Thorsten/0000-0002-0470-0851",,,,,8,5,5,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We conducted a field experiment to examine how social comparison affects workers' effort provision if their own wage or that of a co-worker is cut. Workers were assigned to groups of two, performed identical individual tasks, and received the same performance-independent hourly wage. Cutting both group members' wages caused a decrease in performance. But when only one group member's wage was cut, the affected workers decreased their performance more than twice as much as when both workers' wages were cut. This finding indicates that social comparison among workers affects effort provision because the only difference between the two wage-cut treatments is the other group member's wage level. In contrast, workers whose wage was not cut but who witnessed their group member's pay being cut displayed no change in performance relative to the baseline treatment in which both workers' wages remained unchanged.

Under perfect commitment, I show that noncooperative capital taxes are zero in the long run for a large open economy, thereby generalizing the result previously established only for the special cases of a closed and a small open economy. This does not represent a race to the bottom, though, since the result is independent of the degree of capital mobility, the number of countries, or a country's size relative to the rest of the world. Moreover, when countries cooperate, they still set capital taxes to zero in the long run. These outcomes are robust to different equilibrium specifications, the inclusion of endogenous government spending, and heterogeneous agents and non-linear labor income taxation. Governments find it optimal to implement the efficient capital allocation in the long run, both in a closed and an open economy; this trumps incentives to tax foreigners' domestic capital holdings by raising capital taxes and attracting capital from abroad by lowering capital taxes.

Then at a second time, using a Cramer's coefficient, we deduce association coefficients or correlations among the different states of the major stock exchange markets around the world. First, the associations were globally stronger during the subprime crisis than during the dot-corn bubble period. Second, among European markets Cramer's V is higher regardless of the period.

Various causes of low-growth that are relevant for Austria (a deteriorating balance of trade, increasing resource prices, consumer restraint of households and less immigration) have been identified, leading to an only moderate gross domestic product growth of 0.55 % per year. The resulting impact on the economy is substantial: the labour market suffers from a shortage of labour supply (due to reduced migration) and from a reduced demand for labour (due to reduced demand in consumption, investments and exports). Subsequently, less employment decreases the development of the disposable income of private households (tax rates and social security contributions held constant). Related to this, public debt is higher due to reduced tax incomes and slightly growing public expenditures. From an ecological perspective, resource consumption increases at a slower rate, however, no absolute reduction can be reached. CO2 emissions also slightly increase. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that low growth necessarily leads to the achievement of energy and environmental policy goals. Based on these results, a policy scenario was used to analyze whether and how policy measures are able to cope with the negative consequences of persistent low growth. The results reveal that the selected measures are suitable to reduce negative economic effects: The implementation of reduced working time and an eco-social reform of levies might improve the labour market situation. The negative effects on the national budget can be diminished by a reduction of environmentally harmful subsidies. Induced behaviour changes of private households can reduce energy and resource-intensive consumption.","[Stocker, Andrea; Hinterberger, Friedrich] SERI Sustainable Europe Res Inst, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Grossmann, Anett; Wolter, Marc Ingo] Inst Econ Struct Res, D-49080 Osnabruck, Germany",,"Stocker, A (通讯作者)，SERI Sustainable Europe Res Inst, Garnisongasse 7-17, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",andrea.stocker@seri.at,,"Frank-Stocker, Andrea/0000-0001-8751-7675",,,,,33,4,5,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2014,41.0,3,,,SI,,445,465,,10.1007/s10663-014-9267-x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AL4OW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339113300005,0

In addition to traditional tests, a nonparametric test for differences in stochastic distributions gives evidence that the productivity distribution of firms that export and engage in R&D dominates the productivity distribution of firms that are exporters without engaging in R&D. Furthermore, the productivity distribution of the latter group of firms dominates that of firms who are neither R&D-active nor exporters. This conclusion applies to the years before, under and after the economic downward spiral in the world economy, i.e. 2007 to 2010. Overall, this result confirms the hypothesis of Bustos (2011) for Argentina, and for the results for German firms, see Wagner (2012b) and Vogel and Wagner (2012).

Based on the use of 16 criteria describing the elements of the train and the parameters and the technical state of the railway track, the quantitative estimate K-A (multiple criteria index) is obtained. The suggested model and the techniques used in the work may be applied to determining the quality or effectiveness of other objects or processes, which can be described by sets of criteria.","[Maskeliunaite, Lijana; Sivilevicius, Henrikas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Transport Technol Equipment, LT-10105 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Sivilevicius, H (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Transport Technol Equipment, Plytines G 27, LT-10105 Vilnius, Lithuania.",henrikas.sivilevicius@vgtu.lt,,"Maskeliunaite, Lijana/0000-0001-7764-9199",,,,,35,7,7,0,6,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Furthermore, oil prices were affected by the exchange rate changes at a minimal level. However, in the medium run and the long run, oil price shocks had a significant impact on exchange rate changes. Exchange rate shock has a significant negative impact on crude oil prices while the impulse response of the exchange rate variable to a crude oil price shock was statistically insignificant. Finally, the impact of extreme price volatility in June 2008 on exchange rates was significant. When world oil prices are stabilized, currency fluctuations and uncertainty can be minimized.

Many emerging market countries have adopted inflation targeting as best practice, but now they are being advised to enhance their inflation targeting regimes with foreign exchange intervention. Here we use a DSGE model to tell some cautionary tales about this advice. A Taylor rule guides interest rate setting, while foreign exchange interventions are used as a second tool of monetary policy. These interventions are effective in our model since domestic and key currency bonds are imperfect substitutes. We derive optimal (Ramsey) intervention policies in response to foreign devaluations and fiscal retrenchments, and find that they are rather complex. So, we compare the optimal responses to policies that simply smooth real or nominal exchange rate movements. Our results suggest that discretion may be the better part of valor: pure inflation targeting may come closer to the optimal policy than exchange rate smoothing. A secondary result may also be of some interest: foreign exchange interventions have a stronger impact on inflation and output in an inflation targeting regime than do sterilized interventions; the Taylor rule augments the effects of a given intervention.","[Canzoneri, Matthew; Cumby, Robert] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Canzoneri, M (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",canzonem@georgetown.edu; cumbyr@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,27,6,7,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We show that the above identification scheme can greatly benefit from the cross-sectional dimension of the GVAR-by providing a large number of additional cross-country sign restrictions and hence reducing the set of admissible models. The results indicate that the economic consequences of a supply-driven oil-price shock are very different from those of an oil-demand shock driven by global economic activity, and vary for oil-importing countries compared to energy exporters. While oil importers typically face a long-lived fall in economic activity in response to a supply-driven surge in oil prices, the impact is positive for energy-exporting countries that possess large proven oil/gas reserves. However, in response to an oil-demand disturbance, almost all countries in our sample experience long-run inflationary pressures, an increase in real output, a rise in interest rates, and a fall in equity prices.

In this environment, a small economy prefers a fixed exchange rate regime over a flexible regime, while the larger economy prefers a flexible exchange rate regime. There are two main causes underlying our results. First, in the presence of sticky prices, relative prices adjust through changes in the exchange rate. Multiple stages of production and trade make it more difficult for one exchange rate to balance the whole economy by adjusting several relative prices simultaneously throughout the vertical chain of production and trade. More specifically, there is a tradeoff between delivering an efficient relative price between home and foreign final goods and delivering an efficient relative price between home and foreign intermediate goods. Second, because the small economy faces a high degree of exchange rate pass-through under a flexible regime, it suffers from a lack of efficient relative prices in vertical trade. The larger economy, however, does not face this problem because its level of exchange rate pass-through is low.","[Pang, Ke] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Tang, Yao] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA",Wilfrid Laurier University; Bowdoin College,"Pang, K (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, 75 Univ Ave, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",kpang@wlu.ca; ytang@bowdoin.edu,,,,,,,58,3,3,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

A higher level of credibility is associated with lower interest rates, higher effective exchange rates, and a positive effect on economic activity. We show that the beneficial effects of credibility may be attributed mainly to achieved targets and past inflation. However, transparency and credible actions concerning public debt and country risk management can enhance these effects. Finally, an important policy implication might be the identification of the aspects of credibility that are altered when different shocks occur. We show that a positive long-term interest rate shock negatively affects the aspects of credibility concerning inflation performance and country risk, whereas in the case of a positive currency shock, credibility aspects concerning transparency, country risk, and fighting inflation improve.","[Sidiropoulos, Moiese] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Spyromitros, Eleftherios] Democritus Univ Thrace, Komotini, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Democritus University of Thrace,,,"Papadamou, Stephanos/I-2580-2019; Spyromitros, Eleftherios/AAK-6252-2021","Papadamou, Stephanos/0000-0002-7700-1912;",,,,,44,9,9,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

In this paper, some limitations of single-level IDA studies which can be addressed through applying multilevel decomposition analysis are discussed. We then introduce and compare two multilevel decomposition procedures, which are referred to as the multilevel-parallel (M-P) model and the multilevel-hierarchical (M-H) model. The former uses a similar decomposition procedure as in the single-level IDA, while the latter uses a stepwise decomposition procedure. Since the stepwise decomposition procedure is new in the IDA literature, the applicability of the popular IDA methods in the M-H model is discussed and cases where modifications are needed are explained.

Our approach also allows us to estimate the marginal cost of a child; we find that for the Eurozone adding the first child is more costly than adding a third adult and that the marginal cost of children declines.

When the elasticity is less than unity, a resource-abundant country may be overtaken by a resource-scarce country.

This article considers the institutions of economics from a theoretical perspective, applying to economics itself ideas that have been used to study institutions in the economy and other domains. The institutions of economics are not often treated as such, but deserve attention not only because they impact the discipline, but also because they interact with economic reality, including institutions in the economy. Particularly important are the mental models socially shared by academic economists. Conformity with these institutions and their sharing can be explained by various social factors, such as the perception of legitimacy or naturality, sanctions, uncertainty, increasing returns to adoption, informational differences, lack of power, and habits. A conventional model is adopted, at least in part, because other agents adopt it, and it is arbitrary in the sense that a non-inferior alternative to it is conceivable. An epistemic social norm implies possible sanctions and may be internalized as legitimate. Despite the profound cognitive and motivational influence of a discipline's institutions, together with other conservative forces, cases of non-conformity do occur and promote change. Prestigious academics are often successful innovators.","[Dequech, David] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Dequech, David] Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Dequech, David] Sao Paulo State Res Fdn FAPESP Brazil, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP),"Dequech, D (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,"Dequech, David/D-2312-2012",,,,,,21,8,9,0,6,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In developing countries the regulatory infrastructure is often too weak to allow detailed monitoring of individual groundwater extraction. For this reason, classical public intervention instruments, such as consumption fees or tradable quotas, are infeasible. Here we present a theoretical foundation for a new public regulatory instrument that can potentially generate the same efficiency-inducing incentives as fees and tradable quotas, but without their information and monitoring requirements. The instrument we propose is a tax based on aggregate extraction rather than on individual extraction measures.","[Hansen, Lars Garn; Jensen, Frank; Amundsen, Eirik S.] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Amundsen, Eirik S.] Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, N-5007 Bergen, Norway",University of Copenhagen; University of Bergen,"Hansen, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",lgh@ifro.lcu.dk; fje@ifro.ku.dk; Eirik.Amundsen@econ.uib.no,"Hansen, Lars Garn/D-3992-2014; Amundsen, Eirik S./E-4986-2015","Hansen, Lars Garn/0000-0003-0498-8901; Amundsen, Eirik S./0000-0002-0090-4996",,,,,40,4,4,0,12,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

In order to represent the speculative attack in the economy, the study utilized one of the measures that is most widely adopted to signal the breakup of a crisis, the Exchange Market Pressure Index (EMPI). This paper found the following. First, liquidity (DC), real exchange rate (RER2) and ratio of banking credit to GDP (BCred) were found to significantly influence the EMPI, indicating that the behavior of EMPI has the characteristic that is predicted by the first, second, and third generation of crisis model found to significantly influence the EMPI, indicating that the behavior of EMPI has the characteristic that is predicted by the first, second and third generation of crisis models. Second, the LR test showed that regime switching dynamic model is more robust than ordinary dynamic model in explaining the EMPI, suggesting that speculative attacks tend to have the characteristics of multiple equilibria. Third, the transition probability matrix results showed that the tranquility regime was more persistent than the volatile regime.","[Heriqbaldi, Unggul] Airlangga Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Surabaya 60286, East Java, Indonesia; [Ismail, Munawar; Kaluge, David; Santoso, Dwi Budi] Brawijaya Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Malang 65145, Indonesia",Airlangga University; Brawijaya University,"Heriqbaldi, U (通讯作者)，Airlangga Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Airlangga 4, Surabaya 60286, East Java, Indonesia.",u.heriqbaldi@feb.unair.ac.id,"Santoso, Dwi Budi/AAK-6178-2020; heriqbaldi, unggul/AAN-4993-2020; Ismail, Munawar/JLN-1680-2023","Santoso, Dwi Budi/0000-0002-5991-2632; heriqbaldi, unggul/0000-0002-0221-6230; Ismail, Munawar/0000-0001-5297-6142",,,,,40,2,3,0,16,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Prior research investigating Quebec's universal highly subsidized childcare documented significant declines in a variety of developmental outcomes for all children aged 0-4 years. However, past analysis has not explored whether these effects vary for children of different ages. In this article, we demonstrate substantial heterogeneity in policy impacts by child age. Children who gain access to subsidized childcare at earlier ages experience significantly larger negative impacts on developmental scores, health, and behavioral outcomes. The sole exception is the negative relationship between access to subsidized childcare and hyperactivity scores which steepens with child age. Our analysis additionally provides significant evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity within ages, and reveals benefits from access to universal childcare on developmental scores for those that are above 3 years of age.","[Kottelenberg, Michael J.] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kottelenberg, MJ (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",kottelen@econ.queensu.ca; lehrers@queensu.ca,,,,,,,48,19,21,5,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

The periods of vigorous growth are marked by institutions that taken as a whole are favorable to the accumulation or investment process. The internal contradictions of those institutions, interacting with changes in the external environment, eventually bring the period of prosperity to a close. At that point, a period of intense social conflict is ushered in, accompanied by economic stagnation, until a new set of institutions that favors accumulation can be established. The neoliberal era, from 1980 to 2007, represents a distinctive period of capitalist development in the United States, one with its own characteristic institutions. This essay examines the major institutions of the neoliberal era and their internal contradictions. It shows how these led to the financial crisis of 2007-2009, and examines the conflicts exposed by the crisis. The essay attempts to bring together an empirical account of the financial crisis with a theoretical framework in which the crisis can be most readily understood.","Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Lippit, VD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",victor.lippit@ucr.edu,,,,,,,21,12,14,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

This paper empirically assesses two agency problems that induce such financing constraints one resulting in a firm balance sheet channel and one resulting in a bank balance sheet channel. Evaluating specific models of these two agency problems against a comprehensive data set of U.S. small business credit contracts, I find strong support for the firm balance sheet channel but only weak support for the bank balance sheet channel. A complementary regression analysis confirms this result. Hence, policies seeking to improve firms' balance sheets may be desirable to support small business lending in the recovery from the Great Recession.

While in most standard approaches the resource is located at a single point, we allow the resource to be distributed spatially. Consequently, an agent who exploits the resource has to travel from one location to another. For a fixed planning horizon, we investigate the speed and the path of harvesting chosen by the agent. We show that the agent adjusts this speed so as to visit each location only once, even in the absence of travelling cost. Since the agent does not return to any location for a second harvest, it is optimal to fully deplete the resource upon arrival. A similar type of bang-bang solution results when we drop the assumption of a constant harvesting rate: allowing for a variable harvesting rate, the agent chooses to fully exploit the resource either in the last or in the first travelling period. A society interested in conserving some of the resource thus has to take measures to limit the exploitative behaviour of the agent.

Using a unique, firm-level, proprietary sample of 121 U.S. gasoline retailers collectively operating over 4500 stores, we find that it tends to be only in months when wholesale prices are declining that retailers make meaningfully positive profits, and that in spite of the low profits earned when wholesale prices are increasing, over the entire wholesale price cycle, volatility is preferred by retailers to relatively stable wholesale prices. We are the first to our knowledge to link asymmetric price responses directly to firm profits and characterize the economic significance of asymmetric pricing in the retail gasoline industry. Our findings may have important implications for the scores of other industries where asymmetric retail-to-wholesale price responses are found. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The second element reflects the individual's confidence in his ability to overcome any losses in the future.

International trade is measured as changes in product prices and technological change as total factor productivity (TFP) growth. We take account of a multi-sector and multi-factor of production economy and use mandated wage methodology in order to create an well-balanced approach in terms of theoretical and empirical cohesion. We use data from the EU KLEMS database and analyse the impact of both product price changes and TFP changes of 11 UK manufacturing sectors on factor rewards of high-, medium- and low-skilled workers. Results show that real wages of skill groups are significantly driven by the sector bias of price change and TFP growth of several sectors of production. Furthermore, we estimate the share of the three different skill groups on added value for each year from 1970 to 2005. The shares indicate structural change in the UK economy. Results show a structural change owing to decreasing shares of low-skilled workers and increasing shares of medium-skilled and high-skilled workers over the years.","Tech Univ Dresden, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Engelmann, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, Helmholtzstr 10, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",kontakt@sabine-engelmann.de,,,,,,,49,1,1,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2014,41.0,2,,,SI,,223,246,,10.1007/s10663-013-9209-z,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AG6UT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335554700005,0

Unlike previous works, the present paper takes into account the economic geography by examining the regional clusters and the significant transformation of the Chinese economy through the introduction of structural breaks and nonlinearities in the model. Results indicate that the regional clusters are relevant to the convergence behaviour across China, when both the administrative division and the regional clusters are considered. However, the number of provinces that are converging is higher in the latter case. When nonlinearities were considered across the regional clusters, we found that 18 provinces have already converged with their cluster, 3 provinces are catching up and 10 regions show divergence. These findings are useful for the design and development of national and regional economic policies in the Chinese economy.","[Herrerias, Maria Jesus] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Ordonez, Javier] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Ordonez, Javier] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Nottingham; University of Bath; Universitat Jaume I,"Herrerias, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Contemporary Chinese Studies, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",maria.jesus_herrerias@nottingham.ac.uk,"Ordonez, Javier/K-3665-2014","Ordonez, Javier/0000-0002-1453-2441",,,,,33,2,2,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Producers could, however, withhold part of production facilities (Le., apply a capacity cutting strategy) and thereby push more expensive production facilities to satisfy demand for electricity. This behavior could lead to a higher price determined through a uniform price auction. Using the case of the England and Wales wholesale electricity market we empirically analyze whether producers indeed did apply a capacity cutting strategy. For this purpose we examine the bidding behavior of producers during high- and low-demand trading periods within a trading day. We find statistical evidence for the presence of capacity cutting by several producers, which is consistent with the regulatory authority's reports. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a sample of 201 professionals in the air transport sector, a structural model is outlined and empirically tested. The results show that financial investment positively affected relationship management, information technology, and education. They also had positive impacts on the performance of import and export supply chains. Financial investment had a positive impact because the positive indirect impact outweighed the direct insignificant impact. In general, our findings suggest that in the Korean trade sector utilizing air transportation, investment in security has a positive impact on the performance of import and export supply chains through relationship management, information technology, and education on security in the supply chain.","Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Park, HG (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.",ny1525@hotmail.com,"Tong, Xun/A-9304-2015",,,,,,40,2,2,0,15,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Low river run-off and/or high water temperatures limit a plant's production capacity. This problem may intensify with climate change. Our study quantifies the impact of forced capacity reductions on market prices, production costs, consumer and producer surplus, as well as emissions by means of a bottom-up power generation system model. First, we simulate the German electricity spot market during the heat wave of 2006. Then we conduct a sensitivity study that accounts for future climatic and technological conditions. We find an average price increase of 11% during the heat wave 2006, which is even more pronounced during times of peak demand. Production costs accumulate to an additional but moderate 16 m. Due to the price increase, producers gain from the heat wave, whereas consumers disproportionately bear the costs. Carbon emissions in the German electricity sector increase during the heat wave. The price and cost effects are more pronounced and increase significantly if assumptions on heat-sensitive demand, hydropower capacity, net exports, and capacity reductions are tightened. These are potential additional effects of climate change. Hence, if mitigation fails or is postponed globally, the impacts on the current energy system are very likely to rise. Increases in feed-in from renewable resources and demand-side management can counter the effects to a considerable degree. Countries with a shift toward a renewable energy supply can be expected to be much less susceptible to cooling water scarcity than those with a high share of nuclear and coal-fired power plants.

Coupled with a slowing US economy, regional central banks faced a monetary policy dilemma of either addressing higher inflation or supporting moderate growth. Higher food and fuel prices were the major drivers of headline inflation. Their causes, however, were a confluence of mutually reinforcing cyclical and structural factors. Understandably, different economies faced a different balance of risks between price stability and growth; but to attribute the inflation to supply shocks alone was misleading. This was unsettling given that inflation and inflation expectations were on the rise, and without much credibility, the reluctance of many central banks to raise interest rates risked repeating the mistake the advanced economies made in the 1970s. Without credibility, inflation expectations are unlikely to be well anchored. To gain credibility, a central bank must 'walk-the-talk', and understandably it must have the autonomy to do so.","Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Tang, HC (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Manila, Philippines.",hctang@adb.org,,,,,,,49,1,1,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

In this paper, we examine the extent to which these differences depend on regulations affecting product, labour and credit markets, and assess their relevance for aggregate productivity. To this purpose, we exploit a decomposition of industry productivity into a moment of the firm productivity distribution (the unweighted mean), and a moment of the joint distribution with firm size (the covariance between productivity and market shares - allocative efficiency). We apply such decomposition to a cross section of more than 800 country-industry cells and estimate the relevance of regulation policies for each of the two terms exploiting cross-industry differences in exposure to the policy. Our results suggest that there is an economically and statistically robust negative relationship between policy-induced frictions and productivity, though the specific channel depends on the policy considered. In the case of employment protection legislation, product market regulations (including barriers to entry and bankruptcy legislation) and restrictions on foreign direct investment, this is largely traceable to the worsening of allocative efficiency (i.e. a lower correspondence between a firm's size and its productivity level). By contrast, the adverse impact of financial market under-development on aggregate productivity tends to arise through shifts in the firm productivity distribution (i.e. a lower unweighted mean). Furthermore, stringent regulations are more disruptive to resource allocation in more innovative sectors.

Thus, shifting activities in response to corporate tax rate differentials between parents and subsidiaries are found to be significantly larger if the parent has a lower corporate tax rate than its subsidiary and profit is thus shifted towards the headquarter firm. This result is in line with recent empirical evidence which suggests that MNEs bias the location of profits and highly profitable assets in favor of the headquarter location.","[Dischinger, Matthias] Univ Munich, Publ Finance Grp, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Knoll, Bodo; Riedel, Nadine] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ 520D, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University of Munich; University Hohenheim,"Riedel, N (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ 520D, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",nadine.riedel@uni-hohenheim.de,"Knoll, Bodo/AAE-9159-2020",,ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,27,51,57,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Both Keynesian and Real Business Cycle models predict that a fiscal expansion will lead to a real exchange rate appreciation. However, in almost all the individual countries that have been studied, positive shocks to government spending cause the real exchange rate to depreciate. Recent theoretical work suggests that this unexpected result might reflect incomplete international financial market integration. The country where the incomplete markets assumption is least plausible is New Zealand, because of its integration into the Australian financial system. We show that in New Zealand there is no puzzle, and the standard textbook result still holds.

We show that under AUCR, the equilibrium level of the public good converges to zero as the economy is replicated in the sense of Milleron.","[Konishi, Hideo] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Shinohara, Ryusuke] Hosei Univ, Fac Econ, Machida, Tokyo 1940298, Japan",Boston College; Hosei University,"Konishi, H (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",hideo.konishi@bc.edu; ryusukes@hosei.ac.jp,,"Shinohara, Ryusuke/0000-0003-2916-8352",,,,,22,3,3,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

An incentive compatible mechanism is used to elicit strict preference rankings of subjects over a finite set of alternatives in decision tasks based on dictator and trust games. Violations of single-peakedness range from a low of 19% to a high of 46% across the six main treatments. Other-regarding subjects violate single-peakedness significantly more often than self-regarding subjects. The presence of equal-split in the set of alternatives increases the number of violations. We argue that the violations cannot be explained by appealing to the relative ease of reporting certain rankings or as errors from the theoretical benchmark. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A Review and an Interpretative Framework",ECONOMIA POLITICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SIZE DISTRIBUTION; GIBRATS LAW; FIRM SIZE; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; CITIES; ZIPF; DIVERSIFICATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; SELECTION,"In this paper I refer to and summarize the main findings of the stochastic benchmark developed together with S. Buldyrev, M. Riccaboni, and RE. Stanley to analyze business firms growth and corporate dynamics. The framework encompasses the Gibrat's Law of Proportionate Effect and the growth process originally described by Herbert A. Simon as particular instances. The framework generates testable propositions along four different dimensions: i) firm size distribution, the distribution of firm growth rates, and iii-iv) the relationships between firm size and the mean and volatility of firm growth rates. The predictions of the stochastic benchmark are not falsified across different data sets. Both size and growth distributions are fat tailed, while innovation, competition, and instability at the level of products and firms map onto macroeconomic shocks at the aggregate level of Country GDP. First, the probability density function of growth rates appears to be invariant at different scales of observation and across periods, with its central body well approximated by a Laplace distribution and tails that contain many more events than predicted by a Gaussian probability density function and exhibit an inverse cubic power law. Second, since firm size distribution is fat-tailed, micro-level shocks that affect large firms generate aggregate fluctuations, and GDP volatility remains substantial even for large diversified Countries. The proportional growth benchmark sketched in the paper suggests that the origins, magnitude, composition, and propagation of microeconomic shocks from business firms are key to understand the state of economy and GDP growth and volatility.","IMT Inst Adv Studies, I-55100 Lucca, LU, Italy",IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,"Pammolli, F (通讯作者)，IMT Inst Adv Studies, Piazza S Ponziano 6, I-55100 Lucca, LU, Italy.",f.pammolli@imtlucca.it,,"Pammolli, Fabio/0000-0001-7056-1303",,,,,73,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

This study reveals that the aggregate portfolio of Islamic stocks is immune to interest rate risk. However, at the sectoral level some Islamic equity portfolios demonstrate exposure to interest rate risk. Overall, evidence of interest rate risk exposure is less pronounced among Islamic sector portfolios than that of their mainstream counterparts the Dow Jones World sector indices. The results also hold when interest rate risk is assessed in terms of the sensitivity of the DJIMI return to changes in level, slope and curvature of the interest rate term structure.

It is a stylized fact that opt-in or opt-out designs for otherwise identical choices lead to vastly different outcomes. Choice options are chosen more frequently simply because they are the no-action alternative or default option. However, direct empirical evidence on the reasons for the popularity of defaults is scarce. We devised a special survey module for the Dutch DNB Household Survey to study potential explanations for default choices. We find that the popularity of the default option is related to different personal traits in economic and non-economic decisions. Financially literate individuals are more likely to take action and opt out the default option in economic decision-making. In non-economic decisions, procrastination increases the popularity of the default while individuals who care much about the opinion of others are more inclined to deviate from the default.

While nationalist historians tended to blame Union with Britain for all the economic ills of the 19th century (OBrien, 1921), recent re-evaluations of both historical and recent Irish economic performance have been cause for a reappraisal of the economic relations between Ireland and Britain (Cullen, 1969; Kennedy and Johnson, 1996). The extent to which economic factors were important in Irelands withdrawal from the United Kingdom will be examined in this paper. A secondary aim is to assess the economic consequences of independence in the interwar period. There were many economic reasons up to 1913 as to why Ireland should separate. UK policy was determined by majority voting and policies were suited to the needs of industrial workers in Britain, rather than agricultural workers in Ireland. This led to increased spending beyond the means of Ireland which caused transition difficulties on independence. Finally the consequences of separation in the north and south of Ireland are examined. Evidence suggests that separation led to short term economic difficulty.

We explore the extent to which social capital in rural Vietnam plays a role in increasing formal savings where knowledge gaps exist. Social capital is defined as information sharing and the elimination of information asymmetries through active participation in the Women's Union. We consider high- and low-quality networks in terms of the quality of information transmitted. We find that membership of high-quality networks leads to higher levels of saving in formal financial institutions and saving for productive investments. Our results support a role for social capital in facilitating savings and suggest that transmitting financial information through the branches of the Women's Union could be effective in increasing formal savings at grassroots level. We also conclude that it is important to ensure that the information disseminated is accurate given that behavioral effects are also found in networks with low-quality information.,"[Newman, Carol] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Newman, Carol] Trinity Coll Dublin, Inst Int Integrat Studies, Dublin, Ireland; [Tarp, Finn; Van den Broeck, Katleen] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Tarp, Finn] UNU WIDER, Helsinki, Finland",Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; University of Copenhagen,"Tarp, F (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farigmagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.",Finn.Tarp@econ.ku.dk,"; Newman, Carol/J-6421-2012; Tarp, Finn/T-9651-2017","Van den Broeck, Katleen/0000-0002-3851-7043; Newman, Carol/0000-0002-1785-0891; Tarp, Finn/0000-0002-6247-4370",,,,,36,14,15,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Under very general conditions over oblique socialization, vertical socialization ensures convergence, while the structure of oblique socialization determines the steady state class. In particular, the presence of specific socialization schemes, namely, ethnocentrism, emulation, and reciprocity, produces different outcomes in terms of integration or attitude ranking. Further, the model is applied to the US case by examining the observed ranking of attitudes and obtaining predictions on the possible attitude patterns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The recovery is then connected to monetary policy that allowed non-sterilised gold inflows to increase the money supply. Often this is shown by measuring the fiscal multipliers and demonstrating that they were relatively small. This paper shows that problems with the conventional measures of fiscal multipliers in the 1930s may have created an incorrect consensus on the irrelevance of fiscal policy. The rehabilitation of fiscal policy is seen as a necessary step in the reinterpretation of the positive role of New Deal policies for the recovery.,"[Perry, Nathan] Colorado Mesa Univ, Grand Junction, CO USA; [Vernengo, Matas] Bucknell Univ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Vernengo, M (通讯作者)，Bucknell Univ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",,,,,,,,68,10,10,2,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In this paper we assemble a new dataset of more than 25,000 residential and business broadband plans from all OECD countries from 2007 to 2009 to explore how data metering, service contracts, and bundling voice, video, and data affect the prices consumers pay. We find that faster speeds are correlated with higher prices, although prices increase at a decreasing rate as speeds increase. Additionally, bundles including voice and video are more expensive than standalone service, and plans with more channels included in video bundles are more expensive than plans with fewer channels. Finally, the analysis shows tradeoffs consumers and suppliers make: plans with data caps are less expensive than those without caps and plans with contracts are less expensive than month-to-month plans.","[Wallsten, Scott J.] Technol Policy Inst, Washington, DC 20001 USA; [Wallsten, Scott J.] Georgetown Ctr Business & Publ Policy, Washington, DC 20001 USA; [Riso, James] Cornerstone Res, New York, NY 10022 USA",Cornerstone Research,"Wallsten, SJ (通讯作者)，Technol Policy Inst, 1099 New York Ave,Suite 520, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",scott@wallsten.net,"Wallsten, Scott/ABF-2887-2021",,,,,,35,4,4,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Pre-exam submission asks students to submit college preferences before entrance exam scores are known, whereas post-score (post-exam) submission removes (reduces) score uncertainties. Theoretical analyses show that although mechanisms with post-score submission or SD matching are ex-post fair and efficient, they are not so ex-ante. Instead, the mechanism with pre-exam submission and BOS matching can be more fair and efficient ex-ante. These hypotheses are supported by empirical test on data from a top school at a top-ranked Chinese university with identification based on temporal and provincial changes. We find that although students admitted under the pre-exam BOS mechanism have lower college entrance exam scores than students admitted through other mechanisms on average, they exhibit similar or even better college academic performance.

These include a simple MNL model with interaction terms between respondent characteristics and attribute levels, a latent class model, a random parameter (mixed) logit model, and a hybrid random parameter-latent class model. The public good valued was an increase in renewable electricity generation. The models consistently show that preferences over renewable technologies are heterogeneous among respondents, but that the degree of heterogeneity differs for different renewable technologies. Specifically, preferences over solar power appear to be more heterogeneous across respondents than preferences for other renewable technologies. Comparing across models, the random parameter logit model and the hybrid random parameter-latent class model fit the choice data best and did the best job capturing preference heterogeneity.

This finding suggests that a more elaborate real marginal cost function should be considered by the new Keynesian literature. Tests of the new Keynesian Phillips curve that are based on the restrictive one-factor production technology should therefore be reconsidered.

If the debt of a nation is sustainable, then it implies that the government should have no incentive to default on its internal debt. In this article we examine whether or not the debt-GDP ratios of the G-7 and some European countries can be characterized by a unit root process with the non-linear trend and asymmetric adjustment. The econometric methodology allows us to determine whether the stationarity holds for the government's debt-GDP ratio after considering the non-linear trend. Among the main results, it is found that it is very likely that the debt-GDP ratios of Canada, Germany, the US and Italy are stationarity after taking account of the non-linear trend in the long run. Nevertheless, it is model-dependent for the debt-GDP ratios of these countries to be asymmetrically adjusted after taking the non-linear trend into consideration. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, most existing studies only employ single equation models to test the flypaper effect. In this paper, we specify a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model to examine the flypaper effect in Japan, primarily because other categories of expenditure influence the expenditure on particular policy objectives. We also include spatial interaction in our estimation model and employ a Bayesian approach in estimating our model. Our results show that SUR with a spatial error model is better for this purpose than several other specifications. Using this approach, we observe evidence of the flypaper effect in land development, police, education, and debt expenditure, and spatial interaction in sanitation, police, education, and disaster recovery expenditure.

We first introduce some trade-based explanations for increased wage inequality. There are, however, a number of criticisms of this line of thought based on the trade-wage inequality anomaly', the price-wage anomaly', and the small volume of trade. Mainly due to these criticisms, trade-based explanations for rising wage inequality have been limited in the economic literature. Rather, the primary explanations for wage inequality have been based on skill-biased technological change. Some trade models, however, have weakened the above criticisms, and more economists now argue that the effect of trade, though relatively small compared to that of technological change, is more significant than generally believed. Finally, we attempt to link new trends in inequality, such as job polarization and within-group inequality, to the trade and wage inequality literature.","Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Kurokawa, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan.",,,,,,,,120,23,26,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We build a firm-sided model showing that a first-order stochastic dominance shift in the productivity distribution function decreases the probability of hiring workers with temporary contracts, while a second-order shift has ambiguous effects. Next, using a dataset based on a survey of Italian manufacturing firms, we find that R&D and IA increase the extensive and intensive margins of employing workers with temporary contracts. Moreover, we disentangle the impact of different types of R&D and IA, finding that extra muros R&D always has a positive effect, while the effect of intra muros R&D is generally null. Also the effect of IA changes according to the type of activity: positive with product innovation, null with process innovation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Auer, RA",,,,"Auer, Raphael A.",,,What drives TARGET2 balances? Evidence from a panel analysis,ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EXTERNAL WEALTH; FOREIGN-ASSETS,"What are the drivers of the large TARGET2 (T2) balances that have emerged in the eurozone since the start of the financial crisis in 2007? This paper examines the extent to which changes in national T2 balances can be statistically associated with cross-border private capital flows and current account (CA) balances. In a quarterly panel spanning the years 1999 to 2012 and 12 countries, it is shown that while the CA and changes in T2 balances were unrelated until the start of the 2007 financial crisis, since then the relation between these two variables has become statistically significant and economically sizeable. This reflects the sudden stop' in private sector capital that had hitherto funded CA imbalances. I next examine how different types of private capital flows have evolved over the last few years and how this can be related to changes in T2 balances, finding some deposit flight by private customers, a substantial retrenchment of cross-border interbank lending, and also an increase in bank's holdings of high-quality sovereign debt. My first conclusion from this analysis is that since T2 imbalances were caused by a sudden stop and are unlikely to grow without bounds as eurozone CA imbalances are currently diminishing at a rapid pace, there is no evidence that the institutional set-up of the European monetary union needs to be reformed fundamentally. My further conclusions relate to how the current system transfers risks across the currency union. Limiting or settling T2 balances are not viable options. Rather, policies must be geared to limiting the implicit risk transfer from the private to the public sector within T2 creditor nations, which is facilitated by the current system as it may change the incidence of euro break-up risk.

The analysis was performed using data collected by way of a survey, targeted at the heads of spin-off support programmes in universities in the United Kingdom and Spain, to which we applied the cluster analysis technique, and then a Anova analysis tro confirm their results. This enabled us to identify in these universities three types of spin-off support programmes, differing in terms of experience, resources, university's commitment, proactivity, selectivity, number of spin-offs created and rate of survival. Among the various types of programmes identified, we found one that appear to be model for success. This type seems to opt for a policy intermediate of proactivity and selectivity. We have also found the existence of a certain country effect on the characteristics of the successful model. Finally, we have been able to confirm the importance given by the literature to the existence of a favourable environment to the success of spin-off programmes.","[Beraza Garmendia, Jose Maria; Rodriguez Castellanos, Arturo] Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Gipuzkoa, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Garmendia, JMB (通讯作者)，Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Gipuzkoa, Spain.",josemaria.beraza@ehu.es; arturo.rodriguez@ehu.es,,,,,,,47,5,5,1,47,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

We study bilateral trade balances for a sample of 18 European countries over the period from 1948 through 2008. We find that, with the introduction of the euro, trade imbalances among euro area members widened considerably, even after allowing for permanent asymmetries in trade competitiveness within pairs of countries or in the overall trade competitiveness of individual countries. This is consistent with indications that pair-wise trade tends to be more balanced when nominal exchange rates are flexible. Intra-euro area imbalances also seem to have become more persistent with the introduction of the euro, some of which is linked to labor market inflexibility. Reviewing the direction of imbalances, we find that bilateral trade surpluses are decreasing in the real exchange rate, decreasing in growth differentials, and increasing in the relative volatility of national business cycles. Finally, countries with relatively higher fiscal deficits and less flexible labor and product markets exhibit systematically lower trade surpluses than others. (C) 2013 Society for Policy Modeling.

The trend in employing complicated and ambiguity-bearing unconventional monetary tools in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis has increased the value of such a method. The aim of this article is to introduce a coherent and consistent monetary policy evaluation method for Turkey. Accordingly, we suggest that innovations in the spread between overnight interest rates and Treasury auction interest rates are informative for exchange rate, output, and prices. Empirical evidence for this identification reveals that positive innovation in spread (implying a tight monetary policy measure) decreases output temporarily, permanently decreases prices, and appreciates local currency. This result is also robust to alternative specifications.","[Berument, M.

Agents may sell, or buy, reports over the information acquired and choose their trades in the market on the basis of what they learnt. Reports are unverifiable - cheap talk messages - hence the quality of the information transmitted depends on the conflicts of interest faced by the senders. We find that, when information has a prevalent horizontal differentiation component, in equilibrium information is acquired when its costs are not too high and in that case it is also sold, though reports are typically noisy. The market for information is in most cases a monopoly, and there is underinvestment in information acquisition. We also show that regulatory interventions, in the form of firewalls, only make the inefficiency worse. Efficiency can be attained with a monopolist selling differentiated information, provided entry is blocked. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

For low and high levels of competition we show that, in equilibrium, few are predicted to misreport. It is for medium levels of competition that misreporting is predicted to be highest.
