The model extends previous work by Struben and Sterman (2008) to allow analysis of the UK market. The impact on uptake and CO2 emissions of factors such as subsidies, range, charge point availability, emission rates and a revenue preserving tax are considered. We show that subsidies have little impact on take-up under a traditional business as usual case. However, when we introduce a conditional marketing scenario, they play an important role in tipping the market into a successful trajectory. The sensitivity of the results to assumptions on word of mouth, average vehicle life and emissions rates are explored and we find that changing these can result in a greater impact on take-up and emissions than policy or vehicle attribute factors. Our results have important policy implications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although plenty of scientists have researched the theoretical and practical problems of assessing organization's knowledge potential for a few decades, a unified and single methodology of assessment has not been accepted. The outcome of our research is the original concept for determining knowledge potential, essentially based on new principles. An assessment of the factors making a real impact helped in building a model including such components as employee's knowledge potential, knowledge potential synergy, and organization's environment.

For most European jurisdictions, Directive 1999/44/EC on the sale of consumer goods and its subsequent implementation into national law resulted in a substantial change in the remedies available to the consumer if a product proves deficient. Despite the purpose of the directive to harmonize national legislation, sales laws still differ significantly among member states. The analysis uses a stylized model to compare the pertinent features of two prototypical legal regimes that can be found after the directive's implementation. The pivotal difference between the respective regimes lies in the sequence of remedies. We show that it is possible that investment incentives and the probability that contractual relationships initiated will be completed may be larger under either legal regime. Despite the general case's ambiguity, we establish that the cancelation probability is typically lower if sales law limits buyers initial choice of remedies to subsequent performance. Our analysis indicates that the EC's harmonization target has been missed. With regard to social optimality, we detail under which conditions it is desirable to provide an institutional framework that allows total seller investment to be split between an initial and an incremental input.","[Troeger, Tobias H.] Univ Tubingen, Fac Law, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Friehe, Tim] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; University of Konstanz,"Tröger, TH (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Fac Law, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",tim.friehe@uni-konstanz.de; tobias.troeger@jura.uni-tuebingen.de,"Tröger, Tobias/AAV-3514-2021; Friehe, Tim/ABF-4676-2020","Friehe, Tim/0000-0002-9390-3537; Troger, Tobias H./0000-0002-3908-8148",,,,,27,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Its practitioners tend toward the just do it school of scholarship, in which a concern with the present moment in economic geography subordinates all else. In contrast, I argue that it is vital to know economic geography's history. Historical knowledge of our discipline enables us to realize that we are frequently slaves of some defunct economic geographer; that we cannot escape our geography and history, which seep into the very pores of the ideas that we profess; and that the full connotations of economic geographic ideas are sometimes purposively hidden, secret even, revealed only later by investigative historical scholarship. My antidote: notes from the underground, which means a history of economic geography that delves below the reported surface. This history is often subversive, contradicting conventional depictions; it is antirationalist, querying universal (timeless) foundations; it seeks out deliberately hidden and buried economic geographic practices, relying on sources literally found undergroundpersonal papers and correspondence stored in one subterranean archive or another. To exemplify the importance of notes from the underground, I present an extended case studythe 20th-century development of central place theory, associated with two economic geographers: the German, Walter Christaller (18931969), and the American, Edward L.

The quality and the explanatory ability of internal rating systems can be different. Models used to measure credit risk are not perfect and give quite unreliable results, respectively; they contribute to the procyclical tendencies of the financial system. This article was based on the assumption that a suitably chosen rating system can significantly support long-term profitability and competitiveness of commercial banks. One part of the article also presents methodology of additional profitability on equity of the bank due to the usage of internal rating models. The analyses has proved that the usage of internal rating models increase profitability through substantial savings in equity, which allows the banks to accelerate lending activities in the banking practice. A comparison of standardized approach and foundation internal rating based approach demonstrates that requirement of equity capital can be decreased from 30 to 40 %. Under the condition of the anticipated savings in equity of 30 %, the usage of internal rating model could increase the profitability on equity up to 13 %, depending on the structure of assets, amount of the interest margins and profitability ratio. Future usage of internal rating based approach is quite uncertain since it has shown its procyclical character and has significantly contributed to the acceleration of the global financial crisis by lower capital requirement. However internal rating based approach implementation is very intensive in the credit risk management of the bank, therefore there is rather suggested a gentle modification in this area and not a complete elimination. It has been considered a neccessity to reassess its status in area of solvency, because of its intensive impact on reduction of equity capital.","[Belas, Jaroslav; Cipovova, Eva] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fak Managementu & Ekon, Ustav Podnikove Ekon, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Novak, Petr; Polach, Jiri] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fak Managementu & Ekon, Ustav Financi & Ucetnictvi, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Belás, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fak Managementu & Ekon, Ustav Podnikove Ekon, Zlin, Czech Republic.",belas111@gmail.com; cipovova@fame.utb.cz; pnovak@fame.utb.cz; jpolach@fame.utb.cz,"Cipovová, Eva/H-6650-2012; Kostikov, Eva/N-2596-2019; Novak, Petr/AAM-7284-2020; Belas, Jaroslav/AGS-6813-2022","Kostikov, Eva/0000-0003-4408-4798; Novak, Petr/0000-0003-4701-5755; Belas, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5900-997X",,,,,19,29,29,0,26,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In order to investigate local inhabitant and service staff attitude and readiness to cooperate and assist tourists qualitative research methods are used to observe responsiveness, communication, courtesy and other attributes of two investigated groups of inhabitants and tourist related service staff in Latvia. Findings. Research results show the readiness of local inhabitant and service staffs to assist tourists - almost four out of five local inhabitants are ready to assist foreign tourists. 17% of local inhabitants have no assistive cooperation towards tourists, meaning that every fifth or sixth inhabitant just passes by indifferently when approached by foreign tourist with request for help.

The unemployment rate in Romanian economy reacted strongly to the fall in economic activity, by more than doubling in less than a year raising, and thus raising questions on the validity of a symmetric relationship between unemployment and output. In this paper I investigate the existence of asymmetries in the Okun coefficient in Romanian economy. The asymmetric approach is justified based on both practical reasons, given the last results in the literature, as well as from a theoretic point of view. The econometric framework used is the Markov Switching approach. The data used is at monthly frequency and consists in the monthly industrial production index and in the unemployment rate between January 1991 and December 2009. The Regime switching approach allows for the testing whether the Okun relation switches between different phases. I find that there are asymmetries in the Okun coefficient. A state characterized by a weaker Okun coefficient of -0.09 was found, and a state with a stronger Okun coefficient of -0.32.

The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether a relationship exists between possessing certain personality traits and small business success. The personality dimensions of the five-factor model of personality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Openness to experience, Agreeableness and Neuroticism were the focus of this study. Convenience sampling was employed and 383 usable questionnaires were returned. The validity and reliability of the measuring instrument was assessed. Multiple regression analysis was undertaken to establish relationships between the independent variable (the five dimensions of personality) and the dependent variable, Business success. The findings of this study show that individuals who have high levels of the personality traits Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Openness to experience are more likely to have successful small businesses. Openness to experience is of specific importance as it demonstrates the strongest influence, and is the only trait that has a positive influence on both the financial and growth performance of the business. As such, insights are provided into the personality profile most suited to successful small-business ownership.","Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Business Management, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University,"Farrington, SM (通讯作者)，Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Business Management, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",,,,,,,,82,14,22,2,49,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Our analysis was based on information about VC investments in Germany between 2004 and 2009. We found that possible problems caused by the geographic distance to a portfolio firm seem to be overcome by the syndication of investments with one of the VC firms located close to the investment. The results suggest, however, that a short geographic distance between an investor and the investment has an increasing effect on the probability of syndication as well as on the number of firms that join the syndicate. Hence, local VC suppliers may assume the role of an anchor, connecting the regional economy to more distant parts of the industry.","[Fritsch, Michael] Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Fritsch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",m.fritsch@uni-jena.de; dirk.schilder@gmx.de,"Fritsch, Michael/E-9321-2011; Fritsch, Michael/ABB-7526-2021","Fritsch, Michael/0000-0003-0337-4182",,,,,48,20,26,4,61,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

This paper advances procedures for predicting the direction of the federal funds target rate using a dynamic extension of the multinomial logit model. I find that the 6-month Treasury bill spread relative to the federal funds rate, the unemployment rate and the real GDP growth rate have superior predictive content for the direction of the target a week to several months ahead. When these variables are employed, lagged target changes do not provide additional predictive power. This suggests that the apparent positive serial dependence of the target changes is due to the Fed's systematic response to autocorrelated macroeconomic variables.

The study tracked volunteers' travel behavior to determine which roads (and thus which class of roads) users chose to accommodate their travel needs. More than half of the travel on county roads and city streets occur outside of one's home city, but most travel is within one's home county. The average share of travel distance in the home county is more than 70% for both county and city streets. The high share, which does not account for non-residents destined for the county to work or shop, e.g., implies that the free rider problem on city and county streets at the county level is minimal. Of particular concern is travel on city roads in cities other than one's own. To the extent that this is to go to a destination in that city, that travel is also local. However, because city and county roads are typically funded by those jurisdictions from land-based sources such as property taxes, through trips with neither end in the city through which they are traveling are in a very real sense free riders, and pose a problem. With growing trip lengths and emerging economies of scale in road management, It may be appropriate to consider moving more roads from township, town, or city level to the county level of government.

Life cycle theory assumes that development is governed or mediated by underlying natural, logic or institutional rules. Life cycle models do not deny that firm size and age vary, but they assert that prospective development is related to typical configurations (e.g. transition between stages, vulnerable spots). Knowing these configurations hypothetically can facilitate (pro-) active change and crisis management in favour of firm survival and growth. More than 100 life cycle models have been published during the last 50 years. These models differ in many respects, in general they analyse the opposite forces of growth (success) and decline (crisis) or both. Some of these models are more conceptual and holistic (e.g. whole life cycle; range from small to large); others are more empirical and very specific (e.g. small number of selected firms; mainly cross sectional, few longitudinal). Due to this variety the predictive power of life cycle models tend to be rather specific than general. This paper presents a conception to systemize life cycle models and to create a basis for comparing different approaches. Intended is a portfolio which relates life cycle approaches to firm characteristics and to configurations indicating (predict) requirements or recommendations for change and (pro-) active crisis management. This portfolio can aid further research and evaluations of relevance.","[Oehl, Hans-Peter] Area Integra Consulting & Training GmbH, Riga, Latvia",,,hans-peter.oehl@aon.at,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,11,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,457,466,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100042,0

A fair distribution would mean that the allocation is closely related to the profit generating factors of the underlying entities. The EC supposes that fixed tangible assets, sales and labour are the dominant factors in the generation of profit. This paper analyses the profit generating capacity of these factors and of the alternative factor intangible assets. The results show that the proposed factors only explain 28% of the variation in profit. Moreover, the results indicate that recognized intangibles do not increase R2 significantly. However, for R&D intensive companies, adding the market less book value to proxy for unrecognized intangibles increases the explanatory power with 30%. This suggests that for these companies unrecognized intangibles could be important in generating profit.","[Roggeman, Annelies; Verleyen, Isabelle; Coppens, Carine] Univ Coll Ghent, Fac Business & Informat Management, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van Cauwenberge, Philippe] Univ Ghent, Dept Accountancy & Corp Finance, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",HOGENT University College of Applied Sciences & Arts; Ghent University,"Roggeman, A (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Ghent, Fac Business & Informat Management, Valentin Vaerwyckweg 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Annelies.Roggeman@Hogent.be; Isabelle.Verleyen@Hogent.be; Philippe.Vancauwenberge@Ugent.be; Carine.Coppens@Hogent.be,"Van Cauwenberge, Philippe/B-2566-2013","Roggeman, Annelies/0000-0002-7717-2447",,,,,49,13,13,0,18,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

To maintain this advantage, they must identify and monitor their main rivals. The aim of this paper is to identify and characterize the main competitors of small banks illustrated with the example of cooperative banks in Poland The paper describes the competitive environment of small banks as well as the results of the author's study concerning the identification and perception of their main competitors by small banks, i.e. cooperative banks, in Poland","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Banking Dept, Fac Management Informat & Accounting, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Wozniewska, G (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Banking Dept, Fac Management Informat & Accounting, Komandorska St 118,120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",grazyna.wozniewska@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,16,0,0,2,12,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The routes have generally overlaid the existing bus network as part of the bus reform package, implemented in Sydney from 2005. This paper analyses the performance of Metrobuses by looking at time series data to analyse the impacts of the 13 Metrobus routes and their interactions with the existing bus network and to test whether these services have increased public transport use along the corridors they serve. The methodology captures the routes of the pre-existing network within the catchment area of each Metrobus route using GIS and compares supply and demand for these routes with the Metrobus routes. The results show Metrobuses boost patronage in fringe areas but not in the inner areas where the public transport networks are denser. Metrobus services appear to take at least six months to ramp up patronage to a steady state and then the boardings per supplied km of Metrobuses serving the inner areas are lower than those of the pre-existing routes on the same corridor with the reverse being true for the metropolitan fringe. These results suggest that quality bus services are more necessary to fringe areas with less access to direct routes than in the inner Sydney with policy implications for social inclusion access to services and jobs and for environmental benefits if Metrobuses can promote Mode switch to public transport in areas dominated by car use.

The paper will attempt to assess how far there are similarities in these structures and whether there is evidence of any form of convergence. It does so with a review of the relevant legislation and structures, and their effects, based on the published and grey literature in the two countries. It uses a theory of the regulatory cycle (based on Needham, 1983) to theorise the relative regulatory positions of the two countries. It pays particular attention to the development of types of cooperative or partnership contract between the public and private sectors in local bus transport in the two countries, and assesses the similarities and differences between these two contracts. It concludes that, whilst the two countries may be at different points on the regulatory cycle, and therefore that in regulatory terms these partnership contracts are the result of very different pressures, in fact they are resulting in some similarities, though not in any way a regulatory convergence.

These need to encompass such revenue sources as externality pricing, user pays, beneficiary pays, wider value capture, asset sales and other opportunities. Such matters are just some of the important examples of governance/institutional design considerations that underpin sustainable public transport, an area the workshop recognised as needing much greater future focus. Ways to grow public transport use, and improve service delivery efficiencies and performance, in both trunk and local markets were discussed, with a particular focus on flexible transport systems. Whether these services should target specific niche markets or pursue a wider customer base was an area of some disagreement requiring further research, in a low density developed country setting. The different roles played by flexible transport systems between developed and emerging countries were notable.

Resulting bus accidents may be attributed to the shortcomings of the bus drivers. This study investigates the users' expectations of drivers of sightseeing buses to advise tour bus businesses on how to improve travel safety in response to user needs. Two bus user groups (teachers and parents) in urban and rural areas were surveyed for their expectations of sightseeing bus drivers in terms of age, experience, education, driving license, driving skill pertaining to the route, training, and no drinking or smoking. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that all seven indicators affect the expectations of users in rural zones; albeit only five indicators were fitted with urban model by discarding experience and driving license indicators. Urban users gave the highest priority to 'no drinking or smoking'; while 'training' was of most concern to rural users. Additionally, multi-group analysis found that the variable structures of the users' expectations of sightseeing bus drivers are homologous for urban and rural groups with some variables having dissimilar significance depending on the geographical conditions of each area. It has been found that most accidents around the world were caused by driver negligence similar to those found in Thailand. So, these results and the potential interest of this work can also be useful to readers outside Thailand. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the current financing practices for the second-class highways in China, (equivalent to U.S. or state highways in the United States connecting major cities in a state), this paper developed an integrated method to assess the long-term sustainability of IFS and GFIS in terms of the following widely accepted criteria: adequacy, stability, efficiency, equity, ease of implementation, and political acceptability. These criteria were further classified into quantifiable efficiency criteria (QEC) and non-quantifiable social-institutional criteria (NQSIC) categories. In this research, time-series analysis and telephone-interview methods were used for accessing QEC and NQSIC, respectively. It was found that the IFS in general has more advantage in providing sufficient, stable, and effective funds than the GFIS, and it is considered more favorable and acceptable than GFIS by both provincial and local governments. The results of this research can help decision makers at various levels in China to develop sustainable and effective funding strategies for the second-class highways.

Our results reveal that loads are generally quite large (median 30 kg), but with substantial variance within and across drug types. Males and females, as well as U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens are all well represented among mules. We also find that mule compensation is substantial (median $1313), and varies with load characteristics. Specifically, for mules caught with cocaine and meth, pay appears to be strongly correlated to expected sentence if caught, while pay appears to be primarily correlated with load size for marijuana mules, who generally smuggle much larger loads than those smuggling cocaine and meth. We argue that our results suggest that this underground labor market generally acts like a competitive labor market, where a risk-sensitive, reasonably well-informed, and relatively elastic labor force is compensated for higher risk tasks.

Bork proposed what he called a consumer-welfare standard, though it is what we today call a total-welfare standard. Interestingly, many of the arguments Bork offered in defense of the latter apply also to the former. Bork defended his proposed standard less on the support that it finds in economics and more on his reading of legislative intent. Although Bork's antitrust analysis drew largely on basic microeconomic theory, he believed that economists and courts were incapable of estimating competitive effects. He therefore favored bright-line rules for, particularly, proposed mergers. Whatever else one thinks of Bork, on the critical question of antitrust's fundamental purpose, his views have in large measure prevailed.","Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20024 USA",,"Heyer, K (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",,,,,,,,14,7,7,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

One potential route for emissions reduction is to combine these policy options, by applying a carbon tax which is used to subsidize fleet renewal. Such a policy would have impacts on many aspects of the aviation system, including demand, fleet composition, traffic delays, and airfares. Therefore, its impacts need to be considered holistically, taking into account likely interaction and feedback effects. In this paper, we apply a model of the global aviation system, the Aviation Integrated Model (AIM), to assess the demand and emissions response from passenger aviation following the application of such an aviation sector policy. We find that by 2050, aviation lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions may be reduced by up to 34% compared to the no-policy case for a policy aimed at retiring aircraft over 20 years old.

The focus is on a specific class of models, the so-called single hidden-layer feed forward autoregressive neural network models. What makes these models interesting in the present context is the fact that they form a class of universal approximators and may be expected to work well during exceptional periods such as major economic crises. Neural network models are often difficult to estimate, and we follow the idea of White (2006) of transforming the specification and nonlinear estimation problem into a linear model selection and estimation problem. To this end, we employ three automatic modelling devices. One of them is White's QuickNet, but we also consider Autometrics, which is well known to time series econometricians, and the Marginal Bridge Estimator, which is better known to statisticians. The performances of these three model selectors are compared by looking at the accuracy of the forecasts of the estimated neural network models. We apply the neural network model and the three modelling techniques to monthly industrial production and unemployment series from the G7 countries and the four Scandinavian ones, and focus on forecasting during the economic crisis 2007-2009. The forecast accuracy is measured using the root mean square forecast error. Hypothesis testing is also used to compare the performances of the different techniques.

Most of the time, those causes can be described as reasons. Human beings perform actions because they have reasons for performing them. They are capable of surveying the options available and then selecting one based upon those reasons. But invariably occasions arise in which the reasons known to the agent fail to single out a determinate option. When reasons cannot determine the option to select on their own, the agent must resort to some form of non-reasoned decision-making (NRDM). This paper distinguishes four different forms of NRDM - picking, randomizing, deferring and judging. Each form may be appropriate under different circumstances.

Using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation technique, a regression model is developed. The model is used to explore the links between demographic variables and macroeconomic variables such as real gross domestic product, age dependency ratio and agricultural land. The findings indicate that the link between macroeconomic variables and demographic variables is somewhat ambiguous which requires explanations at the micro level.

In Europe the system has been applied since 2005 to energy intensive installations and, since January the 1st 2012, to airlines with flights arriving and departing from Community airports. Regulators should consider not only the efficiency of the ET'S in reaching an environmental goal,.but also its implications for market competition. In this work, we develop a theoretical model that analyses the European ETS's main features as devised for airlines, focusing on its effects on potential competition and entry deterrence. Contrary to other economic activities under an ETS, potential competition is usual in most airline markets. Our results indicate that the share of capped allowances allocated initially for free to air operators may be a key element in deterring or allowing entry into the market. This result may be against the European principle of promoting competition and may represent a step backwards in the construction of a single European air transport market. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, all standard liability regimes yield the efficient choice of care by the firm, independent of the level of usage. This implies that liability for harm can be considered independently of market structure and competition. We find that when expected harm is cumulative (i.e., increasing and convex in usage), then different liability regimes produce different outcomes and yield different implications for social efficiency. Since the responsibilities for product and market performance are divided among relevant agencies and institutions, this presents a challenge to the correct design of rules for agents in the market. We argue for selection among alternative liability regimes based upon what we refer to as resilience. Strict liability is a resilient policy; no liability and negligence are not resilient. Thus, we provide a new argument for strict liability with respect to product-generated harms.

Yet, despite increased interest in networks, a critical assessment of the role of geography in the evolution of networks is still lacking. This article attempts to explore the interplay between geographic distance and triadic closure as two main forces that drive the evolution of collaboration networks. Analyzing the evolution of inventor networks in German biotechnology, the article theoretically argues and empirically demonstrates that-as the technological regime of an industry changes over time-inventors increasingly rely on network resources by forming links to partners of partners, while the direct impact of geographic distance on tie formation decreases. Although initially triadic closure reinforces the geographic distance effect by closing triads among proximate inventors, over time triadic closure becomes an increasingly powerful vehicle to generate longer distance collaboration ties as the effect of geographic proximity decreases.","Imperial Coll Business Sch, Innovat Studies Ctr, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Ter Wal, ALJ (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll Business Sch, Innovat Studies Ctr, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",a.terwal@imperial.ac.uk,"Ter Wal, Anne/B-4940-2008","Ter Wal, Anne/0000-0002-6041-6898",,,,,100,132,141,8,147,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The first level decision is about whether the drivers will travel to one of the nearest taxi stands after dropping off their customers and the second level decision is on whether the drivers will join the queue at the nearest taxi stand once they have arrived there. A stated preference survey was conducted to interview 258 urban taxi drivers about their choices of the two level decisions. The statistical test shows that search districts, travel distance from the customer's drop-off location to the designated taxi stand, the congestion level on the way of cruising, as well as the preference for traveling towards taxi stands are found to be the significant factors of the first level decision. This study also confirms that the queue lengths of both taxis and passengers at taxi stands, the expected customer-search distance after leaving taxi stands, and the preference of vacant taxi drivers for staying at taxi stands are found to be significantly influence the second level decision. The likelihood ratio tests for market segmentation analysis demonstrate the variations in preferences of taxi drivers operated in different taxi shifts and service areas. Some policy implications on introducing more taxi stands and improving the utilization rates of taxi stands are also discussed.

But the huge financial investments required by these infrastructures will not be undertaken without a well-designed regulatory framework. This paper argues that barriers to the implementation of such a framework can best be understood by drawing analogies to the Law and Economics literature on anticommons. Although situations of ownership anticommons (many owners with veto rights) and regulatory anticommons (many regulators with veto rights) display some differences from the point of view of the preferences and the coordination costs, it is submitted that this analytic framework can be employed to assess and criticize recent EU and US proposals which try to improve planning and siting procedures for cross-border green infrastructures. The literature on anticommons also suggests that effective remedies to suboptimal resource use are directly dependent on the design of the coordination mechanisms among all the regulatory levels.","Univ Trent, Sch Econ, I-38122 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Bellantuono, G (通讯作者)，Univ Trent, Sch Econ, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",giuseppe.bellantuono@unitn.it,,"Bellantuono, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6982-883X",,,,,108,1,1,2,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Most of these works have used single prediction models, such as logistic regressions and survival models, to seek the key influencing factors. From the point of view of customer relationship management (CRM), a two-stage model (i.e., the segment and prediction model) is proposed for analyzing the risk of mortgage prepayment in this research. In the first stage, random forests are used to segment mortgagors into different groups; then, a proportional hazard model is constructed to predict the prepayment time of the mortgagors in the second stage. The results indicate that the two-stage model predicts mortgage prepayment more accurately than the single-stage model (non-segmentation model). (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters.

Overall, all short-sale regulations harm market efficiency. However, naked short-selling prohibition is the only regulation that leaves volumes unchanged while addressing the failure to deliver.

This study suggests a somewhat opposite thesis, whereby independent judicial review allows politicians to credibly commit to destabilizing the validity of such policies. Due to the probable judicial intervention-as a result of the independent judicial review process-the expected policy in force will align more closely with general-interests, insofar as constitutional standards are so oriented.

Numerous policy measures on urban freight transport have been taken throughout Europe during the last decade. This paper presents the results of a study on the state of urban freight transport policies and planning among Swedish local authorities. Results are compared with existing research in the European context in order to find possible links between the freight transport awareness and the successes or failures of measures addressing urban freight transport issues. A questionnaire sent to all Swedish municipalities was combined with a literature study, to map the state of policy and planning within the freight transport as well as the knowledge and awareness of the area. The importance of adequate knowledge and personnel resources in municipalities as well as communication, information dissemination and knowledge exchange is discussed. The empirical data confirm the lack of coordination, sufficient resources and effective knowledge transfer among stakeholders in urban freight transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine these issues, a translog cost function is estimated jointly with factor share equations subject to required coefficient restrictions by using the method of 'Zellner's iterative' technique using the annual data of 11 STUs from 2000-01 to 2010-11. We find that the cost function is fully separable between time (technology) and its other arguments; therefore, technological progress experienced by Sills is (Hicks) neutral and returns to scale depends on output alone. Further analysis reveals that the average cost curve for STUs is U-shaped and it is increasing for the mean firm; consequently, large and medium size STUs are operating on diseconomies of scale whereas relatively small size STUs are experiencing economies of scale. We also examined the technological progress that STUs have enjoyed over time. It is found that the technological progress is same across STUs, though diminishing over time. STUs' cost savings due to technological progress has reduced from 2.1% of the total cost in 2000-01 to 1.3% of the total cost in 2010-11. Finally, we analyzed price elasticities of input demand and elasticity of substitution. It is found that all input demands are price inelastic and cross-price effect is not very strong. Since all own-partial elasticities of substitution are negative, hence, as required, the postulates of the cost minimizing factor demand theory are satisfied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is also questioned how the destination image influences the sponsor brands. The secondary objective is to investigate the influences of the destination image on the intention of attendance to a sporting event. For hypothesis testing a banner was inserted in an international and professional sport event. Structural equation modelling is used as the method of the analysis. The result of the analysis shows a good reliability of the scale and items as well as predictive relevance of the model. The results indicate that the image of the city that host the sporting event influences the image transmission process in sponsorship but not the intention to assist at the sporting event. The main motive of the travel is the attendance at the sporting event and not enjoying the territory itself Regarding the influence of the destination image on both event and sponsor, the image transference is certainly produced.

We find strong cross-sectional associations between schooling and the fertility outcomes, and some evidence that more schooling causes women to have fewer children and delay childbearing, though not to the extent that interpreting cross-sectional associations as causal would imply. Our conclusions are robust when taking account of (1) endogenous within-twin pair schooling differences due to reverse causality and (2) measurement error in schooling. We also investigate possible mechanisms and find that the effect of women's schooling on completed fertility is not mediated through husband's schooling but may be mediated in part through age at first marriage.","[Amin, Vikesh] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Behrman, Jere R.] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Central Michigan University; University of Pennsylvania,"Amin, V (通讯作者)，Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",amin1v@cmich.edu; jbehrman@econ.upenn.edu,"Behrman, Jere R/A-9734-2009",,,,,,37,29,35,4,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

While various countries (developed and developing economies) have benefitted from the direct and spillover effects of FDI, which range from improved technology and knowledge diffusion through to individual and corporate capability enhancement, FDI outflow remains largely channelled to the developed countries, and the rapidly developing countries in Asia and South America. Evidence suggests that the development-enhancing effects of FDI are felt more highly in the developing economies, such as economies in Africa. However, FDI inflow to the developing economies has been very low. Using data generated from the African Development Indicators (ADI) between 1980 and 2008 in econometric estimations, this paper finds that government policies (especially fiscal and monetary policies) play significant roles in facilitating FDI inflow to the African countries studied. The study thereby suggests an improved regulatory framework to make Africa more attractive to inflow of FDI.","Univ S Africa, Dept Business Management, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Aregbeshola, AR (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Business Management, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Aregbeshola, Rafiu Adewale/AAW-5010-2020; Aregbeshola, Rafiu A/A-7879-2015","Aregbeshola, Rafiu A/0000-0002-8502-7493",,,,,40,4,8,0,8,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The national competition policy, directed towards the detection and punishment of cartels, is an important tool for ensuring fair and free competition and an important factor for maintaining the country's economic development. The success of an efficient competition supervision is determined by not only a formal coordination of the legal basis, but also by the peculiarities of practical application of competition law, economic and cultural aspects of society, the political will and many other factors. Despite the fact that formally, the regulation of competition restricting agreements concluded between undertakings in Lithuania is essentially the same as in the European Union, however, in Lithuania the level of competition culture and competition policy dissemination and public awareness is quite low, compared to the other European Union states.

For this reason, we want to investigate the economic impacts of national parks in a peripheral Scandinavian context by analyzing employment in tourism. Theoretically, the paper addresses the idea of nature protection as a tool for regional development. The scientific literature suggests that nature can be considered a commodity that can be used for the production of tourism experiences in peripheries. In this context nature protection is applied as a label for signifying attractive places for tourists leading to increased tourist numbers and employment. This argument follows mainly North American experiences pointing at a positive impact of protected areas on regional development. Meanwhile European studies are more skeptical regarding desired economic benefits. A major challenge is the assessment of tourism's economic impacts. This paper suggests an approach that reveals the impacts on the labor market. This is particularly applicable since data is readily available and, moreover from a public perspective, employment and tax incomes are of uppermost importance in order to sustain population figures and local demand for public services. At the same time accessibility and low visitor numbers form major challenges for tourism stakeholders and complicate the assessment of economic impacts through questionnaires and interviews. The paper shows that the assumption that nature protection promotes positive economic development through tourism is not applicable in a northern Swedish context. Hence, it rejects the often suggested positive relationship between nature protection and tourism labor market development.","[Bystrom, Joakim; Muller, Dieter K.] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden; [Bystrom, Joakim; Muller, Dieter K.] Umea Univ, Arctic Res Ctr ARCUM, Umea, Sweden",Umea University; Umea University,"Byström, J (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden.",joakim.bystrom@umu.se; dieter.muller@geography.umu.se,,"Muller, Dieter/0000-0003-2822-5503",,,,,41,14,15,1,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

The practical growth engine for China's automobile industry is Joint Venture (JV) makers between State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and global makers which having concentrated on passenger car making business. The JVs' role at the passenger car business of China has been expanded continuously since early 1990s. Chinese government has strictly prevented a foreign maker from holding above 50% of whole equity of a JV at vehicle making business. It means that the strategic alliances like non-equity alliances, equity alliances or JV have been feasible options for global makers to take for entering China's vehicle making business. Therefore this study took a deep interest in how much sustainable the JV contract in China, and tried to access the issues through industry based view and institution based view. At industry based view, this study analyzed which strategy is more desirable among three types of strategies; non-equity alliances, equity alliances and acquisitions. To do so this study applied the framework suggested by Dyer et al. (2004) for deciding which strategy is relatively more suitable than others according to five factors; types of synergies, nature of resources, extent of redundant resources, degree of market uncertainty, and level of competition. At institution based view, Chinese local governments' plans, governance structures of SOEs and JVs, policy regulations for automobile industry were examined. As a result acquisition turned out to be more suitable than equity alliance or nonequity alliance for vehicle makers in China under current development condition. But the sustainability of a type of equity alliances, JV will be maintained so long in future due to the institutional factors of China.","[Choi, Byunghun] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Gongju, South Korea",Kongju National University,,cbh797@daum.net,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,17,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-7-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,302,325,,,,,,24,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB2XI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342457200021,0

These qualitative indicators include satisfaction with companies' services, trust and sympathy displayed, return to the store and positive recommendations of the store to friends, relatives or other people, together with the perceived fairness of retailers' treatment. They represent important vectors not only in generating behavioral success of these stores, but also in attracting and retaining customers. In shaping a favorable perception, a particular role is played by several levers - prices, assortment, store atmosphere, customer service, etc. These, together with awareness, trust, sympathy, and more recently with sustainability issues (orientation towards environment protection, reducing resource consumption, societal orientation etc.) converge towards a better positioning of the companies among target market segments. The literature highlights several approaches to the issues at stake, treated individually and in interrelation, but does not entirely succeed in outlining an appropriate research direction regarding the integration of sustainability issues in shaping customer preferences towards non-food retail stores. Fully understanding the situation, the authors conduct an empirical research in non-food retailing in Romania.

It is obvious that potential of individual brown fields to be redeveloped differs according to various factors. As a consequence of existence of thousands of brown fields classification of such sites has to be developed to enable their sorting and selecting for redevelopment. The majority of experts concerned with brown fields are familiar with the theoretical model of brownfield types A-B-C introduced by the Cabernet Project, funded by the European Union. This classification of brown fields according to their redevelopment potential could be applied in decision making on necessity of public funding for individual brown fields redevelopment projects. This proposal, however, has two caveats: The first one lies in the classification method used to sort brown fields into the individual categories. The second lies in applying the classification within the system of subvention programmes where regeneration has often different goals. This paper follows the theoretical debate on brown fields classification in its first part; the second part is devoted to analysis of the A-B-C model and its practical application on set of brown fields on the example of the South Moravian and Usti Region (the Czech Republic).

The dynamics of global trade fair cycles,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGRAPHIE,,,English,Article,,,,,,cyclical clusters; field-configuring events; field reproduction; global trade fair cycles; knowledge generation; temporary clusters; trade fairs,TOURNAMENT RITUALS; MARKETS; ORGANIZATIONS; CONFERENCES; EVENTS,"This paper builds on discussions about field-configuring events (FCEs) and cyclical/temporary clusters by investigating the role of trade fairs in structuring processes of knowledge creation in an industry or technology field. It argues that while fundamental field-configuring activities, such as shifts in technological trajectories, are not typically associated with trade fairs, these events play an important role in field reproduction through decentralized processes of knowledge exchange and learning, supported by the global cycles of events. Yet, knowledge flows across different events are rarely as continuous and fluid as in an ideal-type cyclical cluster context. Despite some overlap in their goals and audiences, different trade fairs generally serve different functions and are characterized by diverse knowledge practices. This is illustrated through an empirical analysis of the global trade fair cycle of the lighting industry, which is based on semi-structured interviews and systematic observations conducted at three international/national trade fairs: LightFair International (USA), IIDEX/NeoCon Canada and Light + Building (Germany). From this, we suggest that most trade fairs establish a permanent middle-ground between, but quite distant from, the extreme ideal-types of discrete field-configuration and continuous knowledge circulation.",,,,,,,,,,,35,12,13,3,28,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Based on results of this study, past net interest margins, bank soundness, operating cost, industry concentration, relative market share, inflation, real depreciation and industrial growth have statistically significant and positive impact while diversification, change in bank size, lagged liquidity, stock market development have dampening effects on net interest margins. However, impact of ownership, GDP and credit market development is statistically insignificant.Our regression results suggest that stock market development as means of alternative source of finance contributes to reduction in net interest margins while the impact of banking sector development on breaking banking cartels and bringing net interest margins down had been insignificant. Exchange rate adjustments, rate of inflation and growth of the industry also cannot be ignored in management of net interest margins. Incentives for bank executives and managers to ensure efficiency in operating costs, reduction in the premium charged for bank soundness, diversification of bank activities and passing on the scale efficiencies to both depositors and borrowers can also play role to bring interest margins down to accelerate investment and growth in the country.","Beaconhouse Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Liberal Arts & Social Sci, Lahore 54000, Pakistan",,"Hussain, I (通讯作者)，Beaconhouse Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Liberal Arts & Social Sci, 3-C Zafar Ali Rd,Gulburg 5, Lahore 54000, Pakistan.",ijaz.hussain@bnu.edu.pk,"Hussain, Ijaz/AAG-1249-2019",,,,,,20,5,8,2,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Analyzing previously unavailable data on telecommunication companies' introduction of IPTV services into Indiana, this study found that although IPTV's entry into the state increased the local competition between cable and IPTV, this local competition was mostly confined to higher income areas due to the income redlining tendency associated with IPTV's entry. These empirical findings raise the issue of the recent deregulation policy reforming cable franchising rules, whose goal was to promote local competition but which might insufficiently reflect the public interest, especially for low-income households.","[Ji, Sung Wook] Michigan State Univ, Dept Telecommun Informat Studies & Media, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Ji, SW (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jis@msu.edu,,,,,,,36,0,1,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

We draw a distinction between, what we call, academic and interface consensus, to capture the wide appeal to consensus in existing literature. We investigate such accounts - i.e. from Miriam Solomon, John Beatty and Alfred Moore, and Boaz Miller - as to put forth a new understanding of consensus-making, focusing on the meta-consensus. We further defend how (NIH) consensus conferences enable epistemic work, through demands of epistemic adequacy and contestability, contrary to the claim that consensus conferences miss a window for epistemic opportunity (Solomon M, The social epistemology of NIH consensus conferences. In: Kincaid H, McKitrick J (ed) Establishing medical reality: methodological and metaphysical issues in philosophy of medicine. Springer, Dordrecht, 2007).

The empirical results suggest that the average performance by other agents has a significant negative effect on an individual's performance.

Using a dataset for the BLNS countries covering the period 1990-2007 in annual frequency and a health production function, the study estimates a dynamic panel using the Arellano-Bond (1991) difference Generalised Method of Moments. The study results show that an increase in either SACU revenue or aggregate government expenditure increases HIV prevalence rates. Disaggregating the government expenditures into health and non-health outlays reveals that the health expenditure component decreases HIV prevalence rates. To be precise, the study finds that HIV prevalence rates decline when public health expenditures as a percentage of GDP and public health expenditures as a percentage of total government expenditures increase. It is argued, therefore, that the type of public expenditure is of consequence: public health expenditures decrease, while public non-health expenditures increase the HIV prevalence rates, with the ultimate direction of HIV prevalence rates determined by the dominant of the two effects.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Ngalawa, H (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa.",,"Ngalawa, Harold Phellix/HGE-9156-2022; Ngalawa, Harold/H-5030-2013","Ngalawa, Harold/0000-0002-7040-5594",,,,,24,0,0,0,9,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

A practical need for management of ethics in organizational culture calls for robust measurement instruments which could help to diagnose potential ethical risks and improve ethical dimensions of organizational culture. The paper presents results of explorative validation analysis of a measurement instrument for ethical organizational culture or the corporate ethical virtues model that was originally developed by Kaptein (2008). The model encompasses 8 virtues, i.e. clarity, congruency of supervisors, congruency of management, transparency, feasibility, discussability, supportability and sanctionability, by 58 item scale. Drawing on the argument that self-reported and ethics-related measurements can be highly sensitive to a socio-cultural context, we assume that a measurement instrument tested in a Dutch company may be differently handled in Lithuania. The results of validation by accomplishing factor analysis in a sample of 757 respondents in Lithuanian public organization show that the overall fit of the model is quite high; although some additional conclusions potentially describing socio-cultural context can be formulated.

Our results indicate that a comprehensive model that combines accounting- and market-based variables is the best option to explain the credit risk, suggesting that both types of data are complementary. We also demonstrate that the explanatory power of credit risk models is particularly strong during periods of high uncertainty, such as those experienced in the recent financial crisis.

Firm A (33 employees representing 41 dyads) and Firm B (61 employees representing 60 dyads) were especially chosen as they enabled us to apply the coding system leading to effective evaluation of surveys as the unit of analysis is dyads. In this framework, this study offers an important contribution to the international management literature as positive effects of LMX quality on firm performance, subordinate performance, intention to leave and job satisfaction were found within the context of organizational and Turkish culture. As the proportion of FOBs is almost 95% in Turkey, they represent Turkish economy and business culture well, leading to more generalizable results. Thus, firms can lead to increase in both subordinate and firm performance by creating an organizational culture in which high quality leader-member relationships are emphasized, finally leading to positive organizational outcomes.","[Unnu, Nazli Ayse Ayyildiz; Kesken, Julide] Ege Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Business Adm, Izmir, Turkey",Ege University,"Unnu, NAA (通讯作者)，Ege Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Business Adm, Izmir, Turkey.",nazliayse.ayyildiz@ege.edu.tr; julide.kesken@ege.edu.tr,"Ünnü, Nazlı Ayşe Ayyıldız/AAD-9998-2020","Ünnü, Nazlı Ayşe Ayyıldız/0000-0002-8427-5727",,,,,77,5,10,1,36,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Most economists wholeheartedly oppose BC's export restrictions, arguing that BC's citizens are worse off as a result of the government's measures. In this paper, it is shown that, while free trade in logs might well maximise global wellbeing, it might not necessarily result in the greatest benefit to BC. Indeed, both economic theory and a follow-up numerical analysis indicate that some restrictions on the export of logs can lead to higher welfare for BC than free trade. Thus, log export restrictions could be economically efficient from a local perspective, but only if the transaction costs of obtaining necessary permits are not excessive.

It argues that collaborative FOSS production by volunteer software developers is a species of critical social practice in Boltanski and Chiapello's sense: rooted in resistance to capitalist social relations, and yet also a source of values that justify the new routes to profitability associated with contemporary network capitalism. Advanced via collective projects that are sustained by hacker norms and privately legislated copyleft' law, the FOSS ethos is apparently antithetical to private property-based accumulation. Yet it can be shown to embody the new spirit of capitalism' in its most distilled form; moreover FOSS developers have instituted new forms of property and new modes of profit creation around software that are in the process of being adapted for use in other economic sectors. Meanwhile, the private law constraints on profit-seeking that have emerged from the FOSS movement are counteracting some of the social pathologies that accompany network capitalism only to consolidate others. The paper concludes by identifying likely bases for a renewal of critique given these realities.","London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Law, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Barron, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Law, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.barron@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,101,23,23,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Using different definitions for mainstream and heterodox economics, we compare the individual and academic characteristics of the economists belonging to these groups. We measure the within and between disagreement for each group and we test whether belonging to one or the other group predicts differences in economists' opinions on economic policy. Results show that: 1) mainstream and heterodox economists differ as to individual and academic characteristics and political views; 2) the disagreement within heterodox economics is lower than within mainstream economics; 3) some of commonly used ways of grouping heterodox and mainstream schools of thought have little explicative power in relation to individual opinions; 4) on critical economic policies, the opinions of heterodox and mainstream economists are significantly different even after controlling for a number of individual characteristics, including political opinions.","Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ Studies, I-80133 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples,"Di Maio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ Studies, Via Medina 40, I-80133 Naples, Italy.",michele.dimaio@uniparthenope.it,,"Di Maio, Michele/0000-0003-2622-6780",,,,,56,14,15,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The analysis is carried out at the firm level, on the basis of a survey covering 804 manufacturing establishments in the Province of Quebec (Canada). We investigate the extent to which existing internal capabilities and their interaction with external sources of knowledge, in particular the use of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS), affect the level of innovativeness of manufacturing firms. Then we examine the extent to which different innovation strategies, and the way KIBS are integrated into these, are associated with innovation. We show that manufacturing firms adopt a variety of innovation strategies, none of which preclude innovation, even introverted strategies whereby firms interact little with outside agents. However, those strategies that incorporate KIBS have a considerably greater chance of leading to innovation.","[Doloreux, David] Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Doloreux, David] KEDGE Business Sch, Talence, France; [Shearmur, Richard] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada",University of Ottawa; Kedge Business School; McGill University,"Doloreux, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, 55 Laurier East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",Doloreux@telfer.uottawa.ca,"Doloreux, David/Y-7368-2019","Doloreux, David/0000-0001-7101-2170",,,,,40,32,37,0,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Many big brand retailers and manufacturers, as well as a number of governments, see LCA as a potentially valuable means to measure, communicate and thereby improve the sustainability' of material goods. The paper's arguments are threefold. First, the appeal of LCA's quantitative and seeming holistic methods must be understood in light of certain tensions and imperatives endemic to contemporary supply chain capitalism. Second, this appeal is tentative; it is far from clear that LCA can capture the complexity of products' lives' in measures that are simultaneously practical, legible and scientifically credible. Third, current public- and private-sector sustainability initiatives involving LCA offer opportunities to explore the increasingly important roles of scientific and technical expert communities in supply chain governance.","Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College,"Freidberg, S (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",Freidberg@dartmouth.edu,"freidberg, susanne/AAT-5295-2021; patchett, nicola/GZM-6150-2022",,,,,,86,53,58,2,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Interpreting structural violence, or explaining injustice, requires understanding what the state means to different people. The chief argument that poverty is a form of violence, and represents the killing of the poor, underlines the injustice that results from treating poverty as a biopolitical fact. I employ a notion of politics that is not restricted to parties and mobilization, but which saturates all relations of inequality.

The interest is what production and knowledge networks that are emerging and how these links or networks developed help the firms in terms of capability development and innovation. In addition to linkages, we relook at what drives the firms and the organization forms to invest abroad. Findings from the cases indicate that while the drivers for internationalization or outward foreign direct investment by Malaysian firms are essentially market seeking, the role of supportive government policies is a critical external driver. There is also clear understanding by the organizations that the move to emerging/developing economies needs a long-term strategy for realization of benefits. In terms of South-South linkages, they can be seen in two phases - one is the linkages developed for the move into emerging/developing economies and second phase is the linkages developed for doing business in the new location. The study shows that the linkages are still vertical with suppliers and parent companies and there are very little horizontal linkages.

This case placed significant emphasis on the economic impact of the abusive conduct, and it represents a clear example of the adoption of an effects-based approach to assess exclusionary behavior by a dominant firm. As this article sets out, given the features of SAAs conduct and of the relevant market context, it is also possible to identify a coherent economic framework that can explain why SAAs rivals could not profitably match its incentive schemes and were therefore foreclosed. The conceptual issues raised by the SAA case are similar to the ones at stake in the landmark judgments on British Airways. The lessons from this case are therefore relevant to the ongoing antitrust debate on loyalty discounts.","[Federico, Giulio] Commiss European Communities, DG Competit, Brussels, Belgium; [Federico, Giulio] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain",,"Federico, G (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, DG Competit, Brussels, Belgium.",Giulio.Federico@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,12,3,3,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The heart of this paper is a survey of European air service procurement authorities. We examine the authorities' perspectives on their rationale for imposing public service obligations (PSOs) on scheduled air services including likely future funding trends and investigate various aspects of the procedures connected with the PSO process (e.g., transparency of subsidies and risk sharing with operators). We also explore various aspects of the obligations that authorities actually impose upon routes and operators (e.g. maximum fare, aircraft size etc). A particular interest of this paper is in the authorities' policies regarding marketing the PSO and promoting competition in their tendering exercises. The lessons derived from this EU experience are discussed with a view in assisting policy makers when promoting and drafting their own regional air transport programmes, or in further refining existing schemes.

The calculated optimal tax rate is $3.60 gal(-1), which is over 18 times greater than the current tax rate and 5 times greater than the Federal Aviation Administration proposed tax rate. The Pigovian component is $0.89, and we observe that the accident externality is taxed more severely than the pollution externality. The largest component of the optimal tax rate is the Ramsey component at $2.70, which reflects the ability of the government to raise revenue from a price inelastic good like aviation gasoline. The optimal tax is estimated to reduce lead emissions by 9%, greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 18% and accidents by 17%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that FDI in Guangdong tends to favour cities closer to Hong Kong, with lower wage rates, better market potential and more preferential policies, and to follow the agglomeration of FDI from the same origin. The diverse home-based characteristics have resulted into the varied pathways of spatial redistribution of FDI. Hong Kong FIEs have been searching for lower-cost regions given the rise of production cost and tightened environmental regulation. In contrast, the redistribution of FIEs from Japan and Taiwan are more sensitive to their home-based business linkages, whereas Japanese and the US FIEs tend to value access to domestic market and to expand in large cities outside Guangdong.","[Xu, Zhihua] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Adv Inst Contemporary China Studies, ACCS, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yeh, Anthony] Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Urban Studies & Urban Planning, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University; University of Hong Kong,"Xu, ZH (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Adv Inst Contemporary China Studies, ACCS, Room DLB 515,David C Lam Bldg, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xzhua100@hkbu.edu.hk; hdxugoy@hkucc.hku.hk,/A-4754-2010,/0000-0002-0587-0588,,,,,50,7,8,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In a large sample of acquisitions, common advisers appear to be chosen in economically sensible ways. After controlling for other variables and accounting for endogeneity, we find that deals with common advisers take longer to complete and provide lower premiums to targets. We find some evidence of lower target valuations and higher bidder returns in such deals. While there is no significant difference in deals'' overall quality, our evidence showing that deals with common advisers are somewhat better for acquirers than for targets favors the conflict-of-interest hypothesis over the deal improvement hypothesis. We find no evidence that merging firms avoided sharing advisers during the 1980s but strong and growing evidence of such avoidance over the following 2 decades.","[Agrawal, Anup] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Cooper, Tommy] Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA; [Lian, Qin; Wang, Qiming] Louisiana Tech Univ, Ruston, LA USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Mississippi; University of Louisiana System; Louisiana Technical University,"Agrawal, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",,,,,,,,71,31,39,0,37,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Mixture components can be interpreted as household segments. Correlations for purchases of different categories turn out to be much more important than correlations among expenditures as well as correlations among purchases and expenditures of different categories. About 18% of all pairwise purchase correlations are significant. We compare the best-performing large-scale model with 28 categories to four small-scale models each with seven categories. In our empirical study the large-scale model clearly attains a better forecasting performance. The small-scale models provide several biased correlations and miss about 50% of the significant correlations which the large scale model detects.

Results indicate the effectiveness of this type of teaching experiences in developing certain professional skills. Additionally, students who worked on international teams developed to a greater degree some intercultural skills such as interacting with culturally diverse people, working in cross-cultural settings and listening and reading effectively with sensitivity to cultural differences. These results invite the promotion of cooperation among teachers and universities from different countries to propose joint academic activities that facilitate the formation of competences in the students.","[Montoya del Corte, Javier] Univ Cantabria, Dept Adm Empresas, Santander, Spain; [Montoya del Corte, Javier] Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain; [Farias Martinez, Gabriela Maria] Escuela Negocios Humanidades & Ciencias Sociales, Inst Tecnol & Estudios Super Monterrey, Dept Acad Contabilidad & Finanzas, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad de Cantabria; Universidad de Cantabria; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"del Corte, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Adm Empresas, Santander, Spain.",javier.montoya@unican.es,"Martinez, Gabriela/ISS-8666-2023; Montoya-del-Corte, Javier/B-1478-2015; Espínola, Gabriela Martínez/GWR-1584-2022",,,,,,38,0,0,4,25,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

In such experiments, respondents often provide reference levels for the attributes and the hypothetical choices presented to them are pivoted around actual behaviour. However, most individuals are not able to provide reference levels for the number of casualties on the road they travel. Thus, if valuation of this important element is attempted, it is the researcher who must provide casualty risk reference levels to the respondents. Some studies have applied route choice experiments including a safety attribute but the majority has been limited to only one particular road section with a common baseline risk for all respondents. This study discusses the setting up and results of a more generalized route choice experiment including a safety attribute. Respondents provided, at an initial stage, their travel times and costs related to a recent trip by car. Then, expected numbers of casualties for different trip lengths were calculated based on travel distances and traffic densities. So, the calculated number of severe injuries and fatalities (casualties) per year, on the road section the respondent had travelled, entered as a third attribute in the choices, together with the reported travel times and costs. Route choice was analysed using multinomial logit and mixed logit models. From the latter models we obtained point estimates for the value of the statistical life ranging from (sic) 7.3 million to (sic) 19.1 million. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The present paper analyses legal struggles over the status of begging in US law and argues that conflicting rhetorical accounts of begging illustrate social actors' efforts to articulate the interconnectedness of their social world, including the ways in which economic practices are embedded in their social and institutional contexts. The paper thus suggests that embeddedness is not just something identified by social researchers, but also a problem faced by social actors as they try to understand the socio-economic order in which they live and act. By arguing for or against the claim that begging is simultaneously an economic action and the exercise of the right to freedom of expression, the voices in this debate attempted to affect the future of this marginal economic activity.","[Cockburn, Patrick J.

But for the issue of slavery, constitutional democracy in the United States was self-enforcing by about 1800. Nonetheless, crises over slavery threatened the nation on numerous occasions. The civil war decisively ended slavery as a source of political division, allowing self-enforcing democracy (for white males) to reemerge following the Compromise of 1877. Since the rules of democracy are located in the law, the question becomes one of explaining adherence to the laws governing democratic political behavior .....

These advances in the measurement of beta and volatility have resulted in improvements in the evaluation of alternative beta and volatility forecasting approaches. In addition, more precise measurement has also led to direct modeling of the time variation of beta and volatility. Both the realized beta and volatility literature have most commonly been modeled with an autoregressive process. In this paper we evaluate constant beta models against autoregressive models of time-varying realized beta. We find that a constant beta model computed from daily returns over the last 12months generates the most accurate quarterly forecast of beta and dominates the autoregressive time series forecasts.

Yet there has been little examination of which of these ability measures is better or worse at predicting the quality of judicial performance including the management and disposition of cases. In this article, we attempt to evaluate these measures of ability by examining a rich group of performance - indicators. Our innovation is to derive performance measures from judicial decisions other than case outcomes (which are inherently difficult to evaluate): the decisions to preside over a securities class action, to reject a motion for lead plaintiff, to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, and to reject a request for fees. In each case, an affirmative decision requires more work from the judge, and thus may be an indicator that the judge works hard and, all else equal, performs well. Using a database of securities class action cases, we find that judges who publish frequently and are highly cited are more likely to dismiss with prejudice but no more likely to make the hard choice in the other cases. Other proxies for judicial ability (attended top law school, judicial experience, earlier position as judge, prior private practice, heavy business caseload, and senior status) are more mixed in terms of their predictive power.

Various theoretical views of steering have been presented over the years, and it has been argued that a multiple-principal context often leads to fragmented steering. The paper aims to identify steering culture models found among principals operating in the same public transport context, and to explain how a successful procurement outcome is possible, despite the hybrid of steering cultures. The paper is based on an empirical analysis of a Swedish county's planning process that resulted in a very successful procurement outcome that met high environmental and safety standards at a relatively low cost. This procurement was seen as a triumph by principals. The findings presents the existence of various steering cultures among the principals, leading to the conclusion that a metagovernor, in this case the PTA, is central to achieving successful outcomes. The metagovernor designed the planning process and formulated a procurement document that satisfied the principals. In this process, the metagovernor negotiated separately with each principal, focusing on the particular characteristics of each principal. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Contract enforcement is shown to have nonmonotonic effects on civic engagement, generating nonmonotonic effects on the evolution of generalized trust. In particular, moderate levels of contracting institutions May crowd-in civic engagement and trust, whereas high levels of contracting institutions have the opposite effect. Furthermore, the model generates a low-trust trap in which contracting institutions are ineffective at promoting civic engagement or trust.","Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Jackson, K (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",,,,,,,,30,6,6,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

I consider both the Cournot and Bertrand cases. When firms compete in quantities, bundling is completely ineffective. Under price competition, selling as a package is profitable when market competition is particularly tough. In such circumstances, the multi-product firm resorts to bundling to dampen the negative impact of low brand differentiation and/or scarce product complementarity. However, overall prices increase as a result of bundling, and not only consumer surplus, but also total social welfare, shrink.","[Mantovani, Andrea] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Mantovani, Andrea] Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Bologna,"Mantovani, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",a.mantovani@unibo.it,,,,,,,34,8,9,0,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

I will make a historical and systemic analysis of the Argentinian case to illustrate how and why state-business relations supporting privileged accumulation spaces (PAS) increased development restrictions from 1966 to 1989. During this period, successive governments shared a common view about the central role the state had to perform for industrialization, especially by supporting the growth of big domestic industrial companies. This view would only radically change in 1989, when neoliberal structural reforms were implemented. To support this hypothesis, I suggest a methodological strategy that combines several techniques and sources in order to analyze the evolution of three complex variables and their multiple relations: state economic intervention, business behavior, and performance by large corporations.","[Castellani, Ana] UBA, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA",,"Castellani, A (通讯作者)，UBA, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",,,,,,,,79,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Partial index tracking only considers a subset of the stocks in the index, enabling a substantial cost reduction in comparison with full tracking. Nevertheless, when heterogeneous investment profiles are to be satisfied, traditional index tracking techniques may need different stocks to build the different portfolios. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology that enables a fund's manager to satisfy different clients' investment profiles but using in all cases the same subset of stocks, and considering not only one particular criterion but a compromise between several criteria. For this purpose we use a mathematical programming model that considers the tracking error variance, the excess return and the variance of the portfolio plus the curvature of the tracking frontier.

By fitting the data from a sample of 117 graduates to a conceptual model using structural equation modelling, it became evident that the PG research students' perception of the Organisational Climate for Research (OCR) is associated with their perception of the PG Research Service Quality (PGSQUAL), the PG Service Experience (SERVEXP) and their perception of their Role (RC). However, no association was found between the students' perception of the research climate (OCR) and their satisfaction (SERVSAT) with the research service; the service experience (SERVEXP) and postgraduate research service quality (PGSQUAL); service satisfaction (SERVSAT) and postgraduate service quality (PGSQUAL).

The shipping alternative choice model assumes shippers with different demand characteristics choose the alternative with the lowest transportation and inventory costs between express and standard shipping services offered by different airlines. The study then formulates airline cost functions with respect to providing standard and express services. Furthermore, the study explores demand-supply interactions and constructs a mathematical programming model to determine flight frequencies and shipping charges for standard and express services by maximizing the object airline's total profit. The results show that those shipping high-value freights tend to select express shipping services and, for the object airline, operating differentiated cargo services rather than the current standard services can raise its market share and total profit by 19.4% and 8.6%, respectively. Moreover, for perishable goods stored in lower temperature-control devices, the charges should be higher.

Data were obtained from a sample of full-time frontline employees in the four- and five-star hotels in Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria. These relationships were tested with path analysis in LISREL 8.30. As hypothesized, job resourcefulness is positively linked to employees' customer orientation. Consistent with the study predictions, customer orientation enhances employees' external representation and service delivery behaviors. However, the results indicate that customer orientation does not significantly affect employees' internal influence behaviors. The results further reveal that customer orientation fully mediates the impact of job resourcefulness on employees' external representation and service delivery behaviors. In other words, job resourcefulness influences such performance outcomes via customer orientation. Managements of the hotels would benefit from the use of effective recruitment and selection techniques to be able to hire employees who can work under resource-depleted conditions. In addition, managements of the hotels could arrange training programs to teach their employees customer-oriented behaviors. By doing so, employees could improve their acting skills over time and consistently demonstrate customer-oriented behaviors. In future studies using longitudinal data would be a potential remedy for minimizing problems associated with the cross-sectional data. In future studies collecting data from multiple sources would also minimize problems emerging from self-report data. In closing, this study partially fills in the void in the services marketing literature by testing the aforementioned relationships using data gathered from frontline hotel employees in a developing sub-Saharan African country.","Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Sch Tourism & Hospitality Management, Mersin, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Karatepe, OM (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Sch Tourism & Hospitality Management, Mersin, Turkey.",osman.karatepe@emu.edu.tr,"Karatepe, Osman M./H-7108-2012","Karatepe, Osman M./0000-0003-3120-8755",,,,,31,0,0,1,28,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

J,"Pretorius, M; Holtzhauzen, G",,,,"Pretorius, Marius; Holtzhauzen, Gert",,,BUSINESS RESCUE DECISION MAKING THROUGH VERIFIER DETERMINANTS - ASK THE SPECIALISTS,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Turnaround; business rescue; decision making; verifier determinants,FAILURE PREDICTION; SMALL FIRMS; YOUNG,"Orientation: Business rescue has become a critical part of business strategy decision making, especially during economic downturns and recessions. Past legislation has generally supported creditor-friendly regimes, and its mind-set still applies, which increases the difficulty of such turnarounds. There are many questions and critical issues faced by those involved in rescue. Despite extensive theory in the literature on failure, there is a void regarding practical verifiers of the signs and causes of venture decline, as specialists are not forthcoming about what they regard as their 'intellectual property'. Research purpose: This article introduces the concept and role of 'verifier determinants' of early warning signs, as a tool to confirm the causes of decline in order to direct rescue strategies and, most importantly, reduce time between the first observation and the implementation of the rescue. Motivation for the study: Knowing how specialists confirm causes of business decline in practice could assist in analysis and deciding on strategies for the rescue earlier than can be done using traditional due diligence, which is time consuming. Reducing time is a crucial element of a successful rescue. Research design and approach: The researchers interviewed specialists with extensive experience in credit for rescue and turnaround. An experimental design was used to ensure the specialists evaluated the same real cases to extract their experiences and base their decisions on. Main findings: The specialists confirmed the use of verifier determinants and identified such determinants as they personally used them to confirm causes of decline. These verifier determinants were classified into five categories namely, management, finance, strategic, banking and operations and marketing of the ventures under investigation. The verifier determinants and their use often depend heavily on subconscious (non-factual) information based on previous experiences, rendering them 'irrational' in modern management perspectives. Practical/managerial implications: Decision makers and affected persons could benefit from the insights obtained through this study. Confirming early warning signs through verifier determinants would be beneficial for entrepreneurs who are creditors, company directors, rescue practitioners, government regulators, court officials and educators alike. Contribution/value add: Knowing the verifier determinants could assist decision making and improve the effectiveness of rescue strategies. Business rescue practitioners can improve their 'investigation of the affairs' activity by using such verifier determinants.","[Pretorius, Marius; Holtzhauzen, Gert] Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Pretorius, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Pretorius, Marius/AAP-3344-2021","Pretorius, Marius/0000-0001-9729-3716",,,,,41,5,12,0,32,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Large amounts of resources used for support programmes automatically put forward the question of their effectiveness and efficiency. These aspects can be examined both from macro and micro perspectives. In this article we focus on one aspect of inefficiency deadweight. This effect occurs if public subsidy is spent on activities that would have happened even without these resources. We examine the effect on selected projects for small and medium-sized enterprises in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The article consists of four parts. First we discuss theoretical background for using the subsidies as development tool. Then we look more closely on the definition of deadweight effect and previous studies analyzing it. In the methodology part we discuss different approaches how to measure this effect and introduce methodology in our research. We also discuss potential problems with interpretation of the results and in the final part we present the results of our research and some policy implications. We found out that the deadweight effect is quite substantial and represents more than 35 % of public subsidies. The project characteristics itself (type of project, amount of budget) has the highest significance for the deadweight effect. The deadweight effect is higher for investments projects compared to the support of education or employment. The probability of the deadweight effect is also decreasing with the total amount of subsidies.","[Sipikal, Miroslav] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Publ Adm & Reg Dev, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Pisar, Peter] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Labudova, Viera] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Stat, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; Matej Bel University; University of Economics Bratislava,"Sipikal, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Publ Adm & Reg Dev, Bratislava, Slovakia.",miroslav.sipikal@euba.sk; peter.pisar@umb.sk; viera.labudova@euba.sk,"Šipikal, Miroslav/HJY-0623-2023; Pisar, Peter/ABE-4019-2020","Šipikal, Miroslav/0000-0002-7205-3385;",,,,,41,9,9,0,23,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

First, the paper is aimed at naming the main sources of revenue as well as the preferential areas of financing. Second, it is also sought to disclose the objective principles of allocating budget appropriation. To achieve the goal, the correlation between preferences in government activity and expenditure allocation was investigated. The conducted research employs ranging and correlational analysis. Since the formation of a bigger budget leads to an increased appropriation of all functional areas, structural data were analysed thus enabling to more soundly determine whether the distinction of a functional area, as the preferential one, has an influence on its greater significance in the overall system of the national budget. After making the study, no possibility of asserting that a distinction of the preferential functional area is related to its preferential financing exists. In order to summarize the obtained results, it could be claimed that the allocation of resources accumulated by the state would be more substantiated if we related it more with activity priorities of the Government. This would lead to higher objectivity when taking decisions on public administration.","Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Social Econ & Management, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Skackauskiene, I (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Social Econ & Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",ilona.skackauskiene@.vgtu.lt,"Skackauskiene, Ilona/V-6026-2018; Skackauskiene, Ilona/AEP-9511-2022","Skackauskiene, Ilona/0000-0002-5078-3678; Skackauskiene, Ilona/0000-0002-5078-3678",,,,,19,2,2,0,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This special pattern has a historical background and is one of the important factors that have enabled many Taiwanese enterprises to continue operating through the decades. The personal links between people create a kind of social network known as guanxi, which is a unique characteristic of Chinese society. The study aims to investigate the guanxi type of managers in Taiwanese family businesses, and examines how the guanxi type may moderate the correlation between the managers' power and the influence tactics used to handle subordinates. We surveyed 178 managers who are working in Taiwanese family business. The results of the hierarchical regression modeling showed that as managers have more position power, especially those exercising the family guanxi, they are more likely to be assertive in their treatment of their subordinates. Managers possessing the friend guanxi often play a bridging role to complement the function of those managers with the family guanxi, who may use the assertive approach too strongly. Managers of this type can provide a lubricant effect and keep the family business running smoothly. We recommend that family business owners should pay more attention to relationship harmony and internal communication channels in their organisations.","[Tsai, Hsien-Tang; Wu, Tung-Ju] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Business Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Yeh, Shang-Pao] I Shou Univ, Dept Tourism, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; I Shou University,"Yeh, SP (通讯作者)，I Shou Univ, Dept Tourism, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",Shangpao@ms12.hinet.net,,,,,,,42,7,8,0,40,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Due to the heterogeneity between domestic and foreign affiliated firms in terms of technology level, we construct a meta-frontier model to measure relative efficiency and technology gap ratios (TGR's) of domestic and foreign affiliated firms. We find that technical efficiencies of foreign affiliated firms are higher than domestic firms, and display a stable pattern during the investigation period. However; technology gap ratios indicate the existence of a negative relationship between the TGR's and technical efficiency of the firms in domestic subsectors. This means that technically efficient firms are in fact using the low level of technology.

Since mid of the 20th century the management decision making theory is divided into normative (rational) decision making and descriptive (behavioural) decision making. With the work of Kahnemann and Tversky the economical behaviour was strengthen. Mainly these theories have been taken into consideration analysing an important decision making process at Small and Medium Size Entities (SME) - the selection and purchase of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System. This strategic decision is one very critical. The management usually focus mainly on the implementation an extensive process which often cause cost overruns. Focus for this research was purely on the selection of the ERP system and all influencing decision criteria. The reflection with the efficiency of the process as well as the satisfaction with the decision was one result along a developed process. Expert Interviews and Case Studies have been executed to support the theoretical approach and literature review. The interviews provide a clear overview of the current practice and support the hypothesis that 'a clear and structured process and the awareness at senior management level from the very beginning' would lead to a high efficient long-term decisions. The focus of the case studies was mainly on testing the model, process and theoretical findings.

Outsourcing is understood as a modern trend of management and also the changes which serve to transfer support activities of a company on an external provider. Practical utilization and application of outsourcing is frequent and very popular in many industries of all developed countries since it brings a lot of positive effects. Wood processing industry in Slovakia is influenced by the economic crisis causing stagnation in the construction industry and decrease in the customer demand for construction, woodwork and furniture products. Many companies are looking for different forms of cost savings and recently more companies have increasingly used the possibilities of outsourcing. The authors present the results of the questionnaire research aimed at the use of outsourcing within the chosen sample of woodworking industry companies in Slovakia. It focuses on the area of outsourcing FM with the use of correlation analysis lining the dependencies of the chosen questions. Within the article there is also the presentation of the proposal for partial methodology of evaluation for economical effectiveness of the potential outsourcing use which within the ABC calculation methodology suggests implementing conceptual schemes such as criterion outsourcing costs, transaction costs and costs savings.

This paper describes the direct and indirect taxation transformation paths followed by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that affected implementation of the fiscal principles and functions of their respective tax systems. Research shows a large number of similarities in the selection of instruments that have significantly changed the way in which the tax systems operate.

We find strong evidence of long-memory, fractional integration in equity volatility and show that this long-memory characteristic is not an outcome of structural breaks experienced during the sample period. Fractional cointegration between the implied and realised volatility is shown using recently developed rank cointegration tests by Robinson and Yajima (2002). The predictive ability of individual equity options is also examined and composite implied volatility estimates are shown to contain information on future idiosyncratic or stock-specific risk that is not captured using popular statistical approaches. Implied volatilities on individual UK equities are thus closely related to realised volatility and are an effective forecasting method particularly over medium forecasting horizons.

In Belgium, they are increasingly used by companies as an incentive to motivate and compensate employees, resulting in the fact that half of the new car registrations are nowadays made in the name of a company and that companies account for 10% of the Belgian car fleet. In many cases the company car can also be used for private trips. In addition, most costs related to the use of a company car are borne by the employer, turning company cars into a nearly free way of travelling for the employee. Research has already established that the yearly amount of kilometres driven with a company car is significantly higher than that of private cars (e.g., Hubert and Toint, 2002; De Witte et al., 2009). Consequently, the rising phenomenon of company cars and its impact on our daily mobility can no longer be ignored. The aim of this paper is to explore the travel behaviours of company car users to make recommendations towards policy makers. This paper uses cluster analysis to show that there is no such thing as the 'typical' company car user. Three types of company car users were identified, each using their company car for different reasons and therefore each requiring different policy actions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We adopt a disaggregated approach by separating cargo handling services provided by stevedoring firms from other port services offered to the ships by different agents. The results obtained from a sample of 19 ports from 1990-1998 show that the technical inefficiency led to an average cost increase of 7% and that allocative inefficiency resulted in labor overuse, inducing an average cost increase of 8%, such that the estimated average cost inefficiency was 15%. A detailed analysis show that large ports - with specialized terminals and a majority of privately-owned cranes - exhibit the largest efficiency indices, while the specific cargo mix handled does not help to explain the differences among ports. We conclude that the reforms contributed to increase the three types of efficiency and that new reforms could be appropriate to improve further the stevedoring operations.","[Jose Diaz-Hernandez, Juan; Martinez-Budria, Eduardo] Univ La Laguna, Inst Univ Desarrollo Reg, Dept Anal Econ, Santa Cruz de Tenerife 38071, Spain; [Jara-Diaz, Sergio] Univ Chile, Dept Ingn Civil, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de Chile,"Díaz-Hernández, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Inst Univ Desarrollo Reg, Dept Anal Econ, Camino Hornera S-N, Santa Cruz de Tenerife 38071, Spain.",jjodiaz@ull.es; jaradiaz@cec.uchile.cl,"Jara-Diaz, Sergio R/H-6705-2013; Jara-Diaz, Sergio/AAK-4221-2020; Díaz-Hernández, Juan José/GOV-5774-2022; Diaz-Hernandez, Juan Jose/I-2678-2015","Jara-Diaz, Sergio/0000-0002-0442-5490; Diaz-Hernandez, Juan Jose/0000-0003-1110-7455",,,,,45,5,5,0,23,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

While the framework of upgrading identifies key dynamics of competition between capitals, it nonetheless sidelines inquiry into how such imperatives condition and are conditioned by labor. To address this conceptual weakness, I argue that studies of the restructuring of production networks can be enriched through a feminist analysis of value. In particular, the efforts of firms to reposition themselves in networks should be considered in light of struggles to rework the basis of labor's value to capital, a process of reproducing and recombining interlocking social differences into novel combinations of exploitable workers. I explore this process through an in-depth case study of a large garment firm in the Dominican Republic, in which upgrading involved the reworking of skilled and unskilled work, animated by gendered practices and norms, that led to the masculinization of skilled sewing and the feminization of new service engineering functions.","SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geog, Buffalo, NY 14261 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Werner, M (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geog, 105 Wilkeson Quad, Buffalo, NY 14261 USA.",marion.werner@gmail.com,"Werner, Marion/IXW-9642-2023","Werner, Marion/0000-0002-5000-3053",,,,,50,51,56,2,47,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

One particular characteristic of these first-generation (G1) PMs is that they link the payoff value of a stock's share to the outcome of an event. Recently, second-generation (G2) PMs have introduced alternative mechanisms to determine payoff values which allow them to be used as preference markets for determining preferences for product concepts or as idea markets for generating and evaluating new product ideas. Three different G2 payoff mechanisms appear in the existing literature, but they have never been compared. This study conceptually and empirically compares the forecasting accuracy of the three G2 payoff mechanisms and investigates their influence on participants' trading behavior. We find that G2 payoff mechanisms perform almost as well as their G1 counterpart, and trading behavior is very similar in both markets (i.e. trading prices and trading volume), except during the very last trading hours of the market. These results indicate that G2 PMs are valid instruments and support their applicability shown in previous studies for developing new product ideas or evaluating new product concepts.

The cartel agreement that prevailed in the air freight industry from 1997 to 2005 will be used to illustrate the search for new methods of price fixing. Unlike previous arrangements, the airlines implicated in the scheme did not seek to manage final prices, but rather the fuel, security, and customs surcharges applied to each faredespite a warning from their own trade association that such a practice was probably illegal. The utilization of common surcharges adds a new dimension to cartel behavior, as this appears to be the first price-fixing agreement that used such a mechanism to manipulate net returns. Unfortunately for the nearly thirty airlines involved, the setting of common surcharges was highly visible to both end users and regulators, leading to complaints filed by both the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. The airlines willingness to risk punishment fines arose out of financial exigency brought on by escalating fuel prices. Once the cartel began to unravel, initially with a confession by executives from Lufthansa, it became apparent that most of the aviation sector was involved.","Fairfield Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfield, CT 06430 USA",Fairfield University,"LeClair, MS (通讯作者)，Fairfield Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfield, CT 06430 USA.",mleclair@mail.fairfield.edu,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

This research seeks to explore the spatial, temporal and gender differences in transportation modal choice among student commuters with an objective of uncovering incentives to increase the use of non-motorized or public transportation to the campus. Findings point to the availability of lower-cost parking permits as an enabler of shorter distance car commutes, especially in the winter season. Male students are found to be more likely to switch commuting modes throughout the year while females are generally more likely to drive. Differences in commuting choice behavior between students with children, and traditional undergraduate and graduate students are also found.

The same conditions are associated with higher sales-based royalty rates and higher franchise-fee amounts.","[Maruyama, Masayoshi; Yamashita, Yu] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Kobe University,"Maruyama, M (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",mmaru@kobe-u.ac.jp; yu-y@gold.kobe-u.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330128, 20243026] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,33,10,10,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The levels of the countries with the highest life expectancies have risen almost linearly. We exploit this regularity by using the classic univariate ARIMA model to forecast future levels of best-practice life expectancy. We then compare two alternative stochastic models for forecasting the gap between the best-practice level and life expectancy in a particular population. One of our approaches is based on the concept of discrete geometric Brownian motion; our other approach relies on a discrete model of geometric mean-reverting processes. A key advantage of our strategy is that the life expectancies forecast for different countries are positively correlated because of their tie to the forecast best-practice line.

Studies (predominantly in the United Kingdom) began to make more explicit the links policy between poverty, transport disadvantage, access to key services and economic and social exclusion (see for example Church and Frost, 2000; TRaC, 2000; Lucas et al., 2001; Kenyon 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Hodgson and Turner, 2003; Raje, 2003). By 2003, the UK Social Exclusion Unit had published and its now internationally recognised report on this subject, which subsequently resulted in the development of a set of transport policy guidances to local authorities in England to deliver what is now commonly referred to as accessibility planning as part of their Local Transport Plans (Department for Transport, 2006). Since this time, researchers, policy makers and practitioners in several other countries became interested in adopting a social exclusion approach to transport planning, largely because of its utility in identifying the role of transport, land use planning and service delivery decisions in creating and reinforcing poverty and social disadvantage. Eight years on from the SEU report, we can begin to reflect on the extent to which a social exclusion approach to the research of transport disadvantage has been successful in opening up new avenues of research enquiry and/or identifying new theoretical perspectives and/or methodological approaches. The paper begins by briefly revisiting the basic theories and core definitions which underpin and inform a social exclusion perspective. It then considers how these have been translated and understood in terms of transport. Secondly, it considers some of the emergent empirical research of transport-related exclusion that has attempted to measure and model the interactions between transport and mobility inequalities and relational negative social outcomes. Thirdly, it offers observations on progress in some key areas of policy and practice, with specific reference to the UK and Australia. It concludes by suggesting how further progress might be made on this issue and considers whether the social exclusion agenda is still a relevant approach for achieving this. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, proximity to various quasi-daily destinations is compared with the reported distance that is actually travelled to reach similar, but alternative, facilities. We note that in rural areas (compared with urban areas) larger distances are travelled, although the closest facility is chosen more often. In the most urbanised areas, however, we note that spatial proximity is also an important aspect in destination choice. Quantification of these phenomena can support the practice of sustainable spatial planning by distinguishing areas that are too mono-functional or too remote, and therefore need more functional diversity, and by identifying areas where densification is useful because the location is close to most quasi-daily destinations, reducing the need to travel over large distances.","[Boussauw, Kobe; Van Acker, Veronique; Witlox, Frank] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Boussauw, K (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",kobe.boussauw@ugent.be; veronique.vanacker@ugent.be; frank.witlox@ugent.be,"VAN ACKER, Veronique/ABD-5249-2021; Van Acker, Veronique/IVH-1307-2023; Boussauw, Kobe/F-9124-2010; Witlox, Frank/A-5143-2008","VAN ACKER, Veronique/0000-0001-9343-1632; Witlox, Frank/0000-0002-8966-6823",,,,,41,12,14,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We develop a theory tailored to an environment, such as medicine, in which sellers are of heterogeneous quality and face two types of demand-private consumers who exhibit downward-sloping demand (for example, private health insurance) and government consumers who exhibit perfectly elastic demand at a fixed price (for example, Medicaid insurance). The theory predicts that high-quality sellers who suffer reputation losses will see their caseloads shift from private to government patients, while low-quality sellers will lose government patients and may gain private patients. Combining individual patient-level data from Florida for the years 1994-2003 with physician-level litigation data, we find evidence that physicians experience reputation effects that are consistent with the theory.","[Dranove, David; Watanabe, Yasutora] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Ramanarayanan, Subramaniam] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",Northwestern University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Dranove, D (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,"Watanabe, Yasutora/0000-0002-5874-0488",,,,,17,14,19,0,18,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The results show that involved actors in the three countries learned in different ways within these partnerships.

Empirically, the causal effect is identified by exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in state laws granting access to the pill to unmarried women under age 21. The evidence shows that the pill was a catalyst that increased cohabitation's role in selecting marriage partners, but did little in the short run to promote cohabitation as a substitute for marriage.","Towson Univ, Towson, MD 21252 USA",University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Christensen, F (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",fchristensen@towson.edu,,,,,,,23,8,14,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

This paper investigates China's embodied technical change and structure of disembodied and embodied technology. In this paper, the sector-level index of total factor productivity stands for disembodied technical change through the dynamic frontier nonparametric approach, and embodied technological change is measured by the core-machinery approach. Empirical results show that capital-embodied technical change is the key factor to productivity, and technical efficiency is determined by factor endowments and the matching level among factors. And in the whole economy, appropriate technical structure is not significant, while in those sectors with high nationalization levels and high profit rates it is significant.","[Dong, Zhiqing] Jilin Univ, Sch Business, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China; [Wang, Linhui] NE Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Changchun, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Northeast Normal University - China,"Dong, ZQ (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Sch Business, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China.",dongzq@jlu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Yiyang/HZI-3668-2023; wang, lin/GSE-3040-2022",,,,,,49,0,0,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

In practice, estimation difficulties may arise as a result of selection bias and limited historic testing. We review some theoretical results and practical estimation tools from observation study design and causal modeling, and evaluate their relevance to credit decision problems. Building on these results and tools, we propose a novel approach for estimating potential outcomes for credit decisions with multiple alternatives based on matching on multiple propensity scores. We demonstrate the approach and discuss results for risk-based pricing and credit line increase problems. Among the strengths of our approach are its transparency about data support for the estimates and its ability to incorporate prior knowledge in the extrapolative inference of treatment-response curves.

The rationale was that, if entrepreneurial attributes could be identified as more developed in one country than in another, solutions could be provided for developing these attributes in others. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and compare the levels of development of entrepreneurial attributes of undergraduate business students in the present study (2010) to the levels of development reported by undergraduate business students in the 2001/2002 study. Cronbach alpha coefficients were calculated to assess the reliability of the measuring instrument and t-tests to establish significant differences. Cohen's d statistics were calculated to establish practical significance. The findings suggest that the educational environment and entrepreneurship education policy of the Dutch university participating in this study could provide solutions as to how entrepreneurial attributes among students could be developed further.","[Farrington, Shelley M.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Business Management, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Venter, Danie J.

First, what is the extent of technology transferred through vertical linkages and public-private alliances, including university-industry linkages, in the phase of product improvement and development? Second, what types of knowledge are transferred from external technology sources? In a sample of ASEAN firms' self-reported partner data restricted to automotive-related industries, we found that direct linkages with multinational corporation (MNC) customers in foreign countries resulted in a lower propensity of product innovation. Indeed, incoming knowledge from MNC customers relating to the management of quality of existing products especially explained the lower propensity of product innovation. We also found that production linkages with MNC suppliers in foreign countries resulted in a higher propensity of product innovation. Incoming knowledge from MNC suppliers about quality controls explained a lower propensity of product innovation. These findings empirically indicate that networked sources of knowledge have a significant influence trade-off between maintaining existing operations and developing new products. The impacts of public-private alliances on innovation are sizable compared with the impacts of vertical linkages. Public-private alliances and vertical linkages offer knowledge with different effects on product innovation.","[Machikita, Tomohiro] Japan External Trade Org IDE JETRO, Interdisciplinary Studies Ctr, Inst Developing Econ, Mihama Wakaba, Chiba, Japan; [Ueki, Yasushi] Japan External Trade Org, Bangkok Res Ctr, Inst Developing Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Machikita, T (通讯作者)，CBS, Asia Res Ctr, Porcelaenshaven 24B, DK-2000 Copenhagen, Denmark.",machi@ide.go.jp,,"Ueki, Yasushi/0000-0002-2893-8864","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730233, 22330087] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,39,8,8,1,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

However, behavioural scores, which are calculated on a monthly basis by most consumer lenders, are the analogues of ratings in corporate credit risk. Motivated by studies of corporate credit risk, we develop a Markov chain model based on behavioural scores for establishing the credit risk of portfolios of consumer loans. Although such models have been used by lenders to develop models for the Basel Accord, nothing has been published in the literature on them. The model which we suggest differs in many respects from the corporate credit ones based on Markov chains such as the need for a second order Markov chain, the inclusion of economic variables and the age of the loan. The model is applied using data on a credit card portfolio from a major UK bank. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The recognized multidimensionality of the phenomenon has increasingly led to the use of composite indicators in order to overcome the limitations usually identified in such measures as the income per capita (Bandura, 2008 [1]; Saisana, 2008 [2]). Using indicators such as this to assess development raises two crucial issues. On the one hand, one needs to identify the dimensions of development for each indicator as well as the content of each dimension. On the other hand, one also needs to assign weights to each dimension in order to have an aggregated indicator. This second issue has drawn little attention in the literature, and usually equal weights are attributed to all the dimensions of a given indicator. In the absence of any systematic analysis of their correspondence to the public perception regarding the importance of each dimension of development, these weights are arbitrarily fixed. This is so despite the fact that individuals are the ultimate beneficiaries of countries' development. The present paper seeks to close this gap in the literature, discussing in an explicit manner, the importance of the weights of each dimension of development.","[Moreira, Sandrina B.] Polytech Inst Setubal, ESCE IPS, Dept Econ & Management, Setubal, Portugal; [Moreira, Sandrina B.; Simoes, Nadia; Crespo, Nuno] Econ Res Ctr, BRU UNIDE, Lisbon, Portugal; [Simoes, Nadia; Crespo, Nuno] Lisbon Univ Inst, ISCTE IUL, Dept Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico de Setubal; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,,sandrina.moreira@esce.ips.pt; nadia.simoes@iscte.pt; nuno.crespo@iscte.pt,"Simoes, Nadia/AAG-1389-2020; Moreira, Sandrina B/C-5584-2011; Crespo, Nuno/AAG-9679-2019","Simoes, Nadia/0000-0002-4334-4482; Moreira, Sandrina B/0000-0003-2124-8366; Crespo, Nuno/0000-0002-6546-6325",,,,,60,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,441,456,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100041,0

Little research, however, has modeled predictions of attitudes toward fees on both the intention to pay (WTP) and stated payment amount (SWTP) simultaneously. This article addresses that knowledge gap using onsite survey data from 1068 recreationists at the McDonald-Dunn forest in Oregon. Attitudes toward paying an annual fee at this forest were directly associated with WTP and were among the strongest predictors of WTP. Respondents with supportive attitudes toward paying the annual fee were more willing to pay than those who were opposed. The strength of attitudes also influenced WTP, with those respondents having stronger opposition being least likely to pay. Attitudes toward paying a fee were indirectly (i.e., mediation) related to the stated payment amount (SWTP), suggesting that payment is influenced by intention to pay (WTP), and this intention is partially a function of attitudes about fees.

Yet, from the perspective of developing nations, the antecedents and consequences of knowledge transfer remain underexplored. This study examined the mediating effect of knowledge transfer on the relationship between cultural fit and joint-venture innovation performance among Malaysian offshore international joint ventures. It made two contributions, first by examining three different constructs of innovation, namely market, strategic and behavioural; and second by using bootstrapping to test the mediating effect. The results affirm that both organizational and national cultural fit are positive determinants of knowledge transfer. However, knowledge transfer mediates the effect of cultural fit only on market and strategic innovativeness, while behavioural innovativeness is not significantly enhanced. The findings suggest that in developing countries, the effect of knowledge transfer on behavioural innovativeness is possibly moderated by other factors such as internal managerial values and government policies.","[Tey, Lian Seng; Idris, Aida] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Tey, LS (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",teyls@um.edu.my,"Idris, Aida/AAW-3407-2021; Idris, Aida/B-8183-2010; Tey, Lian Seng/A-1222-2014","Idris, Aida/0000-0002-5381-2577;",,,,,66,15,17,1,82,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Descartes' life, works and death are interpreted from the unlikely combination of the theoretical perspectives of Charles Taylor and Jean Baudrillard. Despite significant differences, both of these theorists rely heavily on Weber's concept of disenchantment, and each develops a 'punctual' concept in their analysis of modernity. Specifically, the paper combines Taylor's 'punctual self', which can remake itself at will, with Baudrillard's 'punctual death', which presents death as a meaningless terminus. Viewing Descartes through these punctual concepts, it becomes clear that the extensive anatomical investigations he conducted throughout his career shaped his uniquely modern stance towards death and health. However, Descartes maintained an ambivalent relationship with traditional conceptions of death and health, which prevented him from fully embracing modern health-consciousness. The paper concludes with a reconsideration of Descartes' 'premature' death, which invites critical reflection on the role that the predictable behaviour of health-conscious subjects plays in the ever-expanding biomedical order.","Coll Wooster, Wooster, OH 44691 USA",University System of Ohio; College of Wooster,"Tierney, TF (通讯作者)，Coll Wooster, Wooster, OH 44691 USA.",ttierney@wooster.edu,,,,,,,44,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The shift-share analysis decomposed the dynamics of employment, average wage and labour productivity in 2004-2008. The change is distributed into national, proportional, regional and differential component. Regional differences in labour productivity are further assessed by static shift-share analysis. There are many specific features in regions and sector that have to be paid attention to. To begin with, there is a significant difference in the labour productivity of the City of Prague and in other regions. This difference is caused by a significant variation in labour productivity of the most important sectors accelerated by high share of some sectors that are important in the capital city In absolute terms, there is a difference in the level of an average wage in Prague and in other regions, however, the growth rate of an average wage in regions copy the national trends. This is reflected in balanced values of the regional components. The labour productivity in the capital city is higher by 96 % compared to the average of the Czech Republic; labour productivity in other regions is below the average. A two-way analysis of variance of each variable revealed significant differences (alpha = 0.05) in the growth rates among sectors; differences among regions were not proved.

This is especially true in health-care markets where consumers are less informed than providers and standard mechanisms such as warranties cannot protect consumers against inferior products. This article examines how market structure affects the quality of care provided in a health-care market by examining the nursing home industry. We empirically test if quality is affected by a change in market structure that arises when a competitor exits the market. Using a sample of rural nursing homes that have a competitor exit and also experience no entry from new competitors, the effect of market structure is identified using a difference-in-differences approach that compares facilities that are within the same geographic market as the exiting facility to a group of facilities outside that geographic market. We find that total staffing levels are lower after the closure after adjusting for transitory effects. All non-staffing quality measures show improvement after the closure, although not all are found to be statistically significant. This suggests supracompetitive markets with excess capacity may actually have lower levels of quality than more concentrated markets.","[Bowblis, John R.] Miami Univ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Vassallo, Andrew] Shippensburg Univ, Shippensburg, PA 17257 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania,"Bowblis, JR (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",jbowblis@miamiOH.edu; avassallo@ship.edu,,,,,,,0,4,7,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Electric buses deliver zero emissions but, because of the time required to recharge, more buses are needed for a given timetable than diesel counterparts, so making mainstream electric bus operations prohibitively expensive. Early 2014 saw the implementation in Milton Keynes of an electric bus service designed to overcome this problem. An entire bus route has been converted to electric operation with inductive charging at bus layover points. This permits the use of smaller and less expensive battery packs allowing the electric buses to operate continuously all day. This approach significantly reduces the cost of introducing a pure electric bus fleet. This study not only provides an example of how the electric bus problem can be resolved technically. It also addresses the business structures required to deliver sustainable transport, introducing a different commercial model to that which is traditionally used for bus service delivery. This raises important points for regulatory and innovation policy. There is government support for sustainable transport technologies, but successful delivery in the commercial environment requires new institutional structures and business models as well. The Milton Keynes project has sought to develop such a structure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine the causal impact of age, we employ a research design that isolates the effect of the random variation in the age composition of the pool of eligible jurors called for jury duty. Consistent with the jury selection patterns, the empirical evidence implies that older jurors are significantly more likely to convict. Results are robust to controls for county, time, and judge fixed effects.

A port authority can increase its contribution by optimising the various functions it performs in a facilitating and entrepreneurial manner. Port authority reform matters in that it must set the right governance framework for port authorities to achieve their full potential contribution to the competitiveness of their ports. The objective of this paper is to complement existing literature and empirical research on the role of port authorities with a theoretical perspective on how to measure the specific economic impact of port authority reform and understand the process of reform and post-reform governance. The paper outlines a comprehensive analytical framework to assess both elements in a quantitative and qualitative manner. The centrepiece of the framework is based on welfare economics concepts. It introduces a methodology based on techniques of cost-benefit analysis and generalised costs to measure the economic impact of port authority reform on the competitiveness of a port. The application of the framework for expost evaluation will allow policy-makers to identify areas of further improvement and will offer useful insights for those envisaging new reform schemes.,"[Van de Voorde, Eddy] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Verhoeven, Patrick] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, B-2060 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp,"Verhoeven, P (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Richardstr 23, B-2060 Antwerp, Belgium.",eddy.vandevoorde@ua.ac.be; pjhverhoeven@skynet.be,,,,,,,52,5,5,0,16,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The absolute convergence analysis indicates that regional productivity growth follows a slow convergence trajectory. However, a conditional convergence analysis indicates that current productivity gaps can be directly attributed to divergences in the industrial profile of the regional economy as well as to differences in infrastructure endowments. The results of the paper suggest that the productivity gaps which originated from the liberalisation reforms of the 1980s and 1990s will be exhausted in 25 years approximately. The innovation of this paper is the extension of a convergence analysis to the industrial sector.

While these endeavors have primarily concentrated on households, young people may be the front lines of financial inclusion because they may be more likely to be banked in young adulthood and beyond when they start off with savings accounts earlier in life. This article addresses young people's financial inclusion by comprehensively reviewing 60 research studies on young people's savings, discussing the role of the family in young people's financial inclusion, discussing financial inclusion from an institutional perspective, presenting policy implications, and identifying gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Policies that open savings accounts for young people early in life may be a promising strategy for extending financial inclusion and preventing unbanked or underbanked status later in life.","[Friedline, Terri] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Rauktis, Mary] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",University of Kansas; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Friedline, T (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",tfriedline@ku.edu; mar104@pitt.edu,,,,,,,119,19,25,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The experiment allows a decomposition of the number of wireless connections into the number of needs-instances where a consumer would establish a connection if the price were zero-and the conditional probability of establishing a connection.

This could result from the search engine's accurately predicting the websites relevance to users. Or it could result from users merely clicking on the highest ranked links, regardless of the website's relevance. Using a unique dataset, we find that a website's rank, not just its relevance, strongly and significantly affects the likelihood of a click. We also find evidence that rank influences CTRs partly by controlling access to the scarce attention of users, but primarily by substituting the reputational capital of the search engine for the reputation of individual websites.","[Glick, Mark] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Richards, Greg] Keystone Strategy, Brisbane, CA 94005 USA; [Sapozhnikov, Margarita] Keystone Strategy, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA; [Seabright, Paul] Toulouse Sch Econ IAST, F-31015 Toulouse, France",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Sapozhnikov, M (通讯作者)，Keystone Strategy, 150 CambridgePk Dr, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA.",glick@economics.utah.edu; grichards@keystonestrategy.com; msapozhnikov@keystonestrategy.com; Paul.Seabright@tse-fr.eu,"Richards, Greg/L-5591-2015",,,,,,9,10,10,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

In The Antitrust Paradox and other writings, Bork advanced the Chicago school insight that the kind of aggressive price cutting that, at the time, passed for predatory pricing is instead an essential and, for consumers, beneficial attribute of competition. The resulting change in direction that antitrust has taken in predatory-pricing cases culminated in the Court's Matsushita (Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v.

However, the added worker effect seems to be at work for subsamples characterised by households where the spouses are not working in the same industry and where the wife did not work full time pre-displacement. When using a measure of total household income, which includes public transfers, we find that the negative income impact of displacement is reduced by approximately 60 to 70 % when we also adjust for lower tax payments.

We predict firms' systemic relevance as the marginal impact of individual downside risks on systemic distress. So-called systemic risk betas account for a company's position within the network of financial interdependencies, in addition to its balance sheet characteristics and its exposure to general market conditions. Relying only on publicly available daily market data, we determine time-varying systemic risk networks, and forecast the systemic relevance on a quarterly basis.

Programmers who have used open-source software (OSS) are motivated by reciprocal altruism to publish their own improvements. The evolution of the open-source project depends on the form of the altruistic benefits: in a base case the project grows to a steady-state size from any initial condition; whereas adding a need for customer support makes zero-quality a locally absorbing state. We also analyze competition by commercial firms with OSS projects. Optimal pricing policies again vary: in some cases the commercial firm will set low prices when the open-source project is small; in other cases it mostly waits until the open-source project has matured.","[Athey, Susan] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Knight Management Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ellison, Glenn] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Athey, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Knight Management Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",athey@gsb.stanford.edu; gellison@mit.edu,,"Athey, Susan/0000-0001-6934-562X",,,,,39,28,33,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Most recently, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe has led to the bailout of the governments of Ireland, Portugal and Greece. A main reason behind these bailouts is to support European banks loaded with government bonds on their balance sheet. In this article we analyze the detrimental consequences of the public bailout in 2008 and argue that a free market alternative existed. The alternative of a private bailout outlined in this article, consisting of the conversion of liabilities into equity and a private capital increase, largely avoids the problems of a public bailout. Similarly, a public bailout of governments of the Eurozone to sustain banks may be detrimental.","[Bagus, Philipp; Rallo Julian, Juan Ramon; Alonso Neira, Miguel Angel] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Appl Econ 1, Madrid 28032, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Bagus, P (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Appl Econ 1, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.",philipp.bagus@web.de; juanrallo@gmail.com,"Alonso, Miguel/AAP-8272-2021; Bagus, Paul S/M-1273-2015; Bagus, Philipp/ABG-4126-2020","Alonso, Miguel/0000-0002-6778-3594; Bagus, Philipp/0000-0002-8233-6629",,,,,34,15,16,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The underlying longitudinal data and the difference-in-differences strategy used overcome most of the previous cross-sectional study limitations, such as failure to control for child and household pre-death characteristics and unobserved heterogeneity. This paper also pays special attention to the heterogeneity, robustness, and long-run persistence of effects. Results show that orphans are on average 10 pp less likely to attend school than their nonorphaned counterparts, this effect being even more pronounced for girls and young children from poorer households. Results on adults further show that those orphaned during childhood eventually completed less education. These findings suggest that not only do households suffering unexpected shocks resort to schooling adjustments as an immediate risk-coping strategy, but also that adversity has long-lasting effects on human capital accumulation.","Paris Sch Econ PSE IRD, UMR DIAL, F-75010 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Senne, JN (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ PSE IRD, UMR DIAL, 4 Rue Enghien, F-75010 Paris, France.",jean-noel.senne@ensae.fr,"Senne, Jean-Noël/AAD-4372-2020",,,,,,36,14,14,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Such a focus on form, though, fails to adequately account for the movement of value-used here in the Marxist sense of 'congealed labour'-or to recognize the centrality of the labour process in shaping how previously used parts are prepared for inclusion in new commodities. As a way to correct such failings, here we present the concept of Global Destruction Networks (GDNs).

But for centuries they were known equally for fulminating their foes, humiliating saints, and casting calamitous curses at persons who crossed them. Clerics called these curses maledictions. This article argues that medieval communities of monks and canons used maledictions to protect their property against predators where government and physical self-help were unavailable to them. To explain how they did this I develop a theory of cursing with rational agents. I show that curses capable of improving property protection when cursors and their targets are rational must satisfy three conditions. They must be grounded in targets' existing beliefs, monopolized by cursors, and unfalsifiable. Malediction satisfied these conditions, making it an effective institutional substitute for conventional institutions of clerical property protection.

Which law applies in a specific situation depends on various circumstances surrounding the accident. As a result, pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage awards for the families of the accident victims may vary substantially from case to case. Our study examines how aviation disasters affect the short and long-term performance of US airlines and US airplane manufacturers and explores the factors that drive the performance differences. While prior research has largely focused on brand name effects and rising insurance premiums as possible determinants of stock price losses, our results suggest that the regulatory environment that applies to a given aviation accident has a significant impact on how the market reacts to its announcement. Ceteris paribus, we find that accidents that are governed by state laws which place no limit on damage claims entail particularly large stock price declines. Accidents for which federal laws or international treaties restrict claimable damages, on the other hand, are associated with smaller stock price drops. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We use detailed geographical information to identify the link between supermarket entry and the exit of nearby small stores. Entry of supermarkets using small- to medium-size formats creates a competitive threat for the existing small stores, decreasing their probability of survival. The result is robust to several model specifications and varying definitions of what constitutes a supermarket. The impact of supermarket entry is unequivocal for groceries, bakeries, fresh pasta shops, and butcher shops.","[Borraz, Fernando] Banco Cent Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Borraz, Fernando] dECON FCS UdelaR, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Dubra, Juan; Ferres, Daniel; Zipitria, Leandro] Univ Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Ferres, Daniel] IESE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain; [Zipitria, Leandro] Univ San Andres, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad de Montevideo; University of Navarra; IESE Business School; Universidad de San Andres Argentina","Zipitría, L (通讯作者)，Univ Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.",lzipitria@correo.um.edu.uy,"Dubra, Juan/Q-2846-2019","Zipitria, Leandro/0000-0002-7086-1733",,,,,24,17,20,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

This article reviews literature on the subject of project governance and categorises the arguments into three schools of thought namely the single-firm school, multi-firm school and large capital governance school. The single-firm school is concerned with governance principles related to intra-organisational projects and practice these principles at a technical level. The multi-firm school addresses the governance principles concerned with two of more organisations participating on a contractual basis on the same project and focuses its governance efforts at the technical and strategic level. The large capital school considers projects as temporary organisations, forming their own entity and establishing governance principles at an institutional level. From these schools of thought it can be concluded that the definition of project governance is a function of stakeholder complexity and functional positioning in the organisation. It is also evident that further research is required to incorporate other governance variables and related theories such as transaction theory, social networks and agency theory. The development of project governance frameworks should also consider the complexity of projects spanning across international companies, across country borders and incorporating different value systems, legal systems, corporate governance guidelines, religions and business practices.","Univ Pretoria, Grad Sch Technol Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Bekker, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Grad Sch Technol Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Bekker, Michiel C/K-2731-2017",,,,,,38,16,26,7,61,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The role of non-governmental organisations towards inducing a more responsible behaviour is explored. By drawing on literature and reflecting on documented actions of various multinational corporations, particularly from the extractive sector, we find a commonalty that cuts across the board: a considerable disparity exists between policies, strategies and actions that these organisations display in the interest of their inherent, short-term economic gains. Such gains jeopardize interests of both internal and external stakeholders as well as the environment especially in the developing world. We argue that the disparity in implementation can be linked to weak structural institutions and lack of ethical standards in most developing countries.","[Ghalib, Asad K.] Liverpool Hope Univ, Liverpool Hope Business Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Ghalib, Asad K.] Univ Manchester, Brooks World Poverty Inst, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Agupusi, Patricia] Brown Univ, Watson Inst Int Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Liverpool Hope University; University of Manchester; Brown University,"Ghalib, AK (通讯作者)，Liverpool Hope Univ, Liverpool Hope Business Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",ghaliba@hope.ac.uk; patricia_agupusi@brown.edu,"Ghalib, Asad/AAK-4362-2020","Ghalib, Asad/0000-0001-6306-3461",,,,,34,6,6,1,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Our estimates rely on a two-sample instrumental variables approach using representative data from the Japanese Social Stratification and Mobility surveys, collected between 1965 and 2005. Father's income is predicted on the basis of a rich set of variables, and we discuss changes in the Japanese earnings structure for cohorts born between the early 1900s and the 1960s. Our main results indicate that the intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) for both sons and daughters in Japan lies around 0.35, which is an intermediate value, by international standards. We discuss the sensitivity of the IGE to using either personal or family income as the income variable for both fathers and children. We also examine changes across cohorts in the IGE. Results indicate that intergenerational mobility has been roughly stable over the last decades.","[Lefranc, Arnaud] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Lefranc, Arnaud] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Ojima, Fumiaki] Doshisha Univ, Dept Sociol, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028580, Japan; [Yoshida, Takashi] Shizuoka Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Suruga Ku, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan",CY Cergy Paris Universite; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Doshisha University; Shizuoka University,"Lefranc, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, 33 Blvd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France.",arnaud.lefranc@u-cergy.fr,,"Lefranc, Arnaud/0000-0003-0105-584X","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730382, 22330161] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,56,15,16,1,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Under the same economic conditions, liquidity of individual stocks is significantly different, so the question arises - what internal factors of a company have the greatest impact on stock liquidity. The purpose of this paper is to investigate which internal factors of companies are most affecting the stock liquidity in markets of the Baltic countries. The research was performed in two parts. In the first part, the stock liquidity of Baltic companies was analyzed as well as its changes during the period of 2005 - 2012. In the second part, it was investigated the dependence between the stock liquidity of the Baltic companies and the company-level factors, such as size of a company, return on assets, liquidity of assets, financial leverage, fact of profit/loss, market to book value of assets ratio. The research evidenced that the higher liquidity of the stock of Estonian companies was significantly influenced by higher financial leverage, higher liquidity of assets, and profit. The stock liquidity of Latvian companies during the period of 2005-2012 was influenced only by size of the companies. The stock liquidity of Lithuanian companies during the research period was influenced positively only by the size of the companies and return on assets; however financial leverage had a negative impact.

Since 2008 convergence has given way to divergence in Southern Europe. In many eastern member states, the crisis undid much of the previous gains such that overall progress remains modest. This sharply contrasts with the speed of convergence in East Asian countries. Three elements characterise East Asian convergence: (1) An activist state (2) asymmetric integration allowing countries to enjoy the benefits of a liberal global economy while not exposing their domestic economies to the full pressures of that system and, (3) A macroeconomic regime promoting investment and protecting against excessive real exchange rate appreciation. European integration, instead, discourages all three elements. The reason for this developmental model is that the EU increasingly sees competition from low wage countries, including its own periphery, as sparking off a race to the bottom. That zero-sum interpretation, in turn, gained prominence due to the low growth rates that have characterised the EU ever since the macroeconomic policy regime in the member states gradually shifted to an absolute priority for low inflation.","[Notermans, Ton] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Int Relat, Tallinn Sch Econ & Business Adm, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,,ton.notermans@tseba.ttu.ee,"Notermans, Ton/ABE-8296-2021",,,,,,53,0,0,0,4,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-7-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,23,38,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB2XI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342457200002,0

Mathematical formulation of PIH following adaptive expectation technique given by Friedman and the ways of testing the validity of permanency are recapitulated. Two alternative approaches are established: (a) Model published by Campbell and Mankiw [4] looking for an appropriate econometric technique starting by permanent income hypothesis; based on the results of Hall and Flavin, the model allows to reflect an existence of both PIH and non PIH consumers and to quantify their proportion. (b) Model of error correction mechanism as a theoretical concept bringing a solution of problems arising by dealing with non stationary time - series (e.g. [15]) which happened to suite PIH as an application. Possible influence of financial and economic crises is proposed to be measured by introducing relevant dummies in the models. Using the actual data of the Visegrad group (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia) and comprising Austrian economy to provide a comparison, both models are estimated. Small discrepancies according to model in question are evident by following individual economies. Treating Visegrad as a panel, both models provide an identical result. PIH cannot be applied to whole economies, nevertheless, as it is shown about 50% of households in the four Visegrad economies consume according to PIH. Critical years 2008-2012 (end of the data sample) do not change this result significantly.","Vysoka Skola Ekon, Fak Informatiky & Stat, Katedra Ekonometrie, CR-13067 Prague, Czech Republic",,"Pánková, V (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Fak Informatiky & Stat, Katedra Ekonometrie, CR-13067 Prague, Czech Republic.",pankova@vse.cz,,,,,,,29,1,1,1,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Result shows that India has comparative advantage in production and export of cotton in recent years. This study highlights that USA has 14 percent share in world production, however, its share in world export is 38 percent. USA exports 86 percent of cotton production to other countries. The cost of producing cotton is highest in USA, which is 4.5 to 6 times higher than India. During 1995-2010, USA has given about $37 billion to cotton producers though various programmes like counter-cyclical payments, decoupled income, commodity certificates etc. Despite high cost of cotton production, USA is enjoying artificial comparative advantage in cotton market due to high level of domestic support given to farmers and big corporation in USA.

The analyses carried out are designed to define the role of local authorities in the management of economic development in the area. Furthermore, the purpose of this article is to analyse instruments for supporting economic development, which can be potentially used by local governments in Poland. The realization of this objective is possible by using descriptive methods based on a review of literature and the various types of documents and analysis on the policy of both the economic development and activities of local government, which implement this policy. The method of system analysis is also partially used in the article, and some results of surveys conducted among Polish and foreign investors and entrepreneurs in 2011 are presented. The article assumes that in spite of having a number of instruments, both formal and material, for encouraging economic development and business development, most local governments narrowly assess the current state of entrepreneurship and development trends, and perform an insufficient analysis of the potential of their area. Secondly, the formulated goals of economic development are not very innovative, ambitious or concrete. Furthermore, they do not arise directly from the analysis of the micro and macro-environment that affects the position and development of local government.","Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Dept Local Govt & Policy, PL-20080 Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Sienkiewicz, MW (通讯作者)，Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Dept Local Govt & Policy, Pl Litewski 3, PL-20080 Lublin, Poland.",m.sienkiewicz@rozwojlokalny.pl,,"Sienkiewicz, Mariusz/0000-0001-9019-8679",,,,,27,3,3,0,15,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

It should be admitted that relying on investment in R&D is too narrow if we consider the multifaceted nature of innovation. Thus the case study method was employed to have an in-depth look on the innovation evidence in the low-tech sector. Findings show that a persistent struggle of the low-tech sector to take the high earning markets and to produce the high quality products give an impetus to be in line with the current technologies.

Then the author uses the data from 1978 to 2012 to build unary and binary linear regression models for locomotives and improves the model for evaluating the procurement size of locomotives, hoping this research achievement can be an important reference for China Railway Corporation, road bureaus and companies during their decision-making for locomotive procurement.","[Xiao Xiang; Xie Hongwen] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Wang Laixiang] China Railway Corp, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Xiao, X (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",xxiao@bjtu.edu.cn,"xiao, xiang/GWU-6035-2022; Xiao, Xiao/IAN-3011-2023",,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,HAWTHORN EAST,"STE 4, LEVEL 3, 695 BURKE RD, HAWTHORN EAST, VC 3123, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9924140-8-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,3,8,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2MF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358894900001,0

One typical objective of such policy reforms is to provide an incentive for later retirement. The question we address in this paper is whether the expected retirement ages of Irish individuals aged 50 to 64 changed as a result of the policy announcement. The data we use are from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). Our findings show that there was no noticeable break in expected retirement ages before and after 3 March, 2010 (the day on which the policy announcement was made). Also during 2010, the economic news became increasingly bad as the full scale of the fiscal and banking crises in Ireland emerged. The data suggest that there was a reduction in the proportion of people planning to retire at age 65 after 30 September, 2010, the day that the full scale of the banking crisis emerged.","[Barrett, Alan] Trinity Coll Dublin IZA, Econ & Social Res Inst ESRI, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing TILDA, Dublin, Ireland; [Mosca, Irene] Trinity Coll Dublin, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing TILDA, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Barrett, A (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin IZA, Econ & Social Res Inst ESRI, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing TILDA, Dublin, Ireland.",barretal@tcd.ie; moscai@tcd.ie,,"Barrett, Alan/0000-0002-1106-2528",,,,,15,6,8,0,17,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Recent misunderstanding of property, in terms of both the substance of its rights and the implications of its remedies, have presented property as an obstacle tourather than as a platform forurapidly evolving technology. This article will first present a framework for property that captures its role in organizations, intellectual property, as well as property law itself. An information-cost theory of property stresses modularity, standardization, and hybrid systems of private and common rights, which allow for separation of functions and specialization. Modularity and separation in property allow for specialization but also give rise to the potential for strategic behavior. Each specialist may only maximize locally, which can lead to social losses. To counteract this strategic behavior, a combination of boundary placement and interface rules can be used, as is commonly seen in common property systems and their variants. The article then applies this framework to Standard-Setting Organizations (SSOs) and shows that separation of the standardization function is yet another type of property separation and specialization. As with other dimensions of separation, strategic behavior becomes possible. But contrary to some widespread views, the tools of property do not simply cause the problem of opportunistic holdup in SSOs; property also provides some solutions, in this case through doctrines of equity that are aimed at counteracting opportunism in general.","Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Smith, HE (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hesmith@law.harvard.edu,,,,,,,178,15,15,0,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Specifically, I analyze if implementing auctions and legal unbundling can counter market power in an industry where a Vertically Integrated Corporation (VIC) has a monopoly position in an essential, scarce upstream activity and also owns one of the firms active in the competitive downstream activity. In an earlier paper, Van Koten (2011), I showed that in this configuration the VIC, by having its downstream firm bid more aggressively, can-through increased auction revenue-increase its profit, while disadvantaging downstream competitors and lowering efficiency. Here I analyze the regulatory measure of also legally separating the downstream firm from the VIC. I show that such a measure may only be partially effective; the VIC can formulate a simple compensation scheme that does not violate restrictions typically imposed by legal separation but induces the manager of the VIC-owned downstream firm to bid more aggressively. This increases the profits of the VIC, decreases efficiency, and disadvantages downstream competitors.","[van Koten, Silvester] EUI, RSCAS, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [van Koten, Silvester] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic",European University Institute; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"van Koten, S (通讯作者)，EUI, RSCAS, Via Boccaccio 151, I-50133 Florence, Italy.",silvester.vankoten@eui.eu,"van Koten, Silvester/B-8643-2009","van Koten, Silvester/0000-0002-1112-0126",,,,,26,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

It employs a robust clustering approach to perform classification of the component series. Each series within a cluster is assumed to follow the same model and the data are then pooled for estimation. The classification is model-based and robust to outlier contamination. The robustness is achieved by using the intrinsic mode functions of the Hilbert-Huang transform at lower frequencies. These functions are found to be robust to outlier contamination. The paper also compares out-of-sample forecast performance of the proposed method with several methods available in the literature. The other forecasting methods considered include vector autoregressive models with/without LASSO, group LASSO, principal component regression, and partial least squares.

Although many studies are available, conclusions are still mixed. This paper contributes to our existing understanding of the impact of sprawl on social segregation, looking at the case of Beijing. The results of the analysis show that sprawling development, characterised by scattered gated communities, low-density luxury villas, informal development and uneven distributions of public services and transport infrastructures in the peri-urban regions, have increased residential segregation between low-income and high-income residents and between local residents and migrants. Planning policies designed to control urban sprawl and encourage a compact city could have a positive role in reducing social segregation. However, the role of spatial planning is limited as there are still other institutional factors influencing social segregation in China's cities, two of the most relevant here being the remaining hukou system and dual land system.","Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Zhao, PJ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",pengjun.zhao@pku.edu.cn,"Zhao, Peng/HDO-7507-2022",,,,,,76,37,43,6,106,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The objective of the present research was to advance understanding of the factors that influence the range preferences of potential EV customers who had the opportunity to test an EV. Data from 79 participants who had driven an EV for 3 months was assessed in a field study setting. Range preferences of those users were found to be substantially higher than their average range needs. Regression analyses indicated that higher average range needs, higher range of the driver's familiar combustion vehicle (CV), and greater experienced range anxiety were related to higher range preferences. Furthermore, we found that range preferences decreased over the first 3 months of EV use. Finally, indicators of average range needs were more strongly associated with range preferences as EV experience increased. Thus, only customers with EV experience seem to rely on accurate estimates of their range needs when constructing their range preferences. Implications for strategies aimed at enhancing customer appraisal of limited range mobility and determining optimal EV range are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We find evidence that these ISM indices are helpful in improving the nowcasts when new ISM information becomes available at the beginning of the month, ahead of other monthly indicators.

Being based on a nationwide telephone survey in Taiwan, this study uses the contingent valuation method to elicit citizens' willingness to pay (WTP) for maintaining the current PSB in Taiwan. The results show that household average WTP per year for PSB is estimated to be NT$982 (US$29.89), which is equal to 0.18% of GDP per capita in 2007. Such WTP estimate is much higher than the current government subsidy for PSB per household, which implies respondents' high appreciation on PSB as well as the potential benefit that Taiwan PSB could bring to the family. Our estimates of WTP provide important information for government authorities and policy-makers when making funding decisions. Furthermore, our survey results also point to some prioritized functions as potential niches on which the Taiwan PSB could focus in the future.","[Lin, Yih-Ming] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Fu, Tsu-Tan] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Yeh, Powen] Chien Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, Zhongli, Taiwan; [Huang, Mei-Ying] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chiayi University; Soochow University; National Taipei University,"Fu, TT (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",tfu@scu.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,9,9,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

In this context, Bai and Ng (Journal of Econometrics 2008; 146: 304-317) find an improvement in selecting indicators according to the forecast variable prior to factor estimation (targeted predictors). In particular, they propose using the LARS-EN algorithm to remove irrelevant predictors. In this paper, we adapt the Bai and Ng procedure to a setup in which data releases are delayed and staggered. In the pre-selection step, we replace actual data with estimates obtained on the basis of past information, where the structure of the available information replicates the one a forecaster would face in real time. We estimate on the reduced dataset the dynamic factor model of Giannone et al. (Journal of Monetary Economics 2008; 55: 665-676) and Doz et al. (Journal of Econometrics 2011; 164: 188-205), which is particularly suitable for the very short-term forecast of GDP. A pseudo real-time evaluation on French data shows the potential of our approach.

This sector creates large amounts of greenhouse gases and is characterized by the highly decentralized nature of its emissions which are the outcome of the travel decisions taken by billions of individuals. The collective problem is therefore created by a multitude of individual behaviors. If travel choices are constrained in an attempt to solve this collective problem, we need an understanding of the economic bases of individual behaviors. With this in view, this paper begins by presenting the macroscopic impacts of a number of sustainable travel scenarios in France in the year 2050. It then shows the changes in trends which accompany the necessary changes in individual travel behaviors. Some of these changes in trends amount to breaks with the past which will be far from easy to implement.

Individuals have moral concerns about causing harm and would like others to believe that they do. In the absence of legal liability, causing harm suggests low concerns and is therefore damaging to one's social image, which feeds back into incentives to take precautions. These nevertheless remain suboptimal when informal motivations are not strong enough for injurers to willingly compensate victims ex post. By contrast, perfectly enforced legal liability crowds out informal motivations completely (e.g., tortfeasors suffer no disesteem) but precautions are then efficient. Under imperfect enforcement, informal motivations and legal sanctions complement one another. With strict liability, individuals held liable suffer disesteem, there is some motivational crowding-out but no net crowding-out with respect to overall incentives. Under the negligence rule, there is motivational crowding-in when image concerns induce bunching on the legal due care standard.","[Deffains, Bruno; Fluet, Claude] Univ Paris 02, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Deffains, Bruno] European Business Sch Wiesbaden, Wiesbaden, Germany; [Fluet, Claude] Univ Quebec Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Deffains, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 02, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",fluet.claude-denys@uqam.ca,"Deffains, Bruno/F-2896-2018","Deffains, Bruno/0000-0001-9822-5272",,,,,41,18,18,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Despite unique Chinese policies that exhibit strong influence on the economic landscape, we detect key parallels with the patterns found in classic theories and empirical studies in Western contexts. Total employment has become increasingly concentrated. This aggregate picture hides important sectoral variations though: manufacturing employment has spread out to suburban areas; producer service jobs have increasingly concentrated in metropolitan centres; and consumer and public services have clustered in areas with high aggregate population. We argue that the major forces that are shaping the economic landscape in PRD are the market institutions and development path-dependency. Under the circumstances of an increasingly liberalised market and decentralised government, policy now may function as a dynamic tool to magnify local spatial-economic and historical advantages and to balance uneven regional development.","[Cheng, Fangfang; Geertman, Stan; Hooimeijer, Pieter] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Cheng, Fangfang; Boerboom, Luc] Univ Twente, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geoinformat Managemen, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AA Enschede, Netherlands",Utrecht University; University of Twente,"Cheng, FF (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",f.cheng@uu.nl; boerboom@itc.nl; s.c.m.geertman@uu.nl; p.hooimeijer@uu.nl,"Boerboom, Luc/K-2584-2018; Boerboom, Luc/D-3994-2009","Boerboom, Luc/0000-0001-8250-0102; geertman, stan/0000-0002-8824-0484",,,,,67,5,5,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We propose a co-evolutionary theory perspective embracing both firm-internal and firm-environmental factors for location attractiveness, along with institutional and industry changes. The framework integrates constructs from past research in economic geography, international business, and R&D internationalization. The Indian case illustrates how host-country institutional evolution, notably regarding intellectual property rights and education, plays a significant role for international sourcing of pharmaceutical R&D.","[Haakonsson, Stine Jessen] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Jensen, Peter D.

Current policy strategies which focus on resilience show the relevance of this issue and the need for continuing research on the links between complex transport networks and resilience, mostly by exploring this relationship at different scale levels and its impact on the whole network.

This paper addresses three essential questions along these lines: how people decide to self-protect, how they blend self-protection with the other activities, and the influence of the social and economic environment around them. Conceptually, answers emerge when we apply the classic state-preference theoretical framework and carefully consider the role of the probability of victimization, the presumed effectiveness of self-protection, and the outcome of the self-protection decision in the context of recreation and work. To investigate the empirical environment of self-protection, I use a unique data set containing detailed information about the self-protective, recreational, and employment practices of over 3000 U.S. university students. A series of statistical probes provides a profile of personal as well as wider social and economic circumstances that shape the individual self-protection decision; the empirical patterns illustrate how individuals selectively use social and personal resources when protecting themselves against crime as they go about their everyday lives.

However, transport management is often taken into account only as an external cost, without integration in collaborative reasoning. This paper proposes a framework to assess collaborative solutions in the context of logistics and freight transport, as well as to describe the links between freight transport and supply chain management in terms of collaboration techniques. First the main concepts of collaborative logistics in the distribution and transport fields are presented, highlighting the links between collaboration, freight transport and supply chain management. Then, the method to assess collaborative logistics and freight transport solutions is proposed. This method includes a design scheme, a hierarchic clustering technique and a dominance analysis method to unify the assessment of each individual and prepare collaborative research for a common solution. After that, the method is applied to the assessment of five scenarios derived from a real situation for the urban area of Lyon (France) to illustrate how difficult convergence towards consensus is. The results show that a global optimal solution for the entire set of stakeholders is not easy to identify and how the proposed method can be helpful for decision makers to achieve a consensus of common objectives.","[Gonzalez-Feliu, Jesus; Ma, Tai-Yu] CNRS, Lab Econ Transports, F-69363 Lyon 07, France; [Morana, Joelle] Univ Lyon 2, Lab Econ Transports, F-69363 Lyon 07, France; [Grau, Josep-Maria Salanova] CERTH, Hellen Inst Transport, Thessaloniki, Greece",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre for Research & Technology Hellas,"Gonzalez-Feliu, J (通讯作者)，CNRS, Lab Econ Transports, 14 Av Berthelot, F-69363 Lyon 07, France.",jesus.gonzales-feliu@let.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr; joelle.morana@let.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr; jose@certh.gr; tai-yu.ma@let.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr,"Gonzalez-Feliu, Jesus/Q-7749-2018; Salanova Grau, Josep Maria/H-8657-2012","Gonzalez-Feliu, Jesus/0000-0002-0056-7627; Salanova Grau, Josep Maria/0000-0003-1564-2471; Ma, Tai-yu/0000-0001-6900-098X",,,,,96,46,49,0,32,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Nevertheless, David and others claim that their theories have policy significance. Indeed, lock-in claims continue to appear as a basis for antitrust action.

By contrast, in London, the 1984 London Regional Transport Act introduced a system of comprehensive tendering - but it took 10 years for the organisational and ownership changes to be fully implemented. This paper examines the long term impacts of these changes. A key issue when examining long term changes is that of the counterfactual - what would have happened if the changes had not occurred? An econometric model of the demand for local bus services in Britain is outlined and used in conjunction with extrapolative methods for key variables such as fares and bus kms to determine demand-side counterfactuals. Some analyses of subsidy and of costs will also be outlined. This will then permit the examination of welfare change by estimating changes in consumer and producer surpluses, updating earlier studies. It is found that outside London, bus demand declined strongly, at least up to the year 2000 and some of this reduction can be ascribed to deregulation. By contrast in London, demand has generally been increasing. However, in both areas operating costs also declined strongly, again up to 2000, but since then there have been strong increases in costs and subsidy. Our initial finding is that there are net welfare increases both outside and inside London, but with welfare increases per capita being five times greater in London than elsewhere. However, sensitivity analysis shows that our results are sensitive to the specification of the modelling system and assumptions made concerning the counterfactual, particularly for the results for London.

Affected paratransit operators can opt to be incorporated in these systems by forming new operating companies, but must withdraw their existing services from proposed routes. Cape Town's first phase of BRT operations came online in 2011, and operator engagement has focussed on this phase. The attitudes within this city's paratransit sector in relation to future phases, and to the broader reform policy, remain largely untested. In view of this sector's past resistance to government-led proposals, and the current phase avoiding areas with the highest concentrations of operators, the current engagement process's outcomes may not be adequate indicators of future prospects. In this paper the authors discuss the details of the offer that has been made to paratransit operators. progress towards finalising negotiations around that offer, risk factors inherent in the current approach to engagement, and issues that have emerged around the reform programme - insofar as it affects and involves paratransit - which may impact upon future phases of the reform programme. These emerging issues include: the feasibility of continued financial compensation for withdrawing existing operating permissions in view of broader fiscal concerns around BRT implementation; a lack of insight into the fundamental factors driving the responses of paratransit operators and associations to the reform programme; and concerns around a national public transport reform policy that may not be sufficiently grounded in the local contexts within which municipalities and operators function.

This paper, therefore, addresses the coordination problem resulting from the division of policy instruments between two different government levels that face different types of externalities in varying degrees of magnitude in the urban transport sector by developing three types of theoretical models: the Full Control Centralised Model where the state government has full control over all pricing instrument; a Nash equilibrium model where each of the government levels controls only one instrument and takes the behaviour of the other as given; and a Stackelberg equilibrium mode where the behaviour of the state government is influenced by the fact that one of the price instruments is controlled by the local government. With an empirical illustration of the model for Delhi, the paper finds that since there are many interactions and many externalities between the two levels of government, a division of roles between them does not guarantee an efficient pricing outcome and the efficiency of pricing would depend on the institutional set up and on the correspondence between the objective functions of the two government levels.

A franchising network builds on strong partners and a structured headquarters planning. The major problem discussion in this paper is finding the right business partners. This task has been a challenge for many businesses in the past and present, and especially for companies in the franchisor sector. Adequate selection allows for smooth and mutually benefitting relations, which usually turn into profitable and lasting alliances. Contrary to the right personnel decision, wrong decisions often arise from less strategic processes, and quick and unwisely taken decisions by the franchisor, due to lack of understanding of the problems to be solved or a lack of standardization in place. The aim of this research is to support pre-decision-making and to provide a summary of researched ideas on better future outcomes, when selecting a prospect. This analysis plays an important role in the quest for improving selection processes, company's self-assessments, and amendments for existing selection processes. The method used in this paper is content analysis by comparing a collection of articles, describing international franchise processes. Different industries and distinct companies reveal different criteria and strategies. The time frame of nine studies compared in this article starts in the late 1980s and ends in 2011 and covers the North American and European continent.

The provided approach has statistical nature. However, in the absence of a well-established market, the coming reform requires the use of the indirect estimation procedure. This paper proposes a method for estimating the capitalization rate that could usefully be applied in mass appraisal. The proposed model for the evaluation of the capitalization rate is intended as an alternative to traditional inferential processes that apply in real estate market. It can be used even in market segments that are not enough active and does not require the use of technical adjustments assigned from estimators. The procedure is based on a speculative-financial real estate market model. According to this model real factors and monetary factors affect the rate of capitalization. In addition, it assumes that market prices are formed by a process of synthesis of economic-social and personal services. For cadastral purposes it is necessary to purify the market values experienced by these individual influences in order to estimate the average market value. In this paper, the application of a specific multi-criteria approach for estimating capitalization rate is tested. The method is based on the consideration of the mutual influences of the factors that determine capitalization rates. It aims to objectify property values which, by their own nature, are partly subjective. The procedure is applicable to urban and extra-urban micro and macro-estimation and it is based on the UTA approach and on the fuzzy measures theory.","[Granata, Maria Fiorella] Univ Catania, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, I-95124 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,,fiorella.granata@tin.it,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,3,MEDIMOND S R L,40128 BOLOGNA,"VIA MASERATI 5, 40128 BOLOGNA, 00000, ITALY",,,978-88-7587-690-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,119,127,,,,,,9,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BA8IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338155900011,0

The replacement cost method is used where the value of carbon sink is calculated as associated cost savings from replacement of more expensive mitigation options for achieving a given emission target. Minimum costs with and without carbon sinks are derived with a safety-first approach in a chance constrained programming framework which also accounts for variability in control costs. The theoretical results show that for high enough risk discount, carbon sink is not included in a cost effective mitigation program even when the carbon sink cost is zero. The empirical application to the EU independent commitment of 20% reduction in carbon dioxides shows large variation in carbon sink value depending on risk discount. Under no uncertainty, the value can correspond to 0.33% of total GDP in EU, but it declines due to the uncertainty associated with forest carbon sink and is zero for high probability levels in achieving the target. Thus, whether or not to recommend the-inclusion of carbon sink in the EU climate policy depends on the uncertainty of carbon sinks in relation to other sources and on the importance of reaching stipulated emission reduction targets.

The requisite data were analyzed in accordance with the Heckman approach. Results indicated that elderly, male, and resident landowners, having larger tracts of pine plantations were more likely to be aware of wood-based bioenergy.

Especially mutual comparison leads to the desire for new possibilities and methods of analysis or modeling. The purpose of this paper is to approach one of the methods that can be sorted into groups that is still not explored enough, but still has many supporters and opponents. This contribution highlights the role of multiplier effects in the regional and local economies, both from the theoretical and the practical perspective. It briefly presents several methods, including the multiplier effect, and their usage in practice. The method of the local multiplier is explored more in detail and the paper shows its possible use in everyday life. This method is quite new and there do not exist many studies about it at the moment. It was created to help both public and private organizations and individuals to evaluate the impact of their expenditures on the local economy. Local multiplier observes the money trail and its flow after it is spent by local organization or individual. Maintaining the money flow is important especially for small open economies to strengthen their self-sufficiency. Despite all the pitfalls of the local multiplier method, that are represented mainly by obtaining and identifying required data and accurate information, the contribution tries to show possible use in practice. At the same time it is trying to answer the question whether the right value multiplier can be considered as one of the support criterions when deciding on issues of regional policy.","[Machacek, Jaroslav; Silovska, Nana; Rihova, Gabriela; Jilek, Petr] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Narodohospodarska Fak, Katedra Reg Studif, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Machácek, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Narodohospodarska Fak, Katedra Reg Studif, Prague, Czech Republic.",machacek@kav.cas.cz; h.silovska@seznam.cz; gabriela.rihova@centrum.cz; petr.jilek@metrostavdevelopment.cz,"Rihova, Gabriela/JVD-9595-2023",,,,,,26,9,9,1,18,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However, we still do not know how these capabilities change in the firms and in their interactions. Therefore we ask: through what mechanisms do capabilities evolve in the forest industry context? The study was conducted by interviewing 30 forest industry experts and the data was analyzed qualitatively. We find that the main mechanisms of capability evolution include capability gaps, capability selection, capability development and capability outcomes. The study contributes through a rich description of capability evolution and by identifying theoretically meaningful mechanisms through which capability evolution takes place. Furthermore, several implications for practitioners are presented. (C) 2013 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, timed. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

This includes Thailand, where the damage from motorcycle accidents has been increasing yearly. Helmets are one of the most effective pieces of equipment in reducing the severity of injuries in each crash. An increase in helmet use amongst motorcycle riders would therefore reduce the loss of life. With this in mind, Thailand has adopted a wide-scale enforcement of laws regarding helmet use, but there are limits to how widely enforcement can work. Community participation is considered key in increasing the rate of helmet usage. In this, people in the community become the driving force behind mechanisms of community safety through community participation, including public information, public consultation, public meetings, and participative decision-making. This study aims to capture the concept of community participation as a means of increasing the rate of helmet use, and to identify economic, social, and environmental factors that affect the helmet usage of people at the local level, including gender, age, location, number of road lanes, time of day, day of the week, and traffic conditions. As a result of this community participation project in the study area, this survey has found an increase of 13.23% in the rates of helmet usage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

An empirical analysis of buy-outs and location structures of private equity firms in Germany,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGRAPHIE,,,German,Article,,,,,,private equity; buy-out; financial centres; Germany; Frankfurt am Main,VENTURE; GEOGRAPHY; INVESTMENT; INDUSTRY,"The current research suggests that equity investment firms in Germany are concentrated in five or six regional centres of equal importance. While the theoretical discussion focuses primarily on venture capital, empirical studies on locations of venture capital and buy-outs usually make no explicit distinction between the two forms of investment. The analysis presented here makes a systematic distinction between venture capital and buy-outs, with a special focus on buy-outs because this form of investment is of greater economic importance. The paper also extends the range of available data by including data on company transactions. An evaluation of all buy-outs in Germany in 2012 indicates that Munich is the only major location of buy-out firms in Germany, apart from Frankfurt am Main. The branch offices of equity investment firms based in the USA and the United Kingdom (UK) are a crucial factor. Moreover, many private equity firms operate directly from outside Germany, particularly from London. Thus, one might speak of an Anglo-Saxon axis of buy-out firms. These firms have a significant competitive advantage due to better fundraising opportunities in the financialised economies of the USA and the UK. Therefore, it is argued that, rather than focusing exclusively on the regional capital supply to explain the infrastructure of equity investment firms, as it was done in the past, the research should also take the organization of sources of funds into consideration.","Univ Munster, Inst Geog Arbeitsgebiet Stadt & Reg Forsch, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Scheuplein, C (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Geog Arbeitsgebiet Stadt & Reg Forsch, Heisenbergstr 2, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",christoph.scheuplein@uni-muenster.de,"Scheuplein, Christoph/U-7474-2019","Scheuplein, Christoph/0000-0003-2565-2761",,,,,59,1,1,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Using a survey of 185 firms, probit regressions reveal that R&D personnel and market power significantly influence the acquisition of knowledge associated with basic and applied science and product development. Tacit knowledge that resides in customers, and skilled personnel are effective sources for exploitation of international knowledge spillovers. Participation in seminars and conferences also enhances the acquisition of applied science. Firms that rely on codified sources are unlikely to acquire any knowledge. This research also confirms other authors' findings that subsidiary autonomy facilitates knowledge acquisition. In addition, knowledge in product development is most likely to lead to vertical intra-firm transfers while applied scientific research only results in the transfer of R&D capability. Scientific team visits from the US to Japan support subsidiaries' transfer of R&D capability but teams sent from Japan to the US adversely affect transfers. Overall, our results suggest international spillovers are predominantly associated with the acquisition of tacit knowledge, and intra-firm transfers are most effective in the context of knowledge acquired in applied research and product development.","[Shang, Qingyan; Poon, Jessie P.

Instead of the usual improvement scenario, a hypothetical deterioration in the conditions of the forest due to a fire is considered. A dataset containing five observations for each respondent enabled the estimation of three models for which the number of scenarios differed. The results show that visitors are sensitive to price and quality changes and that in the forest fire scenario the intended number of trips would be reduced and that respondents would experience a welfare loss. Signs of inconsistency between preferences expressed by revealed and intended behaviour were found. This research also provides some indications that strategic bias affects answers to price changes.

The analysis of the relationship between the NIC and the CPI was conducted for 16 countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom and was based on NIC data extracted from two sources (Carol Yeh-Yun Lin and Leif Edvinsson (2010), and the generational approach to the National Intellectual Capital measurement presented in the Report on the Intellectual Capital of Poland). Determination of the strength of the correlation between NIC and CPI represents the first step in evaluating intellectual capital as the factor which may reduce the scale of corruption. Evidence of a strong relationship between NIC and CPI confirms the author's hypothesis that a strong relationship exists, at the same time proving that further studies must be carried out to determine the direction of this relationship. Based on the results of such research (providing that NIC is confirmed to have an effect on CPI), it will then be possible to recommend new methods of preventing corruption through the development of NIC.","Silesian Tech Univ, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland",Silesian University of Technology,"Stachowicz-Stanusch, A (通讯作者)，Silesian Tech Univ, Roosevelt St 42, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland.",agata.stachowicz@polsl.pl,,"Stachowicz-Stanusch, Agata/0000-0001-6991-1222",,,,,76,3,4,1,40,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

As reading from computer screens requires a certain degree of individual technical skill, such variables should be objectively taken into consideration when conducting an experiment regarding the comparison between print and screen reading. This study analyses the difference in the level of understanding of the two presentational formats (text on printed pages and hypertext on computer screens) for people between 45-54 years of age (i.e. middle-aged adults). In our experimental findings there were no significant differences between the levels of comprehension for print and screen presentations. With regard to individual differences in gender, age group and educational level, the findings are as follows: gender and education effects on print reading comprehension performance were significant, while those on screen reading comprehension performance were not. For middle-aged computer learners, the main effect of age group on both print and screen reading comprehension performance was insignificant. In contrast, linear texts of traditional paper-based material are better for middle-aged readers' literal text comprehension, while hypertext is beneficial to their inferential text comprehension. It is also suggested that hypermedia could be used as a cognitive tool for improving middle-aged adults' inferential abilities on reading comprehension, provided that they were trained adequately to use available computers.","[Sun, Szu-Yuan] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Shieh, Chich-Jen] Chang Jung Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, Tainan, Taiwan; [Huang, Kai-Ping] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Management, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; Chang Jung Christian University; University of Technology Sydney,"Shieh, CJ (通讯作者)，Chang Jung Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, Tainan, Taiwan.",charles@mail.cjcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,74,5,7,0,34,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Some Hungarian and Polish banks suffered liquidity problems, too. This paper therefore aims to describe development of liquid asset ratio and to find out determinants which affect their values in the Visegrad countries. The data cover the period from 2000 to 2011. Liquidity of Czech banks declined in 2000-2009 (due to higher lending activity and decrease of balances with central banks and other banks) but it has improved during last two years. Liquidity of Slovak banks has decreased in 2009 and 2010 due to impact of financial crisis on some economic sectors and due to changes in interbank market transactions. Very similar is the development of liquid asset ratio in Hungary and Poland where it has gone down during last five years due to important structural weaknesses such as very high loan-to-deposit ratio, high share of foreign debts, and negative net position in the interbank market. Furthermore, we focus on determinants of liquid asset ratio. Results of the panel data regression analysis showed that the liquid asset ratio is mostly influenced by the size of the bank, its capital adequacy and profitability. Also overall macroeconomic conditions, such as growth rate of gross domestic product, the existence of financial crisis, exchange rate or rate of unemployment and the development of interest rates (both on loans and interbank transaction) are important. Although the Visegrad countries have a lot in common, different factors determined liquid asset ratio in individual countries and also the direction of influence of some factors may differ.","Silesian Univ Opava, Dept Finance, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Vodová, P (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Dept Finance, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Opava, Czech Republic.",vodova@opf.slu.cz,"Vodova, Pavla Klepkova/ABG-2948-2020","Vodova, Pavla Klepkova/0000-0003-0382-5174",,,,,40,22,22,0,16,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It refers to migrants who are moving to third countries in the hope of reaching the EU after a short waiting period in the transit country. It is often seen as the missing link between emigration and settlement in the framework of irregular migration to the EU. This paper contributes to the transit migration debate by approaching migrants' transit statuses from a mobilities perspective. Based on empirical data gathered by the means of ethnographic engagements with sub-Saharan African migrants in so-called European transit spaces (Morocco and Turkey), it discusses migrants' experienced immobility and physical immobility on their ways to the EU.","Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Schapendonk, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.schapendonk@uu.nl,,,,,,,37,36,42,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The current traffic models represent the traffic operations at a merge are based on gap-acceptance approach, with the merging traffic givingway to traffic on the mainline carriageway and imposing little or no delay to the mainline traffic. The results tend to overestimate delays to the merging traffic, and underestimate delays and interruptions to the mainline traffic. This paper investigates the current practice in modelling motorway merge in the UK and highlights some major conceptual and methodological differences to those in the US and Germany. Studies based on empirical observations and a dynamic, behaviour-based microsimulation modelling were carried out to improve understanding of the factors involved in the performance at merge. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of model predictions - and perhaps policy decisions - to the behavioural assumptions made in traffic models. The paper provides simple, practical recommendations to improve the current practice on modelling merge by the consideration of peak flow profile in the estimation of merge capacity, realistic local and variable pcu values for heavy vehicles, and a more confined merge influence area than currently advised in the UK guidelines. It calls for further empirical and behavioural-based microsimulation analysis and for the explicit consideration of the variability of traffic flows and dynamic congestion effects on merge, to improve the model predictions and provide better investment decisions.

The particular emphasis is on the case of India, where, in the years following 1991, there was a virtual dismantling of controls on entry and production in registered manufacturing. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in impediments to foreign trade and access to foreign exchange. Economic controls create an incentive for illegal trade, and a frequent by-product of illegal trade is violent crime. Consequently, violent crimes such as murders would be expected to decline following market-based reforms. Analysis of aggregate all-India data, as well as data at the state level, suggests that economic reforms did indeed lead to a reduction in violent crime. I extend the analysis to a panel of countries and find strong evidence that greater trade openness is negatively related to violent crime.","Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Prasad, K (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,33,13,13,1,16,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

A cost frontier approach,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Port reform; Cost frontier; Efficiency evolution,UNITED-STATES; EFFICIENCY,"The evolution of the port management model in Spain has been marked by three legislative reforms in the last two decades. This legislation was designed so that the Spanish regulatory framework could embrace the forms of port organization and management that would in turn permit the Spanish ports to function competitively and efficiently, and to be suitably positioned within the distribution systems. This paper aims to analyze the impact of these regulatory changes upon the economic efficiency of the Spanish Port Authorities during 1993-2007 period. To do this, we use a short run total cost model after contrasting that it is the more appropriate because our results suggest that this sector is not in long-run equilibrium. The results demonstrate that the impact of these legislative reforms has not been equal. The most significant changes, in terms of economic efficiency, took place in the first period. The results were also positive for the second period, although the efficiency gains were much more modest. Finally the third legislative reform seemed to have had a contrary effect upon economic efficiency. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey 1993-2006, we find that mothers with fewer children have a higher calorie intake and a lower probability of being underweight and having low blood pressure; meanwhile, they have a higher probability of being overweight. This would occur if a smaller family size increases the food consumption of mothers, leading underweight women to attain a normal weight and normal weight women becoming overweight. Robust tests are performed to provide evidence on the hypothesis that the tradeoff between children's quantity and mother's quality is through a budget constraint mechanism, that is, having more children decreases the resource allocated to mothers and affects their health outcomes.","[Li, Lixing] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiaoyu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Peking University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Li, LX (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",lilixing@ccer.pku.edu.cn,,"Li, Lixing/0000-0002-1178-5830; Wu, Xiaoyu/0000-0003-3803-7207",,,,,44,29,35,1,70,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

We identify situations where permitting price discrimination leads to either higher or lower wholesale prices for all downstream firms. These findings are driven by upstream profits being discontinuous due to costly entry. Moreover, permitting price discrimination fosters entry which often improves welfare.

In the Netherlands, cost overruns are as common as cost underruns but because cost overruns are larger than cost underruns projects on average have a cost overrun of 16.5%. The focus on one country further enabled to consider cost overruns during different project development phases. It turned out that in the Netherlands the majority of the cost overrun occurs in the pre-construction phase (the period between the formal decision to build and the start of construction). The frequency as well as the magnitude of pre-construction cost overrun is significantly higher than in the construction phase. The used methodology of calculating cost overruns does however not take lock-in into account. This phenomenon shows that the real decision to build was taken much earlier in the decision-making process. Since estimated costs are usually lower during these earlier stages, the cost overruns based on this real decision to build are likely to be much higher. Cost overruns presented in studies are therefore often underestimated and the problem of cost overruns is much larger than we think. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Cantarelli, C.

In the statistical setting, we form both point and interval forecasts using alternative models, and evaluate them using a number of statistical tests. We assess the economic significance of the obtained forecasts by means of trading strategies, taking into account the presence of transactions costs.

Noting the predominant role of linear regression analysis in empirical economics, we asked 257 academic economists to make probabilistic inferences based on different presentations of the outputs of this statistical tool. The questions concerned the distribution of the dependent variable, conditional on known values of the independent variable. The answers based on the presentation mode that is standard in the literature demonstrated an illusion of predictability; the outcomes were perceived to be more predictable than could be justified by the model. In particular, many respondents failed to take the error term into account. Adding graphs did not improve the inference. Paradoxically, the respondents were more accurate when only graphs were provided (i.e., no regression statistics). The implications of our study suggest, inter alia, the need to reconsider the way in which empirical results are presented, and the possible provision of easy-to-use simulation tools that would enable readers of empirical papers to make accurate inferences.

SIX CASES FROM EUROPE,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Assessment; Evaluation; Cost Benefit Analysis; Italy; France; United Kingdom; Germany; the Netherlands; Sweden,TRANSPORT; INVESTMENT,"The paper describes and analyses the different approaches to assessment present in six European countries, namely the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Italy and France. Many comparative studies already exist, pointing out the differences in technicalities and standard values used in the normative frameworks. The contribution of this paper is, instead, to look at the role assigned to assessment procedures in the broader process of decision-making in the transport infrastructure sector. In particular, we look at the role of Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) in the process of infrastructure planning. The cases vary from the use of CBA to assess single schemes out of a general public-driven strategy (like in the UK), to centrally planned and assessed infrastructure in which CBA is used essentially to prioritise among a range of concurrent projects (like in Germany or the Nordic countries). Substantial differences also exist among planned approaches, ranging from centrally managed modelling and ranking, to more complex and cooperative approaches. After reviewing each of the six countries and introducing their approach, we define an interpretation scheme. By means of this scheme, we propose a comparison of the six countries, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. This analysis also makes it possible to comment more rationally some of the commonly found pitfalls of evaluation. The paper concludes with some policy indications, proposing three theoretical models of the process.","[Beria, Paolo] Politecn Milan, DiAP, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Giove, Michele; Miele, Mariafrancesca] Ernst & Young Financial Business Advisors SpA, Rome, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Beria, P (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, DiAP, Via Bonardi 3, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",paolo.beria@polimi.it,"Beria, Paolo/A-9439-2010","Beria, Paolo/0000-0001-5171-6576",,,,,68,10,10,0,16,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The results of the study suggest that while industry characteristics such as industry growth rate and capital intensity have a positive impact on the average plant start-up size, industrial concentration, import penetration, and the change in research and development expenditures are negatively associated with the same variable. In addition, the macroeconomic environment is also an important determinant of the choice of plant start-up size.

In this paper we have taken advantage of the inclusion of a special module on childhood deprivation in EU-SILC 2009 to create reliable measures of both household basic deprivation and childhood deprivation. Overall, our analysis leads us to the conclusion that those exposed to childhood deprivation are generally a sub-set of the children captured by population indicators. Adopting a multidimensional and dynamic perspective on household resources and deprivation enables us to capture the large majority of children exposed to childhood deprivation. Restricting our attention to childhood deprivation would lead us to miss out on a significant number of children living in households experiencing basic deprivation but not exposed to childhood deprivation. It would be unwise to assume that such deprivation has no consequences for children. While there is clearly a value in supplementing existing national measures with child specific indicators, it would not appear sensible to rely solely on the latter.","[Whelan, Christopher T.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Maitre, Bertrand] Dublin Trinity Coll Dublin, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Whelan, CT (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",,,"Whelan, Christopher/0000-0002-3387-5036",,,,,31,11,11,0,12,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We develop an instrument for future changes in incarceration rates based on the theoretically predicted dynamic adjustment path of the aggregate incarceration rate in response to a shock to prison entrance or exit transition probabilities. Given that incarceration rates adjust to permanent changes in behavior with a dynamic lag, one can identify variation in incarceration rates that is not contaminated by contemporary changes in criminal behavior. For the period 1978-2004, we find crime-prison elasticities that are considerably larger than those implied by ordinary least squares estimates. We also present results for two subperiods: 1978-90 and 1991-2004. Our instrumental variables estimates for the earlier period suggest relatively large crime-prison effects.

To explain the observed spatial variation in the distance-decay of commute trips, we test for the effects of urban structure and transport supply. The results indicate that these factors are important in explaining the observed heterogeneity in the magnitude of the distance-decay gradients. We find that larger, less circular labour markets, with a less urbanized spatial structure and a greater jobs-housing imbalance are associated with a flatter distance-decay of commuting trips. Similar effects are found for labour markets with a more specialized industrial structure and greater availability of railway infrastructure.

To date, the majority of analyses of this issue have used income, education, employment situation or ethnicity as parameters for distinguishing socio-economic groups, which might be unequally affected by such emissions in their home. However, in addition to people's residential locations, their daily patterns of time use in conjunction with traffic flows can also play a major role in determining their level of exposure to transport emissions. Through analysing time use surveys from Germany and the UK to establish human daily activity patterns in terms of time spent at home, this paper shows that the parameters age and gender are at least as important in identifying groups that might be disproportionately affected by road transport emissions in their homes in urban areas as are income, education and employment situation. The paper also sets the average time use patterns of different population groups in Germany against representative traffic flows on main roads in Hamburg, Germany, to investigate how differences in time use might relate to variations in traffic patterns. The paper focuses on the residential location as the most common unit of EJ investigations and also the place, where people spend most of their time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The research was conducted with parents of elementary school students in Denver Colorado as part of a larger investigation of school travel. School-based active travel programs aim to encourage students to walk or bike to school more frequently. To that end, planning research has identified an array of factors associated with parents' decisions to drive children to school. Many findings are interpreted as 'barriers' to active travel, implying that parents have similar objectives with respect to travel mode choices and that parents respond similarly and consistently to external conditions. While the conclusions are appropriate in forecasting demand and mode share with large populations, they are generally too coarse for programs that aim to influence travel behavior with individuals and small groups. This research uses content analysis of interview transcripts to examine the contexts of factors associated with parents' mode choices for trips to and from elementary school. Short, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 65 parents from 12 Denver Public Elementary Schools that had been selected to receive 2007-08 Safe Routes to School non-infrastructure grants. Transcripts were analyzed using Nvivo 8.0 to find out how parents respond to selected factors that are often described in planning literature as 'barriers' to active travel. Two contrasting themes emerged from the analysis: barrier elimination and barrier negotiation. Regular active travel appears to diminish parents' perceptions of barriers so that negotiation becomes second nature. Findings from this study suggest that intervention should build capacity and inclination in order to increase rates of active travel. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The thesis is that the source of critical innovation relevant knowledge differs between industrial knowledge bases, making the character and the need of openness contingent on these specificities. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will observe systematic variations in how industries access and combine innovation-related external knowledge. In our analyses we attempt to address a gap in the literature by examining how industrial knowledge bases affect the recombination of knowledge by analysing the different extents, forms (formal and informal) and geography of inbound open innovation. The article illustrates that features and structures of inbound open innovation align, to a large extent, with the industries' knowledge bases and that there is a interplay between an industry's knowledge base, the internal organisation of innovation processes and the channels and geography of inbound open innovation.","[Aslesen, Heidi Wiig] Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Econ Org, Oslo, Norway; [Freel, Mark] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",BI Norwegian Business School; University of Ottawa,"Aslesen, HW (通讯作者)，Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Econ Org, Oslo, Norway.",heidi.w.aslesen@bi.no,"Freel, Mark/ABC-3583-2020; Wiig, Heidi/AAC-7683-2022","Freel, Mark/0000-0001-9849-5272; Wiig, Heidi/0000-0002-3921-2647",,,,,94,50,53,3,78,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The present investigation reconsiders the suppression hypothesis, applying the concepts of niche overlap and competitive exclusion from the literature on ethnic competition. An analysis of Census data on large northern cities offers some support for the hypothesis. The level of retail entrepreneurship of black men was negatively associated with that of white immigrant men in 1910 and 1920, implying that black retail enterprise at these time-points was discouraged by the presence of white immigrant merchants. These negative associations, though, were only moderately significant in a substantive sense, and there was no evidence that a reduction of white immigrant merchants would have produced substantial gains for blacks in the retail trade, as many black entrepreneurs and activists at the time had claimed.","Mississippi State Univ, Dept Sociol, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Boyd, RL (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Sociol, 207 Bowen Hall,Hardy Rd, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",boyd@soc.msstate.edu,"Boyd, Robert L./ABF-2610-2020","Boyd, Robert L./0000-0001-8729-7430",,,,,61,0,1,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This article presents evidence of an indirect government intervention in the Spanish movie industry. In 1999, the Spanish government mandated that operating TV networks invest 3% of their receipts on the production of movies in the Spanish language. Using a new dataset of Spanish movies produced between 2000 and 2008, this article studies the empirical relation between TV network participation on movie production and box office success. Private TV network participation (as opposed to public networks) through production (and not distribution) was found to be associated with higher box office revenues and gross profitability rates, even after controlling for movie production budgets.","[Fernandez-Blanco, Victor] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo, Spain; [Gil, Ricard] Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",University of Oviedo; Johns Hopkins University,"Fernández-Blanco, V (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo, Spain.",vfernan@uniovi.es,,"Fernandez-Blanco, Victor/0000-0003-2096-9460; Gil, Ricard/0000-0003-3627-0988",,,,,7,3,3,0,17,LAWRENCE ERLBAUM ASSOC INC-TAYLOR & FRANCIS,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT STREET, STE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0899-7764,,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

Using exploratory literature review and two case studies we attempt to shed light on the intricate link between data (resources), tools and services as seen through the prism of standards as a foundation for the development of the new informational economy. We argue that in the context of cultural heritage infirmation infrastructure, standards can be seen as enablers of different dimensions of interoperability: between reality and information system; of several information systems; of information within the information system; of the information system and user. The derived interoperability forms the foundation for creation of the maximum surplus value for heritage-aware information infrastructures. The foundation of informational infrastructure in general, and the effective work of heritage-aware informational resources in particular, requires a more elaborate understanding of standards and interoperability, which they either produce or hamper. Three main obstacles to data interoperability were identified; I) pure linguistic multilingualism, 2) cultural multilingualism and 3) historical multilingualism. This research lays foundation for the future development of systemic solutions to interoperable, consistent heritage-aware information infrastructures, arguments being provided that special attention must be paid to the development of standardized multilingual, semantic thesauri, ontologies and their introduction in heritage and humanities information systems.","[Fomin, Vladislav V.; Vitkute-Adzgauskiene, Daiva] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Appl Informat, LT-44404 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Lauzikas, Rimvydas; Vaitkevicius, Vykintas] Vilnius Univ, Fac Commun, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vilnius University,"Fomin, VV (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Appl Informat, Vileikos G 8, LT-44404 Kaunas, Lithuania.",v.fomin@if.vdu.lt; Rimvydas.Lauzikas@kf.vu.lt; Vykintas.Vaitkevicius@kf.vu.lt; d.vitkute@if.vdu.lt,"Fomin, Vladislav/CAI-5517-2022; Laužikas, Rimvydas/AAY-2276-2021","Fomin, Vladislav/0000-0001-8423-2500; Vitkute-Adzgauskiene, Daiva/0000-0001-7923-1087; Lauzikas, Rimvydas/0000-0001-9853-8738",,,,,43,2,2,1,14,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

By using longitudinal, qualitative and quantitative methods of information analysis and case studies, we were able to identify and analyse innovative business models from various European countries and to highlight their role in differentiating businesses from their competitors, while meeting the needs of different stakeholders. These social responsibility initiatives have been assessed from several perspectives: the cost-benefit perspective, as an exercise in strengthening corporate image, as a strategy to increase operational efficiency and as a competitive advantage.","[Ganescu, Mariana Cristina] Constantin Brancoveanu Univ Pitesti, Pitesti 110095, Romania",Constantin Brancoveanu University,,cristina_ganescu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,14,SOCIETAS SCIENTIARUM OLOMUCENSIS II,OLOMOUC,"KRIZKOVSKEHO 10, OLOMOUC, 77900, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87533-04-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,80,84,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BIB28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000327205300011,0

This model assumes that the data are generated by a set of underlying independent components (ICs) that capture the co-movements among the observations, which are assumed to be conditionally heteroskedastic. The GICA-GARCH model separates the estimation of the ICs from their fitting with a univariate ARMA-GARCH model. Here, we will use two ICA approaches to find the ICs: the first estimates the components, maximizing their non-Gaussianity, while the second exploits the temporal structure of the data. After estimating and identifying the common ICs, we fit a univariate GARCH model to each of them in order to estimate their univariate conditional variances. The GICA-GARCH model then provides a new framework for modelling the multivariate conditional heteroskedasticity in which we can explain and forecast the conditional covariances of the observations by modelling the univariate conditional variances of a few common ICs. We report some simulation experiments to show the ability of ICA to discover leading factors in a multivariate vector of financial data. Finally, we present an empirical application to the Madrid stock market, where we evaluate the forecasting performances of the GICA-GARCH and two additional factor GARCH models: the orthogonal GARCH and the conditionally uncorrelated components GARCH.

The development started to accelerate in a variety of branches mostly in the second half of the 20th century. In addition to innovations it was important to estimate the future development of branches and market correctly, especially in connection to current economic situation in the country and conditions in branches.

Often, other media are used to disseminate such endorsements. As a result, their impact on a consumer is likely to depend on the consumer's type and frequency of media choices-that is, his or her media portfolio. This article argues that viewers who prefer literary genre motion pictures have distinct media portfolios that make them more responsive to professional reviews. The article demonstrates this effect through an analysis of the impact of professional reviews on box office receipts for the 750 leading titles released in the United States between 2004 and 2008.","Univ Vienna, Dept Mkt, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Koschat, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Mkt, Brunnerstr 72, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",martin_koschat@hotmail.com,"Koschat, Martin A./AGY-2264-2022",,,,,,43,9,9,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

Thus, the concept of Commercial Health Insurance gradually incorporates into people's lives. More and more people choose to purchase commercial health insurance to reduce their health risks probability. But as the purchasing rate of commercial health insurance has been increased, problems ensue. Due to the fact that China is still one of the developing countries and commercial health insurance in China started relatively late, the market is not mature. Development status is far behind the developed countries, such as Europe and the U.S, On current development situation of commercial health insurance in China, the equivalent of level of 50-80s of the last century in developed countries such as Europe and the U.S. From international experience, we learn that early in the development of commercial health insurance, governments all over the world will unveil a number of policies to support its development, our country is no exception. On January 2009 Executive meeting of the State Council adopted a project on Deepening Medical Health System Reform and the Implementation of Deepening the Reform of Medical and Health in 2009-2011, which indicates that a new round of medical care reform project has been officially unveiled. New medical system reform is a indispensable foundation to reach the great goal of the right of access to basic medical health service. This dissertation discusses the background of implementation of the new medical system reform, involves contents of what opportunities and challenges Chinese commercial health insurance will encounter under the new medical system reform and how to grasp the opportunities as well as to cope with challenges in the medical system reform in such a case. Meanwhile, what we also cannot ignored is that although there are some welcomed advantages in the commercial health insurance in China, several unreasonable problems still exists due to the reason that commercial health insurance in China is still in the early stages of development. Situation of commercial health insurance in China is not optimistic. The dissertation analyses the development of commercial health insurance in China as a clue to its current situation, its advantages, problems one by one.

In this research, we have tried to facilitate this process by applying the Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) method in order to discriminate among the various management alternatives and to identify the management preferences stated by a group of key actors in decision making process: common property forest owners. Descriptive results from the BWS method show the ranking for preventive wildfire policies from the best (most preferred) to the worst (least preferred) policy among those evaluated by forest owners. However, and after employing a Latent Class Model, we find that common forest owners can be classified into two different classes, especially distant in terms of preferences toward forest management priorities. On one hand, one of the classes (containing older individuals) is more likely to prefer policies based on direct economic incentives and quicker returns, whereas a second class (younger) prefers other policies that also contain environmental and social spillovers or benefits. Thus, we find that BWS may be a very suitable method of elicitation of preferences in the context of decision making under multiple conflicting criteria.

We have chosen the human resources area for our investigation because it has gained a permanent role not only as an academic discipline, but also as an empiric theme in the development area. A term first used by Drucker in his 1959 book, Landmarks of Tomorrow: A Report on the New Post-Modern World, the knowledge worker includes people working in the information technology and communications (IT&C) fields, such as programmers, systems analysts, technical writers, academic professionals and researchers. In other words, a knowledge worker is anyone who works for a living at the tasks of developing or using knowledge (Drucker 1999). Our survey includes 217 respondents belonging to SMEs from tourism: accommodation, restaurants, passenger transports, travel agencies and cultural tourism organization. The survey was performed between September 2010 and March 2011 in different regions of Romania and Spain (Cartagena included) and confirms the research hypothesis regarding KM contribution to SMEs performance. The results of the survey suggest that tools which enable diversification of individuals' outputs should be provided to KM applied in SMEs. In addition to discussing the challenges posed to KM in general, we also approached the ways in which specific functional areas of SMEs activities can respond to these challenges, as well as discussing the implications of the managers in implementing KM Tools that have been developed in KM focused on information management do not support many of the key-knowledge work processes. Neglecting the fact that each knowledge worker develops his own subjective configuration based on past experiences, the information he has absorbed and the particular context in which he has used his skills and abilities, corporate software programs aim to level or standardize the differences between individual workers.","[Popescu, Dan; Ciocarlan-Chitucea, Alina; State, Cristina; Petrus, Catalin] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,dan.popescu@man.ase.ro,"STATE, Cristina/AHC-1283-2022; POPESCU, DAN P./J-8620-2014; State, Cristina/AAZ-2886-2021","POPESCU, DAN P./0000-0001-7164-9155; State, Cristina/0000-0002-1514-9831",,,,,21,2,2,0,21,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",,,978-606-19-0104-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,114,118,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEN34,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317437100024,0

The paper paints a background of the current business environment; it explores the macro and micro economic factors driving and inhibiting global competition, such as emerging economies, research and development costs, and time-based competition. It then introduces management practices that were, in their time, considered to be examples of business excellence. Then the major part of the paper investigates the context of 21st century business, and how companies can respond in international markets. Business excellence can be characterised as - understanding customers and markets; and knowing how to 'deliver' what is needed. The paper identifies three key areas of management, namely people and organisations, processes and relationships where attention is necessary. These are explored and developed, based on research conducted to investigate the presence and nature of business excellence in SMEs. Using examples it explores the management, operations and capabilities necessary for SMEs, when their objectives are to be successful in international markets.

One form of serial non-participation is that a varying number of respondents chooses always the zero-price or status quo alternative. The approaches used in the literature to deal with this problem vary from excluding those respondents to using applying latent class models to endogenously allow for different preference structures. However, latent class models also allow to assign respondents to a known class. In this paper we compare specifications of latent class models with and without restrictions. Additionally, we control for differences in the error variance across respondents by applying a scale-extended latent class model. The comparisons are designed to show whether respondents are allocated differently among classes and whether willingness to pay estimates are affected significantly. The data are from a choice experiment regarding management actions to enhance forest biodiversity. The data set is characterized by a high percentage of respondents who were not willing to pay: almost 50% of the respondents always chose the zero price alternative locating this sample rather at the top of the range of respondents who are not willing to pay.

I had no influence on the communication strategy respectively on other factors which influence loyalty like pricing, product or services. Findings & Practical Implications. The analysis proves the assumption that communication plays a significant role within CRM to keep customers loyal. Further on the quality of the media channels e-mail and post mail could be proven. The result is that the replacement of post mailings through e-mail communication is at least questionable. Originality/Value. The study is most likely the first analysis for the hotel business which shows the effect of guest marketing in a CRM context. The reason is that hotel companies so far had not the necessary campaign data available or the data was not linked to a central guest profile. This circumstance made it impossible to analyze the effect of communication on customer relationships.

The results indicate that consumers' quality perceptions are consistent for the two product categories. Perceived product quality may be understood as a hierarchical structure, which consists of tangible and intangible dimensions, and is fairly consistent for different products. The most abstract dimensions are reflected in more specific sub-dimensions and product attributes. For consumers, the quality of the tangible product is more important than the quality of the product intangibles in the case of wooden products. Perceived product value is determined as customers' judgement of the relationship between perceived product quality and price. It was also observed to be a two-dimensional structure with tangible and intangible dimensions. The observed dimensions of perceived product quality and value were logically linked.

These factors are divided into two large components: objective and managerial. When these factors are considered they lead managers to make positive (or negative) decisions to adopt or intensify the use of ICT. During the international financial crisis (2008-2012) both sets of factors would seem to predict that at best firms would stay static in their use and adoption of new ICT tools. To test this we surveyed 97 MBA students. Of the 97, 35 work for companies with more than 250 employees. Given that average firm size in LV is 10 employees [2], this suggests that the results are particularly applicable to the biggest firms in Latvia. The survey was in the form of a five point Likert scale. There were 4 categorical questions and a total of 41 items contained across the 4 questions. The 4 questions and contained 41 items were combined in a construct called ICT Practice Change. The items were coded for no change, some change, or significant change and compared in firms reporting high ICT use, medium use or low use. Using SPSS, an Item Response Theory model [3] was created by which to test the responses. Overall, there were no significant changes in use of ICT reported by Latvian firms. Intergroup (comparing high with medium or low for example) did show that high use groups reported significantly more changes than did low intensity use groups, but still the intensity of use did not change from 2008-2011. Generally, it can be stated that ICT use has changed very little in the time period 2008-2011. For all the variables the conclusion is that their importance was somewhat increased. This suggests that the prediction based on the model is accurate. This lends further support to the validity of the model.","[Ulmanis, Juris] Univ Latvia, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,juris.ulmanis@rbs.lv,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,738,745,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100067,0

Its main objective was to evaluate the relevance of the nature of work -basic types of work- in the formation and implementation of the design variable task specialization. As a result of developing the theoretical framework, three hypotheses were proposed that show the different relationships among these variables, tested in an empirical study. Three measurement scales were designed, and their reliability was assessed using Cronbach's Alpha. Finally, data obtained in the field activity were treated using the following statistical techniques: cluster analysis, single factor variance analysis, correlation test and regression analysis. The results confirm assumptions made in the research hypotheses regarding the type of complex work and task specialization in the organization. A main conclusion of the study is that when the complexity of the work is greater, its decomposition into multiple, highly specialized and limited tasks ceases to be significant for the organization.","[Zapata Rotundo, Gerardo J.; Canet Giner, Maria Teresa] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Direcc Empresas, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Zapata Rotundo, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Direcc Empresas, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",zapager@yahoo.com; teresa.ca-net@uv.es,"; Canet Giner, Maria Teresa/O-5253-2017","Zapata Rotundo, Gerardo Jose/0000-0001-7021-5443; Canet Giner, Maria Teresa/0000-0002-6896-3976",,,,,36,0,1,0,3,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

The theory shows that by economic growth we should mean growth in wealth, which is the social worth of an economy's entire stock of capital assets, not growth in GDP or improvements in the many ad hoc indicators of human development that have been proposed in recent years. Concurrently, the theory shows that by poverty we should mean a low level of wealth, not income, and that the distribution of well-being ought to be judged in terms of the distribution of wealth, not income or education or the many indicators that are currently in use. I show that the concept of wealth invites us to extend the notion of assets and the idea of investment well beyond conventional usage. This perspective has radical implications for the way that national accounts are prepared and interpreted. I then sketch a recent publication that has put the theory to work by studying the composition of wealth accumulation in contemporary India.","[Dasgupta, Partha] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England; [Dasgupta, Partha] Univ Cambridge St Johns Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TP, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Dasgupta, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",,,,,,,,36,32,36,2,28,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4706-2,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

This survey considers the economic dimensions of energy security and political and other noneconomic security concerns and discusses policy approaches that could enhance US energy security. A number of points emerge. First, energy security is enhanced by reducing consumption, not imports. A policy to eliminate oil imports, for example, will not enhance US energy security, whereas policies to reduce energy consumption can improve energy security. Second, energy security is distinct from considerations of energy externalities. Energy security taxes are appealing on political grounds but are more difficult to justify on economic grounds. Finally, the contrasting concerns over energy security between policy makers and economists are striking. The article notes some possible reasons for these differing views and suggests possible research opportunities in this area.","[Metcalf, Gilbert E.] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Metcalf, Gilbert E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Tufts University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Metcalf, GE (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",gmetcalf@tufts.edu,,,,,,,60,25,26,3,44,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4706-2,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

We find that access to mobile phones has generally improved agricultural market performance at the macro level; however, impacts at the micro level are mixed. Evidence regarding the impact of market information systems (MIS) delivered through mobile phones on farm prices and income is limited, but the evidence points to strong, heterogeneous impacts.

Significant emission transfers from developing countries to developed countries in the form of emissions embodied in trade have been interpreted as an indication of such leakage. To reduce leakage and provide an appropriate picture of countries' responsibility for global emissions, an alternative proposal is to attribute emissions on the basis of consumption instead of production. However, as one unit of imported emissions generally cannot be equated with a corresponding increase in emissions released to the atmosphere, putting a price on emissions embodied in imports equal to the social cost of these emissions (e.g., by means of consumption-based emission pricing) is not an optimal policy. Hence, one should consider a broad scope of trade measures to reduce leakage, focusing on a few highly traded, emission-intensive industries. Finally, the optimal policy portfolio to address leakage may also contain free allocation of emission permits and sectoral approaches.","[Jakob, Michael; Steckel, Jan Christoph; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Jakob, Michael; Steckel, Jan Christoph; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Steckel, Jan Christoph; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Jakob, M (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",jakob@mcc-berlin.net,"Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208; Steckel, Jan Christoph/0000-0002-5325-9214",,,,,116,72,72,4,71,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4706-2,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The core of this policy has been very simple: Act responsibly, design policy for the long run, and accumulate enough fiscal space so that fiscal policy can play a stabilizing role in the short run. The approach implies saving during periods of high copper prices and using those accumulated resources during a global economic crisis. Shifting from a procyclical to a mildly countercyclical fiscal stance has helped to smooth public investment and social expenditures across the cycle. One example of this countercyclical policy was Chile's reaction to the 2008-2009 world financial crisis. Thus, this article argues that Chile's approach contains ideas and practices that may be useful in the design of fiscal policies and institutions in other commodity-producing nations.","[Cespedes, Luis Felipe; Parrado, Eric] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Business, Santiago, Chile; [Velasco, Andres] Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Velasco, Andres] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX1 4JJ, England; [Velasco, Andres] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Columbia University; University of Oxford; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Parrado, E (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Business, Santiago, Chile.",lfcespedes@uai.cl; eric.parrado@uai.cl; av278@columbia.edu,"velasco, andres/HTT-4902-2023",,,,,,52,4,5,0,29,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4706-2,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The conclusion that liberalization generally boosts income and thus reduces poverty has not changed; some authors suggest that this finding is not true for very poor countries, but this suggestion is far from proven at present. With regard to microeconomics, recent literature again confirms that liberalization has very heterogeneous effects on poor households, depending, inter alia, on what trade policies are liberalized and how the household earns its living. Working in the export sector predicts gains, and working in the import-competing sector predicts losses, a finding that is reinforced by studies of the effects of liberalization on wages. New research has suggested several ways in which intrasectoral wage inequality is increased by trade, but this research generally does not indicate that the poor actually lose. A fairly common finding is that female workers gain from trade liberalization.","[Winters, L. Alan; Martuscelli, Antonio] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Winters, L.

This architecture sits in sharp contrast to the integrated global trading architecture envisioned 15 years ago by the designers of the Kyoto Protocol and raises a suite of new questions.

As the empirical and theoretical models used by economists have evolved, so has our understanding of the determinants of oil price shocks and of the interaction between oil markets and the global economy. Some of the key insights are that the real price of oil is endogenous with respect to economic fundamentals and that oil price shocks do not occur ceteris paribus. As a result, one must explicitly account for the demand and supply shocks underlying oil price shocks when studying their transmission to the domestic economy. Disentangling cause and effect in the relationship between oil prices and the economy requires structural models of the global economy including the oil market.","Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kilian, L (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lkilian@umich.edu,,,,,,,71,156,156,3,55,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4706-2,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

We review work that contributes to a more complete analysis of the relative merits of mandatory and voluntary labeling; that assesses the distribution of welfare effects across affected groups; and that discusses political economy issues, particularly in the context of voluntary labels in international trade.

We introduce the sources of demand for certification and supply chain standards and the political and economic context in which they have expanded since the 1990s. We explore how various agrifood certification and supply chain standards have been used to achieve changes in production methods and/or in product attributes to meet social goals, and we discuss the prospects for applying these models to commodity crops. We conclude that the nature of corn and soybean production, distribution, and consumption-with numerous sales outlets and invisible consumption as part of processed foods and other products-makes certification schemes to limit agricultural pollution unrealistic and supply chain standards extremely challenging.","[Waldman, Kurt B.; Kerr, John M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Waldman, KB (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jkerr@anr.msu.edu,,"Waldman, Kurt/0000-0002-9643-8378",,,,,78,39,47,2,32,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4706-2,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

A common policy approach has been to partially insulate their domestic market from international food price fluctuations by varying restrictions on their imports or exports. Unfortunately, such domestic stabilization measures amplify international price fluctuations. This article explains conceptually, and illustrates empirically, how insulation measures do little to advance national food security and collectively imperil global food security. Many countries also intervene to alter the trend level of domestic farm product prices, again most commonly with the use of trade restrictions. The latter policies have the unintended consequence of thinning international food markets, adding to their volatility. The article concludes by pointing to alternative ways for governments to boost food security for vulnerable households; such alternatives have become far more feasible in recent times, thanks to the information and communication technology revolution.","[Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",University of Adelaide; Australian National University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,39,1,1,2,45,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4706-2,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Second, we discuss the use of experimental laboratories to testbed market solutions to issues in environmental policy. We concentrate on experiments with one- and two-sided markets and on applications in the domains of water allocation and tradable permit systems.","[Noussair, Charles N.; van Soest, Daan P.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Noussair, Charles N.; van Soest, Daan P.] Tilburg Univ, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Soest, Daan P.] Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Noussair, CN (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",c.n.noussair@uvt.nl,"van Soest, Daan P/C-5544-2013","van Soest, Daan P/0000-0002-3100-1810",,,,,108,10,11,2,43,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4706-2,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The aim of this paper is to study achieving efficiency and equity in sugar factories and sugar-cropping patterns in Upper and Middle Egypt by focusing on the Strategic Water Shortage Preparedness Plan, introduction methodologies, and specific action to fight drought within the general water-planning framework. The Linear Programming Model was applied to calculate the sugar crops, sugar cane and sugar beet acreage, production, and income of both Upper and Middle Egypt. As a result of an optimal cropping pattern, the cultivation season would lose acreage by 7.260%, farm income increase by 1.774%, water uses decrease by 18.511%, and CO2 emission and energy reduced by 14.96%. Overall, as a result of an optimal sugar-cropping pattern, Egyptian sugar exports would decrease by $130.086 million US.

To identify these effects, a probit model is specified and estimated, which allows the calculation of the probability that the private label product is chosen conditional on a set of explanatory variables. Attention is centered on American processed cheese transactions. The source of the data is ACNielsen Homescan Panel of U. S. households for calendar years 2005 and 2006. Retail promotion using store coupons had a significant negative effect on the decision to purchase private label products. In our sample, store coupons were used to purchase both private label products and national brands. A strong negative relationship was found between national brand manufacturer couponing activity and the decision to purchase private label products. Therefore, national brand couponing appears to be an effective strategy for manufacturers to deter private label growth, at least in the processed cheese market. This analysis also shows that the decision of purchasing a private label cheese product is influenced by several sociodemographic characteristics of the household, namely household income and size, age and education of the household head, race, ethnicity, and location.

In this article, the authors inform the discussion on the issue of price competition through analysis of the interaction in the pricing behavior for fresh produce of two leading UK supermarkets, Tesco and Sainsbury's, over a 10-year period with the purpose of improving understanding of how they compete and the possible policy implications. Of particular interest is whether the nature of the interaction in pricing behavior between the two retailers changed as they moved from a situation where they had relatively similar market shares to one where Tesco became the dominant force in retailing in the UK. Through the literature possible price-leadership models are investigated and their empirical characteristics identified. The empirical analysis consisted of the investigation of price leadership using Granger causality tests on the series. In addition, due to the nature of the findings, interrelationships between the supermarket prices were modelled by means of vector autoregressive models for each product and the simulation of interactions between retailers using impulse-response functions. Though no clear evidence of systematic price leadership from Tesco to Sainsbury's was found, the results point to a strengthening interrelationship between the pricing of the two supermarkets over the period for a number of the products examined, which may be a result of the increased use of price checking across supermarket chains as a competitive tool.

It is known that feeding apple pomace to food-producing animals contributes to the functions of their digestive system and increases the level of their productivity. Currently in Latvia, there are only a few studies on the efficiency of use of apple pomace as a feed rich in fibres and natural bioactive substances in livestock farming. Accordingly, the research aim is to determine the efficiency of use of apple pomace in the red deer feed ration in a winter period. The research found that it was efficient to use apple pomace as a valuable source of natural vitamins and minerals available in Latvia in the nutrition of red deer, thus, turning apple pomace into a valuable raw material for the production of high-quality and healthy meat. The daily consumption of feed per red deer in the experimental group amounted to 8.5 kg, i.e. 0.5 kg or 6.25% less than that of feed per red deer in the control group, while the cost of feed for the experimental group decreased by 1.5%. The carcass weight (by 2.49 kg or 4.07% on average) and the amount of muscle tissue (by 8.06%; p<0.05) in the experimental group were greater than in the control group.

Different regions of the country are able to supply a variety of agricultural products due to the wide-range of climate conditions and high land quality. Also, the majority of the water resources in the region are located within the country. Hence, with the implementation of the effective agricultural policies, agricultural products can be significantly increased in terms of quality and quantity. In this context, this study investigates findings from an explanatory study of dried fruit production and exports to improve SMEs' competitiveness in the agriproduct export business. Turkey reported a trade deficit equivalent to USD 7533 million in November of 2011, and this shortfall is becoming more threatening day by day. Because Turkey has a comparative advantage in the dried food industry, it would be valuable to conduct a study to present a management decision tool to determine which factors are more important and to identify the weights that are most significant for dried fruit exporters. The analytical network process (ANP) method was selected to solve the problem because it has been successfully used to evaluate the factors when interdependency exists in between the decision criteria.

The legislation regulating federal marketing orders in the United States allows these producer organizations to propose minimum quality standards (MQS) on domestic production, as well as imports, raising the possibility of using MQS as a nontariff trade barrier (NTB). Industry proposals, however, are subject to approval by the federal government. This paper presents an analytical model that examines domestic producers' incentives and opportunities to use MQS as a NTB and government's incentives to approve or reject such regulations. In the first empirical investigation of the hypothesis that MQS act as NTB, a modified gravity equation model is used to examine the impacts of MQS on imports into the U. S. Results provide little support for the claims that MQS are acting as NTB. [JEL Codes: Q18, F13].

However, most of the studies were conducted several years ago. In the meantime the organic market has matured. Consequently, results in literature need to be reviewed. This study specifically addresses own-price elasticity estimates for organic and conventional milk. The analysis is based on a household panel dataset of 20,000 German households. A two-step estimation procedure is applied. First, a probit regression examines which household characteristics affect the probability of buying organic milk. Second, a linear approximated almost ideal demand system provides detailed demand elasticity estimates. By using up-to-date data, distinguishing between different consumer groups, incorporating sociodemographic information and relying on a considerably large sample size this study is both an update and a refinement of previous research. In contrast to previous studies, econometric results suggest that demand for organic milk is absolutely price-inelastic in Germany. However, price responsiveness differs substantially between milk types and consumer groups. (EconLit classifications: C33, C34, D12).

However, besides the rationale of ethnocentrism or the desire to support domestic farmers, the underlying motivation for such behavior is not well understood. This study assesses consumers' preferences for imported and domestic beef through a choice experiment. We found that willingness to pay for country-of-origin labeled imported beefsteak is associated with (a) consumers' perceptions of the categorical risk from consuming beef, (b) consumers' risk aversion to risks from beef consumption, and (c) consumers' perceptions of the food-safety level of imported beef. Results from this study suggest that the advantage of domestic beef over imported beef can be partly explained by consumers' risk handling behavior. [EconLit citations: Q130].

The authors analyze how market stresses induced by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) recalls and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) outbreaks affect price spreads and the extent of price transmission at the slaughter-to-wholesale and wholesale-to-retail levels. They use monthly national data for the period 1986-2008, which includes records of FSIS recalls of varying severity and BSE events in the United States and Canada. The authors account for immediate and delayed effects of food scares and for potential cross effects across industries and countries. The results indicate that beef and food recalls do not affect their corresponding price margins and overall food safety incidents have minor cross-industry and cross-country effects. However, BSE discoveries in the United States considerably affect marketing margins in the beef industry, particularly at the wholesale-to-retail level. Interestingly, subsequent discoveries had smaller impacts on price margins. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy outbreaks also appear to affect the extent of price transmission between wholesalers and retailers.

The present study showed that decreased support for flax cultivation, insufficient quality of raised flax stalks, lower prices of foreign suppliers, and lack of advanced technology were the main reasons which influenced the decline of Lithuania's flax industry after 2004.

Empirical applications for the U.S. pork-meat and broiler-composite chains illustrate the convenience of the method and reveal that in the pork chain asymmetric price transmission enables retailers (wholesalers) to increase their marketing margin vis-a-vis the wholesalers (farmers), whereas in the broiler sector the retailers face both temporary decreases and increases in their marketing margin as a consequence of asymmetric wholesale-retail price transmission.

Although there has been some theoretical discussion about this issue, no empirical research has been done on these costs; the present study aims to bridge this gap. Following the literature, the main source of democratic costs in agricultural cooperatives is the level of member participation in cooperative governance. We have developed more specific theoretical insights about this special kind of decision-making cost by showing the effect of differences in the level of member participation on democratic costs, differences in terms of democratic and influence costs and in terms of agency costs, and differences between both direct and opportunity democratic costs. Members should take both the relative direct and opportunity costs within total democratic costs into account when determining the optimal size and composition of their board.

By using WTP from an experiment, surpluses for consumers choosing between the usual and new products are inferred and lead to an estimated demand for the new product. From this demand, the author shows how to estimate the ex ante price of the new product along with the ex ante level of advertising selected by one firm for informing consumers. The socially optimal level of advertising maximizing the welfare is also determined. The previous methodology is applied to two experiments with food. For a same-advertising formula regarding information diffusion to consumers, the estimated levels of advertising highly differ between these two experiments because of different WTP variations linked to the new product.

Gala apples are one of the cultivars that have gained ground in popularity. In this article, the authors compare how internal fruit qualities affect consumers' willingness to pay for apples and whether these effects differ across these two cultivars. Consumers are willing to pay more for firmness for both cultivars, with a larger effect for Red Delicious. Using consumer assessments of sweetness acceptability, consumers are willing to pay a positive amount for both cultivars, but the effect of sweetness is higher for Gala apples. The only significant ethnicity variable is being Hispanic, which is associated with lower willingness to pay for Gala and higher willingness to pay for Red Delicious. One possible explanation is that the Hispanic consumers may have stronger food traditions associated with Red Delicious.

The results indicate that the RTEC manufacturers have the pricing decisions and that the retailers do not intervene in setting the retail prices for breakfast cereal brands.

This study examines how the institutional, group, and management characteristics of these farmer companies affect their performance. Theories about causal relationships are tested using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. The results indicate that farmer companies perform better when shares are tradable between members, and patrons pay and receive market-related prices for their inputs and products. All directors should be nominated by shareholders and voting should be conducted by secret ballot. To strengthen accountability, the right to hire and fire executive managers should vest with the board of directors and should not be appropriated by government agencies that facilitate these companies. Although directors and managers should monitor shareholder views, they must take policy and strategic decisions themselves as failure to centralize decision-making results in severe influence problems. Farmer company performance is compromised by the absence of well-defined and regularly observed processes to develop and implement strategies, and by inadequate or inappropriate management skills. These management problems may diminish if government facilitators had a clear exit plan from the time the company is established as this would help to focus their attention on the critical task of empowering farmer shareholders to direct and administer their company.

In each of these models, we describe the allocation of formal control rights with a focus on decision management and decision control rights. We thus provide empirical evidence on the separation of ownership and control in agricultural cooperatives. We also analyze each of the governance models in terms of the associated ownership costs, including risk-bearing costs, the costs of controlling managers, and collective decision-making costs.

A simulation experiment based on data of the Dutch ware potato sector illustrates how price transmission may become imperfect and asymmetric as a consequence of retailer oligopsony power in the sense that farm price decreases are only partially passed on to consumers whereas farm price increases are more than fully transmitted. Oligopoly power by farmers to level their bargaining power vis-a-vis the retailers may even make the degree of price transmission worse. [EconLit classification: D430, L130; Q110].

In response to intensifying competition, the industry has introduced new apple varieties that are more desirable to consumers in terms of eating quality and improve growers profitability. British Columbia (BC) apple sales data were employed to examine the implicit value of apple attributes for apples sold in several metropolitan areas of western Canada (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, and Winnipeg). Linear hedonic price functions were estimated to determine price premiums paid for newer varieties, higher grades, and larger fruit size. In addition, the price effects of cold storage and seasonality were considered because of their association with apple quality. Wholesale prices were significantly influenced by apple fruits of newer varieties, grades, fruit sizes, and metropolitan area. Wholesalers also distinguished between Canadian and BC grades of different varieties.

However, fostering acceptance of new stipulations (e.g., volume control, pricing systems) requires that the attitudes of farmers be taken into consideration. Thus, in this article, the authors analyze how dairy farmers attitudes vary towards both contracting in general and specific contract attributes. Using a survey of 161 dairy farm managers, the research question is addressed by means of a latent class cluster analysis. Three clusters are identified. Their attitudes are heterogeneous, ranging from suppliers who are clearly convinced of the value of contractual relationships to farmers who reject contracts explicitly. Results may be utilized to match the preferences of farmers regarding contracts with modified dairy marketing contracts.

The Chinese market price of cotton decreased, imports increased, and domestic production declined. Furthermore, subsequent adjustments of the SSD system increased market access for cotton, which benefitted China cotton processors.

This paper aims at evaluating the relationship between marketing capabilities and a firm's price-making ability. A survey was conducted based on a sample of 371 food SMEs in the EU. We applied an Ordinal Regression Model to evaluate the determinants of a firm's price-making ability. The analysis results revealed a certain ability of SMEs to set prices. Market analysis and marketing strategy planning capabilities are positively related to the price-making ability of a firm, while firm size is not.

The finding that generalized trust (measured by trust in strangers and past trusting behavior) also affects consumers' choices of GM food, suggests that some concerns about GM-derived food are related to an individual's worldview and may be beyond the control of the food system.

Our empirical findings suggest that for the three categories of milk products under examination, price elasticities in discount stores are generally higher. Beyond that, demand reactions in supermarkets with respect to price changes in discounters differ from the reverse case, i.e., from demand reactions in discounters when supermarket prices are changed.

In this context, how can both types of commitment be strengthened? This study decomposes the membercooperative relationship into four organizational mechanismsmarket, hierarchy, community and democracy, which all play a role in generating commitment. Data originate from 148 farmers, all members of the same agricultural cooperative in Brazil. The results suggest first, that it is possible to disentangle commitment to collective action from commitment to a customer-oriented strategy.

First, comparative static analyses were conducted on the newly developed optimal advertising intensity formula. Second, to consider the endogenous nature of optimal advertising, a linear market equilibrium model was developed and applied to the U.S. beef industry. Results showed that the full consideration of retailer-processor bilateral market power lowered the optimal values of assessment rates, advertising expenditures, and advertising intensity for the checkoff board whereas consideration of importers increases the optimal values. The results indicate that ignoring the import sector in optimal generic advertising modeling should underestimate these optimal values, whereas ignoring the bilateral market power between processors and retailers overestimates the values.

The Heckman maximum likelihood procedure with fixed effects was used to explore the role of income in explaining bilateral trade flows. The study finds that income but not income distribution is an important determinant of food products trade and the hypothesis that income does not influence food and beverage product trade is consistently rejected. For most of the food products, the empirical results reject the proposition that income elasticities are the same across the development spectrum. The assumption of homothetic preferences (expenditure elasticities equal to one) was most consistently rejected for middle-income countries, but rarely rejected for lower- and high-income countries. The results suggest that income plays an important role in food trade, and middle-income countries are the growth markets of the future.

The objective of the study was to evaluate and determine the cigarette consumption responsiveness of these household groups to expenditure changes, tax reforms, and other factors. Taking into account the short-term adjustment processes and long-term equilibrium, the authors adopt an error correction model as the analytic framework, where they estimate long- and short-term expenditure elasticities, tax effects, regional effects, and demographic effects. The estimation results show cigarette demand to be highly inelastic to expenditure changes in both household groups, both in the long- and short-term, confirming the findings of previous research.

The purpose of this study was to apply the means-end-chain framework to build a model for the different motivations that consumers would have in favor of organic cotton products in Taiwan. Three hierarchical levels of means-end were included in the framework for organic cotton products: product attributes, consequences of using products possessing certain attributes, and fulfillment of personal values achieved through positive consequences after using the organic product possessing certain attributes. A survey questionnaire was designed based on product attributes and consequences identified from the Kahle, Beatty, and Homer's List of Values (LOVs; 1986) for respondents to rate their importance on a 5-point Likert scale. The LOVs included nine values of common purchasing motivations, such as sense of belonging, excitement, and warm relationship with others, etc. For the 399 usable cases, fuzzy logic association mining rules were applied. The findings indicated that there were four significant routes by which respondents could achieve the personal value of security. However, knowing respondents' personal value of security as the ultimate motivation for favoring organic cotton is only part of the picture. Only through a full understanding of different paths that lead to security can firms effectively design communication strategies to reach potential consumers.

The aim of the present study is to clarify these two motivations' relative contributions to product demand by considering consumer reference points, that is preferences for remaining at present consumption and price levels. A stated-preference method is applied to the Japanese demand for bread from local wheat. We find that Japanese consumers pay a significant premium for local wheat bread and that more than half the observed demand variation is explained by a product's quasipublic nature. In contrast, reference-point effects suggest that those who frequently buy local food have a negative willingness-to-pay for imported or nonlocal-domestic breads. Appealing to local food-buyers' preferences for a local source and for environmental quality thus appears to be the most effective way of promoting local wheat bread.

Business micro-data were obtained from the Survey on Innovation in the Food Processing Industry in 2004 (n = 809). A higher Canadian dollar against the U. S. dollar was judged to be the most severe of the 10 impediments to the ability of Canadian food processors to compete. Two broader categories of the 10 impediments emerged from a principal component analysis. One category of the impediments relates to private and public standards, while the other relates to vertical and horizontal market power issues. The severity of these impediments is not significantly different among the different size classes of food processors. Subsequent clustering procedures based on these impediments found that the food processors in one cluster were more constrained by all these impediments than their counterparts in the other cluster. Establishment characteristics, such as food subsector classification, and firm strategies, such as export orientation and engagement in R&D activities, were systematically associated with a firm's likelihood of being in the cluster that perceived the impediments to be more severe. Exporting firms are more likely than other firms to perceive each one of the impediments as a constraint. [EconLit Subject Matter Areas: D220; L200; L660].

To achieve the aim, the following research tasks were set: to develop and describe a simulation model for the fermentation of a substrate for biogas production; and to identify an optimal substrate mixture for biogas production. It is necessary to examine several factors for the choice of a biogas substrate. If calculations are based on the energy potentials of substrates and their cost, an optimal substrate consists of a mixture of silage (22%) and manure (78%).

The research was conducted using both an opinion poll and participant observation among 297 randomly selected respondents. In Poland, organic farming has been developing rapidly in the recent years. The number of both producers of food raw materials, along with the acreage of agricultural area, and of processing plants has been on the increase. Moreover, groups of producers of organic food raw materials are being established. However, commodity production falls behind, and the market for organic foodstuffs is developing slowly. The main factor affecting organic farming is the agro-environment payment scheme. It has been demonstrated that the process of horizontal integration in organic farming also has an important role, since, according to the research, in the opinion of organic farm owners, such a measure is an important factor for organisation of the market for both organic food raw materials and organic food products. It contributes to the concentration of supply, which allows increasing the economic effectiveness of farms owned by members of producer groups through higher selling prices as well as lower prices of the purchase of means of production. At the same time, it allows reducing the prices being offered to consumers. On the contrary, forming associations entails certain limitations which may restrain activities being undertaken by producer groups.","[Pawlewicz, Adam] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Agribusiness & Environm Econ, Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,,adampawl@uwm.edu.pl,"Pawlewicz, Adam/H-2373-2019","Pawlewicz, Adam/0000-0002-7381-0536",,,,,11,7,7,0,9,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9934-8466-1-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,34,,,,,112,120,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347131900012,0

In 2012, the trading volume of corn futures was 37 million contracts (or 378 million metric tons). The relationship between Chinese corn futures and spot prices is studied to gauge the price discovery process. Formal statistical tests are conducted based on Johansen's co-integration, Granger causality and the Garbade-Silber approach for the corn spot prices and futures prices. All empirical analysis is also performed for GMO and non-GMO soybeans to provide a contrast with the corn futures market. The results suggest that Chinese corn futures prices guide the spot prices; that is, the corn futures market can serve as legitimate guide for future cash prices. This conclusion is valid for GMO futures market, but is not found to be the case for non-GMO soybeans, where spot prices guide futures prices. [EconLit citations: Q13, Q14].

Survival functions, transition probability matrices, and dynamic discrete choice panel data models are combined to measure persistence. The results suggest that in the food industry the persistence of process innovation is higher than in product innovation. Environmental and market determinants such as market changes or appropriability are more decisive to explain innovation in food industry. By contrast, several determinant variables for innovation activities in the manufacturing sector seem not to be linked with the innovation in food firms. That is the case of the outsourcing ratio and the positive evolution of market share of the individual firm.

The unique features of the dataset allow us to study the price formation in the different market segments. The analysis shows that in the large-scale retail trade consumers value most what is written on the label, but only if it is a verifiable characteristic; label characteristics are also important in wine shops, but a selection process exists to enter this market. Finally, selling wine via both channels appears to be a winning strategy: it allows the price to be increased in the large-scale retail trade, but it does not reduce the price in wine shops.

Using data from the Canadian chicken industry, a flexible non-linear inference framework detects significant non-linearities in the relationship between farm and wholesale prices. An empirical model is proposed to estimate a price transmission elasticity and a target inventory equation in the spirit of linear-quadratic inventory models in the macroeconomics literature. A generalized method of moments estimator measures the impact of inventories on price transmission and accounts for the potential correlation between sales and wholesale prices. The price transmission elasticity is lower (higher) when inventories are above (below) the target level.","[Abbassi, Abdessalem] Fac Sci Econ & Gest Nabeul, Tunis, Tunisia; [Tamini, Lota D.] Univ Laval, Dept Agr Econ & Consumer Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Tamini, Lota D.] Univ Laval, CREATE, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Gervais, Jean-Philippe] Farm Credit Canada, Quebec City, PQ G6V 0B7, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Abbassi, A (通讯作者)，Fac Sci Econ & Gest Nabeul, Tunis, Tunisia.",abbassi.abdessalem@gmail.com; lota.tamini@eac.ulaval.ca; jp.gervais@fcc-fac.ca,,"abbassi, abdessalem/0000-0003-1863-3044; Tamini, Lota D./0000-0003-3423-3155",,,,,48,6,8,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,SPR,2012,28.0,2,,,,,173,186,,10.1002/agr.21292,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,927KE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302905300006,0

We derive superelasticity analytic formulations for logit and random coefficient logit (RCL) demand models that can be used to shed light on firm incentives to alter price, firm cost pass-through, and market power potential. We use the RCL superelasticities that are obtained via simulated generalized method of moments (GMM) to examine retail market power potential in regards to the marketing of national and store-brand milk in the U.S. Our findings show that elasticity of demand rises in price for both brands, with elasticity for store brand milk lagging behind that for national brand in magnitude. Similarly, elasticities for national brands tend to decrease faster when prices are on the decline. Such a condition suggests that retailers can identify a pricing position, possibly in relation to national brand prices, at which there is a low incentive to increase or reduce store brand prices.

This paper looks at this new perspective in value creation where personalized consumer experience takes central stage as opposed to a product and firm-centric view. Through an explorative case study, the paper illustrates how a joint innovation effort between Molson Coors Brewing Company UK (MCBC-UK) and a supplier is leading to more open approaches as consumers are involved in the process. By understanding what consumers' value and engaging in active dialog and interaction, MCBC-UK has been able to develop superior value propositions relevant to their target consumer base. The case underscores the role of consumer value creation in a commoditizing world where companies can seek to maximize the lifetime value of desirable consumer segments by taking consumers as a partner or co-producer instead of an external element. Food and drink companies have the opportunity to add value and extricate themselves from commodity sectors where the lowest cost provider holds sway by embracing consumers' ideas as part of the innovation process.","Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7PE, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Martinez, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7PE, Kent, England.",m.garcia@kent.ac.uk,,,,,,,85,30,39,2,120,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,SPR,2014,30.0,2,,,,,132,147,,10.1002/agr.21347,0.0,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,AF4PF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000334695300003,0

It is claimed that the problems are due to the members having increasingly little trust in the cooperatives and in each other. The cooperatives decision makers have no instruments for estimating how much social capital is lost when they pursue strategies of vertical and horizontal integration. Therefore, they do not consider this loss in their calculations. Thus, the problems caused by the cooperatives vaguely defined property rights are becoming increasingly serious.

However, the performance of the small farms has significantly increased working with the support. Taking into account the significant role of small farms in the population density of the rural areas of Latvia, this situation is closely linked with attaining the overall goal of the rural development of Latvia.

The double bootstrap method was employed to estimate the efficiency scores by the means of the data envelopment analysis and to regress them on the explanatory variables.

Specifically, the second stage analysis included the variables of time, farm size, asset input, specialisation, and subsidy rate.

The assessment procedure introduces a new financial decision-aid approach, which is based on data-analysis techniques in combination with a preference ranking organization method of enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE II). The application of this multicriteria decision-aid approach allows the rank ordering of cooperatives based on the most prominent financial ratios. The financial ratios were selected using principal component analysis. This analytical procedure reduces the dimensionality of large numbers of interrelated financial performance measures. We assess the financial success of Dutch agribusiness cooperatives for the period 19992010. Results show that there is no clear-cut evidence that cooperative models used to attract extra members investments and/or outside equity perform better than the more traditional models.

The first break coincides with the second oil crisis. The second break marks the end of the agricultural export subsidy war between the European Union and the United States in the second half of 1980s; the third one occurred at the beginning of the ethanol boom at the very end of the 1990s. The relationship between corn and oil prices tends to be stronger when oil prices are highly volatile and when agricultural policies create less distortion. The ethanol boom strengthened the relation between corn and oil prices, which are cointegrated only in the fourth and last regime. Impulse response functions confirm that corn prices systematically respond to oil price shocks, but the converse is not observed.

This article tests whether a large portfolio of products is beneficial to producers by observing UK consumer response to price promotions. The article shows that discounts induce mainly segment switching (74% of the total impact), with a limited effect on stockpiling (26%) and no impact on purchase incidence. Consequently, consumers prefer to follow the discount rather than purchase multiple units of the same wine. This result seems to explain the current structure of the market, and suggests that discounts may conflict with segment loyalty, a situation that disfavors producers, particularly in very populated segments. Results also casts doubts on the economic sustainability of competition based on an intense product differentiation in the wine sector. [EconLit Citations: C010, D120, M310].

Small dairy producers have expressed concerns about the competitiveness of the dairy supply chain, arguing that price changes are not being transmitted efficiently from wholesalers to producer at the farm gate level. In this context, this study examines the degree of vertical price transmission between wholesalers and small dairy producers to assess the efficiency level of the dairy market chain in Panama. The findings of this research provide original and important contributions to the policy dialogue uncovering two key issues: 1) a unidirectional transmission of milk prices from producers to wholesaler, and 2) that the transmission of milk prices is asymmetric depending on whether prices are increasing or decreasing.

The empirical data originates from a survey with suppliers of Swedish Meats, a cooperative that used to dominate the Swedish meat sector. However, it lost the cooperative elements as external investors got a share of the ownership in 2007. Results indicate that the importance of typical drivers of perceived transaction costs are not homogeneously distributed. A subgroup of respondents still considers the former cooperative as a safe and trustworthy partner with reliable market information. Successful, entrepreneurial farmers instead perceive higher transaction costs when dealing with the hybrid cooperative. Geographical location and neighboring networks are insignificant.

Data on expected prices for goats transacted were collected from 280 goat producers from Baghlan and Nangarhar provinces, along with information on factors anticipated to influence the price expectation from May 2008 to April 2009. A price expectation model was built and analyzed using a general linear model. Results indicated that goat producers adjusted expected prices for marketing day (Saturday and Thursday), location of sales (district and provincial markets), live weight, and goat producers' market network. However, goat producers did not expect a premium for goat attributes like breed and age. The implications of the study are that goat producers can expect more when they plan their goat sales based on live weight, market day, marketing place and sex of goat.

Although most analyses treat consumers' attitudes and willingness to pay as separate issues, we introduce the idea of prior purchase intention to analyze these two issues as a whole. To achieve this purpose, a modeling technique invoking the multinomial logistic model and the accelerated failure time model is presented. Based on the data collected from an essential double-bounded design, our empirical results suggest that Taiwanese consumers are willing to pay a premium of about 11 NT dollars (7% of the given average market price of 150 NT dollars for the non-GM salmon) to avoid GM-soybean-fed salmon. In addition, the results of this study provide evidence that our stated-preference double-bounded design has a better-off statistical efficiency than the single-bounded one.

This rule established that retail prices of fluid milk products higher than 200% of the Class I milk prices were unconscionably excessive. There is empirical evidence suggesting that supermarket whole milk pricing strategies and the nature of Class I milk price transmission tend to be different in the law period as compared to the period prior to the MPGL enforcement. During the pre-law period, supermarkets used retail price stabilization practice characterized by an incomplete and asymmetric price transmission. During the law period, supermarkets used marketing margin stabilization practice characterized by more than a complete and a much more symmetric price transmission. The institutional environment affected by the interaction of the analyzed regulatory mechanism and the changes taking place in the economic environment (increasing Class I milk price volatility and increasing concentration in the fluid milk processing and supermarket retailing) was likely to cause the observed changes in the supermarket whole milk pricing strategy and Class I milk price transmission process.

The period of 2007-2012 was chosen and chiefly data on declared utilised agricultural area on municipal and region level from the Rural Support Service were used for assessment of land use changes. In Latvia, utilised agricultural areas (UAA), which is mainly used for bioenergy feedstocks production - rape and maize for silage - are located in the territories/regions (Zemgale and Kurzeme) with the highest proportion of agricultural lands and the highest soil fertility. The growing trends in these regions are statistically significant. The biogas plants are also located in these territories. Meanwhile, slight but decreasing tendency of the share of unused UAA in all regions, except Latgale, was observed. Moreover, the share in Latgale, the most undeveloped region, increases and reached 18% in 2012. The observed changes in land use in Latvia show some contradictions to bioenergy policy which is oriented to: returning the unused agricultural land in the production of feedstock; improving the quality of the environment, particularly, biodiversity and the landscape; and encouraging rural development.","[Melece, Ligita] Latvian State Inst Agr Econ, Dept Qual & Environm, Riga, Latvia; [Lakovskis, Peteris] Latvian State Inst Agr Econ, Dept Rural Dev Evaluat, Riga, Latvia",,,ligita.melece@lvaei.lv,"Melece, Ligita/AAZ-6705-2020; Lakovskis, Peteris/AAJ-2386-2021","Melece, Ligita/0000-0002-3120-3711; Lakovskis, Peteris/0000-0002-0965-6220",,,,,34,2,2,0,2,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9934-8466-1-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,34,,,,,180,188,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347131900020,0

This is highly unlikely given that the responsiveness of trade to exchange rate fluctuations could depend on the biological, marketing, and economic factors specific to a commodity. Consequently, we focused solely on broilers for this analysis, which is a leading sector in global meat trade. Using a gravity model, we assessed how two measures of exchange rate volatility (short- and long-run) affect cross-partner broiler trade. Our results indicated that long-run exchange rate volatility has a negative and significant effect on broiler trade, albeit small when compared to the effects of population, regionalization, and sharing a common border; the short-run effect of exchange rate volatility was insignificant. Overall, results suggest that exchange rate volatility has little or no effect on bilateral broiler trade. [EconLit citations: C32, F14, Q17].

This study analyzes the demand for both conventional and functional alternatives sold in the Italian yogurt market using a scanner database of yogurt sales and a discrete choice (nested-logit) demand model, assessing also the role of health-related demographic characteristics as potential contributors to the market success of functional yogurts. The results show that, in the category analyzed, high prices deter the market success of some functional alternatives; this does not apply to drinkable ones, whose demand shows lower own-price and larger cross-price elasticities compared to the other functional alternatives.

In particular, an aging, increasingly health-conscious population is likely to provide fertile ground for the success of functional yogurts in this market.

Organic prices were found to behave like pure jump processes rather than diffusions. A simple specification for pure jump processes is introduced and used with Monte Carlo methods to compute appropriate critical values for unit-root and cointegration tests. The findings indicate that no long-run relationship exists between organic and conventional prices, implying that price determination for organic corn and soybean is independent from that of the conventional crops. This suggests that organic corn and soybean prices are driven by demand and supply forces idiosyncratic to the organic market. For each crop, cointegrating spatial relationships are found between prices at the main organic markets. However, such relationships are generally weaker than the ones for the corresponding conventional prices, implying that organic markets are more affected by idiosyncratic shocks than conventional markets.

Results of the model show that the incentive strength regarding the member CEO is stronger compared to that of the outside CEO in order to shift some effort of the member CEO from individual farming into the task of adding value to the cooperative enterprise. A cooperative with a member CEO is uniquely efficient when upstream and downstream tasks are substitutes to a certain extent, or complements. When the tasks are substitutes, the efficient CEO identity depends on the strength of the substitution effect and the difference of the marginal productivities between the two tasks. The scope of cooperatives with a member CEO being efficient becomes smaller when the substitution effect is at an intermediate level or the productivity difference between the two tasks is limited.

Using survey data from New York food processors, an ordered logit analysis reveals that firm growth is related to important upstream and downstream market condiations. The clustering of similar manufacturers was found to have important effects on firm revenue growth, with the benefits of firm clustering increasing significantly with the level of local urbanization. For these reasons, policies that promote intra-industry or cross-industry collaboration would likely benefit food manufacturers, but these benefits would not be limited to firms in close geographic proximity to one another. Moreover, in rural areas especially, manufacturing firms and community planners need to be aware of possible negative effects of competition from growing concentrations of firms so that these issues can be addressed before local business growth is adversely affected.

In Poland, over 1.28 million beehives were in operation in 2012. This number only satisfies 53% of the minimum pollination needs of major entomophilous plants at the peak of their flowering. This also affects the yield of the plants and a decline in the quality of the crop. The yield values obtained by pollination and losses resulting from the low number of pollinators for selected crops have been estimated in the paper. The major entomophilous plants flowering at approximately the same time included rape and agrimony, apple, pear, plum, sweet and sour cherry orchards as well as currant and gooseberry. The plantation yield obtained in Poland in 2012 owing to the pollination by bees is valued at EUR 825.1 million, and losses resultant from too low number of pollinators are estimated at EUR 728.5 million.","[Majewski, Janusz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Int Econ Relat, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,,Janusz_Majewski@sggw.pl,"Majewski, Janusz/B-6133-2014","Majewski, Janusz/0000-0002-2221-462X",,,,,14,9,9,0,14,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9934-8466-1-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,34,,,,,14,21,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347131900001,0

A method proposed by Roeger () is used to estimate monopoly and monopsony market power, relaxing the assumptions of perfect competition and constant returns to scale, and avoiding any endogeneity issues. The results obtained indicate that foreign investments and consolidation have a positive and significant impact on food processors' and retailers' mark-ups. Food processors, agricultural producers, and wholesalers have lower price-cost margins than retailers, whereas retailers exert monopsonistic power in the upstream food market as well.

Data from an Internet-based survey of consumers (n = 1,139) was analyzed using a bivariate probit model. The bivariate probit model related attitudinal, behavioral and sociodemographic factors to the intention to purchase fresh and nonfresh locally produced foods. Although sociodemographic characteristics play a limited role in shaping local food purchase intentions, attitudinally based variables have far greater influence. Positive views towards local farmers and agriculture in general, as well as food quality, are positively related to purchase intention. The importance placed on brand-specific quality is inversely related to the intention to buy local food. Consumers with heightened levels of food involvement, either growing food or preparing most meals from scratch, are more likely to purchase local foods.

Moreover, it aims to explore whether perceptions about healthiness related to functionality types differ among consumers according to their level of prior awareness of functionality and its health benefits. The application of the discrete choice experimental technique on a sample of 140 parents with at least one 5- to 14-year-old child was selected as the most suitable methodological approach. The sample purposively comprised two subsamples of 70 parents each, based on their real awareness of the term functional'' and of the health benefits of specific functionality types. Parents generally perceived functionality as a product attribute that contributes positively to the image enhancement of the (unhealthy) target product and affirmed that they are willing to pay reasonable premiums for it. However, the level of consumers' prior awareness of functionality played a decisive role in their preference for functional products. The type of food that carries'' functionality was also more important when consumers had no knowledge of functionality. Overall, prior and accurate awareness was found to increase the variety of functionality types and preferred carriers, the strength of preference per functionality type, and the price premiums willingly paid.

In this study, the author investigates potentially nonlinear dynamics of the soybean-to-corn price ratio by applying the smooth transition autoregression (STAR) modeling framework to the soybean-to-corn price ratio, derived from monthly futures prices of corn and soybeans. The estimated model demonstrates nonlinear dynamics, resulting in asymmetries in the adjustment to the long-run equilibrium of the soybean-to-corn price ratio.

We use a counterfactual approach, the synthetic control method, and compare the evolution of the military burden for 40 countries affected by coups with the evolution of a synthetic counterfactual that replicates the initial conditions and the potential outcomes of the countries of interest before exposure to coups. Our case studies suggest that successful coups result in a large increase in the military burden. However, when no effects or a decrease in the defense burden are found, it is often the consequence of a democratization process triggered by the coup. These results are in keeping with recent theoretical developments on the bargaining power of the military in authoritarian regimes. Failed coups, by contrast, produce a smaller, and mostly positive, effect on the military burden, possibly as a result of the incumbent's strategy to avert further challenges to the stability of the regime by buying off the military.","[Bove, Vincenzo] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Nistico, Roberto] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Nistico, Roberto] CSEF, Naples, Italy",University of Warwick; University of Essex,"Bove, V (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",v.bove@warwick.ac.uk,"Bove, Vincenzo/O-2279-2019; Nisticò, Roberto/O-7522-2019","Nisticò, Roberto/0000-0002-8589-3703",,,,,44,34,34,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2014,161.0,3-4,,,,,321,344,,10.1007/s11127-014-0202-2,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AT7XF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345147000004,0

We introduce a nonlinear consumption tax which we call a 'tax lottery'. Under this scheme, an ad-valorem consumption tax is supplemented with a lottery in which consumers can win cash prizes. The winning probabilities in this lottery depend on all consumers' private good consumption decisions. We show that for a given advalorem tax, an appropriately designed lottery can implement an efficient allocation in pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. The lottery component corrects the distortion in private consumption due to the ad-valorem tax, while the resulting tax revenue is sufficient to efficiently provide the public good and pay out the lottery prize.

Mirror neurons are a particular class of visuomotor neurons in the brain that show activity both when an individual performs an action and when he observes another individual performing the same action. According to researchers in cognitive neuroscience, mirror neurons are the brain basis for learning by imitation. The observation of 2 types of movement specifically causes the mirror neurons activation: grasping with the hand and bringing to the mouth. This article seeks to show that TV commercials, in which a character grabs a food product and brings it to his mouth, are more effective. To investigate this research question we designed a between-subjects experiment (n = 130) to compare the memorization of 2 versions of the same ad (featuring an unfamiliar mineral water brand). In the first ad version, the character grabs the product, while there is no contact between the product and the character in the second version. The article outlines that memory was higher in the grasping and drinking condition. Although we cannot conclusively say that the mirror neurons were activated when people saw the character grabbing the product in the ad, the literature on mirror neurons provides an explanatory framework for the observed results. In other words, this study points out that the discovery of mirror neurons is a very new concept for marketing, which can enrich our understanding of advertising processing.","[Lacoste-Badie, Sophie; Droulers, Olivier] Univ Rennes, Ctr Res Econ & Management, Grad Sch Management IGR, CNRS UMR 6211, Rennes, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Rennes,"Lacoste-Badie, S (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, Ctr Res Econ & Management, CNRS UMR 6211, Inst Technol IUT GEA, Campus Beaulieu,Ave Gen Leclerc CS 44202, F-35042 Rennes, France.",sophie.lacoste-badie@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,24,5,8,0,35,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

Past literature has focused on the effect of trade liberalization as the key factor triggering international mergers. We introduce the idea of flexible policy regime in which optimal policies are sensitive to whether a cross-border acquisition has taken place or not. In a free-trade model given asymmetries in marginal cost, we find that optimal subsidies decline when firms acquire inefficient foreign firms while optimal subsidies increase when firms acquire efficient firms. We also find that as the efficiency of the acquirer increases, the profitability of the acquisition and hence the likelihood that it takes place also increases. We find that the role of market size in triggering cross-border acquisitions may be limited even with free trade. J. Japanese Int. Economies 34 (2014) 58-70.

We develop an empirical model that accommodates both the location and fertility choices of households to take into account their self-selected migration across municipalities. We estimate the model using microdata on households in metropolitan areas. The results suggest that self-selection may generate substantial upward bias in the estimated impacts of pronatal policies on fertility. We also find that some types of noncash benefit pronatal policies significantly increase the probability of births occurring in metropolitan households. J. Japanese Int. Economies 34 (2014) 179-200.

It does so first by proposing an urban/suburban classification that takes into account multiple census variables to provide a richer yet fine-grained and standardized classification of urban and suburban census tracts - the Urban Core. The Urban Core is then compared with the more common classification of the Inner City, that is based on age of housing. The proposed definition is then applied to examine if recent behavior of seniors has been consistent with the contention that they will increasingly move to the city - something that has been suggested in the media and grey literature. This is done by examining disaggregate data from four Canadian censuses on households moving to the Urban Core or suburbs, by age group. This is done initially graphically, and then logistic regressions are used to analyze how the effect of being a senior on moving to the Urban Core has evolved over the four censuses, while controlling for other socio-demographic variables. As such, using the proposed definition of the Urban Core, analysis suggests that seniors have been increasingly moving away from the Urban Core, behavior that is inconsistent with a hypothesis of a return to the city for seniors in the future.

The paper describes a mixed method approach used to examine such operators' decisions about vehicle deployment, route frequency, network organisation, and pricing in three rural districts in South Africa. New evidence is presented showing that the condition of rural roads (both paved and unpaved) affects the quantity and quality of public transport services provided, as well as the fares charged to passengers. This strengthens the case for judicious infrastructure investment as a way of improving rural access and livelihoods, and suggests how this might happen by way of leveraging better private sector responses. We also describe the emergence of a differentiated service hierarchy involving a variety of vehicle types suited to different operating conditions, and based on intentional coordination among operators of minibus and pickup truck ('bakkie') services. We argue that governments should promote such coordination and innovation in rural transport markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Consistent with the business cycle literature, corporate investments peak during periods of positive sentiment, yet these periods are followed by lower equity returns. This pattern exists in most developed countries and survives controls for discount rates, equity flows, valuation multiples, operating accruals, and other investor sentiment measures. Higher aggregate investments also precede greater earnings disappointments, lower short-window earnings announcement returns, and lower macroeconomic growth.

Cash transfers are introduced to all agents with income below a given level. Two qualitative results are found: (i) The size of cash transfers has a negative effect on the employment rate, but an ambiguous effect on the unemployment rate; and (ii) the coverage of this welfare program has a positive effect on the employment rate, and an ambiguous effect on the unemployment rate. The numerical simulations also show that: (i) if the government target is to reduce inequality and poverty, the more efficient policy is to increase the level of benefits instead of increasing the eligibility of the program; (ii) compared with a welfare program that condition eligibility to labor market participation, the unconditional cash transfer program has a stronger impact on inequality and poverty, but with a reduction in labor market participation and output.","[Cavalcanti, Tiago] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England; [Cavalcanti, Tiago] Insper, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Correa, Marcio] Univ Fed Ceara, Ctr Economist Educ North East CAEN, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",University of Cambridge; Insper; Universidade Federal do Ceara,"Corrêa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Ceara, Ctr Economist Educ North East CAEN, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.",tvdvc2@cam.ac.uk,"Correa, Marcio/Y-9282-2018","Correa, Marcio/0000-0001-6715-6753",,,,,25,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Positive terms of trade effects raise tariffs in all countries, and can overcome the negative median voter component in labor-abundant countries. Testing the tariff prediction with cross-section and panel data from the 1990s, I show the median voter component is negative in labor-abundant countries and positive in capital-abundant countries.

This study finds that the monthly income gains for seasonal migrants from Armenia to Russia are about US$480 relative to only US$50 in the case of non-migration. Individual panel data based on a novel household survey allow controlling for a variety of socio-economic characteristics. Propensity score matching combined with difference-in-differences addresses potential endogenous self-selection into migration. This paper finds negative selection based on education, employment, and pre-migration income. This is reflected by a low premium for skills in Russia relative to Armenia, luring seasonal migrants into low-skill jobs, mainly in the construction sector. The results identify seasonal labor migration as an attractive opportunity to escape unemployment, especially for the unskilled labor force. Therefore, seasonal migration has become an increasingly important source of income for households (through remittances) from low-income countries and helps eradicate poverty.","Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Res Inst Regulatory Econ, A-1140 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Liebensteiner, M (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Res Inst Regulatory Econ, Heiligenstadter Str 46-48, A-1140 Vienna, Austria.",mario.liebensteiner@wu.ac.at,,"Liebensteiner, Mario/0000-0001-5596-8658",,,,,43,1,1,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Therefore, in order to achieve long-term corporate success, companies need to have a culture that encourages creativity and innovation. The aim of the article is to investigate the link between corporate culture and creativity and the impact of the management form on organizational culture. The research highlights the Romanian hotel industry culture, using Hofstede's model. Considering their impact on innovation, there were taken into consideration three factors: individualism, power distance and long term orientation. The article investigates how these factors are influenced by the hotel's exploitation form and their impact on organizational creativity. The research was conducted on two hotels in Bucharest, affiliated to an international hotel chain. In order to identify the impact of the exploitation form on the hotel's organizational culture, one of the accommodation units is operated under a management contract, while the other operates under a franchise agreement. The study is based on a survey conducted among the employees of the two hotels. Results indicate differences regarding the corporate culture between the hotel operated under a management contract and the unit operated under a franchise agreement. Recommendations on how to foster employees' creativity are suggested. The implications of the findings are discussed, considering the limitations and future research directions.","[State, Olimpia; Iorgulescu, Maria-Cristina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"State, O (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",state.olimpia@com.ase.ro,"Iorgulescu, Maria-Cristina/L-7737-2015; State, Olimpia/AAF-2322-2019","Iorgulescu, Maria-Cristina/0000-0003-4957-3590; State, Olimpia/0000-0002-9737-867X",,,,,22,9,9,2,50,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1205,1221,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900013,0

We present investors with a series of stocks with varying levels of skewness. Using Instant Response Devices, we then collect investors' choices to hold or sell each stock. Among stocks with equal expected returns, we find strong evidence that the sample investors use a prospect theory utility function rather than a mean-variance expected utility function to decide to sell or hold stocks. In the loss domain, we find that investors are ambivalent about the choice between positively and negatively skewed stocks. However, in the gain domain, we find that both individual and institutional investors prefer negatively skewed stocks-a contrast from previous research suggesting that individuals (and not institutional investors) prefer positive skewness.

To identify liquidity-pricing effects, we exploit the information contained in the spreads between bonds issued by a German agency (KfW) and their sovereign counterparts. KfW's liabilities being guaranteed by the German government, these spreads are essentially liquidity-driven. Liquidity effects are found to account for a sizeable share of spreads' fluctuations. After having filtered risk premiums out of the spreads, we estimate the physical default probabilities of eleven countries. Physical probabilities of default are lower than risk-neutral ones, consistently with the existence of a nondiversifiable euro-area sovereign credit risk.","[Monfort, Alain] Banque France, CREST, Paris, France; [Monfort, Alain] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Renne, Jean-Paul] Banque France, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Maastricht University; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Monfort, A (通讯作者)，Banque France, CREST, Paris, France.",,,"Renne, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-0797-2457",,,,,85,47,47,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

The analysis revolves around scenarios of public spending that allow four developing countries to meet targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Public spending rises significantly to meet the targets by 2015. The ultimate effect on aggregate demand depends on the macroeconomic trade-offs of the financing source. The supply effect is that production factors accumulate and productivity rises as larger numbers of better-educated workers become employed. The magnitude of the GDP growth gains and options to magnify them after 2015 are identified. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis explicitly takes into account that oil is a nonrenewable natural resource. A blending mandate has no effect on total cumulative oil extraction. However, extraction of oil is postponed as a consequence of the renewable fuel standard. Thus, if emissions from biofuels are negligible, the standard will have beneficial climate effects. The standard also reduces total fuel (i.e., oil plus biofuels) consumption initially. Hence, even if emissions from biofuels are nonnegligible, a renewable fuel standard may still reduce climate costs. In fact our simulations show that even for biofuels that are almost as emissions intensive as oil, a renewable fuel standard has beneficial climate effects.","[Greaker, Mads; Hoel, Michael] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Rosendahl, Knut Einar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Greaker, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",,,,,,,,34,6,6,0,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Nominal rigidities, combined with permanent productivity shocks, increase expected excess returns on production claims. This is mainly explained by consumption dynamics driven by rigidity-induced changes in employment and markups. An interest-rate monetary policy rule affects asset returns. Stronger (weaker) rule responses to inflation (output) increase expected excess returns. Policy shocks substantially increase asset-return volatility. Price rigidity heterogeneity produces cross-sectoral differences in expected returns. The model matches important macroeconomic moments and the Sharpe ratio of stock returns, but only captures a small fraction of the observed equity premium. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study explores the reasons behind this tendency. To this end, we utilize data compiled through a survey and interviews covering 145 large-scale manufacturing firms. Our analyses reveal two principal sources behind the rise in the import content of production: (1) the change in the structure of production in favor of sectors having high import content and (2) the increase in the use of imported inputs for the majority of firms covered in the study. Regarding the second factor, it is found that insufficient domestic input supply in certain intermediate and investment goods, need to use high quality materials and machinery embodying new technology, lower cost of imported inputs, vertical integration of production processes of multinational and/or foreign-owned companies, supplier credits and credits extended by foreign financial institutions have induced firms to use more imported inputs.","[Saygili, Seref; Cihan, Cengiz; Yalcin, Cihan; Brand, Turknur Hamsici] Turkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankasi, Arastirma & Para Polit Genel Mudurlugu, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Prime Ministry Turkey,"Saygili, S (通讯作者)，Turkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankasi, Arastirma & Para Polit Genel Mudurlugu, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",Seref.Saygili@tcmb.gov.tr; Cengiz.Cihan@tcmb.gov.tr; Cihan.Yalcin@tcmb.gov.tr; Turknur.Brand@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,2,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

This paper summarizes the evidence on the effects of entry reforms and related policy actions to promote firm formalization. Most of these policies result in only a modest increase in the number of formal firms, if there is any increase at all. Most informal firms appear to not benefit on net from formalizing. As a consequence, ease of formalization along will not induce most of them to become formal. Increased enforcement of rules can increase formality. Although there is a fiscal benefit of doing this with larger informal firms, it is unclear whether there is a public rationale for attempting to formalize subsistence enterprises.","[Bruhn, Miriam; McKenzie, David] World Bank, Finance & Private Sect Unit, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank,"Bruhn, M (通讯作者)，MSN MC3-307,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mbruhn@worldbank.org; dmckenzie@worldbank.org,,,,,,,31,68,76,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

We find that different covariates differentially impact each of these endings. In a second exercise, we split our sample of 586 terrorist groups into those that started before and after the beginning of 1990. In so doing, we find that survival factors differ between the two cohorts of groups.

We present evidence that media coverage tends to contribute to investors' chasing of past returns rather than facilitate the processing of useful information in fund portfolios. Our evidence suggests that media coverage can exacerbate investor biases and that it is the primary mechanism that makes fund window dressing effective. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This estimation framework is applied to a unique bank-level dataset compiled from regulatory sources, covering U.S. banks' foreign activities in 83 host markets over the 2003-2013 period. Bank traits are better able to explain the evolving patterns of foreign banking than host market characteristics. After controlling for these traits, the post-financial crisis period shows a structural shift away from cross-border claims towards foreign affiliate activities. Structural estimates of foreign market entry costs and regulatory attitudes towards risk are derived. Simulation exercises confirm the strong impact of banks' and regulators' risk stance on bank profits and portfolio composition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To protect rents and the private benefits of control, controlling owners prefer to include more affiliated members on their boards. This study empirically examines financial institutions in Taiwan a country that harbors both firms with controlling shareholders and pyramidal groups and its results verify the aforementioned postulation. We find that board affiliation is positively associated with control rights, cash flow rights and the control/cash flow deviation associated with controlling owners. In contrast, professionalism can disentangle controlling owners' motives, as it is positively associated with the controlling-owner cash flow/control rights ratio and negatively correlated with the control/cash flow deviation. The results support the incentive effect associated with controlling owners. Moreover, the information argument provides auxiliary explanations for how boards are structured. Family is a catalyst for the bias toward lower levels of board professionalism. Finally, whereas board professionalism is positively correlated with stock returns during a financial crisis, board affiliation has a negative correlation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Notwithstanding the decision to cycle is closely related to local weather conditions and interwoven with the geographical context, research dealing with both aspects is scarce. On the basis of travel diary data, we assess the association of three weather conditions, namely air temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, on cycling trips for leisure and commute purposes for the Greater Rotterdam area, the Netherlands. Besides region-wide logit models and autologistic regressions, place-specific associations of weather conditions are explored through geographically weighted logit models. Considering the entire Rotterdam area, results confirm significant weather effects on cycling while highlighting the necessity to model the residents' locational component. When the confounding effects of individual and household characteristics are controlled, a key finding is that weather effects appear to vary across space, specifically between the more densely settled central environments and the surrounding lower-density areas. Additionally, the results show differences between leisure and commute trips, in which leisure trips appear to be more weather sensitive and show more pronounced spatial patterns.

Study 1 explored people's beliefs about the effects of different incidental emotions on another person's trustworthiness in general. In Studies 2 and 3, senders in trust games faced angry, guilty, grateful, or emotionally neutral responders. Participants who were told about their counterpart's emotional state acted consistently with their beliefs about how these emotions would affect the other's trustworthiness. These beliefs were not always correct, however. There were significant deviations between the expected behavior of angry responders and such responders' actual behavior. These findings raise the possibility that one player's knowledge of the other's emotional state may lead to action choices that yield poor outcomes for both players. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In his dissertation (Bidrag till Grundl'ggelse af en Afstemningsl're), accepted in 1892 at the University of Copenhagen, Heckscher dealt with numerous issues related to voting, especially those related to vote-aggregation in parliaments, courts and committees. He knew the works of Condorcet and Borda quite well, and analyzed many topics that would nowadays fall into the domain of the theory of social choice. These include Condorcet-cycles, differences between Condorcet-effective rules and the Borda rule, strategic voting, the influence of the voting order under the parliamentary voting rules, the likelihood of single-peaked preference profiles, and the problems created by non-separable preferences. Heckscher's treatment of the Judgment Aggregation Paradox is especially noteworthy. Although Kornhauser and Sager (Yale Law Journal 96: 82-117, 1986) are usually mentioned as the inventors of this problem, Heckscher's earlier treatment confirms the suspicion that the problem is not of recent origin. Numerous issues studied in the post-Arrowian theory of voting may already be found in Heckscher's dissertation; some of them have become subjects of systematic study only in the twenty-first century. It is argued that Albert Heckscher, the unknown nineteenth century Danish lawyer, deserves a place in the pantheon of the theory of social choice alongside his better known contemporaries Charles Dodgson and E.

To this end, a little discussed and often overlooked aspect of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) mandated that, in addition to sanctions, states were required to provide TA to build the capacity of struggling schools and Local Education Agencies (LEAs, or districts) to help them improve student achievement. Although every state in the country provides some form of TA to its lowest performing districts, we know little about the content of these programs or about their efficacy in improving student performance. In this paper, we use both quantitative and qualitative analyses to explore the actions taken by TA providers in one stateCaliforniaand examine whether the TA and support tied to California's NCLB sanctions succeeds in improving student achievement. Like many other states, California requires that districts labeled as persistently failing under NCLB (in Program Improvement year 3, PI3) work with external experts to help them build the capacity to make reforms that will improve student achievement. California's lowest performing PI3 districts are given substantial amounts of funding and are required to contract with state-approved District Assistance and Intervention Teams (DAITs), whereas the remaining PI3 districts receive less funding and are asked to access less intensive TA from non-DAIT providers. We use a five-year panel difference-in-difference design to estimate the impacts of DAITs on student performance on the math and English language arts (ELA) standardized tests relative to non-DAIT TA during the two years of the program intervention. We find that students in districts with DAITs perform significantly better on math California Standards Tests (CSTs) averaged over both treatment years and in each of the first and second years. We do not find evidence that students in districts with DAITs perform higher on ELA CSTs over the combined two years of treatment, although we find suggestive evidence that ELA performance increases in the second year of treatment relative to students in districts with non-DAIT TA. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions that explore the association between specific activities fostered by DAITs and changes in districts' gains in achievement over the two years of treatment show that DAIT districts that report increasing their focus on using data to guide instruction, shifting district culture to generate and maintain high expectations of students and staff, and increasing within-district accountability for student performance, have higher math achievement gains over the course of the DAIT treatment. In addition, DAIT districts that increase their focus on ELA instruction and shift district culture to one of high expectations have higher ELA achievement gains than do DAIT districts that do not have a similar focus.

We describe the legal ramifications of this enforcement initiative, and document dramatic contemporaneous market-wide changes in the contractual structure of PIPEs. PIPEs in the post-action period included fewer aggressive repricing rights and more trading restrictions. However, PIPEs in the post-action period also included more investor protections and fewer issuer rights.

Using American bond observations from year 1995 to 2007, we find that the revision decreases the information benefits of ESOs disclosure. When controlling for credit ratings and potential endogeneity problems, we also find that ESOs are significantly and positively related to bond yield spreads in post-No.123R period while have an opposite effect in pre-No.123R period.

Power is a central construct in economic decision making, influencing people's thoughts and behavior in organizational, political, consumer, and interpersonal contexts. Whereas most research has discussed ways that power can influence primary cognition (e.g., increased self-focused thoughts, heuristic processing), we examine how power can influence secondary cognition (i.e., thinking about thinking). We argue that high (relative to low) power can increase reliance on one's current thoughts, magnifying their influence on judgment. If thoughts are antisocial (prosocial), increased power will produce more antisocial (prosocial) judgments and behavior. We activated prosocial or antisocial concepts through priming before activating powerfulness or powerlessness. As predicted, primes impacted people's self-perceptions of cooperation (Experiment 1) and the extent to which they were willing to help others (Experiment 2) when induced to feel powerful, but not when led to feel powerless.

We show that if the initial capital stock is high enough, the economy monotonically converges to a long-run steady state. On the contrary, when the initial capital stock is low, the economy is relegated to an environmental poverty trap. We also explore the implications of public policies on the trap and on the long-run stable steady state. In particular, we find that government should decrease debt and increase pollution abatement to promote capital accumulation and environmental quality at the stable long-run steady state.

Employing multi-country panel-data, we find support for this channel: Dividends by a group firm are positively related with equity-financed investments by its affiliated firms.

J,"Guttman, JM; Reuveny, R",,,,"Guttman, Joel M.; Reuveny, Rafael",,,On revolt and endogenous economic policy in autocratic regimes,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Institutional quality; Dictatorship; Autocracy; Endogenous policy,DEMOCRACY; HISTORY; GROWTH,"Numerous empirical studies have investigated the direction of causality between democracy and economic growth (as well as the level of income per capita), but this empirical work has been paralleled by relatively few theoretical models that endogenize the institutional structure of the regime. Moreover, the different types of autocratic regimes have received relatively little attention. This paper develops a game-theoretic model of endogenous economic policy in autocratic regimes facing a revolt or an insurgency. In this model, there are three players: the regime, the rebels, and the masses. There are three stages in the game. In the first stage, the regime determines the level of infrastructure and the tax rate. In the second stage, the masses allocate their time between production and helping the rebels. In the third stage, the regime and the rebels simultaneously choose their fighting effort levels in a contest, in which the probability of survival of the regime is determined. It is found that autocratic regimes facing a revolt endogenously sort themselves into tinpot regimes that maximize their consumption at the cost of their survival, and (weak and strong) totalitarian regimes that maximize their probability of survival at the expense of their consumption. Empirical implications of the model are derived, and the relevance of the model to public policy is discussed.","[Guttman, Joel M.] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Reuveny, Rafael] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA",Bar Ilan University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Guttman, JM (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",guttman@mail.biu.ac.il; rreuveny@indiana.edu,,,,,,,50,3,4,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2014,159.0,1-2,,,,,27,52,,10.1007/s11127-012-0012-3,0.0,,,26,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AD3OX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333156600003,0

In particular, we show that the discounted expected value is no longer valid as a classical lower bound for insurance prices in general: it has to be corrected by a covariance term that reflects the interaction between the insurance claim and the financial market.

Our discussion begins with an empirical performance measurement of the asset class over the period from 2001 to 2010, suggesting that limited partnership private equity funds may be suited for the purpose of portfolio enhancement. Subsequently, we review the market risk standard approaches set out by both regulatory regimes and outline a potential framework for an internal model. Based on an implementation of these solvency models, it is possible to demonstrate that private equity is overly penalized by the standard approaches. Hence, life insurers aiming to exploit the asset class's return potential may expect significantly lower capital charges when applying an economically sound internal model. Finally, we show that, from a regulatory capital perspective, it can even be less costly to increase the exposure to private rather than public equity.","[Braun, Alexander; Schmeiser, Hato; Siegel, Caroline] Univ St Gallen, Inst Insurance Econ, CH-9010 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Braun, A (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Insurance Econ, Kirchlistr 2, CH-9010 St Gallen, Switzerland.",alexander.braun@unisg.ch; hato.schmeiser@unisg.ch; caro-line.siegel@unisg.ch,,,,,,,71,8,9,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

It does so in a simple model where households care about the school peer group of their children. If ability and income are positively correlated, tracking implies that some high income households face the choice of either living in the areas where most of the other high income households live and having their child assigned to the low track, or instead living in lower income neighbourhoods where their child would be in the high track. Under mild conditions, tracking leads to an equilibrium with partial income desegregation where perfect income segregation would be the only stable outcome without tracking. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The relative estimation accuracy of the methods depends, among other things, on the number of observations and whether in-sample or out-of-sample estimations are considered. The latter is decisive for proper risk management and is required for regulatory purposes. FMMs aim to reproduce the distribution of realized LGDs and, therefore, perform best with respect to in-sample estimations, but they show poor performance with respect to out-of-sample estimations.

When the fraction of unaffiliated directors living near headquarters is lower, nonroutine chief executive officer (CEO) turnover is more sensitive to stock performance. Also, the level, intensity, and sensitivity of CEO equity-based pay increase with board distance. Overall, our results suggest that geographic location is an important dimension of board structure that influences directors' costs of gathering information.","[Alam, Zinat S.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Chen, Mark A.; Ciccotello, Conrad S.; Ryan, Harley E., Jr.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Alam, ZS (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",zalam@fau.edu; machen@gsu.edu; cciccotello@gsu.edu; cryan@gsu.edu,"Ryan, Harley E/E-1551-2012",,,,,,66,59,65,5,58,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

The reallocation is disaggregated into three components, two of which are under the direct control of the underwriter: the initial allocation, and the demand satisfaction ratio. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of 193 hybrid IPOs issued in Italy between 1997 and 2012. Controlling for firm and IPO characteristics, we find that the IPO shares are typically shifted toward institutional investors when positive information is collected during the bookbuilding process. The IPO pricing and share reallocation are found to be interdependent, and reallocation is used in combination with partial adjustment to reward institutional investors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In a climate of financial instability since the onset of the global crisis of 2007-2008, support for new projects is being eroded by serious concerns over the extremely steep costs of high-speed rail, and there is a need for the scientific clarification of the procedure for prioritizing construction. In 2009 a new ranking methodology was developed and applied to 30,000 city pairs in the U.S. to determine their suitability for high-speed rail investment. The existing literature on ranking tools for prioritising HSR corridors is practically non-existent, and, as none of these U.S. lines has been built or put into in operation, this methodology has not been validated. The main aim of this paper is to contribute to these ranking models and highlight their importance in the HSR planning process. The preliminary ranking tool described in this work has been validated using data from the current HSR Spanish network. The results confirm the consistency of the model as a first approach to ranking pairs, mainly for the top O-D relations; however the model has some drawbacks chiefly due to the type of variables used, and their assigned weightings. Finally, some specific improvements are proposed for this ranking approach in order to provide policymakers with a useful tool when planning the construction of new HSR networks.

Traditionally, it is women who adjust their career more readily to meeting family obligations. In an era with a focus on equality between the genders in regard to both education and paid work, it is obvious to think of equality regarding working hours as well, and of distance to and from work. In this study we utilized data from the Norwegian Travel Survey of 2009 to examine the results of adjustments made in weekly working hours and commuting distance in families in which both husband and wife are in paid work These indicate that the family situation is significant, and that, among other things, children in a family does not lead to any reduction in men's working hours or commuting distance. Living in the periphery of large cities is disadvantageous for women who want to work full time, while living within a city tends to be to their advantageous in this regard. The results from the analysis of commuting distance show that women do not commute as far as men in comparable groups (working hours. family type, education, place of living, income, access to a car and occupation) and that the policy of regional enlargement is far from gender neutral. So long as it is women who adjust their labour market participation - both temporal and spatial - an enlargement of the regional/geographical labour market resulting potentially in longer commuting distances will primarily favour those who have the possibility to travel irrespectively of family situation, i.e. men, not women.

This research compares levels of social capital between TOD vs. non-TOD areas in Brisbane, Australia. Using a Two Step cluster analysis technique, three types of neighbourhood groupings were identified based on net employment density, net residential density, land use diversity, intersection density, and public transport accessibility: TODs, transit adjacent development (TADs) and traditional suburbs. Two dimensions of social capital were measured (trust and reciprocity, connections with neighbours) based on factor analysis of eight items representing elements of social capital. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to identify links between the distributions of the dimensions of social capital on areas defined as TODs, TADs, and traditional suburbs controlling for socio-demographics and environmental factors. Results show that individuals living in TODs had a significantly higher level of trust and reciprocity and connections with neighbours compared with residents of TADs. It appears that TODs may foster the development of social sustainability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Social responsibility of business is a key factor in evoking a positive brand reputation. Both the product itself and brand related actions and communications define brand reputation in the eyes of consumers, thus influencing perceived corporate social responsibility. As a consequence, it can be easily hindered or endangered by many product related issues such as faulty products or potentially harmful products. The purpose of this article is to provide an insight on the link between brand reputation and social responsibility in order to help organizations provide better services and protection for consumers. We examined how brand reputation is influenced by the negative bias generated by brand related communications regarding potentially harmful products. This study also analyzes how under normal consumption circumstances, consumers' experiences related to faulty products can influence brand reputation. To investigate this, we propose a model based on perceptual brand constructs and possible outcomes of brand reputation. In both circumstances, negative spillover effects are highlighted using structural equation modeling. The findings reveal that both faulty products and potentially harmful products have a negative bias on brand reputation, but affected perceptual brand constructs are different.","[Munteanu, Claudiu-Catalin; Florea, Dorian-Laurentiu; Pagalea, Andreea] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Munteanu, CC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",munteanu.katalyn@yahoo.com,"Florea, Dorian-Laurentiu/HZL-8236-2023; Munteanu, Claudiu-Cătălin/AAC-4042-2022; Florea, Dorian/ABD-3421-2020",,,,,,35,4,4,1,28,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,58,72,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300005,0

In this paper, the slippery slope framework is formalized by assuming two groups of taxpayers: compliance-minded and evasion-minded persons. Defining reaction functions for persons of both groups with respect to coercive and persuasive power instruments of tax authorities, the typical slippery slope picture emerges that characterises the authorities' work. As a consequence, both groups of policy tools are considered necessary to generate tax compliance. In addition to that, it is shown that coercive and persuasive power may be substitutes or complements to each other, depending of the parameters of the taxpayers' reaction functions. As a further crucial determinant of tax compliance, the behaviour of the fellow citizens with respect to taxpaying is identified. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An alternative of covered interest arbitrage is uncovered interest arbitrage (UIA) in which investors choose to remain uncovered accepting the currency risk. The yen carry trade is known as a longstanding application of UIA. Owing to Japanese low interest rates, yen carry trade has been a highly profitable strategy which involves borrowing in yen to buy higher yielding assets. Employing multivariate GARCH modeling, we examine the volatility transmission mechanism between the exchange rates involved in yen carry trade. Due to high impact of Lehman Brothers' collapse on world financial markets, we rather do the analysis for both before and after the default. Results reveal that interactions between the exchange rates increase considerably in response to negative market shocks. Our findings present new cross-hedging opportunities for investors.","[Tokat, Ekin; Murat, Atilim] TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Ankara, Turkey; [Tokat, Hakki Arda] TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Dept Int Entrepreneurship, Ankara, Turkey",TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University; TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University,"Tokat, E (通讯作者)，TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Ankara, Turkey.",etokat@etu.edu.tr; amurat@etu.edu.tr; hatokat@etu.edu.tr,"Tokat, Ekin/AAA-3279-2021",,,,,,25,0,0,0,6,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

By comparing S&P's ratings quality before and after EJR initiates coverage of each firm, I find a significant improvement in S&P's ratings quality following EJR's coverage initiation. S&P's ratings become more responsive to credit risk and its rating changes incorporate higher information content. These results differ from the existing literature documenting a deterioration in the incumbents' ratings quality following the entry of a third issuer-paid agency. I further show that the issuer-paid agency seems to improve the ratings quality because EJR's coverage has elevated its reputational concerns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Efficient asset-management becomes all the more important for countries subject to post-conflict/post-disaster adversity, not only to reactivate essential services, but also because programs that stimulate civil-engineering industry participation contribute much to recovery rates and can make-up 10% of a (recovering) nation's Gross Domestic Product. A good asset-management model needs to address key activities, communicate respective interconnectivities, and realize best practice. Limited study has been done into asset-management model frameworks that link directly with the change-management strategies required by recovering societies; this presents an obstacle to the prompt implementation of essential asset-management systems in sectors operating in adverse conditions. Asset-management techniques able to take account of the full range of factors in less stable environments require to link contributory variables including: dynamic user-needs analyses, life-cycle analysis, national design specifications, building codes, prefabrication opportunities, procurement routes, and project management tools towards re-build/retro-fitting. This early stage research project presents progress thus far in developing an integrative asset-management framework for infrastructure facilities in adverse/high-alert conditions using a multitude of North African case-study locations. Discussion centers upon developing framework(s) as a basis for workable procedures able to be amended with regard to (changing) design specifications/standards/legislation. Secondary research is presented that addresses the need to integrate economic whole-life evaluation techniques, asset-management tools and scopes in flux, and the extent to which such examination allows future development of flexible change-management for adverse situations towards incorporation into an integrative asset-management framework for infrastructure and civil engineering assets.

Research paper has been designed to generate insight into CSR practices used in context on employees (on a sample of 229 companies) directed with social responsibility because human resource management perspective creates condition for human resource management policies and practices that increase employee commitment. The empirical findings suggest that managers of SMEs, who view their employees as legitimate stakeholders of the firm, will introduce employee-oriented CSR out of their sense of moral responsibility towards their employees shaping in particular activities from social pillar of CSR.

The protection of infrastructure is thus one of the most important and difficult tasks for any government. The energy sector dominates in the UAE and consists of various assets - electricity, oil and natural gas that are geographically dispersed and connected by systems and networks. The protection of these systems and assets and within the energy sector especially, the safeguarding of oil and gas infrastructure from any and all internal and external threats should become top priority in the UAE. Threats to geopolitical and economic stability that need to be considered and prepared for include tectonic activity, climate change, nuclear energy, terrorism and war. This paper explores the disaster vulnerability of the Emirati energy sector with specific focus on Abu Dhabi and Dubai cities. It is based on secondary data, taken from various academic and professional sources, and primary data from a questionnaire survey administered on site at two electricity-generating plants in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Forty questionnaires were distributed and 35 were returned back-20 Abu Dhabi and 15 Dubai. Oil and gas sectors were identified as the most vulnerable energy sources in both Abu-Dhabi and Dubai. Risk from terrorism was thought to be the greatest hazard with every single respondent choosing it. This was despite the fact that respondents believe it to be one of the threats that the energy sector is prepared for. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The research paper offers a perspective for the quantification of credit risk over the Romanian banking system illustrated by the VAR model analysis and review. By analysing the results of the VAR model it was observed that the most powerful influence is made by the exchange, interest and unemployment rates. The GDP influence as demonstrated by the model is influencing the credit risk rate less than the other variables. The statistical test and outputs from Eviews software demonstrates the influence of the variables mentioned. The model presented has the scope to define the interactions between the quality of the credit portfolios and the macroeconomic environment from Romania. Having in view the complexity of the data aggregation and their availability, it were used 155 quarterly observations, the sample period being January 2001 - September 2013. Empirical analysis revealed an important influence of the macro-economic variables over the credit risk rate.

During the latest flooding, some parts of the City of Toronto received over 120mm of rain, while the monthly average for Toronto is 74.4mm. The impact was felt as 300,000 residents were affected by power outages. Other serious disruptions included flight cancellations, subway and other transportation closures. It was the most expensive disaster for the province of Ontario. According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the damage of the insured properties exceeded $850 million. This event renewed a debate on a number of issues, such as decaying infrastructure, insufficient flood management, and inadequate standards. Don River, the main river crossing the city, is wide but not deep enough, which together with sedimentation contributes to frequent flooding of surrounding areas. In addition, natural creeks have been buried in sewer pipes, thus losing the natural waterways towards the lake Ontario and forcing existing rivers and creeks to overflow their banks. While floodplain maps are generally available, the estimation of flood risk maps based on population, economic development, and critical infrastructure will enhance city's flood mitigation and preparedness planning. In this paper, we present an approach for determining spatial flood risk index map based on population vulnerabilities and terrain morphological characteristics using a geographic information system.

To what extent can this variation be summarized by a small number of representative (or synthetic) neighborhoods? To answer this question, U.S. neighborhoods are classified according to their characteristics in the year 2000 using a clustering algorithm. The author finds that such classification can account for 37 percent of the variation with two representative neighborhoods and for up to 52 percent with three representative neighborhoods. Furthermore, neighborhoods classified as similar to the same representative neighborhood tend to be geographically close to each other, forming large areas of fairly homogeneous characteristics. Representative neighborhoods seem a promising empirical benchmark for quantitative theories involving neighborhood formation.

The search for sources of capital and their efficient allocation requires, for increased profitability and value of an economic entity, reliance, in retrospective financial analysis, on certain financial methods and techniques to assess firm's financial performance at a given moment. Economic theory has always been interested in developing methods to predict the risk of bankruptcy starting from rates correlated with the state of health or weakness of economic entities. One of the methods commonly used in current financial analysis is the Score function. Comparing a priori and a posteriori probabilities allows one to determine the Score areas where the risk of bankruptcy is higher. This paper presents, first, the theory of the Score function method for financial analysis of an economic entity and, second, the results obtained when applying this methodology for SMEs in Romanian development macro-regions. The bankruptcy risk for some SMEs is approximated and the strengths and weaknesses of financial management in order to design new strategies are identified. Changes induced by the current economic and financial crisis may involve, when the probability is a priori, an exchange of the bankruptcy rate. The techniques presented and applied in this paper, allowed us, for each considered macro-region, to obtain a general picture of the economic and financial situation of SMEs and allowed for a global diagnosis and a synthesis of their economic and financial situation.","[Balan, Mariana; Iorgulescu, Raluca] Acad Romana, Inst Econ Forecasting INCE, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,,raluca_i@lycos.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,6,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-020-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,235,243,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346751900032,0

This study analyses a case of waste to energy, within the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where two small rural pig farmers assessed production cycles and waste generated in order to exploit new opportunities for organizational cost reduction and energy selfsufficiency. Pig waste acts as biomass for each digester installed in the farming properties. These digesters produce enough power to maintain a central biogas generation unit, and thus providing animals heating and drying of the grain produced in the respective properties. Biofertilizer produced by digesters can, furthermore, help fertilize corn crops and cattle grazing. The findings of our study demonstrate that investment into such a project can provide an excellent return, with savings up to 50% in electric energy and 50 % in fertilizer.

The analysis of how firms react to the taxation and regulation of pension plans and to the guarantees provided by the government has allowed researchers to test alternative corporate finance theories, including risk-shifting and risk management. The difficulty in measuring the value of pension liabilities has motivated the study of whether such liabilities are reflected in the cost of capital and in the value of sponsoring firms. The study of the sponsoring firms' reaction to mandatory pension contribution has provided evidence on financing constraints and on the free-cash-flow hypothesis. Pension plan terminations and freezes have shed light on the nature of the employment contract between the firm and workers.","[Cocco, Joao F.] London Business Sch, Dept Finance, London NW1 4SA, England; [Cocco, Joao F.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 3PZ, England; [Cocco, Joao F.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Ctr Financial Studies, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Cocco, Joao F.] Tilburg Univ, Network Studies Pens Aging & Retirement, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands",University of London; London Business School; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Goethe University Frankfurt; Tilburg University,"Cocco, JF (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, Dept Finance, Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England.",jcocco@london.edu,,,,,,,99,16,18,3,28,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4806-9,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

The aim of this paper is the enhancement of the sustainability assessment framework by selecting the sustainable development indicators according to each country characteristics. The paper discusses several models of sustainable development analysis and identifies different indicators that were chosen to explain sustainability. With the aid of a thorough literature review and data analysis we provide arguments regarding the existence of a general model of social, economic and environmental indicators which may be applied in every country and if such model could be appropriate.

I investigate this hypothesis by exploiting a unique natural experiment that occurred between 1986 and 1998 when refugee immigrants to Denmark were assigned to municipalities quasi-randomly, which successfully addresses the methodological problem of endogenous neighborhood selection. I show that individuals sort into neighborhoods. Taking account of location sorting, living in a socially deprived neighborhood does not affect labor market outcomes of refugee men. Their labor market outcomes are also not affected by the overall employment rate and the overall average skill level in the neighborhood. However, an increase in the average skill level of non-Western immigrant men living in the neighborhood raises their employment probability, while an increase in the employment rate of co-national men living in the neighborhood raises their real annual earnings. This provides quasi-experimental evidence that residence-based job information networks are ethnically stratified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The entry and exit of traders in the market creates an M shaped double bubble price path over the life of the traded asset. This finding is significant in documenting that bubbles can reoccur within one extended trading horizon and, consistent with previous cross-subject comparisons, shows how fluctuations in market liquidity influence price paths.

Numerous authors think that what are called competencies, are the competitive factors that are able to be a source of competitive advantage. These competencies can be related to the dimensions of intellectual capital (IC). There are few studies that analyze the relationship between core competencies, IC and business performance. For that, we present our objective that is, whether competencies related to a concrete dimension of IC are determined by competencies related to others IC dimensions and which types of competencies affect positively to business results. To achieve the aim of our research, a field study has been done, making telephone calls to Spanish companies financial managers. Then, their responses and the financial performance of their companies have been analyzed. To make the analyses, we have utilized structural equations by PLS (Partial Least Squares). The main result of our study is that competencies related to Human Capital, considered as the main source of value creation of the company, impact positively over the competencies related to Relational Capital and Structural Capital, being those determined by competencies related to Human and Relational capitals, and only competencies related to Structural Capital impact positively and directly to business results.","[Garcia-Zambrano, Lidia; Rodriguez-Castellanos, Arturo; Domingo Garcia-Merino, Jose] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Business Adm, Bilbao, Spain; [Carlos Ayala-Calvo, Juan] Univers La Rioja2, Fac Business Adm, La Rioja, Spain",University of Basque Country,"García-Zambrano, L (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Business Adm, Bilbao, Spain.",lidia.garcia@ehu.es; arturo.rodriguez@ehu.es; juan-carlos.ayala@unirioja.es; josedomingo.garcia@ehu.es,"Garcia-Merino, Jose Domingo/AAU-3211-2021; García-Merino, Jose Domingo/HJH-6689-2023","Garcia-Merino, Jose Domingo/0000-0003-3502-9893; García-Merino, Jose Domingo/0000-0003-3502-9893; RODRIGUEZ CASTELLANOS, ARTURO/0000-0002-9436-423X",,,,,57,0,0,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,33,42,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000005,0

This paper aims to analyse the banking system in Romania in terms of its activity efficiency. To achieve this goal we used a number of indicators (consecrated by the literature as being characteristic for measuring these aspects of the banking system's activity).

Indonesia's 2009-14 parliament has been active in economic policymaking, and will leave as its legacy a raft of protectionist legislation. Both presidential candidates, Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo and Prabowo Subianto, have appealed to nationalism in their campaigns, calling for Indonesia to assert its sovereignty and increase its self-sufficiency, but Jokowi's economic platform is more moderate and economically literate than Prabowo's. The incoming president will inherit an economy that continues to slow. Growth is now not expected to approach 6% until 2015 at the earliest. Having engineered a reduction in the current account deficit, Indonesian policymakers now face the more difficult problem of structural fiscal adjustment. Energy subsidies are the most immediate problem, but fiscal reform more generally will emerge as an overriding and unpleasant imperative for whoever wins the presidential election on 9 July. Unless difficult fiscal policy measures are taken, Indonesia will face major trade-offs between deficit control and investment in social programs and economic infrastructure. The new president will struggle to restrict the deficit to the cap of 3% of GDP: a balanced budget will likely not be feasible for several years. He will need to increase the ratio of revenue to GDP and eliminate fuel subsidies-through a more systematic approach than the infrequent price increases of the past. He will need to choose carefully between competing expenditure priorities, such as infrastructure and defence. The new president would also be well advised to tread cautiously in implementing the legal mandates he will inherit, and to work with parliament to avoid further and unwind current earmarking of public expenditure.","[Howes, Stephen; Davies, Robin] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Howes, S (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,44,12,12,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

After 1990 the country has engaged into a long road of health care reforms in order to significantly improve the health system performance and patient satisfaction. The focus of these reforms was mainly on the financing issues, finally transforming the state financed model to an insurance based system, a system that has almost totally ignored the socio-economic and cultural metamorphose of its patients. Liberty, globalization and multiculturalism are the current buzz words, allowing the language of consumerism to progressively incorporate more and more the health care system, and inspiring us to view health just as another simple commodity.

First, communication and managerial competencies were identified. Then, quantitative research was conducted among representatives of the tourism sector. The responses to the questions in the structured questionnaire were rated on a ten-point Likert scale. The differences between the employers' requirements for bachelor and master graduates' communications and managerial competencies were studied applying Fisher discriminant analysis after the proper variables transformation. A principal component analysis was applied to reveal the relations within all sets of data. The results show that employers call for different communication and managerial competencies regarding the level of university degree.","[Kiralova, Alzbeta; Malec, Lukas] Univ Business Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Kiralova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Business Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",kiralova@vso-praha.eu; malec@vso-praha.eu,"Malec, Lukáš/AAC-4978-2021; Kiráľová, Alžbeta/F-9578-2018","Malec, Lukáš/0000-0002-5586-4397; Kiráľová, Alžbeta/0000-0002-7182-1311",,,,,67,0,0,0,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,2389,2399,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300239,0

Did it turn to anybody's mind that Europe will perform in 2013 compared to 2008 almost like in 1934 compared to 1929? Could anyone imagine in 2008 that in 2013-14 many politicians of the EU would regard the quasi 0% growth rate as a success? Did anybody consider possible that the scissors representing the economic performance of the USA and the EU will open significantly (by more than 7%) in favor of the USA even if the crisis originated in America and not in Europe? Probably very few people thought these! This article intends to demonstrate that the main reason for the economic failure of Europe is that economic policies have gone different ways in the United States and in the euro zone. While the primary goals of European policy were the reduction of budget deficits and the restoration of financial investor confidence, the United States has increased the public debt ceiling many times, and the American central bank, in addition to zero interest rate, has continuously announced unprecedented amounts of corporate and government bond purchases. The article intends to show that the crisis management would be much more effective in the euro zone if the ECB applied more expansionary monetary policy and similarly to the FED it announced a quantitative easing program, thus started to purchase treasury bonds of those peripheral states where the unemployment rates are higher than the natural rate of unemployment and where there are large amount of spare capacities. At zero interest rate, at liquidity trap and in case of large amount of spare capacities the expansionary monetary policy causes very low alternative costs and inflation risks. Additionally, the article analyzes the social costs of inflation as well as the main principles and theories of inflation targeting. Then, it reveals its opinion stating that a monetary policy targeting more than one economic indicator would be more successful. Namely, if the ECB did not apply solely inflation targeting, but as in the U.S. business cycle fluctuations (deviations of GDP and unemployment rate from their potential levels) were also taken into account, monetary policy would contribute much more to the success of the European economy. On the other hand, the article also seeks to demonstrate that the reasons for Europe's economic failure go all the way back to the convergence criteria set at the time of euro zone establishment. The criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, incorrectly, do not originate from the optimal currency area theory, so the adaptability to asymmetric shocks is not regarded to be a primary goal. In addition, the SGP-indicators do not consider a lot of factors which have significant effects on long term financial stability. For example, SGP-criteria do not consider (1) how big part of the government's debt is repayable to non-residents, (2) how big part of the government's debt is repayable in foreign currencies, (3) how much the foreign reserves and claims the government has, thus how much the net debt is (4) how much implicit liabilities the government will have in the future (ex. due to pension system benefit payments, recapitalizations of state-owned companies, saving commercial banks in case of financial crises, etc.), (5) how much foreign assets and debts the private sector has, (6) what the debt structure of the private sector is (how big part is payable to non-residents and how big part is payable in foreign currencies), (7) what the position and the structure of the balance of payments show, etc. The article's conclusion suggests a radical revision of the SGP-criteria and it recommends that the future economic policies (fiscal and monetary policies as well) should focus rather on the balance of payments and on the net national debt ratios (including both government and private sector debts) instead of budget deficits and simply gross government debt ratios.","[Krisztian, Kertesz A.] Corvinus Univ Budapest, H-1087 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,,kertesz.krisztian@avf.hu,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,9,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,279,294,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200021,0

The most important rule of marketing is information placement (in this case, the tourist offer). Therefore, traditional advertising models that have prevailed so far, cease to be important. Internet and social networks took the leading role which brought the revolution in marketing activities. Tourism is certainly one of the economic activities where the use of social networks has greatest success potential. Sharing photos, status, location and tips is interesting and fun, and entertainment and leisure is one of the main reasons for being on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and other platforms. Through this interesting contents on social networks tourism subjects or destinations can increase visibility and define destination brands, attract new guests who will then with one click attract new potential guests and thus increase the revenue.

However, despite of the fact, that many papers and models have been proposed, knowledge creation, and organisational learning, still pose a challenge for managers. This is mainly due to the nature and complexity of the knowledge on one hand, and the fact, that while looking for new knowledge, organisations simultaneously need to exploit existing knowledge, on the other hand. This creates significant tension between exploration and exploitation as the opposite aims and goals are related to each other processes. We believe that this can be alleviated by well - being activities, and especially Metal Age Method.

In order to do this, we distinguish between tradable and non-tradable goods to take into account the fact that the presence of non-tradable goods in this economy is one of the largest in the world. We estimate a DSGE model with supply and demand shocks (sectorial productivity, public spending, international real interest rate and preferences) using Kalman Filter techniques. We find the following results. First of all, our variance decomposition analysis suggests that 1) the preference shock basically accounts for private consumption volatility 2) the idiosyncratic productivity shock accounts for non tradable output volatility; and 3) the sectorial productivity shock along with the international interest rate both greatly account for tradable output. Secondly, the model closely replicates the time path observed in the data for the Spanish economy and finally, the model captures the main cyclical qualitative features of this economy reasonably well.

The agriculture sector contributes significantly to the economic growth in Malaysia and in ensuring food security in the country. The recent occurrence of staple food crisis affecting many countries became severe when India, Vietnam and China had limited the exporting of rice to other countries. The overall development of paddy sector under the agricultural framework initiatives are carefully planned and implemented in the recent Economic Transformation Program (ETP). The aim of the initiatives is not only to ensure national food security but also to tap into the global market as the world population continues to grow driving for an increase in the demand. One of the quick win initiatives by the government in overcoming the crisis is to increase the soil fertility for paddy planting which requires promotion of new technology and rigorous research.

European states are in need of restrictive banking policies aimed at encouraging local savings. It is only by increasing real capital accumulation, that Europe can have a healthy economy which can generate the much needed economic growth. I will elaborate on the idea that easy money policies push the real economy towards an equilibrium point which cannot be reached in the current conditions, allocating scarce factors of production in a wasteful manner. It is of paramount importance to point out that cheap credit cannot be a substitute for capital accumulation.

This study addresses the electricity planning of units allocation based on the available resources, considering an increase in wind capacity. A simplified short term electricity planning approach is proposed resulting in a non-linear optimization model, aiming to demonstrate that this new model can bring considerable advantages for energy decision makers. The model is applied for the particular case of the foreseen electricity system in Portugal in 2020. The results demonstrate that in general the simplified version leads to a possible underestimation of costs comparatively to extended version but rather similar values for CO2 emissions. In what concerns to the model running time, a significant reduction can be achieved which means that the simplified approach may be used with significant benefits in the computational time. The model is also used for the analysis of different wind power scenarios, leading to results close to the ones obtained with the extended version.","[Pereira, Sergio; Ferreira, Paula] Univ Minho, Ctr Ind & Technol Management, Braga, Portugal; [Vaz, A.

A large part of Czech population has already shopped online. Customers view it as a quick and convenient shopping where they can save money. But what are the other factors that influence their shopping behaviour? This paper tries to find the answer to this question. Each customer is an individual therefore models of customer behaviour often cannot be generalized, particularly not on the Internet which offers many shopping options and procedures how to select, try and buy a given product. The online business activities of companies are still expanding. Internet marketing together with mobile marketing is gaining momentum, because the amount of customers who are online has been increasing rapidly.

Wavelet decomposition of the original time series is useful in characterizing the oil-stock price relationship at different time scales, in revealing contagion and interdependence between oil and stock prices (as in the recent global financial crisis) and in analysing oil lead and lag effects on stock prices through wavelet cross-correlation. Empirical evidence for the period June 2000 to July 2011 indicates that oil price changes had no effect on stock market returns in the pre-crisis period at either the aggregate or sectoral level (with the exception of oil and gas company stock). At both levels, however, with the onset of the financial crisis we found evidence of contagion and positive interdependence between these markets. Additionally, we found no evidence of lead and lag effects in the pre-crisis period, and so reject the underreaction hypothesis. Since the onset of the financial crisis, oil price leads stock prices and vice versa for higher frequencies, whereas for lower frequencies oil and stock prices lead each other in a complex way.

It stipulates the use of biofuels and of other renewable fuels, for transport mainly, as part of the European Union policy on the decrease of the reliance on energy import and on the diminishing of gas release that generates the greenhouse effect. The total production capacity was of 22.120.000 tonnes of biodiesel in 2011, a value that places Europe on the first rank globally. Despite the data, the production capacity of biodiesel in the European Union followed a descendent trend. This decrease is due to the fact that many production plants on the territory of these states have ceased production and were put on standby, due to very low or inexistent sales. The fact that the price of imported biodiesel was more competitive has determined fuel sellers to make this choice. Thus, there are deep consequences for the whole European Union economy.","[Robu, Alexandru Dragos; Costuleanu, Carmen Luiza] Ion Ionescu de la Brad Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Ias, Dept Agroecon, Iasi, Romania","Iasi University of Life Sciences, Romania","Robu, AD (通讯作者)，Ion Ionescu de la Brad Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Ias, Dept Agroecon, Iasi, Romania.",ccostuleanu@yahoo.com,"Costuleanu, Carmen Luiza/D-8165-2011; Robu, Alexandru Dragos/U-4061-2017; Robu, Alexandru Dragos/HLP-6012-2023",,,,,,4,1,1,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1974,1981,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300199,0

We find that in the presence of sovereign default, macroeconomic stability requires monetary policy to be passive if the feedback from debt surprises back to the primary surplus is too weak. An active monetary policy can however only contribute to the stabilization inflation and output, if the primary surplus is increasing in debt with a slope that increases with the default probability. The results are relevant for the design of fiscal and monetary policy in emerging markets where sovereign credibility is not well established. Recent debt developments in Western Europe and in the United States suggest these results may become relevant for more mature financial markets too once the current low inflation period is over.","[Schabert, Andreas] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [van Wijnbergen, Sweder J.

Our main target for the first part of the paper is to identify based on the most relevant sources from the literature the defining characteristics of these creative & innovative regional clusters. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the development of the urban areas in order to identify the most important regional innovative clusters from our country, Romania. The focus is on the geographical and the sector distribution and structural analysis of the selected clusters. Regional innovative & creative clusters support mostly the start-up companies but also help the existing ones to develop ( by reducing input costs and by increasing the sales market, through the new opportunities offered by the creative and innovative clusters). They also allow the firms to use in a smart, efficient and effective way the local resources in order to develop their business rapidly and to maintain next the competitive advantage from the long-run perspective. As a general conclusion we consider that by taking into account the implications of the regional innovative and creative clusters mostly on the creative industries, it might have positive network externalities on the competitiveness and sustainability mostly for the local development of the smart, creative and innovative local communities. Therefore we have a strong believe that mostly for regions in the emergent countries like Romania we have to pay a greater importance to the role of the creative-innovative clusters within the socio and economic long run competitiveness and development.","[Suciu, Marta-Christina; Florea, Cristina-Andreea] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Suciu, MC (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",Christina.suciu@economie.ase.ro; Cristina.andreeaf@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,3,3,0,11,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,240,248,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000030,0

At the end of the period 1989 - 2011, the annual net investment in agriculture was about 6 times lower and fixed capitalization about 4 times higher compared to 1989. In the same period, GVA in agriculture experienced a strong relative decline as share in national economy (from 23.7% (1990) to 6.4% (2010)); however, agriculture maintained its social buffer role throughout the investigated period, as this sector still uses a large labour input, yet poorly remunerated and with a deficient endowment in production factors that could contribute to increased yields. Using data from the national accounts, the input-output tables and the Chennery - Watanabe and Rasmussen method, it resulted that the Romanian agri-food sector simultaneously presents a double hypostasis: client, through backward linkages and supplier, through forward linkages for the remaining branches, their cumulative economic driving effects (upstream + downstream) being about 4.8 monetary units and 4.7 monetary units respectively.

The theory of planned behaviour states that while the formation of intentions normally precedes behaviour, several factors affect the realisation of the intended behaviour. Therefore, the usefulness of ex-ante surveys for predicting farmers' behaviour requires more attention to reduce the potential biases in such analyses. The paper investigates how well the farmers' intentions correspond with the behaviour in cases of farm exits, continuation of farming and farm size changes in Estonia. Based on the farm survey in 2007, the follow-up survey in 2011, and paying agency's registry data, the ex-ante data on the intentions is combined with ex-post data on actual behaviour. A recursive bivariate probit regression is used to study the effects of selected socioeconomic characteristics on the probabilities of intended and realised behaviour, and the effects of stated intentions on actual behaviour. The results indicate that the usefulness of intentions in predicting actual behaviour differs, depending on the nature of the question in the farm life cycle context. Intentions are found to be a better predictor of actual behaviour when the considered event is regarded as positive (continuation of farming and farm growth) rather than negative (farm exit or farm shrinkage).","[Viira, Ants-Hannes; Poeder, Anne; Vaernik, Rando] Estonian Univ Life Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Viira, AH (通讯作者)，Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Kreutzwaldi St 1, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",ants.viira@emu.ee,"Poder, Anne/A-9600-2014","Poder, Anne/0000-0003-1402-1948",,,,,49,13,15,0,13,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

A rigorous review of contemporary literature has been complemented with an empirical analysis including implied volatility measurements, resulting in a detailed appraisal of the market. Even though statistical option-valuation models have already been available and generally known, these were not used by practitioners. Instead, a heuristic approach based on perfect familiarity with intrinsic valuation and hedging as well as time-value drivers, effectively used since the 19th century, has resulted in surprisingly efficient pricing, constrained rather than by information assymmetries primarily by transaction costs and, over a relatively brief period in 1932-33, by crisis-related liquidity issues in the market.","Univ Finance & Adm, CZ-10100 Prague 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Vlachy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, CZ-10100 Prague 10, Czech Republic.",jan@vlachy.cz,,"Vlachy, Jan/0000-0002-2270-3247",,,,,41,1,1,0,6,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The Priority Action 3 of the HFA demand for a global call to governments and others to use knowledge, innovation and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels. Evidence suggests that there are only very few effective initiatives that have been implemented by stakeholders and especially in the higher education sector where the future policy makers and practitioners are educated and trained. This creates a significant challenge as the ten year plan of the HFA is coming to an end in 2015. This paper attempts to view the world in post-HFA and propose a framework on mapping and integrating disaster risk reduction into formal, informal and non-formal education at policy, practice and community levels. A case study approach was used to examine how the HFA has been embraced into a disaster resilience related higher education programme. The study argues that integrating disaster resilience into education is a key factor for reducing the adverse impact of future disasters. The suggested framework provides an insight into current gaps in knowledge, innovation and education and proposes solutions for effective integration of disaster resilience education at all levels.

The largest benefits obtain when the change to IFRS reporting is combined with change in enforcement.

TARP was originally intended to stabilize the financial sector through the increased capitalization of banks. However, recipients of TARP funds were then encouraged to make additional loans despite increased borrower risk. In this paper, we consider the effect of the TARP capital injections on bank risk-taking by analyzing the risk ratings of banks' commercial loan originations during the crisis. The results indicate that, relative to non-TARP banks, the risk of loan originations increased at large TARP banks but decreased at small TARP banks. Loan levels also moved in different directions for large and small banks and, in supporting evidence, these effects are evaluated based on loan size and TARP repayment. For large banks, the increase in risk-taking without an increase in lending is suggestive of moral hazard due to government support. These results may also be due to the conflicting goals of the TARP program for bank recapitalization and bank lending.

However, while deletion has no significant effect on analyst coverage and shadow cost, we find a rebound in the institutional ownership and liquidity of deleted stocks.

This method enables us to analyse an asymmetric short and long-run relationship between nominal exchange rate and domestic inflation rate. According to alternative calculations of depreciation and appreciation series, our results indicate that depreciation is passed through prices in the long run for all alternative series in expansion cycle, but appreciation is only passed through if the appreciation rate is calculated by more than four previous periods. Our findings further suggest that the magnitude of depreciation on prices is larger than appreciation. However, in the short run, although depreciation is passed through to the prices, appreciation is not. This finding implies that prices are sticky downwards but flexible upwards in the short run and business cycle is the main source of asymmetry.","[Cicek, Serkan] Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Fethiye Business Fac, Dept Econ & Finance, TR-48300 Fethiye, Mugla, Turkey; [Boz, Cigdem] Maltepe Univ, FEAS, Dept Econ, TR-34857 Istanbul, Turkey",Mugla Sitki Kocman University; Maltepe University,"Çiçek, S (通讯作者)，Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Fethiye Business Fac, Dept Econ & Finance, TR-48300 Fethiye, Mugla, Turkey.",serkan.cicek@mu.edu.tr; cigdemboz@maltepe.edu.tr,"ÇİÇEK, SERKAN/A-4217-2018; cicek, serkan/AAH-1766-2019",,,,,,23,5,6,0,12,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Using bank-level data for countries in Eastern Europe and Latin America, we analyze the growth of banks' total gross loans as well as the growth of corporate, consumer, and residential mortgage loans. While domestic private banks in Eastern Europe and Latin America contracted their loan growth rates during the crisis, there are notable differences in foreign and government-owned bank credit growth across regions. In Eastern Europe, foreign bank total lending fell by more than domestic private bank credit. These results are primarily driven by reductions in corporate loans. Furthermore, government-owned banks in Eastern Europe did not act counter-cyclically. The opposite is true in Latin America, where the growth of government-owned banks' corporate and consumer loans during the crisis exceeded that of domestic and foreign banks. Contrary to the case of foreign banks in Eastern Europe, those in Latin America did not fuel loan growth prior to the crisis. Also, there are less pronounced and robust differences in the behavior of foreign and domestic banks during the crisis in Latin America. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We test an underlying theory that suggests that in societies with limited tax enforcement, the presence of informality constrains the set of pledgeable fiscal policy alternatives, increases public debt and the implied probability of sovereign debt restructuring. The hypotheses that we test in our empirical analysis are: a larger size of the informal sector is associated with (1) higher public indebtedness, (2) higher interest rates paid on sovereign debt, (3) a higher level of financial instability and( 4) a higher probability of sovereign default. The empirical results from cross-country panel regressions show that after controlling for previously highlighted variables in the literature that could explain the variation in financial instability, sovereign default risk and public indebtedness, the size of informality remains as a significant determinant of these variables.

It recognises the continued widespread application of model free approaches within many trading and risk management functions. Our analysis of the relative characteristics of four model-free volatility estimates is framed around their relative long memory effects as measured by the feasible exact local Whittle estimator. For a cross-section of sixteen FTSE-100 stocks, for the period 1997-2007, we show that 5-min realized volatility exhibits a higher level of volatility persistence than approaches that use data in a sparse way (close-to-close volatility, high-low volatility and Yang & Zhang volatility). This observation is a useful decision-tool for a trading and risk management decisions that are undertaken in a time-constrained task environment. It recommends that the use of sparse data (open, high, low and closing price observations) requires trader intuition and judgement to build long-memory effects into their pricing.

In this critical review, we examine the law, regulatory guidance, academic research, and agency practice pertinent to equity analysis. We find that recommendations are extensive but generally lack specificity and are rarely enforceable. In the absence of detailed guidance, practice has become dominated by a single method that has foundations in the spatial analysis of environmental exposures and the neighborhood effects literature. We argue that this method is not appropriate for the analysis of transportation investment benefits, in part because target populations must be defined a priori based on demographic thresholds for areal units rather than on the basis of exposure. Further, it does not represent the travel behavior of Title VI-protected populations adequately, most notably people of color. Newer travel demand modeling paradigms are capable of sidestepping methodological problems, and legacy models can be adapted and improved. However, agencies generally have not shifted from traditional methods and planners do not view race as a variable relevant to travel behavior. By relying on an analytical technique that is not likely to reflect the travel behavior of people of color, planning agencies reduce the likelihood that racially disparate outcomes will be identified and mitigated. Meaningful transportation equity analyses must include an assessment of both current and near-term conditions and provide racially specific outcomes, while seeking to mitigate inequities through programming decisions.

By using micro-level data for over 20 European countries that directly measure individual characteristics, corruption experiences, gender roles, trust and values to examine the determinants of corruption, this paper goes beyond the search for associations between various macro factors and perceptions of corruption that is prevalent in the economic literature. One focus of the paper is on how cultural norms such as gender roles and risk preferences influence corruption and whether there are gender differences in the determinants of corruption. In addition, this paper also seeks to determine if there are contagion effects in corruption at the microlevel. Using a seemingly unrelated probit approach, this paper provides empirical estimates of how past experiences with corruption affects both how bribery is viewed and the actual act of offering a bribe.

In this paper we define risk management in terms of choosing from a variety of risk models, and discuss the selection of optimal risk models. A new approach to model selection for predicting VaR is proposed, consisting of combining alternative risk models, and we compare conservative and aggressive strategies for choosing between VaR models.

We find that after the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 in 1998, firms opting to discontinue disclosure of geographic earnings in their financial reports have lower worldwide effective tax rates. These results are consistent with managers perceiving that non-disclosure of geographic earnings helps mask tax avoidance behavior. However, the relation between tax avoidance and non-disclosure reduces after implementation of Schedule M-3 in the annual corporate tax filing beginning in 2004. Schedule M-3 requires a detailed reconciliation of book income to tax income and aims to make firms' tax avoidance activities associated with shifting profits to lower-tax foreign jurisdictions more apparent to the IRS. This study contributes to our understanding of the relation between financial reporting behavior and tax reporting behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, cointegrating errors of real exchange rates (RERs) are highly persistent but mean-reverting. Our findings contrast with all previous studies that restrict their investigations to the traditional I(1)/I(0) cointegration. Since RERs are tied through along memory process, empirical models of G-PPP theory that ignore such a feature should be misspecified.

However, in DEA models, the risk and return factors may be valued differently for different equity markets. A measure that incorporates the risk and return factor values of other equity markets to assess the performance of a given equity market is cross-efficiency. The cross-efficiency of an equity market provides a global perspective of its performance. In this paper, each year from 2003 to 2011, we estimate the cross-efficiency of 40 equity markets in a multi-dimensional risk-adjusted return framework.

Results from a panel of 86 countries over the 1990-2005 period suggest that overall economic freedom has a significant positive effect on subjective well-being. Its dimensions legal security and property rights, sound money, and regulation are in particular strong predictors of higher well-being. The overall positive effect is not affected by socio-demographics; the effects of individual dimensions vary, however. Developing countries profit more from higher economic freedom, in particular from reducing the regulatory burden.

These incongruent attentional biases in the processing of positive and negative outcomes of risky options can explain why people tend to avoid risky options in a gain frame but tend to choose risky options in a loss frame. In line with our expectations, Experiment 1 revealed incongruent effects of framing on attentional biases for positive vs. negative stimuli in an evaluation task. In addition, valence bias predicted risk-seeking vs. risk-averse decisions and mediated the effect of framing on decision making. Two additional experiments investigated effects of valence biases on risky decision making by manipulating affective processing directly with an attention training task. Inducing a positivity (negativity) bias produced risk-seeking (risk-averse) decision behavior by enhancing the salience of win- or loss-related information in a gambling task with ambivalent color stimuli (Experiment 2) and by enhancing the impact of gain or loss outcomes on decision making in a coin toss (Experiment 3).

In response to the literature on the international comparison of bank efficiency, we draw the attention to a local dimension of comparison. By introducing geographical weights and estimating local frontiers for each US savings bank in the 2001-09 period, we find that the bank technical performance is higher for most banks in comparison to a fixed-effects approach. This result highlights the importance of taking into account the local environment and constraints while analyzing banks' performance, so as not to consider the factors that are exogenous to these institutions as inefficiencies.

We find that although policy expectations and visions of transport system innovation are still very much focused on motor vehicle technology change in both countries, particularly technological substitution, there are nonetheless indications of acceptance of transport demand reduction policies, which in turn may be regarded as a form of social innovation. Given the importance of transport demand reduction as part of GHG emissions and congestion reduction strategies, there is a need to better understand how policy for social innovation is entering the sphere of transport and related innovation policy and how these processes might be supported.

Using a simple theoretical model, we show that traffic flows in mainline lanes unambiguously decrease when fuel prices increase, and this effect is stronger when the presence of a carpool lane provides a substitute to driving alone. In contrast, in carpool (HOV) lanes flow can either increase or decrease. These predictions are tested using 8 years of traffic flow data for 1700 locations in Los Angeles. In our preferred specification, the mean elasticity of flow with respect to fuel price is 0.136 for HOV lanes. For a 10% increase in fuel price this implies 10 additional carpools per hour, $8.8 million per year in additional congestion costs for carpoolers and $11.3 million lower costs for mainline drivers. For mainline lanes, flow elasticities are 0.083 and 0.050 for highways with and without an HOV lane. These estimates imply that the mean highway with an HOV lane experiences a 30% larger decrease in hourly flow compared to the mean highway without an HOV lane. Flows in HOV lanes show an immediate decrease following a price increase but respond positively to price increases over time, which suggests time is an important input to carpool formation.

The Survival Prospects of Ugandan Non-Governmental Organisations,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This study examines survival patterns in a large, representative panel of Ugandan non-governmental organisations (NGOs) between 2002 and 2008. It finds no evidence that more effective or more altruistic NGOs have a greater likelihood of survival. The main determinant of survival appears to be access to grants, and NGOs without grants struggle to survive. An investigation of the grant allocation mechanism suggests that effectiveness does not increase an NGO's likelihood of receiving a grant. Grant allocation appears to be neither fair nor effective, but rather to be awarded on the basis of habit rather than merit: once a grant has been allocated there is a strong tendency for it to persist. The odds are stacked against small NGOs that have not previously received grants. A picture emerges of two parallel NGO worlds: one where revenues are small, variable and hard to come by and survival is not very likely, and the other where revenues are high, more stable and more accessible and survival is more likely. The study suggests it may be difficult for an NGO to move from the former to the latter.","[Burger, Ronelle] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Owens, Trudy] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NR7 2RD, England",Stellenbosch University; University of Nottingham,"Owens, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NR7 2RD, England.",trudy.owens@nottingham.ac.uk,"Burger, Ronelle/N-5203-2017","Burger, Ronelle/0000-0003-2463-5265; Owens, Trudy/0000-0001-8676-2919",,,,,32,19,25,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

We also point out potential tax planning strategies that could be employed pre- and post-effective date of the implementation of a participation exemption system that would change the expected revenue to be received during the transition to such a system.","[Donohoe, Michael P.] Univ Illinois, Dept Accountancy, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [McGill, Gary A.] Univ Florida, Fisher Sch Accounting, Gainesville, FL USA; [Outslay, Edmund] Michigan State Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Michigan State University,"Donohoe, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Accountancy, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",mdonohoe@illinois.edu; mcgill@ufl.edu; outslay@bus.msu.edu,,,,,,,35,7,8,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Three motives, namely, strategic choices, altruism, and greenwashing, suggest that the relationship between CSR and FP is positive, non-negative, and non-existent, respectively. We obtained our sample, which covered 2003-2009, from the Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRIS) databank and Bankscope database. The data consists of 162 banks in 22 countries. We then classified the banks into four types based on their degree of engagement in CSR. This study proposes the use of an extended version of the Heckman two-step regression, in which the first step adopts a multinomial logit model, and the second step estimates the performance equation with the inverse Mills ratio generated by the first step. The empirical results show that CSR positively associates with FP in terms of return on assets, return on equity, net interest income, and non-interest income. In contrast, CSR negatively associates with non-performing loans. Hence, strategic choice is the primary motive of banks to engage in CSR. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we first develop a two-population mortality model with transitory jump effects, and then we use the proposed model and an economic-pricing framework to examine how mortality jumps may affect the supply and demand of mortality-linked securities.","[Zhou, Rui] Univ Manitoba, Warren Ctr Actuarial Studies & Res, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Li, Johnny Siu-Hang; Tan, Ken Seng] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Manitoba; University of Waterloo,"Zhou, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Warren Ctr Actuarial Studies & Res, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",rui.zhou@ad.umanitoba.ca; shli@uwaterloo.ca; kstan@uwaterloo.ca,,"Zhou, Rui/0000-0002-0071-4703",,,,,40,41,42,1,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

It argues that it is important to consider these aspects of population change and environment together in order to understand the reality of any mitigation that may be made. Following a review of research which is beginning to address not only the environmental impact of population growth, but also of changes in density, distribution and composition, the paper turns to explore the interaction of population composition and density with environmental change through addressing interactions between migration, ageing populations and climate change. It considers a key population question facing the EU, that of the demographic deficit, and addresses how the mitigating role of migration will be affected by future climate change. It thus considers whether migration is a valid policy approach in the context of Europe's demographic deficit and the impact of climate change on this relationship.","Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Harper, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",sarah.harper@ageing.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,122,17,19,10,86,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The analysis allows for the facts that US states are part of a wider monetary and economic union with free factor mobility across all states and that state residents and firms may purchase goods from neighboring states. Those purchases may generate economic spillovers across neighbors. Estimates suggest that states can increase their own state employment by increasing their own deficits. There is evidence of spillovers to employment in neighboring states defined by common cyclical patterns among state economies. For large states, aggregate spillovers to its economic neighbors are approximately two-thirds of the large state's job growth. Because of significant spillovers and possible incentives to free-ride, there is a potential case to actively coordinate (i.e., centralize) the management of stabilization policies. Finally, the job effects of a temporary increase in state own deficits persist for at most one to two years, and there is evidence of a negative impact on state jobs when these deficits are scheduled for repayment.

This situation can be described as queuing behind a bottleneck whose capacity declines when the queue is large. We combine such a variable-capacity bottleneck with Vickrey scheduling preferences for the special case, where there are only two possible levels of capacity. Solving the model leads to several new insights, including that the marginal cost of adding a traveler is especially sensitive to the lowest level of capacity reached. We analyze an optimal toll, a coarse toll, and metering, showing substantial benefits from using these policies to eliminate the period of reduced capacity. Under hypercongestion, all of these policies can be designed so that travelers gain even without considering any toll revenues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

With the exception of several discrete step adjustments, central banks keep maintaining passive stocks of gold, independently of the patterns of the real price of gold. We also observe the synchronization of gold sales by central banks, as most reduced their positions in tandem, and their tendency to report international reserves valuation excluding gold positions. Our analysis suggests that the intensity of holding gold is correlated with 'global power' - by the history of being a past empire, or by the sheer size of a country, especially by countries that are or were the suppliers of key currencies. These results are consistent with the view that central bank's gold position signals economic might, and that gold retains the stature of a 'safe haven' asset at times of global turbulence. The under-reporting of gold positions in the international reserve/GDP statistics is consistent with loss aversion, wishing to maintain a sizeable gold position, while minimizing the criticism that may occur at a time when the price of gold declines.

After accounting for standard hedge fund pricing factors, we quantify the common latent factor in hedge fund style index returns and model its time-varying behavior using a dynamic factor framework featuring Markov regime-switching. We find that three regimes-crash, low mean and high mean-are necessary to provide a complete description of joint hedge fund return dynamics. We also document significant time variation in the alpha generating ability of all hedge fund investment styles. The period following the stock market crash of 2000 is dominated by the persistent low return state while the long bull market of 1990s is associated with the strongest performance of the industry generating high positive returns. We also investigate drivers of the regime shifts in the common latent pricing factor and find that both flight to safety and large funding liquidity shocks play an important role in explaining the abrupt shift of the common factor to the crash state.

We find that the state-controlled firms in China pay higher dividends (measured by the dividend yield and the dividend payout ratio) than the privately controlled firms. We also find that as the control chain of the firm lengthens, the firm pays lower dividends. We conclude that the privately controlled firms in China pay lower dividends than the state-controlled firms because the former are more capital-constrained in obtaining external equity and long-term debt, other things being equal, and depend more on internal equity to finance growth. The negative association between the length of the control chain and dividends comes from a greater use of investable funds among Chinese firms under corporate pyramids, which is one of the features of the internal capital markets for firms under pyramid structures.

Hypothesis tests indicate that, in both crisis and precrisis years, difficult-to-fail-and-unwind (DFU) banks enjoyed substantially higher ex ante benefits than other institutions. Compared to the US sample, safety-net benefits prove significantly larger for DFU firms in Europe and bailout decisions are less driven by asset size. Introducing a proxy for differences in government susceptibility to regulatory capture helps to explain bailout decisions in Europe.

We investigate whether and to what extent the impact of regulations on entrepreneurship is dependent on corruption. We first test whether regulations robustly deter firm entry into markets. Our results show that the existence of a larger number of procedures required to start a business, as well as larger minimum capital requirements are detrimental to entrepreneurship. Second, we test whether corruption reduces the negative impact of regulations on entrepreneurship in highly regulated economies. Our empirical analysis, covering a maximum of 43 countries over the 2003-2005 period, shows that corruption facilitates firm entry in highly regulated economies. For example, the 'greasing' effect of corruption kicks in at around 50 days required to start a new business. Our results thus provide support for the 'grease the wheels' hypothesis.","[Dreher, Axel] Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Dreher, Axel] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Dreher, Axel] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Dreher, Axel; Gassebner, Martin] ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Dreher, Axel; Gassebner, Martin] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Gottingen; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Ifo Institut,"Dreher, A (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",mail@axel-dreher.de; gassebner@kof.ethz.ch,"Gassebner, Martin/E-9967-2013; Dreher, Axel/AAN-1839-2020","Dreher, Axel/0000-0002-7227-3599",,,,,65,360,363,5,140,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2013,155.0,3-4,,,,,413,432,,10.1007/s11127-011-9871-2,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,138NQ,,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",Y,N,2024-03-09,WOS:000318515700012,0

We test one aspect of this hypothesis using a cross-sectional panel dataset of small banks located in Texas from 1994 to 2002. Our results suggest that small banks located in smaller counties escalate their commitment to bad loans when compared with those located in larger counties, even after controlling for psychological and social factors that influence escalation tendencies. These results highlight the need for small banks to trade-off the positive benefits of adopting a relationship banking strategy against its unintended negative consequence. We provide some suggestions on how small banks may lessen their escalation tendencies despite adopting a relationship banking strategy. The results of this study also suggest that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that develop strong relational bonds with small banks may benefit from continued access to credit facilities, especially during periods when they experience financial distress.","[Kang, Eugene] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Strategy Management & Org, Nanyang Business Sch, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Zardkoohi, Asghar; Paetzold, Ramona L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Fraser, Donald] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Finance, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Nanyang Technological University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Kang, E (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Strategy Management & Org, Nanyang Business Sch, Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",aslkang@ntu.edu.sg; Zardkoohi@tamu.edu; rpaetzold@mays.tamu.edu; D-Fraser@tamu.edu,,"Kang, Eugene/0000-0002-5648-1507",,,,,92,9,12,2,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Treating bankruptcy as a special case of distress, we find that diversification reduces the likelihood of bankruptcy and liquidation in Chapter 11, which is consistent with the coinsurance hypothesis. However, we observe higher bankruptcy costs as measured by time spent in Chapter 11 and inefficient segment investment for diversified firms. Our evidence is consistent with the idea that diversification provides benefits to managers in terms of job security rather than to firms. Our findings may help firms to make diversification decisions and creditors determine lending policies toward different forms of organizations.

Panel regressions show that worsening financial conditions discourage exports by reducing both the variety of goods exported and the export volumes of individual goods. This study also develops a DSGE model to clarify this finding, featuring financial shocks, enforcement constraint, and firm entry. In the event of a credit crunch, worsening financial conditions would reduce firm borrowing capability, forcing firms to decrease production, and thus, decrease firm profit and firm value. As exporters face larger fixed costs in production, they are more sensitive to financial constraints. Consequently, a credit crunch reduces individual firm exports and discourages potential entrants from entering the export market, which in turn decreases aggregate exports. The proposed model can also explain the phenomenon of trade decreasing more than GDP, as observed in the most recent financial crisis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Applying the instrumental variable threshold regressions approach to cross-sectional data for 85 countries, it finds that social capability such as human capital, financial development, and political institutions defines the impacts of trade and FDI on domestic investment. Particularly, trade adversely affects investment in low-human-capital, less-financially-developed, or more-corrupted countries, but positively affects it in countries with opposite attributes. In contrast. FDI has a positive effect on investment in countries with low human capital, less-developed financial sectors, or high corruption, but a negative impact in countries with opposite attributes.

The main results are that an improvement in financial development increases the probability of exporting of more productive plants and those with foreign ownership operating in manufacturing sectors that are more dependent on external finance. Our estimates also show that financial development does not appear to improve the probability of exporting for relatively smaller and younger plants. This result suggests that, at least for the case of exporting in Chile, smaller and younger plants are not necessarily more likely to benefit than larger and older plants from improvements in access to credit.","[Alvarez, Roberto] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Ricardo A.] Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Sachar Int Ctr, Waltham, MA 02454 USA",Universidad de Chile; Brandeis University,"López, RA (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Sachar Int Ctr, Mail Stop MS 032,415 South St, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",rlopez@brandeis.edu,,,,,,,36,7,10,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Because of the shift from controlled to market economies and accompanying crises, failed policy regimes and changes in exchange rate regimes, unit root tests for transition countries often require allowance for structural changes. Accounting for structural breaks gives substantially faster mean-reversion speeds than those found for major industrialized countries. These fast adjustment speeds are plausible: Transition countries had perhaps 10 years to make unprecedented adjustments required for accession to the European Union. A number of papers have applied non-linear models to the Central and Eastern European countries. This paper investigates four non-linear models and compares them with piece-wise linear break models. The break models appear superior in detecting mean reversion for the Central and Eastern European transition countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

When considering improvements in the borrower's creditworthiness as one of the reasons for refinancing mortgages, we show that refinancing penalties can be welfare improving and that they can be particularly beneficial to riskier borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates, reduced defaults, and increased availability of credit. Thus, a high concentration of prepayment penalties among the riskiest borrowers can be an outcome of efficient equilibrium in a mortgage market.

Our data are from a unique survey of firms in Lebanon. The findings complement studies of large firms with foreign currency loans from foreign lenders. Exporters, naturally hedged against currency risk, are more likely to incur dollar debt. Firms also partly hedge themselves by passing currency risk to customers and suppliers. Less opaque firms with easily verifiable collateral and higher net worth are more likely to access dollar credit. Firms reliant on formal financing (banks and supplier credit) are more likely to contract dollar debt than firms reliant on informal financing (family, friends and moneylenders). Bank relationships, however, do not increase the dollar debt likelihood. And finally, profitable firms are less likely to have dollar debt. Information frictions and limited collateral, therefore, constrain dollar credit even when it is intermediated domestically. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Second, daily risk premia co-move with US macro variables and corporate default risk. Third, global factors explain most of Latin American countries' premia, and local factors best explain European and Asian premia. The importance of global factors grows over time.

However, given an observed futures price, a deterministic seasonal component at the price level is not relevant for the pricing of commodity options. In contrast, this is not true for the seasonal pattern observed in the volatility of the commodity price. Analyzing an extensive sample of soybean, corn, heating oil and natural gas options, we find that seasonality in volatility is an important aspect to consider when valuing these contracts. The inclusion of an appropriate seasonality adjustment significantly reduces pricing errors in these markets and yields more improvement in valuation accuracy than increasing the number of stochastic factors.

Inflation uncertainty is measured as the conditional variance generated by a Fractionally Integrated Smooth Transition Autoregressive Moving Average-Asymmetric Power ARCH (FISTARMA-APARCH) model. The distinguishing feature of our approach from the previous studies is the determination of the sign of the Granger causality relationship between inflation and its uncertainty over time. First, using a rolling VAR model, we show that the relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty is time varying with frequent breaks. Second, using the MS-VAR model, we obtain strong evidence in favour of the Holland's stabilizing Fed hypothesis for Canada, France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States.

Consequently, we demonstrate that competition policy has a clearer role in promoting a higher rate of innovation in that event. Hence, we identify one reason why the strength of the two policies may be complements from the perspective of increasing the rate of entrepreneurial innovation.","[Gans, Joshua S.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Persson, Lars] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Toronto; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Persson, L (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",joshua.gans@gmail.com; lars.persson@ifn.se,,"Gans, Joshua/0000-0001-6567-5859",,,,,37,14,17,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The story essentially claimed that the mortgage investment strategy of the hedge fund Magnetar during the period between 2006 and mid 2007 was based on a desire to construct CDO deals with riskier assets so that they could place bets that portions of their own deals would fail. This paper provides several pieces of evidence in line with the argument that tranches from Magnetar-sponsored CDOs present overly risky investments. However, investors and rating agencies appear to have adjusted their required spread levels and ratings to reflect this higher riskiness, at least to some extent. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using South African data this paper investigates the relationship between export destination and wages at a worker level. South Africa, a middle-income country, has two distinct main export marketsa regional market where per capita incomes are lower than at home, and an international market with higher per capita incomes. Our estimates show that workers in firms that export to the region earn less than those that produce for the domestic market. Those in firms that export outside the region earn more than either domestic producers or region-only exporters. Much of this difference in wages can be explained by the premium the different types of exporters pay for skills. These results support previous studies which suggest that export destination is related to product quality which in turn is related to worker quality and therefore wages.","[Rankin, Neil] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Schoeer, Volker] Univ Witwatersrand, African Microecon Res Unit, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; University of Witwatersrand,"Rankin, N (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",Neil.rankin@wits.ac.za; Volker.schoer@wits.ac.za,"Schöer, Volker/Q-8024-2019","Schöer, Volker/0000-0002-6382-2015; Rankin, Neil/0000-0001-8825-3341",,,,,19,13,13,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Our simulation results show the following. First, the TP estimators can have biases larger than 100% of true risk prices when data are generated by the betas with high levels of multicollinearity and invariance that can be observed from actual data. Second, the t-tests for hypotheses related to risk prices and pricing intercepts have only limited power. The levels of multicollinearity and invariance of betas can vary depending on the assets and sample periods used in estimation. Thus, we propose use of two pre-diagnostic statistics to measure these levels. Many previous studies have investigated the finite-sample properties of the TP estimators using the data generated with the estimated betas from actual data. Our results indicate that simulation outcomes can lead to quite different conclusions, depending on the levels of multicollinearity and invariance of the betas used to generate the data.

The research study was run by the department of management, School of Business Administration in Karvina, Silesian University in Opava. The initial section of the paper will discuss the theoretical framework regarding the global economic crisis as well as its impact on businesses. Later on, staff assessment methods and remuneration practices in non-cash remuneration will be analysed along with their current status among Czech companies. The theoretical framework leads then to establishing hypotheses concerning the impact of the global economic crisis on businesses in the Czech Republic in terms of provision of fringe benefits. The subsequent section will present the methodology used, the data and results from the primary research. A part of the questionnaire survey will be analysed to look into the interdependence of certain questions pertaining to the change in fringe benefit offer in 2007 - 2011, the period assumed to be a crisis era.

This research is motivated by the recent severe climate change events that led to devastating human and financial losses. Just at the beginning of this century, most investors would not have put climate change into their asset pricing equation. Over the last few years, however, we have witnessed drought, crop loss, wildfire, ice-melt, hurricanes, and severe climate change. Just in the dragon year of 2012, Hurricane Sandy brought New York City, the world's largest financial center and most of the east coast under water. Traditional asset pricing model focuses essentially on the market-risk premium factor. We can no longer assume that climate change topic does not belong to the research area of capital market and asset pricing. In this study, we measure the abnormal stock returns using a six-factor model that incorporates 1) market risk-premium, 2) small firm factor, 3) value stock factor, 4) momentum factor, 5) liquidity factor, and last, but certainly not the least 6) sustainability factor. By inserting this new factor into the traditional asset pricing model, we contribute to the financial literature as well as to corporate sustainability literature. The findings of this research may also shed light on investment strategies that could adapt to climate change. Our sample consists of 3000 publicly-traded companies in the KLD database matched with financial data from Compustat and CRSP files for the period of 1991-2012. We employ a combination of KLD data and ClimateCount scores to measure the performance of corporate sustainability initiatives. We hypothesize 1) climate change affects investor sentiment which in turn affects stock returns; 2) companies with commitment to sustainability and taking initiatives to address climate change may lead to better risk-adjusted stock returns and firm value; 3) corporate sustainability factor may have certain explanatory power for asset pricing.","[Boasson, Vigdis; Mitchell, John] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Finance & Law, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Boasson, Emil] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Business Informat Syst, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",Central Michigan University; Central Michigan University,"Boasson, V (通讯作者)，Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Finance & Law, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",boasslv@cmich.edu; boassle@cmich.edu; mitchljb@cmich.edu,"Boasson, Vigdis/JGM-7234-2023","Boasson, Vigdis/0000-0002-8621-6026",,,,,0,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1612,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100170,0

It defines main sources of interest rate volatility and studies how specific source of volatility influences optimal interest margin. Special attention is focused on unexpected shock in liquidity of banking system, actual central bank's decision on targeted level of interest rate, long-term deviation of inflation and output from central bank's targeted values and potential impact of these factors on term premium instability. Sources of interest rates are discussed in term of bank's refinancing/reinvestment risk with an attempt to formalize interest rate volatility for further empirical research. Our conclusion is that dealer's model of optimal interest margin is consistent with only permanent shocks to banking system liquidity and long-lasting central bank's surprises with its monetary policy that increase a level of refinancing/reinvestment risk faced up by banks. On the other hand it is not consistent with interest rate volatility caused by transitory liquidity shocks, expected current changes in central bank's targeted main policy rate and long run trends in main policy rate based on disinflation.","[Bruna, Karel; Korbel, Jiri] Univ Econ Prague, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-10368 Prague 3, Czech Republic; [Korbel, Jiri] Czech Savings Bank, CZ-14000 Prague 4, Czech Republic",,"Bruna, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-10368 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",bruna@vse.cz; jiri.korbel@gmail.com,"Bruna, Karel/AAD-9178-2020","Bruna, Karel/0000-0003-3690-1364",,,,,19,1,1,0,1,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This pattern of growth combines institutional anchoring to the EU, integration of product markets through trade in goods and services, unfettered capital mobility including foreign direct investment flows and labour mobility. In these circumstances the actual economic crisis represented a major challenge for these economies, which moreover were quite affected and the recovery is slow. For the purpose of the statistic data analysis, we decided to form two groups of countries, based on their history, background and recent development. We first made an analysis of the evolution of macroeconomic indicators to see how economic policy measures were favourable overcoming the crisis for each country. Through a panel data model we tried to illustrate the impact of certain macroeconomics variables (unemployment rate, GDP, FDI, trade) on standard of living (real average net earnings).","[Cristescu, Amalia; Stanila, Larisa; Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina; Cataniciu, Nicolae] Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest 010643, Romania",,,cristescu_amalia@yahoo.com; ap_larisa@yahoo.com; madalina.andreica@gmail.com; ncataniciu@incsmps.ro,"Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/AAK-8233-2020; Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/F-8696-2011","Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/0000-0002-0589-4010; Stanila, Larisa/0000-0002-5069-8756",,,,,14,0,0,1,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,162,171,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500014,0

Besides the contractual terms, corporate governance structures also can have a positive impact on agency conflicts and compared to financial covenants some substituting relationship has been identified. As debt contracting considers all three terms, it is important to analyse their joint influence on agency conflicts.

According to Ando and Modigliani (1957), consumers pass through different stages of a life-cycle with different impacts on demand. The criticism that life-cycle theory neglects generational effects and concentrates only on ageing effects has led to the application of the cohort analysis, which decomposes not only age, but also period and cohort effects. This paper presents the results of a cohort analysis on food-at-home and food-away-from-home consumption covering 25 years of German consumption data. The results of seemingly unrelated regressions indicate that there are significant age, period and cohort effects on food-at-home and food-away-from-home expenditures, which are more distinct for food-at-home consumption. This paper also finds evidence for the significant effects of gender, occupation, household composition and region on both expenditure categories. For instance, the effect of being female is negative on both types of expenditures. Moreover, there is a non-linear relationship between household size and both food-at-home and food-away-from-home-consumption.","[Drescher, Larissa S.; Roosen, Jutta] Tech Univ Munich, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Drescher, LS (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Alte Akad 16, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",LDrescher@tum.de,"Roosen, Jutta/AAN-2079-2021","Roosen, Jutta/0000-0002-3032-399X; Drescher, Larissa S/0000-0002-0227-8407",,,,,30,8,9,0,7,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

First, real-business-cycle models can incorporate pollution and pollution policy and can be used to answer several questions. For example, how should environmental policy adjust to business cycles? How do different types of policies fare in a context with business cycles? Second, endogenous technological growth is an important component of environmental policy. Several studies ask how policy can be designed both to tackle emissions directly and to influence the adoption of clean technologies.

It shows that municipalities using participatory budgeting favored an allocation of public expenditures that closely matched popular preferences and channeled a larger fraction of their budgets to investments in sanitation and health services. This change is accompanied by a reduction in infant mortality rates. This suggests that promoting a more direct interaction between service users and elected officials in budgetary policy can affect both how local resources are spent and living standard outcomes.

Many farm workers and farm dwellers in South Africa experience precarious tenure, and poor housing and labour conditions. This paper explores what is happening to farm labour and to agricultural capital in Limpopo province. Findings from field research on four horticultural and livestock/game farms illustrate how economic pressures, combined with land restitution and labour migration, have produced new and contested trajectories of agrarian change largely cementing a historical shift from independent land tenure to wage labour but also prompting diversification of livelihoods. We explore the ways in which actors on farms workers, dwellers, owners and managers have responded with regard to three spheres of contestation: ownership, production and employment; tenure and livelihoods; and family, gender and children. We argue that, contrary to official visions of reform, long-term processes of agrarian change predating political transition proletarianization, casualization and the externalization of farm labour are being accelerated. These processes, and the ways in which they are producing new contours of social differentiation, are illustrated at farm level.","[Hall, Ruth] Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa; [Wisborg, Poul] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Shirinda, Shirhami] Elim Hosp, ZA-0960 Makhado, South Africa; [Zamchiya, Phillan] Oxford Int Dev Ctr, Oxford OX1 3TB, England",University of the Western Cape; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Hall, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",rhall@uwc.ac.za; poul.wisborg@umb.no; shirhami@yahoo.com; phillan.zamchiya@sant.ox.ac.uk,"Hall, Ruth/T-9818-2019","Hall, Ruth/0000-0002-8068-8794",,,,,64,29,34,1,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Thus, it motivates us to examine the role of emotional intelligence and trust as significant psychological elements in predicting consumers' decisions to engage in social networking online purchase. We then proposed a model that links relationships of emotional intelligence, trust, perceived value, purchased intention and confirmation. Using a survey and a cross sectional study, we collected data from 334 respondents who have taken part in social network online purchase. Based on the regression analyses, the survey findings reveal consumers' decisions are explained by the relationship between emotional intelligence and trust, which then the trust plays the role as the predictor to perceived value and purchase intention. In addition, there are also relationships between perceived value and purchase intention, and between purchase intention and confirmation. The study is significant as understanding the emotional intelligence is the basis of taking the appropriate strategies for online and mobile retailers in capturing more consumers and higher sales.

To test both theories panel data methodology is used over a sample of 94 Czech companies during the years 2005-2010 with the use of annual data. Because we use lagged dependent variable amongst independent variables to test pecking order theory and trade-off theory we employ Arellano and Bond (1991) GMM and Anderson and Hsiao (1982) 2SLS models. We explore the influence on total debt ratio as a dependent variable in two formats and independent/explanatory variables, which correspond to specific company characteristics depending on previous literature. Our results suggest that both theoretical approaches contribute to explain capital structure in Czech firms.","[Jindrichovska, Irena] Univ Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Ugurlu, Erginbay] Hitit Univ, Dept Econ, Corum, Turkey; [Kubickova, Dana] Univ Finance & Adm, Dept Business Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Hitit University; University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Jindrichovská, I (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",irena.jindrichovska@vsem.cz; erginbayugurlu@hitit.edu.tr; dana.kubickova@mail.vsfs.cz,"Jindrichovska, Irena/N-7626-2015; Ugurlu, Erginbay/AAH-1227-2019; Kubickova, Dana/F-5098-2013; Ugurlu, Erginbay/H-8209-2018; Jindrichovska, Irena/N-5867-2019","Ugurlu, Erginbay/0000-0002-1297-1993;",University of Economics and Management,University of Economics and Management,This contribution is supported by University of Economics and Management.,,15,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,509,520,,,,,,12,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100052,0

The Human Development Index (HDI) combines three dimensions: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. The inequality of access to the available resources is measured by the new multidimensional inequality-adjusted human development index (IHDI) which is based on the same aspects as the HDI but also reflects the unequal distribution of each sub-factor in the population. IHDI is the real indicator of the level of human development, while HDI can be interpreted as the maximum level of IHDI, which could be achieved in the absence of inequalities in the distribution of wealth.

Traditional corporate governance mechanisms, such as concentrated ownership and takeover threats, in principle, also apply to banks. However, banks have special traits and are heavily regulated, preventing natural forms of governance to arise and rendering many of these governance mechanisms ineffective. Financial regulation can in principle compensate for weaknesses in corporate governance but in practice has had limited effectiveness in protecting the interests of banks' stakeholders, because of, for instance, unproductive interactions between regulatory restraints and existing governance arrangements. The review concludes with a discussion of corporate governance and regulatory reforms to enhance the safety and soundness of banks. These proposals range from placing more emphasis on value creation for bank stakeholders other than shareholders to reducing risk-shifting incentives for bank managers and shareholders.","[Laeven, Luc] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Laeven, Luc] Ctr Econ & Policy Res, London EC1V 3PZ, England",International Monetary Fund; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Laeven, L (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",llaeven@imf.org,,,,,,,118,71,79,6,78,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4805-2,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

The optimal rules maximize the second-order approximation to intertemporal utility. Three results emerge: (a) when prices are sticky, perfect inflation stabilization is optimal independently from the tax instrument adopted; (b) the optimal degree of responsiveness of monetary policy to output varies depending on which tax instrument induces fluctuations in the average tax rate; (c) when prices are flexible, fiscal rules that prescribe unexpected variations in the price level to support debt changes are always welfare-maximizing.

Individuals maximise their utility while deciding among three occupations: independent entrepreneurship, paid employment and intrapreneurship. I show that intrapreneurs resemble employees rather than entrepreneurs. Specifically, comparing the decision-making of intrapreneurs to that of entrepreneurs, the former are significantly more risk averse, expect lower but less uncertain reward and are broadly endowed with a poorer set of entrepreneurial abilities; despite having higher levels of human capital they fail to recognise business opportunities and have lower confidence in their entrepreneurial skills. A distinction within the category of intrapreneurship, based on the level of engagement and therefore the level of personal risks they bear, adds to our understanding of intrapreneurship. Engaged intrapreneurs, i.e., intrapreneurs that expect to acquire an ownership stake in the business, unlike the rest of intrapreneurs, share the attributes usually assumed to characterise entrepreneurs.","Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Martiarena, A (通讯作者)，Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",arrizaam@aston.ac.uk,"Martiarena, Alona/AAF-9269-2021; Martiarena, Alona/AAK-4376-2020","Martiarena, Alona/0000-0002-8087-3762; Martiarena, Alona/0000-0002-8087-3762",,,,,49,57,77,9,169,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In this paper, elemental symbol mapping and spatial association analysis techniques are applied to travelers' attitudes. Attitudinal data, drawn from a recent travel survey conducted in McMaster University (Hamilton, Canada) among staff, students, and faculty, are analyzed. The place of residence of the respondents is geocoded in order to map the responses, and the spatial pattern of the qualitative/ordinal attitudinal variables is analyzed using the Q(m) statistic. Analysis of a selection of variables shows how some attitudes appear to develop independently from the local environments, whereas others are related to a preference towards certain types of local environments or social aspects of the local environment, which suggests underlying processes of self-selection or adaptation.

It is the voluntary integration of social and environmental considerations into everyday business operations and interactions with stakeholders. CSR thus aims to facilitate the transition towards socially and environmentally sustainable future. Certification of this approach is not common in the Czech Republic. Agriculture is yet an area where the social responsibility has an important place. In addition to the certification requirements of ISO 14000, organic farming in the Czech Republic is also used by private certification standard GLOBALG.AP The paper discusses the possibilities of using standard GLOBALG.AP as a potential tool of corporate social responsibility for the sector of agricultural production. Its implementation and certification represents producer's interest in creating safe and quality food, providing safety and employee development and in reflecting increasingly important concern for the environment and its sustainability. This standard is intended to serve as a tool for objective assessment of systemic application of good agricultural practices and through fulfillment of given checkpoints to guarantee production of safe food, while ensuring accountability farms to consumers, environment, animals and farm workers.

The United States must reduce their current account deficit. Thus, it is derived to a question how the U.S is going to do. A significant process of rebalancing is the structural adjustment of U.S. economic activity. Although the sign of US recovery remains distinctly subpar, deficit roughly halved relative to pre-crisis levels, to about 3% of GDP.

We demonstrate that building permits have substantially declined before every recession since 1970, and that differences in permits across states before the last seven recessions explain the relative severity of a state's job and income losses during these recessions. Hence, we can use permits to predict which states will suffer the greatest job losses in a recession. We show further that housing reflects expectations of future economic activity as permits are closely related to movements in consumer expectations, and both lead the business cycle by four quarters. Differences across regions in consumer expectations and permits are also highly correlated, and both can forecast interstate differentials in job and income losses across regions, particularly during recessions.

The empirical results show that the trading rules have stronger predictive power in the emerging stock markets of Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines than in the more developed stock market of Singapore consistent with earlier studies. In addition, the short-term variants of the technical trading rules have better predictive ability than long-term variants. However, unlike earlier studies we show that transaction costs can eliminate the trading profits implying weak-form efficiency in most stock markets during our study period further suggesting that these markets have become more informationally efficient over time.

A clear lesson is that policies to mitigate adverse impacts of financial crisis on the macroeconomic level should be given priority for preserving employment. In this regard, expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to keep aggregate demand from collapsing need to be emphasized once a crisis breaks out. However, equally crucial is the maintenance of sound pre-crisis fundamentals to help keep negative impacts from proliferating, even when a crisis is triggered. In addition, flexible labor market structures and temporary employment-boosting policies appear to be necessary to reduce the negative impacts of a crisis on workers.

Reforming the credit rating industry has hence become an important policy issue. In addition to the regulatory efforts in the context of accepting the for-profit business model of ratings, there is a growing realization that credit ratings bear the characteristics of a public good. Financial market participants need reliable, transparent and independent assessment of credit risks. Credit ratings are therefore better viewed as an infrastructure matter. However, the proposed regulations seem to have missed this point. This paper introduces a new approach to credit ratings undertaken by the Risk Management Institute at the National University of Singapore that is predicated on the provision of credit ratings as a public good.

We construct several measures to capture firms' alliance activities. The key finding is that borrowing firms with active alliance involvement experience lower cost of bank loans. The reduction of borrowing cost is strongest for financially unconstrained firms and firms with high G-index and intensive monitoring from institutional investors. We also relate various characteristics of alliance agreements to the cost of bank borrowing, and find evidence supporting market power hypothesis and organizational flexibility hypothesis. We further report that allying with a prestigious partner (i.e.. S&P 1500 firms) provides certification effect that lowers bank loan cost. In addition, firms positioned in the center of the alliance network enjoy lower cost of bank loans. Lastly, we document that firms engaging in alliance activities expand their debt capacity and are less likely to use collaterals and covenants in their bank loan contracts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to the monitoring decision of a social planner who seeks to maximize the utility of aggregate consumption, banks choose to monitor only if doing so is consistent with maximizing the market value of equity. As a consequence, socially and privately optimal monitoring choices can diverge. Under some circumstances, appropriately configured capital regulation can bring private loan-monitoring decisions into line with those of the social planner. Nevertheless, the capital ratio required to attain this outcome hinges on a number of factors that are likely to be economy-specific, including the banking system's monitoring technology and its exposure to default. Thus, it is unlikely that a unique capital ratio will be able to induce socially optimal monitoring in all economies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using several contemporary fundamental factors to proxy for the latter of these investors' trading patterns, the interaction of these three groups of investors is explored in the G-7 markets using monthly stock market prices. There is no evidence that positive feedback traders are present in the sample data. Fundamental traders are however observable. This finding suggests that although positive feedback traders may drive stock prices in the short-run, as is typically observed in higher frequency data, fundamental traders likely play a role in pushing prices back to their fundamental value in the longer-run.

An understanding of the forces underlying the departure from fundamental values is important in explaining the mechanisms underlying housing market performance and predicting potential house price changes in the future. This study constitutes the first use of a common trend (CT) model to analyze private house prices in the Swedish market. We employ a cointegration system to analyze the macro variables of consumption expenditure per capita, user costs and house prices. We decompose shocks into those resulting from fundamental variables, specified in this research as income and the interest rate, and those resulting from cyclical variables. The results indicate that interest rates play a dominant role in explaining house price swings, and are also significant in determining user costs for households in Sweden. Transitory shocks are found to have little explanatory power for house prices and user costs in the long run. A number of tests have been performed to verify the robustness of the specification and results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In a macroeconomic approach, the first section focuses on the crowding out effects of public jobs creation on private jobs creation. The effect is found to be large and significant by an empirical study of 17 OECD countries for the period 1960-2000: for 10 public jobs created, 15 private jobs are directly or indirectly lost. This study also shows that the impact of public employment creation strongly depends on the kind of public jobs created. Two characteristics are crucial: the degree of substitution between public and private sectors productions on the one hand and the magnitude of the advantages provided by public jobs. Retaining a microeconomic perspective, section two surveys empirical studies of subsidized employment policies. Conclusions are similar to the ones drawn from the macroeconomic analysis, namely the kind of jobs created is essential: subsidized jobs created in the private sector are often a first step towards a permanent job, especially for young and/or low skilled people. By contrast, subsidized jobs created in the public sector do not increase the probability to find a permanent job.","[Algan, Yann] Sci Po, F-75007 Paris, France; [Cahuc, Pierre] CREST, Lab Macroecon, F-92245 Malakoff, France; [Zylberberg, Andre] Univ Paris 01, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Algan, Y (通讯作者)，Sci Po, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.",yann.algan@sciences-po.fr; cahuc@ensae.fr; azyl@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,13,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

An optimism bias of the quarterly Consensus growth forecasts can be asserted right from a graphic analysis and its existence is confirmed by the calculation of the mean errors which are systematically negative. The Theil index reveals that Insee forecasts are superior to the Consensus ones. In addition, the Consensus forecasts are superior to a naive forecast. Proper tests seem to confirm that an optimism bias exists; this bias could arise from the combination of several forecasts. The study of the Consensus Economics fixed event forecasts regarding the next coming year requires a preliminary analysis due to missing data. We thus only retain the forecasts of nine institutions that we compare to those of the Government, the IMF, the OECD, and the European Commission. It appears that the forecasts are fairly close to the Consensus forecast and that the optimism bias is still observable.

The 'competition effect' implies that entry lowers desired markups and dampens inflation. Under translog preferences, where the substitutability between goods depends on their number, we find evidence of such an effect. That model generates more countercyclical markups than Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) monopolistic competition model, where price stickiness is the only source of markup fluctuations. In contrast, a model with strategic interactions between oligopolistic firms cannot generate an empirically relevant competition effect and is statistically equivalent to the Dixit-Stiglitz model.

Malaysia's experience suggests that where electoral competition gives politicians an incentive to respond to voters' service preferences, top-down initiatives have the greater potential for large-scale social change.

The following pathways are investigated: educated parents' greater household income, exposure to media, literacy, labor market participation, health knowledge, and the extent of maternal empowerment within the home. We find that while father's education is positively associated with the immunization decision, mother's education is more critically associated with longer term health outcomes in OLS equations.

Using a sample of cross-border joint ventures from 105 countries, we investigate the impact of country legal, cultural and business environment factors, industry factors as well as deal specific factors on the intensity of cross-border joint ventures with one US partner. Our results suggest that US firms are more likely to form joint ventures with firms from countries with weaker legal and regulatory environments and with higher cultural, language, and religious disparity from the US. However, compared to mergers between a foreign target and a US bidder, US firms are more likely to form joint ventures with firms from countries with strong laws and regulations, as well as with smaller cultural, language, and religious differences from the US. These findings are consistent with cross-border joint ventures being a hybrid organizational form existing in between free-market contracts and firm-like deals such as mergers and acquisitions. Our results further suggest that foreign countries receiving large US foreign direct investments and/or relying less on export and import are associated with higher intensity of cross-border joint ventures. The volume of cross-border joint ventures with US partner is higher for firm from less competitive and/or more politically stable countries. On a firm level, US firms are more likely to form cross-border joint ventures in cases of technology transfers between the joint venture partners, in deals involving partners from unrelated industries or with foreign firms not cross-listed in the US.

Existing models explain the survival of rent-taking politicians by ideological divisions in the electorate and/or informational asymmetries. The current paper demonstrate that rent extraction can persist even if voters are fully informed and ideologically homogenous. We show that in such an environment, voters may gain by persistently reelecting a rent-taker that limits his rent extraction. Such an equilibrium occurs when voters and politicians do not discount the future too heavily, and the share of honest candidates is relatively small.","[Helland, Leif; Sorensen, Rune] BI Norwegian Sch Management, Dept Econ, N-0442 Oslo, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School,"Helland, L (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Sch Management, Dept Econ, Nydalsveien 37, N-0442 Oslo, Norway.",leif.helland@bi.no; rune.sorensen@bi.no,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2012,153.0,1-2,,,,,205,213,,10.1007/s11127-011-9785-z,0.0,,,9,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,985PO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307280000013,0

We explore this aspect using a novel dataset of industry recommendations, which are often issued by strategy analysts. We study sell-side analysts' ability to rank industries relative to each other (across-industry expertise), and how it relates to analysts' ability to rank firms in a particular industry (within-industry expertise). We find that analysts express more optimism towards industries with higher levels of investment, past profitability, and past returns. Analysts exhibit across-industry expertise, as portfolios based on industry recommendations generate abnormal returns over both short and long horizons, beyond what would be explained by industry momentum. Additionally, industry recommendations contain information, which is orthogonal to the information revealed in firm recommendations, and more so for brokers who benchmark their firm recommendations to industry peers. Consequently, the investment value of sell-side analysts' recommendations is enhanced when both dimensions of industry expertise are utilized by considering industry and firm recommendations in combination.

We adopt a Bayesian learning model in which media coverage of inflation affects forecast disagreement by influencing information sets as well as predictor choice. Our empirical results show that disagreement of households depends on the heterogeneity of story content and on the reporting intensity, especially of news on rising inflation. Disagreement of professional forecasters does not depend on media coverage. With respect to the influence of macroeconomic variables, we provide evidence that disagreement of professional forecasters primarily depends on the inflation rate and on inflation volatility. The response of households to inflation is much less pronounced.","[Lamla, Michael J.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Lamla, MJ (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.",lamla@kof.ethz.ch; thomas.maag@snb.ch,"Lamla, Michael/AAG-2600-2019","Lamla, Michael/0000-0001-7350-1680",,,,,39,41,45,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Based on Vroom's (Work and motivation, 1964) expectancy theory, we predict that startup-specific instrumentality, valence and expectancy are key components of entrepreneurial motivation and closely related to those intentions, efforts, and behaviors that will eventually lead to operating a firm. Hypotheses are tested using data from the first Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics I. Our results show that valence is a multidimensional construct, and that various types of valence are related to different intent and behavioral outcomes. All types of valence, instrumentality, and expectancy are related to a nascent entrepreneur's intended effort level in a cross-section of data, and over time, intended effort is positively related to operative firm status. Overall, our results suggest that expectancy theory holds promise for research on nascent entrepreneurs' motivation.","[Renko, Maija] Univ Illinois, Dept Managerial Studies, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Kroeck, K.

However, for under-utilized crops like minor millets, market participation may actually encourage growers to increase on-farm diversity through better access to new varieties exchanged at local markets and higher returns from varieties already grown. We test this hypothesis in two different agro-ecological niches, the Plains and the Hills in southern India. Empirical results based on propensity score matching indicate that, in the less fertile dryland plains, market participation improved on-farm varietal diversity of minor millets and increased net revenues - albeit with insignificant welfare effects on farm households. On the other hand, in the fertile hill ecosystems, market development had no effect on varietal diversity. Insights from such a comparison could help design suitable policy interventions for on-farm conservation of under-utilized crops in their own agro-ecosystems through active stakeholder participation.","[Nagarajan, Latha] IFDC, Washington, DC 20005 USA",,,h.takeshima@cgiar.org; lnagarajan@ifdc.org,"Takeshima, Hiroyuki/AAN-6611-2021; Takeshima, Hiroyuki/AAO-3212-2021","Takeshima, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-1761-408X; Nagarajan, Latha/0000-0003-4516-0772",,,,,39,5,5,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The main objective of the Fillon reform was to simplify the complex regulations that were created by the progressive introduction of the 35-hour week. The reform incidentally created large variations in labour costs, depending on the type of firm and the wage level within the firm. This paper presents an evaluation of the impact of this reform on employment using a balanced panel of firms with more than five employees, drawn from a matching between several administrative data sources from 2000 to 2005.","[Bunel, Mathieu] Univ Caen, CREM, F-14032 Caen, France; [L'Horty, Yannick] Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE, Paris, France",Universite de Caen Normandie; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Bunel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Caen, CREM, F-14032 Caen, France.",mathieu.bunel@unicaen.fr; yannick.lhorty@univ-mlv.fr,,"bunel, mathieu/0000-0002-0038-4759",,,,,24,9,10,4,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.
