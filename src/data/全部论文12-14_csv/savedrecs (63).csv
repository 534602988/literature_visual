The advantage of the model is that it allows for both unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity in the covariates. Using data gathered by questionnaire, the authors confirm that the overall fit of the model is good and outperforms other related count data models. From the model estimation it is clear that the number of visits to Madeira Island is supported by multiple variables such as destination attributes, hotel facilities and travel cost, tourist motivation and tourist satisfaction.

The potential impact of these programs on the economic benefits of activities and environmental liability in the downstream area are generally ignored. In this study, a hydrological model has been coupled to an economic optimization model (Target MOTAD). It is designed to simulate, in the case of Merguellil watershed, the potential impact of different scenarios of upstream erosion reduction on the farmers' returns in the plain, located in the downstream area. The plain is irrigated from groundwater aquifer which is naturally recharged with runoff water from the upstream. The scenarios simulated envisage erosion reduction by 25%, 50% and 75% compared to its maximum level. Results show that all the simulated scenarios reduce the economic returns of farmers in the plain; that becomes particularly high beyond the erosion reduction by 50%. They also show that income gains obtained upstream, resulting from soil conservation and water harvesting, can only partially compensate the economic losses in the plain; this leads to a decrease in the total economic income across the basin (upstream and downstream). Therefore, reducing soil erosion in the upstream watershed seems to be the most appropriate management strategy.","[El Amami, Hacib] Eaux & Forets Ariana Tunisie, Inst Natl Rech Genie Rural, Tunis, Tunisia; [Fouzai, Ayoub; Nasr, Jamel; Bachta, Mohamed Salah] Inst Natl Agron Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"El Amami, H (通讯作者)，Eaux & Forets Ariana Tunisie, Inst Natl Rech Genie Rural, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,16,1,1,1,7,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2013,12.0,2,,,,,57,64,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AG2VQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335275600006,0

The simplified GARCH model is chosen that involves the estimation of only univariate GARCH models, and hence easy to estimate, and does not put additional constraints on the model. The results of Monte Carlo simulations showed that accurate estimates of conditional correlations can be obtained using these robust estimators when the errors are heavy-tailed. We also investigate the forecasting performance of the class of robust estimators in predicting value-at-risk using various evaluation measures and collect empirical evidences of the better predictive potential of estimators such as LAD and B-estimator over the widely-used quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for the estimation and prediction of multivariate GARCH models.

In contrast to previous studies, which have tended to focus on the overall results of regional elections or just on the party-list votes, it provides a quantitative analysis of the votes for United Russia in the plural single member district contests. By widening the traditional focus on the aggregate results and party-list voting the study brings to light important variations in the patterns of United Russia's electoral domination of regional assemblies. The specific form of United Russia's domination depends on the configuration of regional elites and their strategies. Social and economic features of the regions have little impact on the degree and modes of United Russia's electoral domination, but influence the ability of regional leaders to ensure electoral mobilisation in the regions and this is more significant the higher the level of the election.","[Panov, Petr] Perm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Perm 614990, Russia; [Ross, Cameron] Univ Dundee, Sch Humanities, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",University of Dundee,"Panov, P (通讯作者)，Perm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 15 Bukireva St, Perm 614990, Russia.",panov.petr@gmail.com; c.z.ross@dundee.ac.uk,"Panov, Petr/O-2160-2016","Panov, Petr/0000-0002-0759-7618",,,,,17,32,38,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JUN 1,2013,65.0,4,,,SI,,737,752,,10.1080/09668136.2013.767581,0.0,,,16,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,159BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320018800008,0

In Riccetti (The use of copulas in asset allocation: when and how a copula model can be useful? LAP Lambert, Saarbrucken 2010), a copula-GARCH model is applied and it is found that copulas are not useful for choosing among stock indices, but can be useful in a macro asset allocation model, that is, for choosing stock and bond composition of portfolios. In this paper I apply that copula-GARCH model for the macro asset allocation of portfolios containing a commodity component. I find that the copula model appears to be useful and better than the mean-variance one for the macro asset allocation also in presence of a commodity index, even if it is not better than GARCH models on independent univariate series, probably because of the low correlation of the commodity index returns to the stock, the bond and the exchange rate returns.","Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Social & Econ Sci, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Riccetti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Social & Econ Sci, Ple Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",l.riccetti@univpm.it,"Riccetti, Luca/AAF-5115-2020",,,,,,52,15,16,0,30,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This recession has been referred to as The Great Recession due to its severity and the length of its duration. As the U.S. economy has experienced a shift in its industrial structure toward an ever-larger service sector, there is a literature that argues that economic fluctuations should be less than was the case in a goods-production dominated economy, as it is presumed that the demand for services is less cyclical than the demand for goods. The Great Recession challenges this presumption. This article reports on the unemployment experience of states through the Great Recession with regard to their industrial structure, finding that there is a correlation between industrial structure and unemployment trends.","[Beyers, William B.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Beyers, WB (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Geog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",beyers@uw.edu,,,,,,,14,9,11,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Broadly speaking, this literature can be divided into two strands. One strand examines the way social identity affects support for EU integration quantitatively, using opinion poll data. The other draws (often loosely) on social constructivism, using qualitative research methods. Social Identity Theory (SIT) is increasingly invoked in both these literatures and this development is to be welcomed. However, so far engagement with SIT has been rather tentative, drawing largely on theoretically impoverished versions of SIT. It is argued in this article that this practice has resulted in SIT's theoretical potential being underutilized. At other times, this has resulted in theoretical confusion because SIT explanations are being used alongside other theories whose premises clash with core SIT assumptions. We conclude that more in-depth engagement with SIT's basic and core tenets will enable quantitative EU identity researchers to move beyond attachment' to territorial identities, and allow qualitative EU identity researchers to move beyond shared history', deeply rooted identities' and resonance'.","[Mols, Frank; Weber, Martin] Univ Queensland, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Mols, F (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",f.mols@uq.edu.au,"Weber, Martin/GPW-6095-2022; Weber, Martin/JLL-7207-2023","Mols, Frank/0000-0003-2472-2131; Weber, Martin/0000-0002-3533-5850",,,,,67,19,31,2,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Based on the model of Teitz (1968), we incorporate a fixed cost for opening stores, as well as every possible asymmetry regarding an upper limit on the number of store openings. These two factors have an impact on firms' location strategies as constraints, which yield only two opposing types of equilibrium strategies for the leader. One is the segmentation strategy, where the leader monopolizes a market segment by partially deterring the follower's entry. The other is the equidistant location strategy, where stores are opened at equidistant locations throughout the market. Both maximum and minimum differentiation can result in equilibrium at the firm level. This seems to reflect real-world location patterns well, particularly those observed in some retail industries such as cafes and fast fashion retailers. We also obtain welfare implications of multi-store competition by analyzing the case where the social planner can optimize the upper limit on the number of store openings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First, we propose a turning point chronology for the French business cycle based on a classical conception of economic cycles and a non-parametric dating algorithm applied to the real GDP series. Second, static and dynamic probit models are developed and estimated to produce the recession probabilities. In-sample results show that the dynamic specification performs better than the static one and, above all, that the exchange rate has a stronger predictive power than the yield curve. Out-of-sample results finally confirm the predominant role assigned to the exchange rate in predicting the latest recession occurred in 2008.","[Bismans, Francis; Majetti, Reynald] Univ Lorraine, BETA, Nancy, FR, France",Universite de Lorraine,"Bismans, F (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, BETA, Nancy, FR, France.",francis.bismans@univ-lorraine.fr; reynald.majetti@univ-lorraine.fr,,,,,,,33,4,5,0,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The model features EpsteinZin recursive preferences, which determine the market price of macro risk factors. Analysis of the US nominal term structure data from 1953 to 2006 shows that agents dislike high uncertainty and demand compensation for volatility risks. Also, the time variation of the term premium is driven by the compensation for inflation volatility risk, which is distinct from consumption volatility risk. The central role of inflation volatility risk in explaining the time-varying term premium is consistent with other empirical evidence including survey data. In contrast, the existing long-run risks literature emphasizes consumption volatility risk and ignores inflation-specific time-varying volatility. The estimation results of this paper suggest that inflation-specific volatility risk is essential for fitting the time series of the US nominal term structure data.

Using a two-step selection model, we predict firm-specific subsidy amounts that can be explained by the characteristics that determine firms' eligibility for government support and its amount. Drawing on the accounts of the discretionary allocation of subsidies in developing countries, we interpret the discrepancy between the predicted and the observed subsidy amounts as a proxy for a firm's ties to government officials. Controlling for observable and unobservable firm characteristics as well as persistence in exporting, we find that although, in general, subsidies exhibit a positive impact on export volumes, this impact is diminishing in subsidy size and in the degree of a firm's connectedness.","[Helmers, Christian] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Trofimenko, Natalia] Kiel Inst, Kiel, Germany",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Helmers, C (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,36,9,9,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2013,36.0,4,,,,,465,486,,10.1111/twec.12033,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,119VR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317127800006,0

Using data from the IMF's Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), we find that intra-East Asian financial asset holdings of four East Asian countries Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore are larger than the levels predicted by the financial gravity model. However, our analysis suggests that this result is likely to be driven by intra-regional trade linkages and reflect those linkages. Therefore, the salient implication for regional policymakers is that they should continue to promote intra-regional financial integration.

This gradual and largely endogenously driven path calls for the simultaneous consideration of ideas and politics. Exogenous shocks affected economic policy, but did not determine the course of economic history in India. India's developmental model evolved out of new ideas Indian technocrats developed based on events they observed in India and other parts of the world. A historical case for the tipping point' model is made by comparing two severe balance of payments crises India faced in 1966 and 1991. In 1966, when the weight of ideas and politics in India favored state-led import substitution, Washington could not coerce New Delhi to accept deregulation and globalization. In 1991, on the other hand, when Indian technocrats' ideas favoured deregulation and globalization, the executivetechnocratic team engineered a silent revolution in the policy paradigm. New Delhi engaged constructively with Washington, making a virtue of the necessity of IMF conditions, and implemented a home-grown reform program that laid the foundations for rapid economic growth in world's most populous and tumultuous democracy.","Natl Univ Singapore, South Asian Studies Programme, Singapore 117548, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Mukherji, R (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, South Asian Studies Programme, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",,,,,,,,116,37,40,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The proposed model is a discrete choice model with latent choice sets. As per the formulation of the mode, the model falls in the general category of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models with choice set formation, which is also known as a Generalized Logit (GenL) model. However, the proposed modelling framework uses a scale parameterization approach to capture heteroskedasticity in departure time choices. Hence, the model presented in the paper is a Heteroskedastic Generalized Logit (Het-GenL) model in general or specifically a heteroskedastic Paired Combinatorial Logit Model (Het-PCL). Empirical models are developed for the departure time choices for home-based commuting trips in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). The datasets from the Transportation Tomorrow Survey, a 5 percent household based trip diary survey conducted in 2006 is used for empirical model estimation. Separate models are estimated for private car and transit users' departure time choices. It becomes evident that transportation level-of-service attributes enter into the systematic utility function as well as the scale parameter function with significant coefficients. The proposed econometric approach captures the normalization effect of different variables in terms of simultaneously influencing systematic utility as well as the scale parameter and thereby correctly explains the elasticity of corresponding variables.

First, the demand characteristics associated with local public health services are explored. Tax-share, income, and aid elasticities of local public health demand and the congestability of local public health services are estimated and compared to similar estimates for local public education and municipal services. Second. local and regional demands for public health services are compared with respect to their underlying characteristics and spending levels. Third, Brueckner's test is conducted to determine if resources are efficiently allocated to local public health services in communities with an independent health department and those participating in a regional health district. Empirical evidence reveals that the demand for local public health services is inelastic with respect to tax share, unrelated to income, and relatively sensitive to intergovernmental aid. Moreover, regionalization appears to increase spending on public health services especially relative to both municipal and local education services. Finally, regional health departments serving large populations appear to overspend on local public health services. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Officially, the ECB sets policy for the eurozone and considers only eurozone data. However, economic shocks in one or more countries may warrant a deviation from this rule. Using real-time, forecast data, the authors estimate a modified Taylor rule incorporating two macroeconomic national influence' measures: first the difference between the median and the eurozone measures of inflation and real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and then deviations of the measures of inflation and real GDP growth for the core' and periphery' countries from eurozone averages. Using rolling-window analysis to test the stability of parameter estimates, evidence is found that divergences in national data notably developments in the periphery from eurozone averages play an increasingly important role during the financial and sovereign debt crises.","[Bouvet, Florence] Sonoma State Univ, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA; [King, Sharmila] Univ Pacific, Stockton, CA 95211 USA",California State University System; Sonoma State University; University of the Pacific,"Bouvet, F (通讯作者)，Sonoma State Univ, Dept Econ, 1801 E Cotati Ave, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA.",bouvet@sonoma.edu,,", Florence/0000-0003-2174-8563",,,,,32,3,3,1,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The analysis is based on primary data surveyed from tourists visiting Nha Trang in March, 2011. A total of 402 valid samples were used from 554 initial samples. The study provides several important findings concerning tourists' modal choice. Travel time per kilometer, per-kilometer travel cost to income ratio, mode quality variables, and income are key elements in explaining the tourists' modal choice decision. In addition, tourists with a lower income tend to be more sensitive to change in per-kilometer cost. Furthermore, the high-income tourists are much more likely to choose plane or train rather than coach. Understanding the tourists' modal choice behavior may help tourism transport companies to develop appropriate marketing strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We partner with a metropolitan water utility to implement a natural field experiment to examine the effect of such messages on residential water demand. The data, drawn from more than 100,000 households, indicate that social comparison messages had a greater influence on behavior than simple prosocial messages or technical information alone. Moreover, our data suggest that social comparison messages are most effective among households identified as the least price sensitive: high users. Yet the effectiveness of such messages wanes over time.

They are wider because, in addition to geographic closeness, economic proximity is also an important source of influence; they are stronger because of the significant contagion effects during the 20072009 subprime and financial crises.

However, as transport-related CO2 emissions are largely seen as a 'social' cost rather than a 'private' cost to the individual, the behavioral engagement with and response to information on environmental effects of travel choices may be limited. It is argued that framing, studied in a range of contexts, can be used to enhance the evaluation of choice attributes and promote more sustainable choices. An experiment is reported that examines the effect of valence framing of amounts of CO2 emissions on the perceived differences between alternative amounts. Through the use of positive and negative terms, the information is framed to focus attention either on the potential of a travel mode to provide environmental benefit (positive frame) or on its potential to reduce environmental loss (negative frame). Survey participants' estimates of CO2 amounts were compared for positive and negative framing of the same information using an ordered logit model. The findings imply that negative framing is more effective than positive framing in highlighting differences between CO2 amounts of alternative travel modes and therefore is likely to influence travel-related choices.

We define a family of social choice rules that depend on the population's preferences and on the probability distribution over the sets of feasible alternatives that the society will face. Our methods generalize the well-known Kemeny Rule. In the Kemeny Rule, it is known a priori that the subset of feasible alternatives will be a pair. We define a distinct social choice function for each distribution over the feasible subsets. Our rules can be interpreted as distance minimization-selecting the order closest to the population's preferences, using a metric on the orders that reflects the distribution over the possible feasible sets. The distance is the probability that two orders will disagree about the optimal choice from a randomly selected available set. We provide an algorithmic method to compute these metrics in the case where the probability of a given feasible set is a function only of its cardinality.","[Baldiga, Katherine A.; Green, Jerry R.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Green, JR (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kbaldiga@gmail.com; jgreen@hbs.edu,,,,,,,19,14,14,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2013,40.0,2,,,,,439,460,,10.1007/s00355-011-0614-6,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,072HT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313661600008,0

It is argued that road pricing is an effective tool but that it would be more effective if charges are differentiated. A laboratory experiment employing a heterogeneous sample (n = 155) examined effects of differentiated road pricing schemes on understanding and behavioral change intentions. The results show that difficulties are experienced in calculating the charges for road pricing schemes differentiated with respect to both place and time. Suggesting learning effects, if presented with degree of differentiation gradually increasing compared to random orders, the highly differentiated schemes were evaluated faster, as more comprehensible, and perceived difficulty decreased. Elderly were less flexible than young people in indicating how they would respond, women were more flexible than men, and frequent drivers less flexible than non-frequent drivers.

Developed in the context of finite populations and described by finite state Markov processes, stochastic evolutionary game dynamics have received much attention recently. However, the relationship between two types of evolutionary dynamics so far has failed to be thoroughly understood. In this paper, we establish several classes of selection mechanisms in large populations under which corresponding stochastic evolutionary dynamics approach the imitative dynamic (including the replicator dynamic), the impartial pairwise comparison dynamic (including the Smith dynamic) and the separable excess payoff dynamic (including the Brown-von Neumann-Nash dynamic) respectively in adjusted forms. In other words, we present intuitive interpretations from a statistical perspective for these deterministic dynamics by constructing their microscopic foundations in settings with finite but large populations.","[Gao, Xing; Zhong, Weijun; Mei, Shue] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,"Gao, X (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",gxingstar@163.com; zhongweijun@seu.edu.cn; meishue@seu.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Fund Grant of China [71071033],Natural Science Fund Grant of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We wish to thank the anonymous referee for constructive and informative comments that helped to improve the presentation of this manuscript.

Actually, until the beginning of the eighteenth century, Italian real wages were either higher than in England (fourteenth and fifteenth centuries) or more or less equal (sixteenth and seventeenth).

In autumn 2003, the Hong Kong dollar appreciated from close to 7.80 per US dollar to 7.70, as investors feared that the currency board would be abandoned. In the wake of this appreciation, the monetary authorities finally revamped the regime as a symmetric two-sided system with a narrow exchange rate band.","[Chen, Yu-Fu] Univ Dundee, Sch Business, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Funke, Michael; Glanemann, Nicole] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany; [Funke, Michael] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Dundee; University of Hamburg; Ifo Institut,"Chen, YF (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Sch Business, 3 Perth Rd, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",yufu.chen@gmail.com,,"Chen, Yu-Fu/0000-0001-9246-9938",,,,,27,4,4,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The so-called Rehn-Meidner model recommends restrictive macroeconomic policies, active labor market policies and solidarity wages to combine price stability with economic growth, equity and full employment. In the 1950s, Bent Hansen evaluated the validity of the Rehn-Meidner policy and the underpinning theory. Hansen's theory of inflation shows that he was strongly influenced by Rehn's idea about asymmetric wage drift. But Hansen questioned the generality of the Rehn-Meidner policy program. Hansen's rigor analysis shall not conceal that, even together with Rehn, he was unable to shed light on the relationship between average profits and wages through labour scarcity or all relations between the policy means in the Rehn-Meidner model.","Stockholms Univ, Natl Ekon Inst, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Erixon, L (通讯作者)，Stockholms Univ, Natl Ekon Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.",lex@ne.su.se,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

In this article we discuss the general aspects of quantitative analysis of the monopoly price differentiation models and we will analyze in more detail the models of consumer's utility maximization in the conditions of price differentiation of the goods and a model of monopoly's profit maximization with price-differentiated production. A problem of monopoly's profit optimization is built on a specific hypothesis that a monopoly gives a consumer an, all or nothing offer, meaning that a differentiated price only applies in a case that a consumer buys the whole amount of a good offered with a differentiated price and a corresponding revenue then guarantees a monopoly's maximum profit. We will analyze a role of consumer's behavior optimization when the consumer's willingness to spend his funds on goods with differentiated prices is related to maximization of his total utility. For the optimization problems we will formulate the Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and we will study their interpretation options.","[Fendekova, Eleonora] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Business Econ, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,,nfendek@dec.euba.sk; fendek@dec.euba.sk,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,159,164,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000028,0

We illustrate the model for US and Canadian unemployment and find that US innovation variables have an effect on Canadian unemployment, and not the other way around, and also that there is no common nonlinearity across the unemployment variables.","[Franses, Philip Hans; Paap, Richard] Erasmus Univ, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Franses, PH (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",franses@ese.eur.nl,,"Franses, Philip Hans/0000-0002-2364-7777",,,,,18,0,0,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Originally, the 2007 legislation was intended to benefit consumers with lower gasoline prices, to reduce carbon emissions, and to promote oil security by displacing imported oil with domestically produced ethanol. While well-intentioned, the realized benefits have been minimal to consumers, the environment, and oil security. Alternatively, the unintended consequences on corn and other food commodity prices are having severe repercussions particularly in developing countries where consumers have more limited substitution possibilities. The extreme drought of 2012 illustrated the folly of mandating fixed quantities of ethanol use in gasoline, while allowing the residual to be left for food uses. It is time to reconsider and rescind the ethanol mandates.","Texas A&M Univ, George Bush Sch Govt, Mosbacher Inst, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Bush School of Government & Public Service,"Griffin, JM (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, George Bush Sch Govt, Mosbacher Inst, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",jgriffin@bushschool.tamu.edu,,,,,,,42,6,8,0,26,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,34.0,4,,,,,1,24,,10.5547/01956574.34.4.1,0.0,,,24,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,218QI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324447100001,0

Either in multiplicative or in additive approaches there may appear some incompatibilities in the pair-wise comparison matrix - inconsistency and/or intransitivity. These properties do not have to occur simultaneously. Inconsistency and/or intransitivity in multiplicative and additive pair-wise comparisons are detected and measured by using consistency index/ratio, transitivity index/ratio, respectively. In this contribution we propose the way how to transform additive ( fuzzy) pair-wise comparison matrix into multiplicative one for which the consistency index/ratio and transitivity index/ratio are defined. An example illustrating the application of the above mentioned approaches is supplemented.","[Kiszova, Zuzana; Ramik, Jaroslav] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,kiszova@opf.slu.cz; ramik@opf.slu.cz,"Ramik, Jaroslav/P-8696-2014",,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,373,378,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000064,0

Based on a qualitative means-end chain analysis this paper therefore explores usage motives, thus expanding the existing insights from analyses of usage behavior. In a series of laddering interviews with users of a US carsharing service, the underlying hierarchical motive structure is uncovered and four motivational patterns are identified: value-seeking, convenience, lifestyle, and environmental motives.

To derive these factors we employ traditional approach via econometric model with logistic regression (probit model) drawing on sample data. In addition, we consider possible pros and cons of introduction of other approaches e. g. hierarchical model of tenure choice (Boehm [5]). Analysis covers period of 2005-2011 and makes use of the data coming from investigation EU-SILC in the Czech Republic. Preliminary results of the basic (probit) model testify to the fact that tenure choice in Czech Republic is influenced by the factors similar to those in other countries - household income, marital status of the household head and household size. On the other hand, the influence of other demographic characteristics of the household head (gender or age) has not been confirmed. Analysis of the tenure choice (i.e. conditional probabilities of choosing housing type) will be accompanied by detailed analysis of households who have moved during the analyzed period.","[Spalkova, Dagmar; Spalek, Jiri] Masaryk Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,dasa@econ.muni.cz; spalek@econ.muni.cz,"Špalek, Jiří/J-9210-2012; Špalková, Dagmar/JWO-4070-2024; Špalková, Dagmar/H-6423-2013","Špalek, Jiří/0000-0001-5832-4946; Špalková, Dagmar/0000-0001-6977-1426",,,,,14,0,0,0,4,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,927,932,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000157,0

A literature review produced 52 potential criteria, subdivided into 10 groups. Based on an analysis of experts' opinions, the perceived importance of each criterion was determined and a set of essential criteria created. To illustrate the usage of these essential criteria, five models (export base, Keynesian, ad hoc, input-output and computable general equilibrium) were evaluated and compared based on their performance on these criteria.

So far there has been no attempt to ascertain whether subregional groupings that exist inside the EU (which represent a potential in-between layer of policy-making between the bilateral and multilateral) are inclined or able to attempt to co-ordinate their positions on Russia. This article focuses on the Visegrad Group (VG), which would appear to be an obvious candidate, but actually has virtually no co-operation agenda vis-a-vis Russia (the other main groupings are the Benelux Economic Union, the Nordic Council and the Weimar Triangle). The article argues that it is difficult to accommodate Russia in the current VG foreign policy framework due to the focus on low politics and integration assistance. It also contends that limited capacity and intra-VG divergence on key aspects of relations with Russia mean that the VG is unlikely to expand its agenda so as to attempt more co-operation on Russia in the future.","Wolverhampton Univ, Sch Law Social Sci & Commun, Dept Hist Polit & War Studies, Wolverhampton WV1 1LY, W Midlands, England",University of Wolverhampton,"Dangerfield, M (通讯作者)，Wolverhampton Univ, Sch Law Social Sci & Commun, Dept Hist Polit & War Studies, Wulfruna St, Wolverhampton WV1 1LY, W Midlands, England.",M.Dangerfield@wlv.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,8,9,2,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The baseline scenario confirms that demographic change in India may yield significant gains to future real per capita income, resulting from a continuing sharp decline in its total dependency ratio. For China, these gains are largely in the past, although the positive contribution of declining youth and working-aged dependency to future per capita income will continue to offset the negative impact of rising aged dependency through to 2030. Whilst a policy change to foster higher fertility rates and hence more rapid population growth in China might ultimately ease its dependency burden, in the short run it will increase it. In any case, such a course is contradictory to the goal of delivering improvements in real per capita income. For India, we confirm that the benefits of further fertility reductions, in the form of increased real per capita income, are substantial.","[Golley, Jane] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Ctr China World, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Tyers, Rod] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Tyers, Rod] Australian Natl Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University; University of Western Australia; Australian National University,"Golley, J (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Australian Ctr China World, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,"Tyers, Rodney/0000-0003-3080-0415",,,,,65,8,8,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2012,35.0,11,,,,,1387,1416,,10.1111/twec.12003,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,041FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311385400001,0

The Government of the Czech Republic introduced a new economic instrument, which came into force on 1 January 2009 and was inspired by similar environmental taxes in Member States of the European Union - the car registration fee, which is based on emission parameters of cars. The main target of this fee has been to change the structure of the passenger car fleet in the Czech Republic, particularly to support new registrations of new passenger cars with better environmental characteristics and to decrease the share of new registrations of used passenger cars. This article focuses on an ex-post analysis of impacts of the car registration fee on the structure of the passenger car fleet in the Czech Republic and its environmental characteristics in the first 3 years after the legal mandate of the fee. The case study is based on a correlation analysis and an analysis of statistical data from official sources in the Czech Republic. The impacts of the car registration fee on both the structure of the passenger car fleet in the Czech Republic and the environmental characteristics of new registrations are significant. For the first time since 2004, the number of new registrations of new cars was higher in the period 2009-2011 than the number of new registrations of used cars. Moreover, the share of alternative fuel cars in the passenger car market is increasing and the emissions from private car transport are decreasing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we combine a macroscopic model of traffic congestion in urban networks with an agent-based simulator to study congestion pricing schemes. The macroscopic model, which has been tested with real data in previous studies, represents an accurate and robust approach to model the dynamics of congestion. The agent-based simulator can reproduce the complexity of travel behavior in terms of travelers' choices and heterogeneity. This integrated approach is superior to traditional pricing schemes. On one hand, traffic simulators (including car-following, lane-changing and route choice models) consider travel behavior, i.e. departure time choice, inelastic to the level of congestion. On the other hand, most congestion pricing models utilize supply models insensitive to demand fluctuations and non-stationary conditions. This is not consistent with the physics of traffic and the dynamics of congestion. Furthermore, works that integrate the above features in pricing models are assuming deterministic and homogeneous population characteristics. In this paper, we first demonstrate by case studies in Zurich urban road network, that the output of a agent-based simulator is consistent with the physics of traffic flow dynamics, as defined by a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). We then develop and apply a dynamic cordon-based congestion pricing scheme, in which tolls are controlled by an MFD. And we investigate the effectiveness of the proposed pricing scheme. Results show that by applying such a congestion pricing, (i) the savings of travel time at both aggregated and disaggregated level outweigh the costs of tolling, (ii) the congestion inside the cordon area is eased while no extra congestion is generated in the neighbor area outside the cordon, (iii) tolling has stronger impact on leisure-related activities than on work-related activities, as fewer agents who perform work-related activities changed their time plans. Future work can apply the same methodology to other network-based pricing schemes, such as area-based or distance-traveled-based pricing. Equity issues can be investigated more carefully, if provided with data such as income of agents. Value-of-time-dependent pricing schemes then can also be determined. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study measures performance of the trade relationship, benchmarking it against other trade flows worldwide, and examines the impact of the politics on bilateral trade performance. To do this, a frontier gravity model is estimated using core determinants of trade. This gives a benchmark against which to measure trade performance, explained using resistances to trade. While the economic relationship is not independent from the politics, an important conclusion is that trade has not been diminished or disturbed by politics to a significant extent. Chinas commitment to the global trading system from the mid-1980s and its accession to the WTO in 2001 has meant that tensions in the political relationship with Japan from time to time have not derailed, but rather have increasingly come to be dominated, by the economic relationship.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Armstrong, SP (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,"Armstrong, Shiro/Q-4118-2019","Armstrong, Shiro/0000-0001-9756-7860",,,,,48,15,18,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2012,35.0,9,,,,,1102,1120,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01473.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,003UV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308637800002,0

This finding is supported by comparing the unconditional productivity averages or distributions, or regressing the productivity on the international status dummy, controlled for the relevant covariates. In the present paper, we disentangle the distribution of the gross productivity premium from the component that is created by the different structural compositions of the two groups of firms; we can thereby measure the distribution of the net premium that is attributable to internationalisation. To this purpose, we use the quantile decomposition methodology (Melly, 2005). The main results highlight that (i) the net premium is substantially lower than the gross premium and (ii) while the difference in the gross premium is uniform along the entire distribution, the net premium is significant only for the less productive firms. These results are confirmed even if different internationalisation modes are considered (i.e. exports, agreements and commercial penetration) using the domestic firms as baseline. One exception is the net premium for firms enrolled in foreign direct investment and/or offshoring; this premium does not decrease for firms at the top of the productivity distribution.","[Ferrante, Maria Rosaria; Freo, Marzia] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Ferrante, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy.",,,"Freo, Marzia/0000-0003-4541-5288; ferrante, maria/0000-0001-9813-2420",,,,,46,4,5,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2012,35.0,9,,,,,1186,1214,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01415.x,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,003UV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308637800007,0

Ordered probit models with random-effects panel allow us to estimate the survey respondents' perceptions of these methods, as well as the roles of individual socio-demographic characteristics in the formation of these perceptions. Both the restriction of automobile traffic and its regulation by congestion (waiting in line) are widely considered unjust by the respondents, regardless of whether they work and whether they are drivers or non-drivers. Their attitudes towards tolls justified by the pollution caused by automobile traffic are less negative. As regards compensation, in addition to emergency vehicles and those that transport people with limited mobility, respondents believe car-pooling ought to benefit of a toll exemption. The support for a reduced rate for low-income users shows a concern for justice to which it will be necessary to respond. The respondents' socio-professional status, level of education, car use or non-use, and residence inside or outside of the toll zone clearly play a role in their perceptions of these methods of regulation and compensation.

It finds that being embedded in this place does not make university students drive alone more than their peers in other places. Being multimodal and having a discounted transit pass increase the odds of alternative modes while holding a parking permit reduces the odds of these modes. Commute distance is positively related to carpool and telecommuting. Gender, status (undergraduate vs. gradate) and age are significantly correlated to biking, walking or public transit. Students living alone are more likely to commute by driving alone than other students. Having friends and classmates living nearby increases the odds of taking public transit. Due to data constraints, this study cannot prove whether there is any correlation between information contagion and the effects of living alone and having friends and classmates living nearby on alternative mode choice. But it proposes that the issue be worthwhile of further investigations. Base on the above, the paper recommends a comprehensive travel demand management program, utilization of information contagion effects of students and promotion of multimodal commute to better promote alternative mode of commute among university students.

We reassess this claim using a four-pronged approach. First, we total smallpox deaths reported by two fur trading posts that were in the midst of the epidemic. Second, we review case fatality rates in other smallpox outbreaks, and discuss the likely incidence of the disease among Native Americans. Third, we analyse trade during the period of the epidemic. Fourth, we estimate the native population prior to the epidemic based on the carrying capacity of the region. All four approaches lead to a similar conclusion. Mortality from smallpox was likely under 20%, which is much less than previously asserted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Using generalized method of moment (GMM) panel data analysis, we find strong evidence of a positive relationship between FDI inflows into a country and its economic performance. We also find evidence that domestic financial system is a significant prerequisite for FDI to have a positive effect on economic growth. Policy implications are clear.

That oversaving and not underinvestment is coming in the way of a quicker and more durable recovery is not just simplistic but misleading from a medium-term growth perspective for emerging Asian countries and other developing countries in this region. Drawing upon country panel data for developing countries and a subsample of Asian countries during the period 19912007, this study makes a case for a bold and coordinated fiscal stimulus, directed to stimulating agricultural and overall growth, and mitigation of poverty and hunger. Our simulations further suggest that poverty reduction is likely to be larger if the fiscal stimulus is directed to social spending in health and education sectors. Indeed, if our simulations of fiscal impacts have any validity, the dire predictions of millions getting trapped in poverty and hunger may turn out to be exaggerated. The prospects of a strong recovery led by fiscal stimulus are thus real and achievable.","[Gaiha, Raghav] Univ Delhi, Fac Management Studies, Delhi 110007, India; [Imai, Katsushi S.] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Thapa, Ganesh] Int Fund Agr Dev, Rome, Italy; [Kang, Woojin] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Delhi; University of Manchester; Australian National University,"Gaiha, R (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Fac Management Studies, Delhi 110007, India.",,"Imai, Katsushi Imai/I-3595-2015","Imai, Katsushi Imai/0000-0001-7989-8914",,,,,30,4,4,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2012,35.0,6,,,,,713,739,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01432.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,944IB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304191600003,0

For the year 2009, we develop a comparative analysis of the ranks of Arab countries according to the Gross Domestic Product / Capita (WB), the Human Development Index (UNDP) and Governance Indicators (KKZ) compared to a group of countries that are part of developed countries, the CEECs, Latin America and Asia, supposedly as a benchmark or model country in order to explain the difference between their developmental trajectories. The analysis shows that the only reference to per capita income or HDI does not explain the differences in development between countries but also institutional quality is the source of this difference. To explain the delayed development of Arab countries compared to the benchmark countries we propose to identify key institutional factors which are responsible for the delay.

Identifying attitude-practice dissonances matters because how they get resolved influences mothers' future employment. Previous research examined changes in women's attitudes and employment, or spouses' adaptations to each others' attitudes. This is extended by considering how women and men in couples simultaneously adapt to parenthood in terms of attitude and behavioural changes and by exploring indirect effects of economic constraints. Structural equation models and regression analysis based on the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2007) are applied. The results suggest that less traditional attitudes among women and men are more likely in couples where women's postnatal labour market participation and the use of formal childcare contradict their traditional prenatal attitudes. Women's prenatal earnings have an indirect effect on attitude change of both partners through incentives for maternal employment.","[Schober, Pia] Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Cambridge CB2 3RQ, England",University of Cambridge,"Schober, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Free Sch Lane, Cambridge CB2 3RQ, England.",pss36@cam.ac.uk,,"Schober, Pia/0000-0003-1953-1197",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G020779/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G020779/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,31,80,82,3,56,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

However, since a particularly poor performance is usually punished by relegation and since being relegated to the respective second division is associated with a dramatic decline in revenues, avoiding relegation is a target in itself. Using data from seven different professional team sports leagues in four different countries we estimate various parametric and semi-parametric regression models to identify the determinants of the clubs' length of stay in their respective first division. In line with the organizational ecology literature we find that club experience, previous club performance (number of previous championship titles and number of previous relegations) and market size (average attendance) affect survival in a statistically significant and economically relevant sense. Perhaps surprisingly, founding conditions seem to be irrelevant for a club's length of stay in its respective first division.","[Frick, Bernd; Wallbrecht, Bjoern] Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Dept Management, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Frick, Bernd] Volkswagen AG, Inst Labor & Personnel Management, D-38440 Wolfsburg, Germany; [Frick, Bernd] Univ Trier, Inst Labour Law & Ind Relat European Community, D-54286 Trier, Germany",University of Paderborn; Volkswagen; Volkswagen Germany; Universitat Trier,"Frick, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Dept Management, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",bernd.frick@notes.upb.de; bjoern.wallbrecht@web.de,,,,,,,69,4,4,0,18,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The equation is estimated using a Heckman version of a GMM instrumental variable method. Our results provide strong evidence of that import flows vary systematically with the investigated corruption characteristics and enable the identification of channels through which corruption affects international trade.

Dynamic behavior is determined essentially by two types of entities: on one hand, the degree of information stickiness that characterizes the price-setting decisions of firms and the consumption and labor supply decisions of households and, on the other hand, a policy parameter that indicates how the central bank acts in order to stabilize prices. Under perfect foresight, stability will hold and the degree of information stickiness simply indicates the velocity of convergence towards the steady-state. If the ability to forecast future events is less than perfect, stability will then depend on monetary policy-the main result is that the stickier the diffusion of information is, the more aggressive monetary policy must be in order to guarantee convergence towards the long-term steady-state.","[Gomes, Orlando] Inst Super Contabilidade & Adm Lisboa ISCAL IPL, P-1069035 Lisbon, Portugal; [Gomes, Orlando] Unidade Invest Desenvolvimento Empresarial UNIDE, Lisbon, Portugal",Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Gomes, O (通讯作者)，Inst Super Contabilidade & Adm Lisboa ISCAL IPL, Av Miguel Bombarda 20, P-1069035 Lisbon, Portugal.",omgomes@iscal.ipl.pt,"Gomes, Orlando/JAC-2919-2023; Gomes, Orlando/B-6043-2009","Gomes, Orlando/0000-0002-7251-8736;",,,,,25,3,3,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In conventional welfare economics, individuals' preferences are assumed to be coherent, and the satisfaction of those preferences is the normative criterion; but this approach breaks down if preferences are incoherent. Traditionally, the preference-satisfaction criterion has been interpreted in three conceptually different ways, emphasising respectively the normative value of happiness, self-assessed well-being, and freedom. If individuals' preferences are incoherent, these interpretations diverge, leading to fundamentally different strategies for dealing with the reconciliation problem, and new questions are raised about whether normative economics should be addressed to governments or individuals.","[McQuillin, Ben; Sugden, Robert] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [McQuillin, Ben; Sugden, Robert] Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Sugden, R (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",r.sugden@uea.ac.uk,"Sugden, Robert/B-1153-2012","Sugden, Robert/0000-0002-3401-3139",ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,39,41,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2012,38.0,4,,,,,553,567,,10.1007/s00355-011-0627-1,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,918PI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302262200001,0

However, there are no long run analyses on this topic that cover the whole span from Unification to present days. This paper contributes to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between real exports, imports and GDP in Italy from 1863 to 2004 by using cointegration analysis and causality tests. The outcome suggests that these variables comove in the long run but the direction of causality varies across time. In the period prior to the First World War import growth led GDP growth that in turn led export growth. Conversely, in the post-Second World War period we have a strong bidirectionality between imports and exports consequent on the increase in intra-industry trade. We also find a weak support for export-led growth and growth-led imports. This suggests that exports were not the only or the main driver of economic growth. There was probably a multiplicity of factors at work, among which high rates of capital formation and the expansion of internal demand probably stood out. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These quality differentials in inputs and outputs are mostly ignored in empirical studies. These omissions make the practical value of productivity studies in organizations like banks questionable because quality is a key component of performance. This paper proposes using hedonic aggregator functions (as a tool of aggregating inputs and outputs with quality attributes) within an input distance function framework and analyzes the impact of banking deregulation on efficiency and total factor productivity (TFP) change in the Indian banking industry using panel data for the period 1996-2005. Empirical results indicate that banks have improved their efficiency (from 61% in 1996 to 72% in 2005) during the post-deregulation period, and the gain in efficiency of state-owned banks has surpassed that of private banks. Improvement in capital base, as indicated by increased capital adequacy ratio, played an important role in ushering efficiency gain. The return to scale estimate suggests that state-owned banks are operating far above their efficient scale and cost savings can be obtained by reducing their size of operations. Overall, TFP growth was above 3.5% annually. Both technical progress and technical efficiency change consistently played an important role in shaping TFP growth.

In the short term, pill access caused declines in fertility and increases in both the share of children born with low birthweight and the share born to poor households. In the long term, access led to negligible changes in fertility while increasing the share of children with college-educated mothers and decreasing the share with divorced mothers. The short-term effects appear to be driven by upwardly mobile women opting out of early childbearing, while the long-term effects appear to be driven by a retiming of births to later ages. These effects differ from those of abortion legalization, although we find suggestive evidence that pill diffusion lowered abortions. Our results suggest that abortion and the pill are on average used for different purposes by different women, but on the margin, some women substitute from abortion toward the pill when both are available.","[Ananat, Elizabeth Oltmans] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Ananat, Elizabeth Oltmans; Hungerman, Daniel M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hungerman, Daniel M.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Notre Dame,"Ananat, EO (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [R03 HD057362-02, R03 HD057362, R03 HD057362-01A2] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,42,64,88,0,36,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This article presents first empirical evidence on international student migration to Germany, one of the most important destination countries for international students worldwide. While previous research in the field has mainly used data on international trade in educational services, I use a novel approach that analyzes student mobility as a form of migration, using data on international student migrants. An augmented gravity equation is the basis for the theoretical and empirical framework. I also provide extensive sensitivity checks of the empirical results and estimates using both the usual log-linearized and a multiplicative specification of the gravity equation, following recent work by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (Rev Econ Stat 88(4): 641-658, 2006). The results provide evidence for the importance of distance-a familiar result from the empirical migration literature.

A Tobit model is used to evaluate the effects on fishing trip length of personal and trip characteristics.

Of the age classes, the population share of 'young retirees' - people aged between 65 and 74 - increased the number of visits to nature areas significantly, whereas the share of 'baby boomers' - people aged between 55 and 64 - was insignificant in explaining the number of visits. As the baby boomers are reaching retirement age, and assuming that their generation behaves like the young retirees in this study, the demand for national parks and hiking areas may increase substantially in the coming years.

The results provide evidence that cultural proximity between country of origin and country of destination has positive effects on the tourism flows between those countries. In particular, after controlling for a set of geographical variables, more people from countries with the same language (English) and high governmental rankings comparable to that of the USA travel to the USA for holidays than people from other countries. Above all, there is strong evidence that tourists from Christian countries prefer the USA as a holiday destination much more than people from other countries.

An analysis of the British Railway Mania, which occurred in the 1840s, suggests that investors may have been myopic, as their expectations were only accurate in the short-term, but they remained rational, as they acted in a utility maximising manner given their expectations. Investors successfully incorporated forecasts of short-term dividend changes into their valuations, but were unable to predict longer-term changes. When short-term growth is controlled for, it appears that the railways were priced consistently with the non-railways throughout the entire episode. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Empirical findings showed that there is a significant long-run relationship between the variables under study. Nevertheless, the expenditure on research and development does not produce a high return in terms of gross national income per capita; indeed, it produces a rather mild payback. Since expenditure in research and development is inevitable for a country to remain competitive in a globalized economy; therefore, enhancing research and development is still a relevant strategy.

War events, which have significantly affected this part of Croatia, have left a large and indelible mark on the economy, whose recovery has demanded new knowledge, skills and approaches. High unemployment rate, and restructuring destruction and of large systems were incentive for an increasing number of people to solve their subsistence through self-employment. In their attempts to find entrepreneurial ideas, and start entrepreneurial ventures, they came across numerous obstacles, greatest among which were lack of information and entrepreneurial knowledge. Start-up entrepreneurs lacked one of the most important factors for quality and successful start of entrepreneurial career - entrepreneurial environment. Entrepreneurial environment is an environment that ensures access to sources of funding, favourable government policies and programmes, and access to professional services. In that situation, establishment of Centre for Entrepreneurship Osijek, which was among the first entrepreneurial centres that were established in Croatia, seemed as a logical step in fostering economic development of the region. Centre for Entrepreneurship Osijek was founded in 1977, as a non-governmental organisation, with the aim to promote entrepreneurial behaviour and provide information to all future and current entrepreneurs, related to start-up and development of entrepreneurial ventures. Today, after 15 years of existence, the Centre has become a reference point of Osijek's entrepreneurial infrastructure, the oldest centre for entrepreneurship in Croatia, Centre which entrepreneurs still visit every day. Through the case of Centre for Entrepreneurship Osijek, programmes and activities it carries out, and work on encouraging entrepreneurship in Eastern Croatia, this paper will attempt to show the importance of supporting institutions in the development of entrepreneurial environment. By analysing the number of users of services of Centre for Entrepreneurship Osijek, collaboration and networking with other supporting institutions, and institutions of local self-government (Association of Croatian Institutions for Promotion of Entrepreneurship - UHIPP, Business Incubator BIOS ltd., Croatian Employment Service, Regional Office Osijek, Office for Economy of the City of Osijek, Agency for Development of Osijek-Baranja County, etc.), will show the scope of activities of this organisation. The main objective of this paper is to underscore the importance of supporting institutions in fostering entrepreneurship, that is, development of an enabling and supportive environment, and its importance for starting new, and the growth and development of existing small and medium-sized enterprises in Eastern Croatia.","[Delic, Anamarija; Alpeza, Mirela; Peterka, Suncica Oberman] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,,adelic@efos.hr; malpeza@efos.hr; suncica@efos.hr,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,12,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,32,42,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600003,0

Further we assume that service of a customer is interrupted by the occurrence of the server failure and the system empties when the server is broken (we call it as the failure-empty discipline). We assume that random variables relevant to server failures and repairs are exponentially distributed.

From a growth perspective, high and rising levels of inflation as in 2006-2008 raise concerns that inflation, if uncontained, could undermine growth. On the other hand, higher levels of inflation could create more space for using monetary policy to reduce nominal and real interest rates during financial crises. A nonlinear growth regression for 165 countries over 1960-2007 shows that for developing countries, inflation above 10 percent quickly hurts growth. For advanced economies, there is no specific threshold: in the medium term, higher inflation hurts growth for any initial level of inflation, suggesting that there is a real cost to maintaining higher inflation as a buffer.","[Espinoza, Raphael] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Leon, Hyginus] Int Monetary Fund, Western Hemisphere Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Espinoza, R (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",respinoza@imf.org; hleon@imf.org; aprasad@imf.org,,"Ananthakrishnan, Prasad/0000-0003-0888-4675",,,,,37,8,10,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

These forecasts of future increases in home-loan collateral values may have affected both the demand and the supply of mortgages. Standard time series models using repeat-sales indexes suggest that positive trends had a long half-life. Expectations based on such models could lead to an asset bubble. Analysis of data from the HMDA loan database and LoanPerformance.com at the MSA level and at the loan level substantiates the effects of past price trends on the demand and supply of subprime mortgages. On the demand side, at the MSA level, past home price increases are associated with more subprime applications, higher loan to income ratios and lower loan to value ratios of applications for both prime and subprime mortgages. This is consistent with the notion that households not only borrowed more but also invested more in home equity conditional on greater past house price increases. On the supply side, past home price appreciation had a significantly greater impact on the approval rate of subprime applications than the approval rate of prime applications. Loan level analysis indicates that past home price appreciation increased the approval rate of subprime applications but did not affect the approval rate of prime applications. Further, approved HMDA subprime loans had higher loan to income ratios in MSAs with greater past house price trends.","[Goetzmann, William N.; Yen, Jacqueline] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Peng, Liang] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Yale University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Goetzmann, WN (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",william.goetzmann@yale.edu,,,,,,,42,40,47,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In this paper we will try to discriminate between these learning models by running laboratory experiments with incentivized human subjects. Participants predict inflation rates for 50 successive periods in a standard overlapping generations model and are rewarded on the basis of their forecasting accuracy. The information set for each participant contains the past inflation rates and the participant's own past predictions which, in turn, determine the actual inflation rate. We consider two treatments, with a low and a high level of monetary growth, respectively. We find that the level of convergence to the monetary steady state is significantly lower and volatility of inflation rates higher in the second treatment. Constant gain learning algorithms, such as adaptive expectations with a low adjustment parameter, seem to provide a better description of the experimental data than decreasing gain algorithms, such as (ordinary) least squares learning. Moreover, many participants switch between prediction strategies during the experiment on the basis of poor performance of their initial prediction strategy.","[Hommes, Cars; Sonnemans, Joep; Tuinstra, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,,p.heemeijer@uva.nl; c.h.hommes@uva.nl; j.h.sonnemans@uva.nl; j.tuinstra@uva.nl,"Sonnemans, Joep/ITT-9754-2023; Tuinstra, Jan/H-4197-2011","Sonnemans, Joep/0000-0001-7545-7409; Tuinstra, Jan/0000-0001-6156-4940; Hommes, Cars/0000-0002-2260-2665",,,,,28,6,6,1,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The upsurge of interest in the role of tourism for economic growth is due to its contribution to the host country in terms of foreign exchange earnings, employment, multiplier effects, etc. This turns the sector into a potential strategic factor for economic growth. Tourism in Malaysia follows the same trend. It is fast growing and becoming a major contributor in foreign exchange earnings, second only to manufacturing. Apart from that, government resources are not unlimited. One of the major government expenditures in developing countries is related to health. Thus, what is the effect of health on economic growth in the long run? In addition, the mixed empirical results associated with Granger causality among tourism, health and economic growth have inspired the study to venture into this area within the Malaysian context. Therefore, the study's objectives are to determine statistically: 1) the determinants of long run economic growth; 2) the directions of Granger causality; and 3) the speed of adjustment for economic growth. The study employs econometric techniques namely Johansen cointegration and Granger causality in vector error correction model (VECM). Based on time series data from 1974 - 2010, the study comes out with the following results: 1) the long run relationships reveal that tourism receipts and health are positively and significantly influencing economic growth, 2) economic growth and health precede tourism receipts and 3) the speed of adjustment is 0.11 per cent. The results obtained in the study add to the knowledge in this field and suggest to the policy makers to further improve and sustain tourism to generate higher economic growth.","[Li, Cheam Chai] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Selangor, Malaysia; [Chuan, Ong Soon] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Business & Entrepreneurship, Kelantan, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Malaysia Kelantan,"Li, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Selangor, Malaysia.",,"Chai Li, Cheam/ABC-4890-2020",,,,,,67,0,0,1,8,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,671,+,,,,,,7,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600058,0

Since China employed the independent director system in listed companies in 2001, independent directors have contributed to the protection of minority shareholders' interests and the improvement of corporation government in listed companies. However, there is still a considerable gap between the reality and the goal that the independent director system is established to achieve. Through investigation and statistical analysis, this paper has found out the main problem of the independent director system in China's listed companies, which is the election mechanism of independent directors. The author pointed out that the engagement or dismissal of an independent director is controlled by majority shareholder(s) and chairman of the board or CEO who represents the majority shareholder(s)' interests. For solving the foregoing problem, this paper proposes a detailed, practical solution for the election mechanism of independent directors in listed companies, which based on excluding or restricting controlling shareholder(s) or majority shareholder(s) to nominate independent directors in order that the independent director(s) could maintain independence.","[Li Xuehua] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,,lixuehua@cietac.org,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,982,987,,,,,,6,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500154,0

Monte Carlo simulation tries to iteratively evaluate the deterministic model by using random inputs. Methods of multi-criteria evaluation of alternatives use given inputs to find the order of the alternatives. This order is influenced mainly by weights of the criteria.","[Mynarik, Petr; Kuncova, Martina] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,petr.mynarik@vse.cz; martina.kuncova@vse.cz,"Kuncová, Martina/HSH-3894-2023",,,,,,6,1,1,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,617,621,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900106,0

There are two approximations in deriving the confidence region. First is replacement the nonlinear model by a linear one using a first-order Taylor series. Second is using Kenward-Roger approach for approximation the variance-covariance matrix of the estimators of parameters of the calibration function. The simulation study will be performed in the computer system Matlab.

The areas are exploited to produce inefficiently, and so is the system of incentives and subsidies. Therefore, Croatia is highly dependent on food imports. Although there are still one in three people living in agricultural households, only a few food products are being produced in quantities sufficient for national needs. On food imports such as the one in 2008, Croatia has spent $ 1.5 billion. Rural areas occupy about 85 percent of the territory, and 85 percent of villages are affected by depopulation. Residents of rural areas are characterized by increasing life expectancy and a fifth of the rural population aged between 25 and 40 years wants to move to the cities. In fact, almost half of agricultural land is classified in the group threatened by erosion. Nearly a third of all agricultural land suffers from acidity. More and more farmland is lost by converting agricultural land into construction land. For these reasons, the strategic goal of increasing agricultural production will not be easy to achieve. To achieve this we need to change priorities in national policy towards agriculture and rural areas. It is considered that a major obstacle in the way of raising productivity is the small area (approximately 1.9 hectares) owned by agricultural households. These households, on the other hand, have approximately 80 percent of agricultural resources. Fragmentation of agricultural land does not adopt the global economy, but emphasizes large, easier and faster cost-effective systems. Small agricultural households are facing destruction, and without them there is no life in rural areas and caring for the environment. The imperative to raise productivity in agriculture comes into conflict with the objectives of rural development and sustainable development. In order to counter such trends, the EU wants to use incentives to adjust small and medium-sized farms to market conditions. However, the distributional impact of incentives is such that large manufacturers picked the most money, rather than small and medium producers. This effect leads to land consolidation, the creation of large landowners and the development of profitable food industry. Deregulation and the promotion of competitiveness in agriculture and food industry further complicate the survival of viable rural communities. In surviving villages, the EU wants to develop the competitiveness and diversification of agricultural production in rural households (e. g. tourism and rural crafts). In this paper we explore the ambivalence of European agricultural policy and its impact on Croatian agriculture and countryside, and try to answer the question whether this policy, in the case of Croatia, will lead to the collapse of local agriculture, the disappearance of rural communities and food price increases. Based on experiences of other countries and theoretical models, the paper gives outlines of a national agricultural policy which would, for example, through the development of cooperatives and clusters protect family farms and households living in rural areas. At the same time such a policy could affect the increase in agricultural yield and income of small and medium-sized farmers.","[Odobasa, Rajko] Fac Law, Dept Econ Sci, Osijek, Stjepana Radica, Croatia",,,rodobasa@pravos.hr,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,10,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,108,117,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600012,0

Drawing on a range of recent OECD and trade union statistics, as well as qualitative studies, it is claimed that governments converged substantially over period 1990-2005, introducing fiscal austerity measure and making substantive changes to public sector management and operation through privatization, marketization, and public-private partnerships. These substantially recast public sector industrial relations and led to job loss, labour market segmentation, and declining public sector labour power.

In this overlapping and sometimes conflicting scenario what Latin Americanness should mean, and how integration projects should respond to current challenges of global political economy are being redefined. The focus of the paper is twofold: to better understand current regional transformations and to discuss what new developments mean for how we theorise non-European regionalism. Looking at the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas and the Union of South American Nations we ask: How are we to understand regional agreements that are grounded in different systems of rules, alternative ideas and motivations that contest 'open regionalism'? We argue that Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA) represent different pathways to regional building, creating foundations for post-hegemonic and post-trade regional governance. We thus challenge New Regionalist approaches that assume regionalism as taking place within and modelled by neoliberal economics, establishing the debate around 'old' vs. 'new' regionalism. As these categories are limited in grasping the full meaning and implications of post-hegemonic regional orders, we discuss UNASUR and ALBA as 'arenas for action' to understand divergent practices, outcomes and types of regionness emerging in alternative regional spaces in South America.","Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Riggirozzi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England.",P.Riggirozzi@Soton.ac.uk,,"Riggirozzi, Pia/0000-0001-5809-890X",,,,,65,65,74,0,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We consider an idealized system that delivers its users to a common destination by requiring each to transfer from a feeder- to a trunk-line vehicle. Continuum models are used first to analyze cases in which the trunk-line vehicle schedule is given exogenously. We find that when feeder vehicles are dispatched in coordination with this exogenous trunk-line schedule, the reduction in user cost often outweighs the added cost to the feeder operation. In cases when the frequencies of trunk and feeder services can be established jointly, the models show that coordination can be Pareto improving, meaning that operator and user costs both diminish. Conditions that give rise to these cost savings are specified. Practical implications are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides the environmental issues, crude oil resources are decreasing while their price is increasing. As it is almost impossible to reduce the consumption of plastic products, we will analyze the possibility of producing food packaging, especially laminate films from alternative raw materials which, unlike fossil fuels, are both eco-friendly and renewable. The most common biodegradable and compostable synthetic polymers are lignin, cellulose and starch. These are anticipated to have equal or even better barrier properties and to be easily manufactured through injection moulding, sheet extrusion, blow moulding, thermoforming, film forming and other processes and technologies currently specific to traditional plastics. Being biodegradable and compostable the use of bioplastics solves both the environmental problem of waste disposal and the financial problem of recycling. At the moment, bioplastics covers only 5-10% of the plastic market, the biggest drawback being the cost competitiveness to the traditional plastics - bio-based polymers have wider applications only in the medicine field where the function is more important than the cost. This paper aims to give a complete view over the bioplastics and over the applications than can be used in agricultural systems. It provides an overview over the bioplastic materials and defines which applications are better suited for each one regarding their properties.

The system enabled the country's relatively fast and smooth inclusion in the European monetary system. However, its former rise and recent tendency towards disorganisation clearly overlap with the qualitatively different phases of Europeanisation. At first glance, this overlap supports the thesis that there has been a decline of corporatist pacts in the post-EMU period, suggesting that the decline is caused by the more or less successful internalisation of EMU demands and pressures during the accommodation process. In the Slovenian case, this interpretation is basically misleading. It is true that the decline of corporatism in Slovenia was connected with EMU pressures, but the primary source of its disorganisation lay in its specific micro-foundations.","Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Chair Human Resources & Social Management, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Stanojevic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Chair Human Resources & Social Management, Kardeljeva Ploscad 5, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",Miroslav.Stanojevic@fdv.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,33,15,16,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,5,,,,,857,877,,10.1080/09668136.2012.681540,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,958AJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305208000003,0

Much of the bias could be explained by various client and appraiser characteristics. The relation between the client and the appraiser affects valuation bias. Customer employed appraisers tend to give more client friendly valuations than their court appointed counterparts. However, experienced and licensed appraisers render less biased valuations. The appraisal bias does not appear to depend on neighborhood and demographic characteristics. In addition, experienced and licensed appraisers provide materially more accurate valuations. Unlicensed, inexperienced appraisers have an error rate approximately four times worse than licensed, experienced appraisers.","[Zhu, Shuang; Pace, R.

It builds on the results of factor analysis, which defined seven significant factors that characterize the socio-economic status of communities. The input for cluster analysis was the factor loadings, which allowed making multi-dimensional classification of the studied municipalities. To build the structure of clusters there were used both hierarchical clustering methods and non-hierarchical clustering methods with the help of k-means. In the first case the Ward's method was utilized to create clusters and the results were graphically displayed by tree diagram. With the help of the division procedure an initial cluster was divided into 2 to 4 smaller clusters. Two basic clusters can be classified as urban and rural. Urban cluster is characterized by better features of population settlement, age structure, civic amenities and the branch structure. On the contrary, cluster consisting of rural communities has an aging population, population migrating to cities, poor civic amenities and the employment structure is dominated by manufacturing and agriculture. When lowering the clustering level, it can be found that rural cluster breaks down to agricultural, submountaneous and cross-border areas. In the second stage, the method of non-hierarchic clustering using k-means was applied on the results of factor analysis. A set of municipalities of the Liberec Region was gradually divided into 2 to 10 clusters, which were analyzed in detail using the R-square index and Calinski-Habarasz F index. Taking into account the requirement that the clusters were not formed only by a few elements and outlying values, the region was finally divided into 6 clusters, which can be classified as urban, micro-regional, economically weak and rural focused on housing, services and agriculture.","[Zizka, Miroslav] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,miroslav.zizka@tul.cz,"Zizka, Miroslav/I-5624-2016","Zizka, Miroslav/0000-0002-7804-3954",,,,,9,1,1,0,5,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,1045,1050,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900179,0

Despite obvious theoretical appeal, significant startup costs and a reliance on grid-based methods have limited the use of policy function iteration as a solution algorithm. We reduce these costs by providing a user-friendly suite of MATLAB functions that introduce multi-core processing and Fortran via MATLAB's executable function. Within the class of policy function iteration methods, we advocate using time iteration with linear interpolation. We examine a canonical real business cycle model and a new Keynesian model that features regime switching in policy parameters, Epstein-Zin preferences, and monetary policy that occasionally hits the zero-lower bound on the nominal interest rate to highlight the attractiveness of our methodology. We compare our advocated approach to other familiar iteration and approximation methods, highlighting the tradeoffs between accuracy, speed and robustness.","[Richter, Alexander W.] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Haley Ctr 0332, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Throckmorton, Nathaniel A.; Walker, Todd B.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Walker, TB (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, 100 S Woodlawn,Wylie Hall 105, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",arichter@auburn.edu; nathrock@indiana.edu; walkertb@indiana.edu,,"Richter, Alexander/0000-0003-2876-9615; Throckmorton, Nathaniel/0000-0002-9671-757X",National Science Foundation [SES 096221],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank Troy Davig for many helpful discussions and Bulent Guler and a referee for helpful comments.

The agent's demand level is the minimum level of the public good from which she can receive a positive benefit. In this game, there exists a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium at which the (Pareto) efficient allocation is achieved. The voluntary participation game may also have a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium with underprovision of the public good. However, some subgame perfect Nash equilibrium with the efficient allocation satisfies strong perfection, introduced by Rubinstein (Int J Game Theory 9:1-12, 1980), and strong perfection is satisfied only by the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium with the efficient allocation. Furthermore, all payoffs at strong perfect equilibria belong to the core of the enterprise game. By these results, we conclude that in our case, the voluntary participation problem is not as serious as the earlier studies report.

We investigate the role of dispensing physicians in the consumption of antibiotics characterized by two opposite external effects: infection prevention and control, and bacterial resistance. We model the interaction between competing physicians (with and without dispensing of drugs) and patients exposed to bacterial infections and show that spatial effects of consumption may generate ambiguous results. Then, we propose an empirical exercise which exploits data from small geographic areas in Switzerland where two regimes - prescribing physicians and dispensing physicians - are possible. We consider spatial aspects of antibiotic consumption by means of combined spatial lag and spatial error econometric estimators for panel data (SARAR models). We find evidence that dispensing practices increase antibiotic use after controlling for determinants of demand and access, and spatial effects. Whether dispensing practices lead to an increase of antibiotic consumption beyond socially optimal levels is unclear and requires further research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The largest Brazilian port, the port of Santos, is the 42nd largest container port in the world. However, Santos' performance indicators are much lower than those of the world's largest ports, so comparisons with them are difficult. This article focuses on the Brazilian container terminals that handled containers in 2009 and compares port competitiveness. This study classified seventeen Brazilian container terminals into three distinct groups based on the following competitiveness criteria: number of containers handled, berth length, number of berths, terminal tariffs (in US$), berth depth, rate of medium consignment (in containers/ship), medium board (containers/hour), average waiting time for mooring (in hours/ship), and average waiting time for load or unload cargo (in hours/ship). This classification used a hierarchical cluster analysis. The classification shows that the terminal of Tecon in the port of Santos has the best performance of all, while small terminals (<150,000 container units) are the worst performing terminals in Brazil.

Even under random treatment assignment, subsequent selection into the mediator is generally non-random such that causal mechanisms are only identified when controlling for confounders of the mediator and the outcome. To tackle this issue, units are weighted by the inverse of their conditional treatment propensity given the mediator and observed confounders. We show that the form and applicability of weighting depend on whether some confounders are themselves influenced by the treatment or not. A simulation study gives the intuition for these results and an empirical application to the direct and indirect health effects (through employment) of the US Job Corps program is also provided.

Data for the municipalities constituting the AML and the period 1993-2010 are analysed using static and dynamic panel data models to measure the relative importance of fuel price, income, vehicle stock, the price of public transport, and the availability of urban and suburban rail networks on fuel demand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the Portuguese context to produce fuel demand elasticities for a specific metropolitan area, as opposed to the estimation of country-level aggregate elasticities. Our findings indicate that the elasticity of fuel demand with respect to fuel price ranges between -0.48 and -0.72 in the short run and between -1.19 and -1.82 in the long run. Income elasticities are found to range between 0.51 and 0.54 in the short run and between 1.26 and 1.37 in the long run. The elasticity of fuel demand with respect to vehicle stock (keeping population constant) is 0.57 in the short run and 1.43 in the long run. There is only weak evidence of a reduction in fuel demand as a result of a decrease in the price of public transport, and no effect of greater availability of rail networks. Based on the elasticities estimated, we predict road transport CO2 emissions for the AML according to different macroeconomic scenarios. The results indicate that the emissions target is only achieved in the scenario of poor economic performance. In the presence of medium and strong economic growth, fuel prices would need to increase by about 7% and 11% per year respectively in order to meet the emissions target. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on Austrian microcensus data from 1980 to 2009, multinomial logistic regression models are used to investigate changes in this effect. The findings show converging trends between different educational groups. Couples with children below the age of three whose mothers are highly educated increasingly turn away from the dual breadwinner model and, rather unexpectedly, choose the male breadwinner model. Over the period covered, parents with various combinations of educational attainments opted more and more frequently for the modernized male breadwinner model in which women work part-time. The latter has become the most common arrangement among parents with preschool children. These results are interpreted in the light of institutional and cultural factors, paying special attention to parental leave regulations, the availability of childcare places and attitudes towards mothers' employment.","[Berghammer, Caroline] Univ Vienna, Dept Sociol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Berghammer, Caroline] Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, Wittgenstein Ctr, IIASA,VID OAW,WU, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna; Austrian Academy of Sciences; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Berghammer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Sociol, Rooseveltpl 2, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",caroline.berghammer@univie.ac.at,,"Berghammer, Caroline/0000-0003-4955-8729",,,,,53,40,43,0,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Data limitations and conceptual confusion have hindered efforts to distinguish state economic development strategies and to update existing typologies to reflect contemporary practices. This article uses data from the Council for Community and Economic Research's Expenditures Database in 2007 to evaluate the extent to which the states follow conceptually distinctive economic development strategies. We find that the states' economic development expenditures reflect a high degree of conceptual hybridity rather than strict adherence to supply-side industrial recruitment or demand-side entrepreneurial development.","[Hanley, Caroline] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Douglass, Michael T.] Motley Fool, Alexandria, VA USA",William & Mary,"Hanley, C (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Sociol, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",cehanl@wm.edu,,,,,,,22,16,21,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We use census records to identify a set of high-frequency names among African Americans that were unlikely to be held by whites. We confirm the distinctiveness of the names using over five million death certificates from Alabama, Illinois and North Carolina from the early twentieth century. The names we identify in the census records are similarly distinctive in these three independent data sources. Surprisingly, approximately the same percentage of African Americans had black names historically as they do today. No name that we identify as a historical black name, however, is a contemporary black name. The literature has assumed that black names are a product of the Civil Rights Movement, yet our results suggest that they are a long-standing cultural norm among African Americans. This is the first evidence that distinctively racialized names existed long before the Civil Rights Era, establishing a new fact in the historical literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Particular focus is placed on efforts by Georgian policy-makers to align Georgian political institutions with Western models. Drawing on the concept of policy transfer, the author demonstrates various pitfalls in this process. Based on the gathered evidence, it appears that Georgian policy-makers engaged in various processes of 'incomplete transfer', compounded by a lack of understanding or deliberately false conceptions of Western institutions. Despite democratic rhetoric and interlinkages with the West, Georgia moved to a novel form of 'hyper-presidentialism' and dismantled institutional checks and balances. Hence, the Rose Revolution initially served to reinforce the already existing institutions of 'patronal presidentialism' through a series of misguided institutional modifications. The author also discusses the outcome of the recent parliamentary and presidential elections, which may have ironically and accidentally further democratised the country.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Social Sci, Inst Polit Sci, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Dobbins, M (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Social Sci, Inst Polit Sci, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",Dobbins@soz.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,42,3,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JUL,2014,66.0,5,,,,,759,774,,10.1080/09668136.2014.910941,0.0,,,16,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AJ8AJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337924100004,0

Moreover, we find the QTEs to be very small at quantiles below the median for males, ages 16-17 and 18-19, and non-resident students.

The estimation results obtained from a binomial logistic regression model were used to identify the characteristics of those tourists most likely to opt for each type of direct farm market. A field survey was used to collect data from 437 visitors to rural areas in South Korea. The results show that various factors differentially affect tourists' decisions to visit specific areas or to visit each type of direct farm market. The findings indicate that the people most likely to buy in pick-your-own markets tend to be wealthier or male, whereas married women and people who live in metropolitan areas are more likely to visit on-farm markets.","[Kim, Kyung-Hee] Rural Dev Adm, Natl Acad Agr Sci, Agr Environm Dept, Suwon 441707, South Korea; [Park, Duk-Byeong] Kongju Natl Univ, Coll Ind Sci, Dept Community Dev, Chungnam 340702, South Korea",Rural Development Administration (RDA); Kongju National University,"Park, DB (通讯作者)，Kongju Natl Univ, Coll Ind Sci, Dept Community Dev, 54 Daehak Ro, Chungnam 340702, South Korea.",khkim08@korea.kr; parkdb84@kongju.ac.kr,,,,,,,46,3,3,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

If markets are incomplete and have frictions, however, this may change. Renting should become more likely the more mobile a household has to be and the more income risk can be diversified. Using household panel data from Germany, we test both predictions. We find that mobility requirements have a positive effect on the probability of renting. This effect is robust even after controlling for state dependence, unobserved heterogeneity and other factors known to influence the tenure mode choice. Our data, however, does not support the hypothesis that the potential to diversify net income risk when renting affects the tenure mode choice.","[Schulz, Rainer; Wersing, Martin] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland; [Werwatz, Axel] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre & Wirtschaftsrecht, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",University of Aberdeen; Technical University of Berlin,"Werwatz, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre & Wirtschaftsrecht, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",r.schulz@abdn.ac.uk; martin.wersing@abdn.ac.uk; axel.werwatz@tu-berlin.de,,"Schulz, Rainer/0009-0000-5741-9070",,,,,36,4,5,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The case of Croatian coastal destinations is used. The particular weighting procedures are: (a) factor analysis (FA); (b) expert panel survey; and (c) the equal weights technique. As the results of this study reveal, the weights attached to different sustainability indicators can differ significantly depending on the weighting procedure used. Accordingly, inappropriate choice of weighting procedure could distort the relative importance of different sustainability indicators and thus could result in imperfect decisions by policymakers. The authors argue that the suitability of factor analysis as a weighting procedure in the construction of composite indicators of TS is rather questionable.","[Kozic, Ivan] Inst Tourism, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Mikulic, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Tourism, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute for Tourism - Croatia; University of Zagreb,"Kozic, I (通讯作者)，Inst Tourism, Vrhovec 5, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",ivan.kozic@iztzg.hr; jmikulic@efzg.hr,"Mikulić, Josip/N-9680-2019; Kozic, Ivan/HNS-8655-2023","Mikulić, Josip/0000-0001-7079-668X;",,,,,19,12,12,1,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In the regression models, factor scores were utilized from nature orientation, recreation experience preference (REP), a new ecological paradigm (NEP) and wilderness preference (WPS) scales. Higher scores on a NEP environmentalism factor were associated with higher expenditure, while higher scores on a REP risk seeking factor were associated with lower expenditure. Higher scores on a risk seeking, or challenge factor, from the nature orientation scale was associated with lower expenditure, while higher scores on an inspiration seeking factor were associated with higher expenditure.

In doing so, we use three of the most widely used locally flexible functional forms, the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) of Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), the quadratic AIDS (QUAIDS) of Banks et al. (1997)-an extension of the simple AIDS model that can generate quadratic Engel curves-and the Minflex Laurent model of Barnett (1983), which can also generate quadratic Engel curves. We pay explicit attention to economic regularity, argue that unless regularity is attained by luck, flexible functional forms should always be estimated subject to regularity as suggested by Barnett (2002), and impose local curvature to produce inference consistent with neoclassical microeconomic theory. Our findings indicate that the curvature-constrained Minflex Laurent model is the only model that is able to provide theoretically consistent estimates of the Canadian demand for gasoline. Our estimates show that the own-price elasticity for gasoline demand in Canada is between - 0.738 and - 0.570 -less elastic than previously reported in the literature.

We observe that immigrant borrowers are charged substantially higher interest rates in their mortgages than their native counterparts. These differentials remain high and significant even after controlling for differences in creditworthiness and other factors. Further analyses based on the decomposition of the native-immigrant interest rate gap reveal that the differences in observable factors only account for 12% of the gap.

To identify the effects of this policy change, use is made of the fact that only migrants from EEA member states were affected, while third country citizens were not. Robust evidence is found that the share of low educated permanent migrants from the EEA to Austria reduced relative to the share of low educated permanent migrants from other countries after Austria's EEA accession. This suggests that liberalizing migration may be an effective way to improve the skill structure of migrants in countries with a high share of low-skilled migrants.","[Huber, Peter; Bock-Schappelwein, Julia] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Huber, Peter] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Huber, P (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",Huber@wifo.ac.at,,"Huber, Peter/0000-0001-6263-6395",,,,,31,0,0,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The SURE model was adopted because of the lack of a significant correlation between the dependent variables. The pairwise covariance analysis for any two of the three transportation modes revealed that the transportation modes could substitute for one another. Factors related to modal and demographic characteristics had different impacts on the usage of the three modes. The calculation of elasticity using different population densities and public transportation usage showed that when the 'number of city bus routes' was increased by 50% in areas with high population density and high public transportation usage, car usage decreased by 1.4%, which corresponds to 300,000 vehicles, and total CO2 emissions reduced by 0.0204%. When the 'total length of city bus routes' was increased by 50%, the number of motorcycles used decreased by 83 million, and total CO2 emissions reduced by 1.119%, which corresponds to 1.4 million tonnes of CO2 emission. These findings suggest that these different factors had varying impacts on car and motorcycle usage in different areas. We therefore recommended that future transportation policies consider the varying transportation usage trends in different areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We use the interactive fixed-effects model to address the issue of endogeneity due to the association between cross-state unobserved heterogeneity and divorce law reforms. We document that earlier studies in the literature do not fully control for unobserved heterogeneity and result in mixed empirical evidence on the effects of divorce law reforms. While reconciling these conflicting results, our results suggest that divorce law reforms have temporal positive effects on divorce rates, thus confirming the 2006 findings of Wolfers. Via simulation experiments, we assess the degree to which faulty inclusion or faulty exclusion of interactive fixed effects affects the policy effect estimators. Our results suggest that faulty inclusion only results in efficiency loss whereas faulty exclusion causes bias.

Agent decisions are based on economic partial utilities. It's a new computational tool using cellular and agent-based models. Decision processes are represented through computational agents. Land-use and land cover changes are represented through a cellular model. It belongs to kind of models called Multi-Agent Systems model of Land-Use Cover Change. Decisions concern the estate development in the neighborhood of the agents. Space is discretized in heterogeneous cells where heterogeneous agents interact together (directly or via space). Based on partial utility probabilities, several stochastic simulations are achieved. These simulations are then summarized, replicated and a parameter sensitivity analysis provided. The main parameters influencing the decisions of an agent depend on his type (ecologist, etc.) and on the expected economic activities in his neighborhood. Little information is assumed to be known about the mechanisms determining the parameter values guiding the decisions of the agents, except their type. The whole system constitutes a general virtual model, mostly independent from initial conditions and real data. Sensitivity analysis are used to explore behavioral paths and influencing parameters. In summary, the main contribution of this paper consists in: (i) defining a simulation-based framework for modeling the decisions of many heterogeneous economic agents involved in spatial interactions; (ii) capturing the decision process using general utility-based equations; (iii) providing a sensitivity analysis of initial parameter values. An example of possible application investigating strategies of various categories of agents (institutions, landowners, homeowners, etc.) facing an intense residential development is provided. The framework consists of abstracting institutional characteristics of actual local Urbanism Plan procedures in France. This model constitutes a first step to be further specified.","[Prunetti, Dominique; Muzy, Alexandre; Pieri, Xavier] Univ Corsica Pasquale Paoli, CNRS, LISA, UMR 6240, F-20250 Corte, France; [Innocenti, Eric] Univ Corsica Pasquale Paoli, CNRS, SPE, UMR 6134, F-20250 Corte, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS),"Prunetti, D (通讯作者)，Univ Corsica Pasquale Paoli, CNRS, LISA, UMR 6240, BP 52,Campus Caraman, F-20250 Corte, France.",prunetti@univ-corse.fr,,,,,,,34,5,5,1,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Firstly, we proceed to an analysis of the evolution of specialization in production in the enlarged EU, taking into account all its 27 member countries. Given their decomposability properties, we use the entropy-based indices to measure countries' relative specialization and then, given our rather short period of analysis, we use the bootstrap method to analyze the evolution of the specialization index. We first analyze all economic sectors and then, our analysis is more detailed focusing on manufacturing industries. Globally, we find that specialization is decreasing across all economic sectors, while it is increasing across manufacturing industries. Secondly, we study specialization determinants, with a special interest in the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI). For homogeneity reasons, we analyze two separate samples, one including old EU members plus Cyprus and Malta and the other, the CEECs. In order to take into account the endogeneity of most of our independent variables, we use the vector autoregression (VAR) technique and analyse the impulse response functions. Globally, FDIs seem to positively influence countries' relative specialization, for our both samples and for both economic sectors and manufacturing industries. However, their impact appears weaker than most of the other independent variables, such as the market potential or the relative endowments.","[Vechiu, Natalia; Makhlouf, Farid] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, CATT Ctr Anal Theor & Traitement Donnees Econ, F-64016 Pau, France",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,"Vechiu, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pau & Pays Adour, CATT Ctr Anal Theor & Traitement Donnees Econ, Domaine Univ,Ave Doyen Poplawski,BP 1633, F-64016 Pau, France.",natalia.vechiu@univ-pau.fr; fmakhlouf@hotmail.fr,"Makhlouf, Farid/X-5050-2019; Vechiu, Natalia/GLU-2192-2022","Makhlouf, Farid/0000-0001-8737-6075; Vechiu, Natalia/0000-0002-3806-7353",,,,,46,6,6,0,24,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We also find a significant positive effect on the interaction between FDI stock and distance to the technological frontier, suggesting that the ability of technologically backward countries in absorbing technologies developed at the frontiers increases as more FDI stock is accumulated.","Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Baltabaev, B (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,64,58,65,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2014,37.0,2,,,,,311,334,,10.1111/twec.12115,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AA0OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330793500007,0

Empirical work examining the relationship between such commitments and the flexibilities' that policymakers exercise to get around them is still relatively nascent, especially for emerging economies. This paper provides a rich, empirically based assessment of ways that Turkey exercised trade policy flexibilities during the global economic crisis of 2008-11. First, and despite multilateral and customs union commitments that might limit changes to its applied tariffs, Turkey exercised flexibilities during 2008-11 by making changes to both its applied MFN and preferential tariffs that could affect nearly 9 per cent of its manufacturing imports. Second, Turkey's cumulative application of temporary trade barrier (TTB) policies - that is, anti-dumping, safeguards and countervailing duties - is estimated to impact an additional 4-6 per cent of Turkey's manufacturing imports by 2011. Other surprising results include Turkey's lengthy extensions to the duration of previously imposed anti-dumping and safeguards beyond expected removal dates, conversion of product coverage from one TTB policy to another, extensive coverage of upstream and downstream segments of important industries and potential deepening of discriminatory preferences already inherent in existing preferential trade agreements.","World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Trade & Int Integrat DECTI, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Trade & Int Integrat DECTI, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,"Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",,,,,38,10,12,2,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2014,37.0,2,,,,,193,218,,10.1111/twec.12114,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AA0OC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330793500002,0

The difference of incidences of poverty (head count ratios) in two parts (North and South) of rural West Bengal is then decomposed using the familiar Oaxaca decomposition methodology into an aggregate characteristics effect, which is interpreted as a resource effect and an aggregate coefficients effect, which is interpreted as an efficiency effect. An important observation from the present analysis is that the poorer North Bengal has a scarcity in terms of availability of characteristics (resources) compared to that in South Bengal and the resource scarcity in North Bengal is the dominant factor causing the poverty gap between the two parts of West Bengal. Thus, attention needs to be paid to North Bengal with respect to enhancement of important policy variables like education level, Government aid, and employment opportunities.","[Chattopadhyay, Somnath] ICRA Ltd, Monetary Res Project, Kolkata 700045, India; [Majumder, Amita] Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata, India; [Jaman, Hasanur] Bidhannagar Municipal Sch, Kolkata, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata,"Chattopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，ICRA Ltd, Monetary Res Project, B 245 Lake Gardens,Ground Floor, Kolkata 700045, India.",pikluchatterjee@gmail.com; amita@isical.ac.in,,,,,,,49,4,4,1,24,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

By thus escaping the macroeconomic trilemma, they should have been able in practice to avoid taking account of foreign exchange developments in the determination of the monetary policy interest rate. The goal of this paper is to test this assumption empirically. Using a Taylor-rule approach, the paper shows that towards the collapse of the Bretton Woods system the volatility of the spread between the two segments of the foreign exchange market played a growing role in the determination of the monetary policy interest rate.","[Durre, Alain] Lille Catholic Univ, IESEG Sch Management, Lille, France; [Durre, Alain] CNRS, LEM, UMR 8179, Paris, France; [Ledent, Philippe] Catholic Univ Louvain, Econ Sch Louvain, Louvain, Belgium",IESEG School of Management; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Durr, A (通讯作者)，Lille Catholic Univ, IESEG Sch Management, Lille, France.",a.durre@ieseg.fr; philippe.ledent@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

J,"Givoni, M",,,,"Givoni, Moshe",,,Addressing transport policy challenges through Policy-Packaging,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,,"Policy packaging is not a new concept and hardly anyone would dispute the merit of strategically considering and deploying several policy measures in combination to address transport policy issues. Yet the concept of policy packaging remains largely vague, and how to 'package' policies is not really considered or suggested. Policy packaging in most cases remains just a term. The Optimal Policies for Transport in Combination (OPTIC) project aimed to start advancing state-of-the-art in the design of policy packages. The project objective was to turn policy packaging into a well-established approach to policy making, with solid theoretical and methodological foundations that can also be practically applied in the field. This editorial to the special issue on Policy Packaging serves to first define and explain the main principles of policy packaging and the goals it strives to achieve: increasing effectiveness, implementability and thus efficiency. It then describes the main contribution of each of the papers in the special issue to research and practice of policy packaging and it outlines some avenues for further research. The paper concludes by setting a few criteria to distinguish a policy package from a 'list' of policies and by arguing that only through case studies and application in practice that state-of-the-art policy packaging can be really advanced.

Fueling this debate is the uncertainty pertaining to the benefits of HI in general, and the relative benefits of private versus public HI in particular. This uncertainty stems from non-random selection into different types of HI (private, public, or none) in combination with the absence of experimental data. Moreover, the lack of typical exclusion restrictions complicates identification of the causal effects of different HI types. Here, the aim is to assess the causal impact of public HI, relative to private HI, on the insured infant's health. To that end, this study employs the methodology proposed in Altonji et al. (J Polit Econ 113:151-184, 2005) which trades off what can be learned in exchange for not requiring an exclusion restriction. Nonetheless, the method remains quite informative in the present context. Specifically, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, Birth Cohort, along with several measures of infant health, the results suggest that while public HI is associated with worse infant health, this association disappears once selection on observables and unobservables is considered. In fact, the estimated effects of public HI are predominantly positive once both types of selection are admitted. Further analysis reveals that the likely beneficial effects of public HI are due to greater coverage for infants at a much lower cost.","IMPAQ Int LLC, Columbia, MD USA",American Institutes for Research,"Roy, M (通讯作者)，IMPAQ Int LLC, Columbia, MD USA.",mroy@impaqint.onmicrosoft.com,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

For Asia, the evidence shows that as intraregional exchange rate volatility increases, intraregional exports in these goods fall. This adverse impact is even more pronounced in the subregion of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)+5 comprising ASEAN member countries plus the People's Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Japan; the Republic of Korea; and Taipei, China; and especially among intermediate and equipment exports. Again, the impact magnifies in an even smaller subgroup excluding the smaller ASEAN economies. These results underline the significant impact of exchange rate volatility on the region's production networks. For South Asia, however, exchange rate volatility appears to have a positive impact on exports. Still, caution is warranted given that South Asian economies trade relatively little with each other.","Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Tang, HC (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Manila, Philippines.",,,,,,,,37,14,15,1,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2014,37.0,2,,,,,335,352,,10.1111/twec.12095,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AA0OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330793500008,0

The article suggests a third possibility, namely that Keynes's 'method', and methodological continuity throughout his writings, allow the possibility to adapt theories to changing times and circumstances, that is, to different quaesita. It thereby emphasizes that, though elaborated having in mind the theoretical framework of the Treatise on Money, Keynes's early articles on the Great Depression tell much about the future as well as the past of his theoretical journey. In particular, the article illustrates two 'big pictures' providing the background for the Keynes's evolving thoughts on the main issues of capitalism. The criticality of investment decisions under conditions of irreducible uncertainty and the ineliminable tensions between creditors and debtors, also at the international level, endangering national autonomy and policy space, are here discussed as two main constants in the evolution of Keynes's thinking, providing insights that might be relevant to interpret the current recession.","[Carabelli, Anna M.] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dipartimento Studi Econ & Impresa, Vercelli, Italy; [Cedrini, Mario A.] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; University of Turin,"Cedrini, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",mario.cedrini@unito.it,,"Cedrini, Mario Aldo/0000-0003-1059-4458",,,,,65,1,2,0,10,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The key conditions are the presence of domestic actors able to use the EU and carry over procedural policy requirements from the acquis to other policy-making. Analysing policy-making processes in the forestry sector, we find NGOs able to use EU links and governments sensitive to naming and shaming can result in a positive influence of EU rules on the policy process and quality of democracy.

This is the first study to consider clinically measured levels of body composition rather than BMI to investigate the effects of food prices on obesity outcomes among youths classified by gender and race/ethnicity. Our findings suggest that increases in the real price per calorie of food for home consumption and the real price of fast-food restaurant food lead to improvements in obesity outcomes among youths. We also find that a rise in the real price of fruits and vegetables leads to increased obesity. Finally, our results indicate that measures of PBF derived from BIA and DXA are no less sensitive and in some cases more sensitive to the prices just mentioned than BMI, and serve an important role in demonstrating that rising food prices (except fruit and vegetable prices) are indeed associated with reductions in obesity rather than with reductions in body size proportions alone.

This paper analyses features of communication processes of the Information Age as well as the influence of new e-technologies on methods of communication, notably in regard to organisation, management and the market. The emphasis is on analysis of those communication processes that are based on script and written word, that is, on those technical aids which use a Latin alphabet keyboard for communicational purposes. The Latin alphabet is, therefore, viewed as a means of communication and its character potential, especially that which relies on information age technology, is examined. The research of the character potential of the Latin alphabet includes comparison of features of the Latin script to the writing system known as the Glagolitic script. Glagolitic is described in its genesis as well as in the ability of the Glagolitic system of characters to convey a threefold message with a single character (each character is simultaneously a grapheme, a number and a symbol). Also discussed is the ability of Glagolitic characters to form a, symbolic sentence, whichis a resultof the order in which they are placed in a character unit and their ability to convey a twofold message: a) a word or a symbolic sentence, which communicationally is more demanding and complex. The said attribute of Glagolitic characters (graphemes) indicates their ability to create, unlike the letters of the Latinic alphabet, communication by variations in the order in which they are placed within a single meaningful unit and according to their place in the, symbolic sentence (the order accorded to them in a character sequence) and according to their graphemic-phonetic meaning when they are read and interpreted as a word that is an integral part of the language. This shows how the Glagolitic script effectively creates semiotic communication and thus is observed as a model for setting a paradigm for potentials of Latin and other written characters in communication processes of the Information Age.","[Horvat, Jasna] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Mikrut, Martina] Fac Law Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Lebeda, Ivana Ljevak] Naklada Ljevak Ltd, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Horvat, J (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",jasna@efos.hr; mmikrut@pravos.hr; ivana.ljevak@naklada-ljevak.hr,"Horvat, Jasna/AAC-5827-2022","Horvat, Jasna/0000-0001-9665-1470",,,,,24,1,1,0,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,335,344,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600031,0

Since the dependent variable is not only binary and dyadic, but also spatially correlated, we propose a spatial origin-destination probit model and a Bayesian estimation methodology that avoids inconsistent maximum likelihood estimates. We apply the model to militarized interstate dispute initiations, observations of which are clearly binary and dyadic and which may be spatially correlated due to their geographic distribution. Using a cross-section of 26 European countries drawn from the period leading up to WWII, we find empirical evidence for target-based spatial correlation and sizable network effects resulting from the correlation. In particular, we find that the effect of national military capability of the potential aggressor, which is a significant determinant of conflict in either case, is overstated in a benchmark model that ignores spatial correlation. This effect is further differentiated by the geographic location of a country. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Luo, Shali; Miller, J.

Although is usually linked to its economic and environmental impact, no less valuable is its impact on socio-cultural elements. Social dimension of tourism is seen through tourists' staying, movements and interaction with other tourists as well as with residents of a certain tourist area. The extent and direction of the impact of tourism on residents significantly depend on the level of tourism development in a destination, on inclusion of residents in tourism offer as well as on momentary impact of tourism in the destination. The aim of this paper is to determine the mutual influence of tourism and local community in a tourist destination. The paper will present the results of a research of the attitude of residents conducted in Zadar County as a tourist destination during 2013. The research was conducted through a structured questionnaire encompassing all regional-developmental units defined in Tourism Development Master Plan for Zadar County 2013 - 2020. An accidental sample of the residents included 889 examinees belonging to various age groups. The research analyzed the residents' perception of the impact of tourism on Zadar County as a tourist destination and their satisfaction with the level of tourism development and tourism offer. The research also determined in which activities the residents are involved in tourism as well as the ways for their future involvement. Moreover, the research identified the direct benefits from tourism for the destination but also the externals conditioned by them. The conclusion proposes possible directions in reduction of the negative impact of tourism on local community and reinforcement of the positive interaction between tourists and residents.","[Miocic, Bozena Krce] Univ Zadar, Dept Tourism & Commun Studies, Zadar, Croatia",University of Zadar,"Miocic, BK (通讯作者)，Univ Zadar, Dept Tourism & Commun Studies, Zadar, Croatia.",,"Krce Miocic, Bozena/ISU-6504-2023","Krce Miocic, Bozena/0000-0001-5845-8901",,,,,7,0,0,1,11,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,531,538,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900068,0

The paper focuses on the quantification of relation between economic performance and public debt. There is an analysis of 27 EU countries and other 13 OECD economies data (1971-2010) divided into two groups - developed economies and less developed emerging markets and categorized into four blocks. Main findings of the paper are following: increasing public indebtedness as a percentage of GDP has led to lower economic performance in analysing group of 40 countries. The difference between the highest and lowest category of public debt level is almost 2 percent.

This paper develops a methodology for identifying them and applies it to answer several lingering questions in the context of the US. It contributes to a more general debate in the general industrial clusters literature: while many authors see industrial clusters growing, others see them dispersing. To answer this and related questions in the context of logistics clusters the paper first analyzes the prevalence of such clusters using a two-index methodology to identify clusters in the US. Evidence of increasing concentration of the logistics industry in clusters in the US over time is tested and documented. In addition, some evidence that logistics activities in counties inside clusters show higher growth than counties outside clusters is found. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that Japanese agricultural industry organization patterns is agricultural cooperatives and Chinese agricultural industry organization patterns is not clear, which most farm households do not join in agricultural industry organization. This makes that Chinese farm households are confronted with more price risk of factor than Japanese ones. As a result, Chinese farm household will be inclined to invest too much self-supporting factors, for example labor and land, too little no self-supporting factors, for example tractor and fertilizer. Under the additivity assumptions of gross production function, the production inefficiency of micro-farm household will lead to macro production inefficiency of one country. The empirical research supports above inference, which land and labor are overinvested in China. So, the government should promote the establishment of the agricultural cooperatives to stabilize the factor price and to improve agricultural production efficiency.","Beijing Inst Graph Commun, Finance & Accounting Dept, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Graphic Communication,"Yang, R (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Graph Commun, Finance & Accounting Dept, Beijing, Peoples R China.",evayangrong@bigc.edu.cn,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,4,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-9311-1,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2014,32.0,,,,,,20,25,,,,,,6,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC8FA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000355586700004,0

Researchers, keen to inform metropolitan scale planning efforts, have devised ways of benchmarking regional commuting and land use phenomena. The foundation for these benchmarks rests on metrics that quantify the home-job proximity in terms of the aggregate arrangement of workers relative to jobs. Emanating from the literature on 'excess commuting' and 'jobs housing balance', these metrics are increasingly moving towards policy applications. Despite major methodological developments over the last decade, a key methodological issue remains unresolved. Recently developed metrics under this regional macro-scale framework use zonal-based spatial data (e.g. census tracts or traffic analysis zones (TAZs)) and consequently the values of the metrics may be influenced by the scale (e.g. zone size varies between census blocks versus tracts) and zonal partitioning scheme. Moreover it is not known if values of these metrics vary across scale, and exhibit self-similarity, meaning whether it is possible to infer values from one scale to another. This study examines the relationship between the commuting efficiency framework and spatial scale issues by implementing a suite of commuting metrics in the Boise, Idaho USA metropolitan area. Simulations using geographic information systems (GIS), optimization techniques and fractal analysis show that newer metrics developed post 2002 do not vary with scale, while those devised pre-2002 vary with scale but do so in a predictable way.

However, a peculiar feature of AD has not received much attention: these measures are endogenous to the behaviour of the exporting firms, which can adjust the dumping margin by changing their export price and ask the authority to amend the AD measures accordingly. The objective of this paper is to fill part of this gap in the literature by analysing the AD reviews conducted by the European Union for affirmative petitions initiated in 1980-2009. To this end, a novel data set of all such reviews has been assembled. Summary statistics reveal that more than a third of all petitions concluded with the imposition of AD measures are reviewed at least once before their expiration, and most reviews lead to lower AD duties (although, almost 20percent of the firms investigated through interim reviews see their duties increase). There are significant differences in the outcome of the reviews depending on the party requesting them (i.e. reviews lodged by European producers are less likely to lead to lower duties). These conclusions are confirmed by the econometric analysis, which also shows that Chinese firms see their duties reduced significantly less than those of firms from other countries.","[Nita, Andreea C.] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Zanardi, Maurizio] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Zanardi, Maurizio] Univ Libre Bruxelles ECARES, Brussels, Belgium",Lancaster University; Lancaster University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Nita, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",,,"Nita (Danila), Andreea Corina/0000-0001-6122-3134; Zanardi, Maurizio/0000-0003-1713-1034",,,,,22,7,7,4,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2013,36.0,12,,,,,1455,1477,,10.1111/twec.12113,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,273CN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328511500001,0

As a prominent nationalist, he joined the Fascist regime from its very beginning and in 1925 was named official speaker of the Presidential Committee for the study of constitutional reforms. The laws suggested by the Commission were the first step towards the gradual corporatisation' of the Italian society, a process that Gino Arias encouraged through many essays and writings that appeared in the main Fascist journals and newspapers. This paper seeks to analyse Arias's fate during the rest of the 1920s and 1930s that would eventually lead to a rather dramatic and paradoxical ending: the flight of the Jewish' Gino Arias to Argentina, due to Fascist racial laws. Gino Arias's elaboration of the revolutionary' corporatist economy is based on an original reformulation of the individuals' economic motive. Arias moved from the traditional self-interest motive to a new and particular affectio societatis, an hypothesis, although far from being realistic, that was necessary to give corporatism a sound theoretical foundation. The elaboration of Arias's speculative analysis was strictly related to government's economic policies throughout the Twenties and the Thirties and cannot be understood without referring to the institutionalisation of Fascist corporatism. Arias's affectio societatis represents in fact the theoretical formulation of a widespread cultural process and as such will be examined in this paper.","Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, I-50127 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Ottonelli, O (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",omar.ottonelli@hotmail.com,,"Ottonelli, Omar/0000-0002-5154-6615",,,,,98,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

We create and employ new forward-looking employment growth indices that measure the urban economic strength of an MSA and find that it accounts for a significant and sizeable portion of the house price movements in that MSA. We argue that the forward looking measure is an indicator of future agglomeration growth for the MSAs. We further partition the urban economic growth into growth by various industries and track the attribution of their growth to housing prices over time. We find that for some MSAs, home prices are driven by the same set of industries over time, whereas for others, home prices are driven by a totally new set of industries in the later quarters, due to the birth of new industries. We also analyze the impact of the diversification of an urban economic base on home price volatility and observe that diversification decreases home price volatility. The result has larger implications for urban policymakers in selecting the appropriate type of industries relative to their existing mix of industries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a test for collusion specific to this particular industry. We find strong evidence that before the NIRA, the costs of a plant's nearest neighbor had a positive effect on a plant's own price, suggesting competition. After the NIRA, this effect is completely eliminated, with no correlation between a plant's own price and its neighbor's cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This study used a combined life cycle assessment-life cycle cost analysis (LCA-LCCA) model to optimize the pavement maintenance plans with the incorporation of EDC. The paper introduced a comprehensive LCA methodology in pavement field, estimated the marginal damage costs of various air pollutants, and developed an algorithm to link LCA model and LCCA model. A case study of three overlay systems, Portland cement concrete (PCC) overlay, hot mix asphalt (HMA) overlay, and crack, seat, and overlay (CSOL), was presented. The findings through the study include: the EDC occupies a significant portion of the overall costs; the developed LCA-LCCA model is effective in reducing both the energy consumption/greenhouse gas emission ranging from 8.2% to 12.3% and the overall costs ranging from 5.9% to 10.2% for the three overlay designs, respectively; it is reasonable to expect smaller environmental burdens and less overall costs for the PCC and CSOL options as opposed to the HMA option although comparisons of the former two are indeterminate due to the great uncertainties in the usage module.

Another explanation for default and foreclosure, which has generally been neglected in the academic literature but not by the FBI, is fraud. One impediment to identifying and measuring fraud is the lack of statistical tests capable of detecting it. This paper proposes a simple method to detect transactions where fraud may have occurred. The models proposed here are important for at least three reasons. First they can document the role of fraud in the mortgage foreclosure crisis. Second, they can serve as part of a forensic effort designed to detect and deter mortgage fraud. Third, they demonstrate that mortgage fraud distorts house price indexes because it artificially elevates house prices during the period of fraud followed by a subsequent collapse due to the foreclosure sales. Accordingly, fraud can give the false impression that foreclosure lowers area house prices when it actually artificially inflates them. This suggests an alternative interpretation for the recent empirical literature on externalities from foreclosure.","[Carrillo, Paul E.] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Carrillo, Paul E.] George Washington Univ, ESIA, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University; George Washington University,"Carrillo, PE (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, 2115 G St NW,Suite 364, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",pcarrill@gwu.edu,,,,,,,48,16,21,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

As the crisis has exposed the original balance that economic and monetary union (EMU) sought to maintain between monetary integration and policy diversity to be unsustainable, the eurozone is put before the choice of one of three governance models: executive federalism, democratic federalization or EMU dissolution. Notably, these three governance models perfectly illustrate Dani Rodrik's trilemma of the world economy', which maintains that of the three goods - economic (and monetary) integration, the nation-state and democratic politics - one will always have to give. In light of this, the article concludes that the present course towards executive federalism can be justified for preventing euro dissolution and recognizing the value of national self-government. Nevertheless, it threatens to come at a democratic price. Hence, it is imperative to consider possible flanking measures that can mitigate this effect.","[Crum, Ben] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Crum, B (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci FSW, De Boelelaan 1081, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",B.J.J.Crum@vu.nl,"Crum, Ben/AFR-9886-2022","Crum, Ben/0000-0003-4330-295X",,,,,39,101,103,0,74,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This paper empirically examines whether agglomeration facilitates tacit collusion in the lodging industry using a quarterly data set of hotels in Texas. We jointly model a price and occupancy rate equation under a switching regression model to identify a collusive and noncollusive regime. The estimation results indicate that clustered hotels have a higher probability of being in the potential collusive regime than isolated properties in the same town. The identification of a collusive regime is also consistent with other factors considered to affect the sustainability of tacit collusion.,"[Gan, Li] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Gan, Li] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gan, L (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,,35,28,31,2,21,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Using the case of the railroad industry in France, I examine how both natural monopoly theorists and legislation dealt with this subject in the nineteenth century. I argue that the origins of vertical unbundling date to this period with legislation pertaining to inland waterways and railroads. This was particularly the case for the railroad industry due to pricing and competition rationales. I analyze the writings of Dupuit and Walras, and show that they both agreed that infrastructure and services had to be unbundled for the inland waterways. In contrast, they expressed different justifications to defend the monopoly for the railroad industry. Following a chronological progression, the first section explores the origins of unbundling in legislation. The second section analyzes how theorists approached the way railroads had to be managed.

Traditionally, investigating the bivariate stochastic processes has been dominated by linear econometrical methods that proved helpful especially in finance. However, when dealing with intradaily power data, we cannot rely on models developed for financial or other commodity markets. Therefore, wavelet transforms are applied for power markets data to search for and decode nonlinear regularities and hidden patterns existing between the variables. Given its ability to decompose the time series into their time scale components and thus to reveal structure at different time horizons, wavelets are useful in analyzing situations in which the degree of association between processes is likely to change with the time-horizon. Therefore, a wavelet-based cross-analysis is performed between prices and trading volume time series. On the same basis, causality tests and out-of-sample forecasting tasks are carried out to empirically the strong relationship between the two investigated time series.","Monastir Univ, Fac Sci, Computat Math Lab, Monastir 5019, Tunisia",Universite de Monastir,"Saâdaoui, F (通讯作者)，Monastir Univ, Fac Sci, Computat Math Lab, Monastir 5019, Tunisia.",foued.saadaoui@gmail.com,"Saâdaoui, Foued/J-9710-2019","Saâdaoui, Foued/0000-0002-0574-2922",,,,,28,21,22,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This evidence rests on the assumption that the magnitude of duration dependence is the same over time. However, we assume that the degree of likeliness of an expansion or contraction ending as it gets older might indeed change after a specific duration. Estimating a continuous-time Weibull model for a group of 13 industrial countries over the period 1948-2009 and allowing for the presence of a change-point in the duration-dependence parameter; we conclude that the evidence of positive duration dependence is no longer present when an expansion surpasses 10 years of duration.","[Castro, Vitor] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Castro, Vitor] Univ Minho, Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade do Minho,"Castro, V (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",vcastro@fe.uc.pt,"Castro, Vítor/P-4837-2019","Castro, Vítor/0000-0002-6426-6663",,,,,28,16,17,1,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The authors test for both types of discrimination in National Basketball Association (NBA) data in two ways. First using a modified Heckman procedure, they control for potential survival bias that may arise from exit discrimination in panel data and could possibly bias the coefficients of wage equations. Not controlling for survival bias could lead to false conclusions concerning the presence of pay discrimination. Using 1990-2008 NBA data, the authors fail to find any evidence of either pay or exit discrimination in the NBA utilizing this new technique. In one specification, however, a negative coefficient on the white dummy is found after controlling for height and being foreign-born suggesting that reverse discrimination is present. Yet, using a subset of the panel data used to examine pay discrimination in the NBA with career earnings the authors find that there is a pay premium paid to White players over their career in the magnitude of 16%-20%, ceteris paribus. Neither of these results, however, is robust and highlights the pitfalls of using the residual method in measuring both pay and exit discrimination.","[Groothuis, Peter A.] Appalachian State Univ, Walker Coll Business, Boone, NC 28607 USA; [Hill, James Richard] Cent Michigan Univ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; Central Michigan University,"Groothuis, PA (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Raley Hall, Boone, NC 28607 USA.",groothuispa@appstate.edu,,,,,,,18,25,32,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Densified biomass has physical properties similar to grain, and therefore, the transportation system in support of delivering densified biomass to a biorenery is expected to emulate the current grain transportation system. By analyzing transportation costs for products like grain and woodchips, this paper identifies the main factors that impact the delivery cost of densified biomass and quantifies those factors' impact on transportation costs. This paper provides a transportation-cost analysis which will aid the design and management of biofuel supply chains. This evaluation is very important because the expensive logistics and transportation costs are one of the major barriers slowing development in this industry. Regression analysis indicates that transportation costs for densified biomass will be impacted by transportation distance, volume shipped, transportation mode used, and shipment destination, just to name a few. Since biomass production is concentrated in the Midwestern United States, a biorefinery's shipments will probably come from that region. For shipments from the Midwest to the Southeast US, barge transportation, if available, is the least expensive transportation mode. If barge is not available, then unit trains are the least expensive mode for distances longer than 161 km (100 miles). For shipments from the Midwest to the West US, unit trains are the least expensive transportation mode for distances over 338 km (210 miles). For shorter distances, truck is the least expensive transportation mode for densified biomass. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, during the first decade of the twenty-first century, models inspired on mengerian monetary theory, mainly represented by the search monetary approach, are trying to reintroduce neo-walrasian elements. This paper aims at clarifying the main theoretical implications of this movement, through an analysis of the MengerWalras divide on money.

Rewards for a Victory, the Teams' Offensiveness, and the Home Bias",JOURNAL OF SPORTS ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,incentives; sports economics; strategic behavior; count data methods,INCENTIVES,"How do the rewards for a victory influence the soccer teams' offensiveness? The authors argue that a home bias induces the home team to play excessively offensively, in the sense that the home team does not maximize the tangible returns from a match. When the rewards for a victory are increased, the opportunity costs of playing excessively offensively rise, so that the home team chooses a more defensive playing style. Therefore, an increase in the rewards for a victory leads to the counterintuitive result of a more defensive soccer match if the home bias is sufficiently strong and if the levels of offensiveness of the teams are strategic substitutes. The authors test their theoretical hypotheses with data on the German soccer premier league. If the home bias is proxied for by the number of spectators relative to the stadium capacity, the authors find support for the theoretical predictions. The results have implications for the design of soccer competitions.","[Dewenter, Ralf] Univ Dusseldorf, Duesseldorf Inst Competit Econ, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Namini, Julian Emami] Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Namini, JE (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",emaminamini@ese.eur.nl,,,,,,,16,17,17,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The purpose is to determine the extent to which factors of production might complement or substitute for one another. A simple model is presented to illustrate the potential trade-offs between appraisal- and transactions-based information production. A series of empirical tests are performed on a panel data set constructed for 51 markets covering 9 years, 2001 through 2009. The number of commercial appraisers (i.e., certified general appraisers) and the number of commercial property transactions are used as proxies for information production. Overall, the results support the substitution hypothesis. Additional analyses examine a broader definition of appraisal-based information production, as well as the influence of market transparency on the main findings of this paper. Findings based on these additional analyses indicate that the trade-off between appraisal- and transactions-based information production is more pronounced in transparent markets. We conclude that appraisal-based information as a factor of production is, potentially, most critical in markets or conditions where the information environment is incomplete (i.e., transactions are scarce or the information regarding transactions is not public).","[Downs, David H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Kornblau Inst, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Guner, Z.

This paper examines this question using British data. We develop a semiparametric local instrumental variables estimator for identified features of a flexible correlated random coefficient model. These identified features are directly related to the marginal and average treatment effect in policy evaluation. Our results indicate that returns to college systematically differ between actual college graduates and actual college non-graduates. They are on average higher for college graduates and positively related to selection into college for 96% of the individuals. The dependence between selection into college and returns to college education is strongest for individuals with low math test scores at the age of 7, individuals with less educated mothers, and for working-class individuals.","Tilburg Univ, CentER, Dept Econometr & OR, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Klein, TJ (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, CentER, Dept Econometr & OR, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",T.J.Klein@uvt.nl,,"Klein, Tobias/0000-0001-7724-3260",,,,,36,2,2,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

One epistemic method is to fix a probability model and compute the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator or expected utility maximizer (EUM), given the data provided by the voters. We first show that an abstract voting rule can be interpreted as MLE or MAP if and only if it is a scoring rule. We then specialize to the case of distance-based voting rules, in particular, the use of the median rule in judgement aggregation. Finally, we show how several common 'quasiutilitarian' voting rules can be interpreted as EUM.","Trent Univ, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada",Trent University,"Pivato, M (通讯作者)，Trent Univ, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.",marcuspivato@trentu.ca,"Pivato, Marcus/AAE-4495-2020","Pivato, Marcus/0000-0001-9833-6175",,,,,74,22,23,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2013,40.0,2,,,,,581,630,,10.1007/s00355-011-0619-1,0.0,,,50,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,072HT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313661600014,0

Attitudes of experts (N = 53) and British public (N = 40) were compared using open-ended questionnaires, attitude scales, analytic hierarchy process and preference ranking. Both samples prioritised reduction in transport demand in qualitative measures. In quantitative measures, however, experts preferred techno-economic measures while the public prioritised behaviour change and public transport improvement. Some options for sustainable transport also varied with individuals' values, suggesting that expertise alone does not fully account for variation in attitudes. Different perspectives and values imply a need for a broader definition of expertise in transport policy-making, and that the public may not accept transport policies/technologies designed by experts - underlining the importance of early public engagement.

Such policies present numerous puzzles. Electricity prices below marginal production costs could warrant EE policies if EE and energy are substitutes, but they will not be substitutes if the energy price is sufficiently high. Using EE savings to meet renewable energy requirements can dramatically increase the marginal cost of electricity. Rejecting rationality of consumer energy choices raises doubts regarding cost benefit analysis when demand curves may not reveal willingness to pay. Decoupling to guarantee constant profit regardless of use contradicts findings that incentive-based mechanisms outperform cost-of-service regulation. Regulators may implement EE policies to exercise buyer-side market power against generators, increasing consumer welfare but reducing overall economic performance. Encouraging utilities to take over potentially competitive EE contradicts policies to separate competitive from monopoly enterprises.","[Brennan, Timothy J.] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Brennan, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA.",brennan@umbc.edu,,,,,,,32,14,18,0,23,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,34.0,2,,,,,1,25,,10.5547/01956574.34.2.1,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,109KV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316368300001,0

This is because knowledge about people's income does not tell us what they are able to acquire with that income. For example, people with the same income may not have the same access to health and transportation services, schools and opportunities in the labor market. Recently, there has been growing interest in empirical studies based on the capability approach. Most of these, however, are only loosely related to quantitative behavioral theory, at least in a concrete and empirically operational way.

At the same time, policy differences, including the failure to improve the quality of the enabling environment and prevent financial crashes (the dark side of finance), were found to explain a sizable share of the deviations of individual country paths from the benchmarks.","[de la Torre, Augusto; Feyen, Erik; Ize, Alain] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank,"de la Torre, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC USA.",adelatorre@worldbank.org; efeijen@worldbank.org; aize@worldbank.org,,"De La Torre, Augusto/0000-0002-4894-0355",,,,,36,22,24,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

The article considers whether the fear of revolution was genuine or artificially created to discredit opposition and strengthen support for the regime. It seems that tensions inside the regime and the unexpected occurrence of the previous coloured revolutions led to real fears of revolution in Russia, although this was in fact unlikely. Russian policy towards the West and the rival election programmes are examined to investigate whether the regime was creating an enemy image of the West.","UCL, Sch Slavon & E European Studies, London WC1H 0BW, England",University of London; University College London,"Duncan, PJS (通讯作者)，UCL, Sch Slavon & E European Studies, 16 Taviton St, London WC1H 0BW, England.",p.duncan@ssees.ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,106,23,26,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JAN 1,2013,65.0,1,,,,,1,25,,10.1080/09668136.2012.698049,0.0,,,25,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,076II,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313949600001,0

Commissions and utilities continue to study the potential benefits of dynamic pricing through experimentation but most of it involves the residential sector. We add to that body of knowledge by presenting the results of a pilot in Connecticut which included small commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in addition to residential customers. The pilot featured a time-of-use rate, two dynamic pricing rates and four enabling technologies. Customers were randomly selected and allocated to these rates, to ensure representativeness of the final results. The experiment included a total of around 2,200 customers and ran during the summer of 2009. Using a constant elasticity of substitution model, we find that customers do respond to dynamic pricing, a finding that matches that from most other experiments. We also find that response to critical-peak pricing rates is higher than response to peak-time rebates, unlike some other experiments where similar results were found. Like many other pilots, we find that there is virtually no response to TOU rates with an eight hour peak period. And like the few pilots that have compared small C&I customer response to residential response, we find that small C&I customers are less price responsive than residential customers. We also find that some enabling technologies boost price responsiveness but that the Energy Orb does not.","[Faruqui, Ahmad; Akaba, Lamine] Brattle Grp, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Sergici, Sanem] Brattle Grp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",The Brattle Group; The Brattle Group,"Faruqui, A (通讯作者)，Brattle Grp, 201 Mission St,Suite 2800, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",Ahmad.Faruqui@Brattle.com,,,,,,,24,31,35,1,17,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,35.0,1,,,,,137,160,,10.5547/01956574.35.1.8,0.0,,,24,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,267KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328097900008,0

Real sector especially in the time of recession is facing the problem of its sustainability, therefore demands from the administration quick, timely and quality service, program or a project. Real sector, today, in administration looks for a partner that will recognize problems with which they are facing and react to them with quality service. Real sector studies and compares work conditions in environment and impose to the administration demand for constant validation of their work. At the time when the expectations and obligations of the administration are increasing, question raises about justification the decision to accept international standards as criteria by which administration will evaluate its work. Particularly when we know that the acceptance of standards represent significant investment of administration in its own recognizability, proof of affirmative attitude of administration of its role in economic development, but also an obligation for continuous work on its own advancement. Revision of international standards has resulted in principles that are precondition od successful organization. Analysis of the application of the principles of building a real and public sector presented a qualitative contribution to the application of these principles in organizational behavior, and thus the success of the system. In the second part of the study it is the analyzed the tendency of the increase of certified administrations in the world and Croatia.

One critical issue when estimating a hierarchical Archimedean copula is to correctly determine its structure.

We hypothesize that obese individuals are less likely to commit crime and be arrested because their body weights may prevent them from successfully engaging in certain criminal activities, particularly those that are physically intensive. To test this hypothesis, we use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and panel data techniques and find that obesity is negatively related to arrest. In one specification, for example, we found that the odds of an obese man being arrested are 64% of those of a healthy weight man. The social costs of obesity may be overstated if obesity reduces the likelihood of arrest because the obese are less criminally active. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The systems are relatively simple, both mathematically and for voter understanding, and are fully workable for large-scale elections. Their designated equilibrium strategies, under which voters vote sincerely, involve discerning the top one or two candidates in the preference ordering of the electorate. One set of systems uses its ballot to obtain voters' preference rankings plus approval votes, and tallies the latter if no Condorcet winner exists. It offers solid advantages vis-A -vis instant-runoff voting, which uses a kindred ballot and has attracted recent reformers.

Based on a portfolio accounting identity and the budget constraint of the Chinese central bank's holding of foreign assets, the monthly growth rate of reserves can be decomposed into monthly rate of return, valuation effects of exchange rates, and monthly net purchase rate. The valuation effect reveals the value share of each currency. Bayesian inference is adopted to estimate the state-space model with a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The results show that China significantly and dramatically diversified its reserves out of the US dollar in 2002: both the euro's value and quantity shares increased from 5% to more than 20%. By the end of 2007, China held about (at most) 67.3% of its reserves in the US dollar, 22% in the euro, 2.5% in the Japanese yen, 4.7% in the Australian dollar, and 3.5% in the British pound.

Yet, Chicago style antitrust has not yet lost its hold on u.s. antitrust. The paper suggests that the Chicago persistence within u.s. antitrust and, by the same token, the inhospitality of u.s. antitrust towards game-theoretical Industrial Organization theory owe much to the vitality of the legal doctrine according to which antitrust analysis should be consistent with traditional price theory. In particular, the paper analyzes two issues: i. the adoption of the equilibrium end-state notion of competition which is still dominant within mainstream economics and ii. the unshaken faith in the resilience of competition vis-a-vis Type xi errors committed by antitrust Agencies, provided that government-induced barriers to entry be absent or negligible.","Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Giurid Soc & Sport, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Signorino, R (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Giurid Soc & Sport, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",rodolfo.signorino@unipa.it,,"SIGNORINO, Rodolfo/0000-0002-7122-1762",,,,,37,0,0,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

In this article, it is argued that the no votes in both countries, despite the support of mainstream political elites and the bulk of the media, should not be viewed with surprise. The article begins by examining the background debate to the referendums in both countries before considering the major issues that dominated the no campaigns as well as the issues that motivated the two countries' electorates in their decisions to reject the EU Constitution. From here, the article examines the significance of the 2005 no votes in the current context within France and the Netherlands and argues that the clear polarization of the no vote among those from socio-economically less well-off backgrounds is not only the sign of a further widening of the gap between mainstream political elites and their supporters with regard to European integration, but that in turn it is also having a significant impact at a party level in terms of the galvanization of Eurosceptic political parties particularly the radical right. The article concludes with the argument that 2005 has contributed to the growing salience of Euroscepticism within both countries, which in the context of the crisis in the eurozone is likely to lead to further re-evaluation of the European project among political elites.","[Startin, Nick] Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Krouwel, Andre] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of West England; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Startin, N (通讯作者)，Univ W England, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",Nicholas.Startin@uwe.ac.uk,"Krouwel, Andre/D-3959-2016","Krouwel, Andre/0000-0003-0952-6028",,,,,31,24,24,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

However, despite strong theoretical suggestions of a linkage, little is known about the impact of social inequality on this support. We address this issue using evidence from mass surveys undertaken in 12 post-communist states in 2007, supplemented by country-level data about economic and political performance. Specifically, we investigate whether social inequality generates negative perceptions that democracy and the market will lead to social conflict and if it increases support for anti-democratic forms of governance. Notably, we find little link between citizens expectations of social conflict and national-level indices of income inequality. However, we do find a link between perceptions of the extent of social inequality and expectations of market-generatedbut not democracy-generatedconflict. Underscoring these positive and negative findings, perceptions of social inequality are also clearly consequential for support for strong-hand economic government but not for anti-democratic leadership.","[Whitefield, Stephen] Univ Oxford Pembroke Coll, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford OX1 1DW, England; [Loveless, Matthew] Univ Kent, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury CT2 7NX, Kent, England",University of Oxford; University of Kent,"Whitefield, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Pembroke Coll, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford OX1 1DW, England.",stephen.whitefield@politics.ox.ac.uk; m.loveless@kent.ac.uk,,"Loveless, Matthew/0000-0002-7232-2776",,,,,49,11,12,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JAN 1,2013,65.0,1,,,,,26,44,,10.1080/09668136.2012.734588,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,076II,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313949600002,0

We demonstrate that the single equation approach could potentially generate biased estimates of pricing disparities when it fails to consider the impact of the underwriting decision.","Off Comptroller Currency, Washington, DC 20219 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Off Comptroller Currency, 250 E St SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA.",yan.zhang@occ.treas.gov,,"Zhang, Yan/0000-0002-9377-187X",,,,,34,6,8,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The Quality Function Deployment technique has been applied. The data show that among the visual characteristics of 'pecorino' (sheep milk) cheese, consumers assign the greatest importance to animal welfare, origin, and production process. Price and product appearance (colour and presence of holes in cheese) are of secondary importance. To meet these needs, producers can effectively operate along the supply chain by acting on: sheep feed composition, housing, genotype lines and stocking density (number of sheep per m(2)). Animal welfare, which is shown to be the most important aspect for the consumer, can be enhanced by means of the housing and stocking density. The less important issues, although not of secondary importance in terms of food safety, are those that affect cheese maturing, production technology, and dairy milk treatment.","[Naspetti, S.; Alberti, F.; Solfanelli, F.] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambientali, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Naspetti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambientali, Ancona, Italy.",simo-na@agrecon.univpm.it,"; Naspetti, Simona/C-1143-2013","Solfanelli, Francesco/0000-0002-4322-8078; Naspetti, Simona/0000-0003-0778-2386",Interregional Governmental Funds in Italy,Interregional Governmental Funds in Italy,"We are grateful to the anonymous referees for their valuable comments on the manuscript.

Evidence also indicates that nonbanks price prepayment penalties less favorably to borrowers than banks do, and nonbanks originate disproportionately more loans with prepayment penalties in locales with less financially sophisticated borrowers. State antipredatory lending law provisions restricting the use of prepayment penalties eliminate the elevated default risk of nonbank originations relative to bank originations. These findings are consistent with incentives generated by nonbank compensation via yield spread premiums on loans with prepayment penalties.","[Rose, Morgan J.] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Rose, Morgan J.] Off Comptroller Currency, Washington, DC 20219 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,"Rose, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.",mrose@umbc.edu,,,,,,,44,7,7,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2012,40.0,4,,,,,662,707,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2011.00328.x,0.0,,,46,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,062UJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312947900002,0

To test the applicability of the method, we ran two Monte Carlo experiments and applied it to Horowitz's (1993) often studied work-trip mode choice dataset.

It shows that the probability of going out of business was significantly higher for establishments close to that store. This probability fell off at a rate of 6% per mile in all directions. Using this relationship, we estimate that WalMart's opening resulted in the loss of approximately 300 full-time equivalent jobs in nearby neighborhoods. This loss about equals WalMart's own employment in the area. Our analysis of separate data on sales tax receipts shows that after its opening there was no net increase in retail sales in WalMart's own and surrounding zip codes. Overall, these results support the contention that large-city WalMarts, like those in small towns, absorb retail sales from nearby stores without significantly expanding the market.","[Persky, Joseph] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Merriman, David] Univ Illinois, Inst Govt & Publ Affairs, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Davis, Julie] Loyola Univ, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Baiman, Ron] Ctr Tax & Budget Accountabil, Chicago, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Loyola University Chicago,"Persky, J (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 601 S Morgan St,M-C 144, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",jpersky@uic.edu,,,,,,,15,22,27,2,39,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This approach, which is deeply rooted in the social choice literature, allows one to define (rationalize) voting rules via a consensus class of elections and a distance: a candidate is said to be an election winner if she is ranked first in one of the nearest (with respect to the given distance) consensus elections. It is known that many classic voting rules can be distance-rationalized. In this article, we provide new results on distance rationalizability of several Condorcet-consistent voting rules. In particular, we distance-rationalize the Young rule and Maximin using distances similar to the Hamming distance. It has been claimed that the Young rule can be rationalized by the Condorcet consensus class and the Hamming distance; we show that this claim is incorrect and, in fact, this consensus class and distance yield a new rule, which has not been studied before. We prove that, similarly to the Young rule, this new rule has a computationally hard winner determination problem.","[Elkind, Edith] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Math Sci, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Faliszewski, Piotr] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Slinko, Arkadii] Univ Auckland, Dept Math, Auckland, New Zealand",Nanyang Technological University; AGH University of Krakow; University of Auckland,"Elkind, E (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Math Sci, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Singapore 637371, Singapore.",eelkind@ntu.edu.sg; faliszew@agh.edu.pl; a.slinko@auckland.ac.nz,,"Slinko, Arkadii/0000-0002-0397-6290; Faliszewski, Piotr/0000-0002-0332-4364",,,,,18,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2012,39.0,4,,,,,891,905,,10.1007/s00355-011-0555-0,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,015VE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309473700011,0

Offered under a monopoly by an Association of individual owner drivers, the public transport service has not changed dramatically since its start in the early 1900s. Instead, an organic growth alongside the main routes linking new areas to the public transport network and a declining level of service pushed even more the local population to switch to private mobility. This has classified the islands amongst the countries in the world with the highest levels of motorisation. In 2008, following a general election and a general strike held by the public transport operators over the Government's intentions to remove monopolies, the new Minister for Transport published his intentions to reform public transport from its roots. This reform included the removal of the monopolies protecting the incumbents as well as developing a new network of services which cater more effectively to the public's travelling demands. This paper deals with the public transport reform and through direct observation details the processes involved in the regulation of public transport as well as the design of the new public transport network. The paper concludes with the critical factors which led to implementation of the reform and how this is applicable to cities worldwide. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of this literature has focused on the trade effects of standards and on the effects on exporters and producers. Very few studies have looked at the effect of standards for workers in export supply chains although this is important for poverty reduction. In this paper, we use original panel data from surveys among workers in the horticultural export industry in Senegal to analyse the effects of GlobalGAP certification of exporterproducer companies on the employment conditions of workers in these companies. The results suggest that GlobalGAP certification is associated with an increase in workers daily wages and with longer employment periods.

The dynamics of the lodging industry are accounted for through the adoption of an error correction model. Recent research suggests that the use of discounting room rates may not be an effective pricing strategy as it results in increased occupancy rates at decreased average daily rates, thereby reducing a common financial performance indicator - revenue per available room (revPAR). The recommendation made to hotel managers, then, is to avoid discounting and instead adopt an average rate. This study generates opposing findings and reveals that discounting may be a practical short-term pricing solution that may compensate for market disequilibria. The results suggest that using statistical residuals rather than room rate averages may more accurately forecast appropriate hotel room rates and balance supply and demand. Thus, the recommendation of adopting average room rates may provide incorrect implications for managers in the short run.","[Semrad, Kelly J.] Univ Florida, Eric Friedheim Tourism Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Croes, Robertico] Univ Cent Florida, Rosen Coll Hosp Management, Orlando, FL 32819 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Semrad, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Eric Friedheim Tourism Inst, POB 118208,FLG 242D, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",robertico.croes@ucf.edu; ksemrad@hhp.ufl.edu,,,,,,,29,9,10,1,18,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Economic theory tells us in relation to cross-network pricing that collusion or network monopoly may yield welfare as well as profit benefits although any welfare benefits from cross-network collusion may be more than offset by a reduction in competition elsewhere. To address this, we introduce a new regulatory concept: the independent profit-maximising agent. The agent sets prices on cross-network goods taking either (i) a complete, or (ii) an arbitrarily small, share of the associated profit. We examine welfare and profits with and without agent type (i) and (ii) with collusion (network monopoly) between the non-agent firms and without collusion (independent network duopoly). We show that splitting up the network monopoly (creating independent network duopoly) may be inferior for both society and firm(s) compared with a network monopoly 'regulated' by an agent and that society always prefers any of the four agent regimes over network monopoly and network duopoly. Indeed, employing the agent may reduce welfare losses by a large proportion while having relatively little effect on profit.","[McHardy, Jolian] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England; [McHardy, Jolian] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy; [Reynolds, Michael] Univ Bradford, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Trotter, Stephen] Univ Hull, Ctr Econ Policy, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Sheffield; University of Bradford; University of Hull,"McHardy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",j.mchardy@sheffield.ac.uk; m.reynolds2@bradford.ac.uk; s.d.trotter@hull.ac.uk,"McHardy, Jolian/IAO-0206-2023","McHardy, Jolian/0000-0003-2441-7110; Reynolds, Michael/0000-0002-3454-4335",,,,,15,0,0,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2012,73.0,2,,,,,223,248,,10.1007/s11238-012-9303-x,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,969RI,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306073300003,0

The key insight is to characterize beliefs as a parameter to be estimated from observed choices in a well-defined experimental task and to estimate that parameter as a random coefficient. The experimental task consists of a series of standard lottery choices in which the subject is assumed to use conventional risk attitudes to select one lottery or the other and then a series of betting choices in which the subject is presented with a range of bookies offering odds on the outcome of some event that the subject has a belief over. Knowledge of the risk attitudes of subjects conditions the inferences about subjective beliefs. Maximum simulated likelihood methods are used to estimate a structural model in which subjects employ subjective beliefs to make bets. We present evidence that some subjective probabilities are indeed best characterized as probability distributions with non-zero variance.","[Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Andersen, Steffen] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fountain, John] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; [Hole, Arne Risa] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Rutstroem, E.

A test of the effect of parking requirements values in Los Angeles County,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Parking supply; Land use; Parking standards,UNCERTAINTY; LOCATION; OPTIONS; INDEXES; RENTS,"Minimum parking requirements (MPRs) are the norm for urban and suburban development in the United States (Davidson et al., 2002). The justification for MPRs is that overflow parking will occupy nearby street or off-street parking. Shoup (1999a) and Willson (1995) provide cases where there is reason to believe that parking space requirements have forced parcel developers to place more parking than they would in the absence of parking requirements. However, to our knowledge the existing literature does not test the effect of parking minimums on the amount of lot space devoted to parking beyond a few case studies. This paper tests the hypothesis that MPRs bind for most land uses using data on suburban office, commercial, industrial and retail property sales from Los Angeles County using both direct and indirect approaches. Our indirect test of the effects of parking requirements is similar to the one used by Glaeser and Gyourko (2003). A simple theoretical model shows that the marginal value of additional parking to the sale price of a building should be equal to the cost of land plus the cost of parking construction. We estimate the marginal values of parking and lot area with spatial methods using a large data set from the Los Angeles area nonresidential property sales and find that for most of the property types the marginal value of parking is significantly below that of the parcel area. In addition, we directly examine required and supplied parking and find that on average parking supplied is quite close to the required amount. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the common sharing function adopted by households to divide the cake among a strong and a weak individual. The sharing function which maps the household income into the outcome of the weak individual must belong to the class of utility functions which supports the stochastic order. In addition, the household must follow a compensating rule, meaning that the share of resources devoted to the weak individual increases with household income. Applications to fiscal federalism are also proposed. All inequality is a source of evil - for by the inferior more is lost in the account of happiness than is gained by the superior J.

This paper uses a historical case study, Saxony in 1834, to analyze empirically the relative impact of endowments and agglomeration based on the application of a New Economic Geography model. The model and data allow the analysis of the complete population distribution, from large cities down to the smallest village. The results suggest that location characteristics explain the relative size of settlements, but only 9% of absolute town and 2% of absolute village population. Similarly, the direct effects of location characteristics shape the relative size of urban growth between 1550 and 1834, but conditional on transportation cost decreases the size of the effects is only between 1/4 and 1/9 of the second-order effect through the impact on market access. Finally, the model implies a location characteristics index value for each settlement. Actual geographic characteristics, ranging from agricultural land quality to weather patterns, explain a significant share of these values, and therefore settlement size. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach, however, is comparative; we examine the behavior of all six properties, under three general methods for handling ties: applying a set extension principle (in particular, Gardenfors' sure-thing principle), using a tie-breaking agenda to break ties, and rephrasing properties via the t-a-t approach, so that only two alternatives are considered at a time. In attempting to explain the patterns of similarities and differences we discovered, we found ourselves obliged to confront the issue of what it is, exactly, that identifies these properties as a class. We propose a distinction between two such classes: the tame monotonicity properties (which include participation, half-way monotonicity, and strategy proofness) and the strictly broader class of normal monotonicity properties (which include monotonicity and one-way monotonicity, but not Maskin monotonicity). We explain why the tie-breaking agenda, t-a-t, and Gardenfors methods are equivalent for tame monotonicities, and how, for properties that are normal but not tame, set-extension methods can fail to be equivalent to the other two (and may fail to make sense at all).","[Zwicker, William S.] Union Coll, Dept Math, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA; [Sanver, M.

The main tools put into play were price and structural policies. In both cases one could identify a set of intervention areas resting on the role of the internal market, while attempting to preserve consumer purchasing power, to support family farming, promote export, mobilize natural resources, develop rural infrastructure, etc. (MARH-AFD, 2010). Despite the apparent achievements in terms of agricultural production and/or rural development aspects, however, the relative share of agriculture has kept declining over time both in gross domestic product and employment. Further growth and development in the agricultural sector seem to be increasingly challenged in view of resource degradation resulting from crop intensification, world market instability and the increasing pressure on natural resources. Moreover, recent events in the country revealed the existence of significant distribution problems in the form of social inequities, as a consequence, at least partly, of the development policies adopted in the past. Within this context, new challenges are emerging pointing out to the need for better argumentation of future policy setting and implementation. The suggestions made in this paper call for a thorough review of internal policy support for producers and consumers as well as the identification of relevant mechanisms to promote agricultural exports. These suggestions draw also the attention to the needed care when dealing with the opening up of borders to trade along with a better synchronization of the training and research functions in the light of the agricultural sector development priorities.","[Laajimi, Abderrouf; Thabet, Boubaker; Ben Said, Moncef] Inst Natl Agron Tunisie, Dept Econ & Gest Agr & Agroalimentaire, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"Laajimi, A (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Agron Tunisie, Dept Econ & Gest Agr & Agroalimentaire, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,6,4,4,0,9,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2012,11.0,2,,,,,24,28,,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,003SD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308630700004,0

We introduce a dual cycle model which is an extension to the multivariate trend plus cycle model with phase shifts A la Runstler. The dual cycle model is a combination of two types of model: the trend plus cycle model and the cyclical trend model, where the cycle appears in the growth rate of a variable. This property enables hysteresis to be taken into account. Hysteresis is likely to show up in unemployment, but it can also affect the capital stock due to the existence of long investment cycles. In the proposed model, hysteresis may affect all the factor inputs of the production function and phase shifts are extended to the dual cycles. Genuine measures of potential growth can be computed that are hysteresis-free and less prone to volatility. A complementary measure of the output gap that takes hysteresis into account can be derived.","Natl Bank Belgium, Res Dept, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",European Central Bank; National Bank of Belgium,"Moes, P (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Belgium, Res Dept, Bd Berlaimont 14, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",philippe.moes@nbb.be,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We examine the influence of various opt-out clauses, different interest rates and other factors on the value of presale contracts.

Specifically, the empirical analysis identifies the extent to which the origination of a CRA mortgage substitutes for FHA and subprime originations during the period 1998-2006. The results suggest that in the years prior to the expansion of the subprime market (1998-2001), the origination of CRA loans carried a small substitution effect with respect to FHA originations, with little to no impact on subprime originations. Conversely, during the years of the subprime industry's growth (2002-2006), CRA originations substituted at a much higher rate for high-cost originations. These findings are suggestive about the dynamic role of community reinvestment lending within the changing context of the broader mortgage market. To the extent that CRA originations carry lower foreclosure risk than many subprime products, they also carry implications for the extent of neighborhood externalities in the wake of the subprime foreclosure crisis.","[Spader, Jonathan S.] ABT Associates Inc, Social & Econ Policy Div, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Quercia, Roberto G.] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Quercia, Roberto G.] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Community Capital, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",ABT Associates; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Spader, JS (通讯作者)，ABT Associates Inc, Social & Econ Policy Div, 4550 Montgomery Ave, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",jonathan_spader@abtassoc.com; quercia@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,37,5,8,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The models in preference space fit the data better than the corresponding models in WTP space although the difference between the best fitting models in the two estimation regimes is minimal. Moreover, the willingness to pay estimates derived from the preference space models turn out to be very high for many of the job attributes.

Following Chander and Tulkens (Int J Game Theory 26:379-401, 1997), we assume that firms react to a deviating coalition by choosing individual best reply strategies. We deal with the problem of the non-emptiness of the induced core, the gamma-core, by two different approaches. The first establishes that the associated Cournot oligopoly Transferable Utility (TU)-games are balanced if the inverse demand function is differentiable and every individual profit function is continuous and concave on the set of strategy profiles, which is a step forward beyond Zhao's core existence result for this class of games. The second approach, restricted to the class of Cournot oligopoly TU-games with linear cost functions, provides a single-valued allocation rule in the gamma-core called Nash Pro rata (NP)-value.

Across all sectors, direct domestic truck and rail transportation are similar in magnitude for embodied freight transportation of goods and services in terms of ton-km. However, the sectors differ significantly in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and costs per ton-km. Recent pressure to reduce energy consumption and emissions has motivated a search for more efficient freight mode choices. One solution would be to shift freight transportation away from modes that require more energy and emit more (e.g., truck) to modes that consume and emit less (e.g., rail and water). Our results show there are no individual sectors for which targeting changes would significantly decrease the total freight transportation energy and emissions, therefore we have also looked at the prospect of policies encouraging many sectors to shift modes. There are four scenarios analyzed: (1) shifting all truck to rail, shifting top 20% sector mode choice, (2) based on their emissions, (3) based on a multi-attribute analysis, and (4) increasing truck efficiency (e.g., mpg). Increasing truck efficiency by 10% results in similar energy and emissions reductions (approximately 7% for energy and 6% for emissions) as targeting the top 20% of sectors when selected based on emissions, whereas selecting the top 20% based on availability to shift from truck results in slightly less reductions of energy and emissions. Implementing policies to encourage higher efficiency in freight trucks may be a sufficient short term goal while efforts to reduce truck freight transportation through sectoral policies are implemented in the long term.

The synthesiser is designed for large population matrices and allows target variables to be represented in several target constraints. As a result, constraints for the IPF are cross-linked, which makes it difficult to ensure consistency of targets in a forecast perspective. The paper proposes a new solution strategy to ensure internal consistency of the population targets in order to guarantee proper convergence of the IPF algorithm. The solution strategy consists in establishing a harmonisation process for the population targets, which combined with a linear programming approach, is applied to generate a consistent target representation. The model approach is implemented and tested on Danish administrative register data. A test on historical census data shows that a 2006 population could be predicted by a 1994 population with an overall percentage deviation of 5-6% given that targets were known. It is also indicated that the deviation is approximately a linear function of the length of the forecast period. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the benefits and applicability of such route guidance using a case study. An adaptive discretization scheme is first proposed to improve the efficiency in computing convolution, a time-consuming step used in the reliable routing algorithm to obtain path travel time distributions. Methods to construct link travel time distributions from real data in the case study are then discussed. Particularly, the travel time distributions on arterial streets are estimated from linear regression models calibrated from expressway data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that optimal paths are substantially affected by the reliability requirement in rush hours, and that reliable route guidance could generate up to 5-15% of travel time savings. The study also verifies that existing algorithms can solve large-scale problems within a reasonable amount of time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This result is used to provide characterizations of each of these rules by postulating separating axioms, that is, an axiom and its negation. Such axioms identify traits specifically differentiating a type of rule from the other types. For instance, majority differs from strong dictatorship in the existence of a society for which collective indifference should be a less likely outcome than the strict preference of one alternative over the other. As a second example, the difference between majority and strong dictatorship can be traced back to the requirement that the likelihood of collective indifference diminishes with the size of society.","Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus 43204, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Quesada, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Avinguda Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.",aqa@urv.cat,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2012,72.0,2,,,,,149,166,,10.1007/s11238-011-9244-9,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,885JC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299774200001,0

Our regression model rejects the hypothesis that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of future spot exchange rate, indicating the existence of time-varying risk premium under rational expectations. Our signal plus noise model reveals a time-varying risk premium component in yen and Euro. The same model provides evidence for the presence of risk premium in pound over a shorter sample period, though not over the entire sample.

However, there is substantial evidence that a sizable fraction of households faces liquidity constraints, thus the assumption of consumption smoothing is not met. This might be one of the reasons why the predictions of some models fail, for example those concerning effects of fiscal policy on consumption. To overcome this problem, some models assume that only a part of households (Ricardian households) smooth their consumption and the other part (rule-of-thumb households) consume their whole current disposable income. This paper estimates the fraction of rule-of-thumb households in the Czech Republic, based on the modified Euler equation using instrumental variables (approach by Campbell and Mankiw [4]). Furthermore, potential time variation in this parameter is investigated using the two-step strategy proposed by Kim [10] that deals with the endogeneity problem. Our results suggest that the share of rule-of-thumb consumers exceeds 40%. In addition, this share is unstable over time, however the decline in the recent years is puzzling and worth exploring further.","[Adam, Tomas; Baxa, Jaromir] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Baxa, Jaromir] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic; [Baxa, Jaromir] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Dept Econ, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences,,tomas.adam@ies-prague.org; jaromir.baxa@gmail.com,"baxa, Jaromir/K-3195-2019","baxa, Jaromir/0000-0002-9768-209X",,,,,13,1,1,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,8,13,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900002,0

On the global level, EP was a modest Universal Postal Union (UPU) member. Only three years later, EP was ranked third worldwide in the UPU congress elections. In addition, EP became a member of the two most important committees in the UPU: The Investment Committee, and the Executive Committee. EP was also unanimously voted by the African Postal Organization to chair the PAPU in 2008 and 2009. It was a classic case of turnaround in terms of organizational improvement, efficiency and providing a quality service. However, there were many challenges to tackle along this road to success. EP's workforce was huge but rather idle, bureaucratic and technologically inept. The existing technology used at EP was outdated and unsecure. The ICT infrastructure was insufficient in terms of quantity and quality, many services were not even automated and the software applications were diverse and incompatible. Additionally, the environment of the offices and the corporate buildings was unwelcoming and unproductive. The strategic plan laid out for EP sought out the ICT department as the engine which would pull the giant organization to the future. A short few months later, with its up-to-date telecommunication and information systems and technically adept staff, its ICT arm was able to lead EP's other divisions and the company as a whole to a path of sustainable growth.

Since the argument that comes to justify this asymmetry, in the Theory of Moral sentiments, is not clear, both in its structure and in its content, the first step consists in a clarification of Smith's position resting, principally, on the History of Astronomy, which introduces the concepts of 'custom' and 'surprise'. Next, Smith's argument is discussed in a more formal framework, through alternative approaches of what might be considered a Smithian happiness function: reference-dependent models with loss aversion or standard cardinal utility-like functions. Textual evidences leads to favour the last alternative. This also leads to non-trivial conclusions concerning the way Smith views individual happiness.","Univ Paris 01, PHARE, Paris 13, France",,"Bréban, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, PHARE, Maison Sci Econ 106-112,Blvd Hop 75647, Paris 13, France.",laurie.breban@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,44,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

While a general appreciation has developed that the system has worked quite well, research has not paid sufficient attention to the weakest actors in the system. This paper addresses the puzzle of missing cases of least-developed countries initiating WTO dispute settlement procedures. It challenges the existing literature on developing countries in WTO dispute settlement which predominantly focuses on legal capacity and economic interests. The paper provides an argument that the small universe of 'actionable cases', the option of free riding and the assessment of the perceived opportunity costs related to other foreign policy priorities better explain the absence of cases. In addition (and somewhat counterintuitively), we argue that the absence of cases is not necessarily bad news and shows how the weakest actors can use the dispute settlement system in a 'lighter version' or in indirect ways. The argument is empirically assessed by conducting a case study on four West African cotton-producing countries (C4) and their involvement in dispute settlement.","[Elsig, Manfred] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Stucki, Philipp] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Elsig, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland.",,,"Elsig, Manfred/0000-0001-6950-108X",,,,,41,22,24,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Unlike previous literature, we introduce a general specification of production that allows for disentangling the gains from specialization from the monopolistic markup. The consequences of separating both parameters on the equilibrium dynamics of the model are analyzed. We find that the long-run growth rate ceases to depend on the markup when it is disentangled from the returns to specialization, and the same happens with the conditions for saddle-path stability. Numerical simulations show that the steady-state equilibria are more prone to be stable in the model that disentangles parameters.

The concept of the neighborhood as it started in Britain, at the beginning of this century, and carried over the whole world, is the basic planning concept for nearly every city in the world. It has been transferred to the Middle East from the beginning of the 1930s during the colonial era. This concept has not been followed correctly at Greater Amman due to many reasons.

This development often was described as 'Americanisation', since it seemed to rest upon the influences of the American occupation regime. In contrast, the paper applies another meaning of 'Americanisation'. It is considered a 'discourse' that serves to structure the disciplinary procedures to produce progress. As it can be shown by the adoption of Keynesianism and neoclassical microeconomics, the change of the discipline was not primarily driven by direct American influences. Rather, in some respect the German reception took a path of its own. That contradiction can be solved by a theoretical modification of the classical concept of 'Americanisation'.

Yet, the French plan stands out for its remarkably collective and conflict-free nature. In order to account for this distinctiveness, we highlight the role of an informal consortium among public and private actors in the French financial establishment. We argue that the bank support plan should be viewed as a gift that members of the same elite group extended to each other in exchange for future, albeit still indeterminate, counter-gifts. Thus, the presidential rhetoric of 'rupture', a hallmark of Nicolas Sarkozy's mandate (2007-2012), should not be taken at face value. Behind the scenes, a closed decision-making process brought together and strengthened a small group of high-powered public officials and bankers. The role of this consortium in shaping the bank rescue plan underscores its importance in France's evolving model of capitalism.","[Jabko, Nicolas] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Jabko, Nicolas] Sci Po, CERI, Paris, France; [Massoc, Elsa] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Jabko, N (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,"Massoc, Elsa/HKN-7246-2023","Jabko, Nicolas/0000-0001-8028-1946",,,,,49,50,53,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

As never before numerous events have occurred that not only changed the affinities and tastes of the tourist demand, but also led the tourism offer to focus on new strategies and aspects of operation. The rules of the game have changed to the core with the emergence of more frequent terrorist attacks, economic volatility, weather disasters, new conflict hot spots in the world and so on. Tourism as a specific and complex industry has become too sensitive to such changes. Unlike these and similar external factors that in general have negative impacts on tourism, there have also been changes in the behavior and demands of the tourists themselves. Visiting new and unknown tourist destinations in recent years is becoming a major motivational characteristic of the tourists' decision to engage in the tourist flows. Inevitably is the need of the tourist destinations to adapt to this changing environment. Republic of Macedonia still represents an insufficiently explored destination in tourism terms. It can be concluded that the state of the tourism industry is on a low developed level. The changes that have occurred did not spare even this destination. There exist a number of new methodologies for successful adapting to this situation and achieving of competitive advantage in order to survive on the tourism market. The cluster approach in this sense refers to the use of new methodology. It used for the first time in the strategic formulations. Experience shows that the cluster model can be applied to various forms of tourist activities. Based upon the defined objectives, frameworks and guidelines, several clusters can be differentiated with the use of the criteria of priority. In Macedonia the cluster approach is applied to the rural, cultural, mountain, lake and wine tourism. However, in methodological terms this is an open segment of research that can also be used on other possible forms. Using these global experiences will have a contribution for Macedonia to become one of the countries in which the applicability of this methodology is accepted by all stakeholders. The results show remarkable gains that can be recommended to other spatial units in the country and abroad. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

With the monitoring system, we were able to achieve optimal microclimatic conditions for fattening pigs. Ammonia emission in the conventional rearing group reached 17 +/- 7g pig(-1) day(-1). A lower ammonia emission of 7 +/- 1 g pig(-1) day(-1) was found from the organic group. Higher ammonia values in the conventional group could be a result of differences in the pigs' excretory behaviour. In both rearing systems, ammonia emissions were below the maximum level listed by the International Commission of Agriculture Engineering.

The complete abandonment of the socialist housing allocation system during the housing reform has led to profound changes in housing provision and consumption in urban China. This paper presents a chronological reform process and an investigation of the interaction between urban commodity housing prices and general economic conditions in Hang Zhou for the period of 1978-2010. The empirical results indicate that urban commodity housing prices in Hang Zhou are dictated by market fundamentals, which could explain most of the variations in urban commodity housing prices. The findings indicate that there is a stable and strong long-run equilibrium relationship between urban commodity housing prices, the consumer price index, the construction cost index, and one year real lending interest rate in Hang Zhou, and it is the identified fundamentals that drive the prices up, rather than a speculative bubble. Consumer price index and construction cost index positively related to urban commodity housing prices, while change of one year lending interest rate will negatively influence the urban commodity housing prices. The results of Granger causality tests confirm there is a weak short-run relationship from urban commodity housing prices to consumer price index.","[Zheng, Yi; Lean, Hooi Hooi] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,,"Lean, Hooi Hooi/A-5754-2010","Lean, Hooi Hooi/0000-0002-6847-0274",,,,,18,0,0,0,1,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,691,699,,,,,,9,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600060,0

It focuses on the ways in which migrants strategize around temporary employment and move across different jobs and locations trying to improve their precarious lives. Combining labour process theory and the perspective of the autonomy of migration the author reviews the concept of mobility power' as a form of resistance to degrading work. The findings illustrate that, while certain categories of migrants remain trapped in temporary employment, others manage to move on occupationally, develop aspects of their lives beyond work and engage in new migration. The main argument is that, in contrast to mainstream accounts of migrants' labour market incorporation, migrant temp workers use their transnational exit power to quit bad jobs and defy employers' assumptions about their availability to work under poor conditions.","Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Alberti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",g.alberti@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,136,141,2,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Marginal implicit prices are estimated for a variety of ski area physical characteristics and skier amenities. While controlling for these other attributes, the analysis also investigates crowding effects in alpine downhill skiing. Increased crowding, approximated by additional skiers per hour per acre, is shown to raise lift ticket prices at first, before exerting a negative impact on lift ticket prices at high levels of crowding. The results provide evidence for the existence of both agglomeration and congestion effects in downhill skiing and support previous findings of non-linear crowding effects in other outdoor recreation activities.","[Fonner, Robert C.; Berrens, Robert P.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Fonner, RC (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, MSC05-3060 1, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",rfonner@unm.edu; rberrens@unm.edu,,,,,,,35,12,14,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We bridge this gap by studying India's services growth at the sub-national level. Contrary to earlier commentary on the unsustainability of India's services growth process, our findings suggest that per capita services may be converging across Indian states (this is not true of per capita income); unlike previous studies on India, evidence is provided using both traditional sigma and beta-convergence measures and advanced panel unit root tests from the recent econometrics literature. A disaggregated analysis of services sectors reveals convergence in railways, public administration and financial services. Finally, a Jensen and Kletzer approach to determine tradability and an additional original methodology provide evidence of most services being traded' across India's states, suggesting the role of such trade in the services growth story even at the sub-national level.","Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Shingal, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland.",,,"Shingal, Anirudh/0000-0001-8007-7531",,,,,67,5,5,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2014,37.0,12,,,SI,,1773,1793,,10.1111/twec.12163,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AW4KC,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346249000007,0

Greater support is found for the adaptation perspective, as organizations offered fewer flexible work options in 2009 than in 2006. They also engaged in less promotion of alternate work arrangements.

Although persons with disabilities are several times more likely to take rides from household members than to take public transit, little research has been conducted to explore the circumstances under which such rides are given or taken. To address this gap in literature, this study examines the role of household members in transporting persons with disabilities in contemporary America. It explores how the circumstances for the ride takers may change in the future, identifies future challenges in providing mobility to persons with disabilities, and examines ways to meet those challenges. Using nationwide data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey, the study compares the rides taken by persons with disabilities from household members with trips made by other travel modes, the persons who take rides with those who do not take rides, and the drivers who provide rides with those who do not provide rides. Probit models are used for the comparisons. Implications of the findings are discussed in light of potential demographic changes in the future, especially the growth of single-person households and the consequent loss of household support for transportation. Due to similarities in circumstances in other developed countries, an international context to the study is also provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using two empirical illustrations consisting of the Smets and Wouters model and a larger news shock model we show that the SMC algorithm is better suited for multimodal and irregular posterior distributions than the widely used random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We find that a more diffuse prior for the Smets and Wouters model improves its marginal data density and that a slight modification of the prior for the news shock model leads to drastic changes in the posterior inference about the importance of news shocks for fluctuations in hours worked.

This is achieved by using repeated cross-sections (2002-2009) of German microcensus data. I apply the difference-in-differences technique for three groups of craftsmen which were subject to different intensities of treatment. The results show that the complete exemption from the educational entry requirement has fostered self-employment significantly by substantially increasing the entry probabilities, while exit rates have remained unaffected. I find similar, though weaker relative effects for the treatment groups that were subject to a reduction of entry costs or a partial exemption from the entry requirements. Moreover, I consider effect heterogeneity within each of the treatment groups with respect to gender and vocational training, and show that the deregulation of entry requirements has been most effective for untrained workers.","[Rostam-Afschar, Davud] German Inst Econ Res, DIW Berlin, Dept Publ Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Rostam-Afschar, Davud] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin,"Rostam-Afschar, D (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",davud.rostam-afschar@fu-berlin.de,"Rostam-Afschar, Davud/I-6153-2015","Rostam-Afschar, Davud/0000-0002-9358-998X",,,,,37,25,27,0,24,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We are especially interested in the effects of football-related fan violence on a club's potential for generating revenues. In this article, we measure hooliganism by arrests for football-related offenses. We analyze two distinct periods in the history of hooliganism in the English Football League: an early period, during which hooliganism was a fundamental social problem (seasons from 1984-1985 to 1994-1995), and a more recent period, in which hooliganism has been less prevalent (2001-2002 to 2009-2010). In the early period, we find evidence of an adverse effect of arrests on football club revenues for English League clubs. This effect disappears in the more recent period, showing that hooliganism, while still present but at lower levels, no longer has adverse effects on club finances. Our results support a hypothesis that recent gentrification has reduced hooliganism and thereby has had a positive influence on revenue generation.","[Jewell, R.

This technique is based on the use of a l(1)-norm (sum of the absolute values) type penalization on the portfolio weights vector that regularizes the Markowitz portfolio selection problem by automatically eliminating the dynamical redundancies present in the time evolution of asset prices. We make specific recommendations as to the different estimation techniques for the parameters needed in the use of the method and we prove its good performance in realistic situations involving different rebalancing frequencies and transaction costs. Our empirical findings show that the beneficial effects of the use of sparsity constraints are robust with respect to the choice of trend and covariance estimation methods used in its implementation.","[Ortega, Juan-Pablo] Univ Franche Comte, UFR Sci & Tech, CNRS, Lab Math Besancon, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Henriques, Julie] Tea Cegos Deployment, F-25000 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Ortega, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, UFR Sci & Tech, CNRS, Lab Math Besancon, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France.",Juan-Pablo.Ortega@univ-fcomte.fr,,"Ortega, Juan-Pablo/0000-0002-5412-9622",,,,,17,1,2,4,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

A significant dimension of the paper is its emphasis on institutional convergence, going beyond econometric or statistical convergence. Our results reveal that North Cyprus needs 17years to catch up to full per capita income convergence, 16years for per capita output convergence and 17years for full total factor productivity (technological) convergence. The time-series findings demonstrate that statistical convergence is occurring quite rapidly as the North is catching up to the average income and productivity levels of the South, which may confirm evidence of unconditional (beta) or absolute convergence, but there are significant differences between North and South in savings, tastes, population growth and technology. Most significantly, there are institutional differences highlighted in the study with a Two-sector model of gate-keeping and rent-seeking which validates the premises of conditional convergence.

However, given that a PNR passenger must drive for part of the trip, this approach to transit provision has an ambiguous influence on vehicle kilometers traveled (Via). The impact of PNR on VKT is highly dependent of how PNR users would choose to travel if the PNR facilities were not available. Given that this issue has received little attention in a US context, we use the light rail system in Charlotte, North Carolina as a case study to examine the potential impact of PNR removal on VKT. Using a travel survey of PNR passengers, we estimate the VKT currently generated while driving to and from the rail stations and then estimate how VKT would change under various PNR removal scenarios that assume different behavioral responses. We find that, under the most realistic scenarios, PNR removal would lead the average PNR passenger to increase her driving by 8-15 VKT per round trip. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes tests for the joint satisfaction of these assumptions by applying the approach of Huber and Mellace (Testing instrument validity for LATE identification based on inequality moment constraints, 2011) (for testing instrument validity under treatment endogeneity) to the sample selection framework. We show that the exclusion restriction and additive separability imply two testable inequality constraints that come from both point identifying and bounding the outcome distribution of the subpopulation that is always selected/observed. We apply the tests to two variables for which the exclusion restriction is frequently invoked in female wage regressions: non-wife/husband's income and the number of (young) children. Considering eight empirical applications, our results suggest that the identifying assumptions are likely violated for the former variable, but cannot be refuted for the latter on statistical grounds.","[Huber, Martin; Mellace, Giovanni] Univ St Gallen, SEW, Dept Econ, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Huber, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, SEW, Dept Econ, Varnbuelstr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",martin.huber@unisg.ch; giovanni.mellace@unisg.ch,"Mellace, Giovanni/JDQ-1812-2023","Mellace, Giovanni/0000-0003-1784-6654; Huber, Martin/0000-0002-8590-9402",,,,,39,28,37,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

While Russia has become more authoritarian at least since the mid 2000s, the variation in governance across regions remained significant, creating a promising basis for exploring the reasons for this variation.

The empirical results of an analysis of European and Australian airports over a 10 year timeframe reveal that under relatively non-competitive conditions, public airports operate less cost efficiently than fully private airports. Irrespective of ownership form, regulation is necessary to emulate competitive forces thus pushing airport management towards cost efficiency and reasonable pricing policies. Under potential regional or hub competition, economic regulation inhibits airports of any ownership form from operating and pricing efficiently. Although public and fully private airports operate equally efficiently in a competitive setting, private airports still set higher aeronautical charges. Furthermore, mixed ownership forms with a majority public holding are neither cost efficient nor low price, irrespective of the level of competition.

Critical debates in work, employment and industrial relations raise similar concerns about intensified employer and managerial power and weak workers' voice in substantive decision-making in organizations and workplaces. This article proposes that consideration of philosopher Etienne Balibar's conceptions of post-national social citizenship, droit de cite, popular sovereignty and 'worksites of democracy' can usefully stimulate renewed discussion on substantive industrial and organizational democracy. The article argues that development of a radically social citizenship disrupts the hegemony of liberal notions of ownership and of employment contractual relations. Expansive social citizenship enables emancipatory movement beyond congealed adversarial conventions and towards a democracy understood as continually reflexive cooperation. The article illustratively addresses theoretical and practical implications for the regulation of work, employee participation and corporate governance, especially in European companies.","[Casey, Catherine] Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Casey, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",c.casey@leicester.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,1,2,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

First, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to assess the overall WUA efficiency and to evaluate the management and engineering sub-vector efficiencies separately through a mathematical modification of the initial DEA model. In a second step critical determinants of sub-vector efficiency are determined using a Tobit model. A major finding of the study is that WUAs are clearly inefficient. Under variable returns to scale (VRS) speccation, the average technical efficiency of WUA was 84.4%. This implies that output level could be produced by saving 15.6% of (all) used inputs. The average scale efficiency was around 96.5%, indicating that many WUAs are not operating at an efficient scale. Results show also that inefficiencies of the management and maintenance are higher than the overall inefficiency. The average management efficiency is around 80.6% while the average engineering efficiency is 82.3% indicating that about 19% of management and maintenance expenditures could be saved if WUAs were operated in a sound manner. The inefficiency found can be mainly attributed to the number of water pumping stations managed and the number of years of experience operating a WUA (age).",,,,,"Sghaier, Mongi/AAV-9326-2020",,,,,,36,8,8,0,12,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2014,13.0,2,,,,,47,55,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AM7XC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340081000006,0

Although SERs still dominate and shape the labour market, they have undergone several modifications in the recent past. Using survey data from 2006, the article examines how work organizations and particularly multiple workplace demands influence the perceived job security of employees in SERs. The article also asks whether - 20 years after reunification - structural and cultural differences still exist between East and West Germany. The results show that employees in East German SERs are more willing to accept flexibility and performance requirements. The article suggests that a new psychological contract has emerged, which promises long-term employment only if employees eventually meet the new workplace demands. Yet the overall lower job security of East Germans, fuelled by lower trust in their employers' information policies, indicates the fragile nature of this arrangement.","[Bernhardt, Janine] Social Sci Res Ctr Berlin, D-10785 Berlin, Germany; [Krause, Alexandra] Univ Jena, Dept Sociol, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Bernhardt, J (通讯作者)，Social Sci Res Ctr Berlin, Presidents Project Grp, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.",janine.bernhardt@wzb.eu,,,,,,,56,15,15,1,50,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper investigates the association between participation in entertainment activities and tourism flows in Italian provinces, and finds that admission to theatre-type activities increases as the number of domestic tourists rises, whereas admission to museums or concerts rises with an increase in foreign tourists. Admissions to exhibitions and shows demonstrate a positive association with both domestic and international tourists, while non-cultural activities remain statistically insignificant. The results provide empirical support for the existence of a strong relationship between tourism flows and cultural participation.

For a function of parameters, it compares the objective function at the vertices of a simplex and updates the worst vertex through simplex search steps. However, a standard serial implementation can be prohibitively expensive for optimizations over a large number of parameters. We describe an implementation of the Nelder-Mead method in parallel using a distributed memory. For processors, each processor is assigned vertices at each iteration. Each processor then updates its worst local vertices, communicates the results, and a new simplex is formed with the vertices from all processors. We also describe how the algorithm can be implemented with only two MPI commands. In simulations, our implementation exhibits large speedups and is scalable to large problem sizes.","[Klein, Kyle; Neira, Julian] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Neira, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",neira@econ.ucsb.edu,,"Neira, Julian/0000-0001-9603-9708",,,,,11,29,35,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Using a Cox regression model I show that turbines that are located in areas with better wind resources are at a higher risk of being scrapped. Policies put in place in order to encourage the scrapping of older, poorly placed turbines actually have a larger effect on well-placed turbines.","[Mauritzen, Johannes] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Mauritzen, Johannes] Norway & Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Mauritzen, J (通讯作者)，NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",johatmes.mauritzen@nhh.no,,"Mauritzen, Johannes/0000-0003-3576-4572",Norwegian Center for Sustainable Energy Studies; IFN research program The Economics of Electricity Markets,Norwegian Center for Sustainable Energy Studies; IFN research program The Economics of Electricity Markets,"This paper has been much improved thanks to suggestions and comments by three anonymous referees.

The current discourse often focuses on SWFs as political versus market actors. In this exploratory article, however, it is shown that SWFs may be both. They may be employed as a means to increase a state's relative economic power, even when their individual investments are generally made on the basis of economic, market-driven, logic. After a brief overview of SWFs, and literature review of the issues that attend them, I examine the traditional neorealist understanding of internal balancing and argue that there is evidence to support the claim that SWFs can be employed as tools of this state strategy. Four methods, and two cases (Singapore and China), of internal balancing through SWFs are then examined. I find that some SWFs are used for internal balancing purposes in the conventional sense, but that the phenomena may be better captured by the newer concept of non-military internal balancing (in which a state's relative economic power is enhanced without damage to the overall relationship they currently maintain with the target state).","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Int Studies, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lenihan, AT (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Int Studies, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.lenihan@lse.ac.uk,,"Lenihan, Ashley/0000-0002-8845-5362",,,,,88,13,16,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

These gaps preclude a robust understanding of the changes in environmental, human health, resource, and climate change impacts that result from the implementation of HSR in the United States. The gaps are also inimical to an understanding of how HSR can be positioned for 21st century sustainability goals. Through a synthesis of environmental studies, the gaps are grouped into five over-arching grand challenges. They include a spatial incompatibility between HSR and other long-distance modes that is often ignored, an environmental review process that obviates modal alternatives, siloed interest in particular environmental impacts, a dearth of data on future vehicle and energy sources, and a poor understanding of secondary impacts, particularly in land use. Recommendations are developed for institutional investment in multimodal research, knowledge and method building around several topics.

The estimators formulated from the generalized method of moments (GMM) and the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) frameworks can be robust to unknown forms of heteroskedasticity. In this study, the finite sample properties of the robust GMM estimator are compared with the estimators based on the Bayesian MCMC approach for the spatial autoregressive models with heteroskedasticity of an unknown form. A Monte Carlo simulation study provides evaluation of the performance of the heteroskedasticity robust estimators. Our results indicate that the MLE and the Bayesian estimators impose relatively greater bias on the spatial autoregressive parameter when there is negative spatial dependence in the model. In terms of finite sample efficiency, the Bayesian estimators perform better than the robust GMM estimator. In addition, two empirical applications are provided to evaluate relative performance of heteroskedasticity robust estimators. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This leads to a new proof to show that preference cycles can be of arbitrary length for more than two but not for two commodities. For this, it is shown that a set of bundles satisfying the given condition exists if and only if the dimension of the commodity space is at least three. Preference cycles can be constructed by embedding a cyclic -polytope into a facet of a convex monotonic hull in -space, because cyclic polytopes always admit Hamiltonian cycles. An immediate corollary is that WARP only implies SARP for two commodities. The proof is intuitively appealing as this gives a geometric interpretation of preference cycles.","TU Dortmund, Wirtschafts & Sozialwissensch Fak, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Heufer, J (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund, Wirtschafts & Sozialwissensch Fak, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.",jan.heufer@tu-dortmund.de,,,,,,,32,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2014,76.0,3,,,,,329,341,,10.1007/s11238-013-9373-4,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AC4US,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332517200003,0

To evaluate how socioeconomic conditions influence the growth during the adolescence, we tracked the body size of 15-19 year-olds over the last sixty years covering the socialist period (1951-1990), the war (1991-1995) and the transition to capitalistic economy. This study of Zagreb, Croatia, adolescent population provides information on the secular trend in height, weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) and examines their relation with Real Gross Domestic Product. From 1951 to 2010 the girls' height approximately increased by 6.2 cm and weight by 6.8 kg, while the boys' height increased by 12.2 cm and weight by 17.3 kg. Prior to 1991 mean BMI in girls was higher than in boys, but from 1991 on, the interrelation between the sexes has been opposite, possibly mirroring the cultural trends that started in mid-1970s and reflecting higher sensitivity of boys to the socioeconomic changes. In conclusion, the secular trend in body size over the investigated period reflects the positive economic trends interrupted by the war. The recent increase in BMI corresponds to the country's economic recovery and indicates the nutrition transition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Widespread outsourcing processes and the increased sophistication of logistics provisions mean that the industry has arguably evolved beyond being a mere service input to occupying an integral and strategic role within many global industries. It is, therefore, intimately connected to debates about shifting governance regimes and upgrading dynamics within those industries. Conceptualising logistics from a global production network (GPN) perspective offers the potential for revealing both (1) the contribution of logistics providers to value and upgrading dynamics in client sectors and (2) the ways in which the logistics industry itself can be thought of as a multi-actor value-generation network with its own strategic and upgrading dynamics. The article distils the key contributions and limitations of prevailing business studies approaches to logistics, before charting a four-pronged research agenda that foregrounds the political economy of logistics provisions within the global economy. The analysis concludes by thinking about the implications of on-going post-crisis restructuring within the world economy for the proposed research agenda on logistics and GPNs.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore 117548, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Coe, NM (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",,"Hu, Albert/E-1722-2016; Coe, Neil/AAN-8902-2020","Coe, Neil/0000-0001-7720-5061",,,,,96,88,95,2,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Public attention often focuses on the problems of steady development, the preservation of biological diversity, and the implementation of ecotourism activities. Western Siberia is a prospective region for the development of Ecotourism in Russia. This is caused by the high natural potential, originality and aesthetic value of its landscapes, as well as its diverse flora and fauna. In spite of such plant diversity and the high recreational potential of the region, Ecotourism there is developing very slowly. The main reasons for the low efficiency of Ecotourism are the weak transport access, a vast area (hence the long distances between tourist attractions), climatic conditions, and a limited tourist season. Another important problem is a lack of advertisements about Ecotourism. Thus, only 32 of 135 nature reserves and national parks in Russia have their own website, and the information can be ineffective for Eco-tourists. This lack of information in support of Ecotourism, and of effective traditional forms of environmental education can be overcome with the use of a digital multilingual resource. One such specialized presentational product, Tobolsk Mainland, explores a wide range of local and foreign network users with unique capabilities of ecological tourism in Western Siberia. Virtual tourism in this digital resource is another tool of visual representation. The virtual tour serves as an interactive guide for all of the objects, located at various distances from the actual stay.","[Buslova, N. S.; Klimenko, E. V.; Sheshukova, L. A.; Vychuzhanina, A.

We also find evidence of gene-environment interactions: The environment moderates genetic effects on homeownership in that growing up in a wealthier family results in a stronger expression of genetic predispositions, while idiosyncratic life experiences appear to explain a larger portion of the variation in homeownership among those who grew up in a less wealthy family environment. Furthermore, we find that home location choices, for example, a familiar home location close to one's birthplace and an urban versus a rural home location, are explained by both genetic factors and parental influence. Because we control for an extensive set of individual characteristics analyzed in existing research, an interpretation of our evidence is that an individual's preferences with respect to homeownership and home location are partly genetic. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors that explain individual behavior with respect to the housing market, and add to an expanding literature on the biological and genetic factors that influence individuals' economic and financial decisions.","[Cronqvist, Henrik] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Muenkel, Florian; Siegel, Stephan] Univ Washington, Foster Sch Business, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Siegel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Foster Sch Business, Box 353226, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",hcronqvist@cmc.edu; muenkel@uw.edu; ss1110@uw.edu,"Cronqvist, Henrik/K-3023-2012; Cronqvist, Henrik/AAJ-5683-2020; Siegel, Stephan/E-9098-2011","Cronqvist, Henrik/0000-0002-3976-7642; Cronqvist, Henrik/0000-0002-3976-7642; Munkel, Florian/0000-0003-1639-6284; Siegel, Stephan/0000-0002-7938-6940",,,,,94,12,13,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In this view, paper's effort is to examine these most proclaim advantages of corporations entrepreneurship in host economies. As the result shows, there is positive impact of foreign direct investment on labour productivity. Also, it indicates the negative sign of coefficient for foreign investment in case of unemployment. That implies that higher volume of investment decreases the unemployment what is in fact a positive for economy. Export is positive and statistically significant only in influencing labour productivity, but it has no effect on unemployment.

This article revisits the sources of economic backwardness' in eastern Europe and asks whether post-communist states' membership in the European Union (EU) upends the earlier structural conditions that had traditionally prevented east-west economic convergence. The article finds that while there is more economic opportunity for post-communist states in the EU than outside it, EU membership does not subvert the major drivers of the developmental divide. EU membership does, however, limit economic volatility for the New Member States (NMS), which, in historical perspective, is a boon for eastern populations and stabilizing for democratic politics.","Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Epstein, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, 203 Ben M Cherrington Hall,2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",repstein@du.edu,,,,,,,60,26,30,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Historical data pertaining to important factors affecting the CO2 emissions of passenger vehicles, such as the number of registered vehicles, annual mileage, and average CO2 emissions per vehicle, were analyzed to predict the extent by which these factors would change in 2020. The results show that the total CO2 emissions from passenger vehicles in 2015 would be approximately 37.1 Mton, assuming automobile manufacturers will meet the regulations for CO2 emissions reductions for 2015. The CO2 emissions reduction route is determined in accordance with a hypothetical regulation for CO2 emissions reductions in 2020. If the CO2 emissions rates of new passenger vehicles are reduced by 3-7% per year after complying with the 2015 regulation, then total CO2 emissions and required energy would be approximately 36.5-38.6 Mton and 12.9-13.6 Mtoe, respectively. Also, if the current fuel economy competition persists until 2020, the CO2 emissions reductions will follow the plausible reduction route and consequently reach 35.1 Mton CO2 and 12.4 Mtoe energy in 2020. As a result, in order to reduce the total CO2 emissions of passenger vehicles in 2020 (compared with 2015), the value of regulated CO2 emissions in 2020 should be set to less than 103 g/km per passenger vehicle.

We introduce own customer profitability calculation model designed for distribution channels of brewers. The created model is defending terms of managing marketing investments at customers. It allows evaluation of analytical data and draw conclusions, offers the possibility to understand, how to set the level of investment within particular marketing and financial segments.","[Oresky, Milan] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Mkt, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Oresky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Mkt, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",milan.oresky@euba.sk,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3995-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,374,385,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BF6XQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383767900041,0

However, social networks may not remain unchanged in the long term, particularly in response to life-cycle events (for instance, an employment transition). A change in the social network in turn may have a repercussion on activity and travel behaviour, indicating that an investigation of the long term dynamics of social networks are relevant for understanding activity scheduling, or rescheduling behaviour. To this end, the paper advances the concept of social network dynamics in dynamic activity travel behaviour modelling. It explores the dynamics of social networks and life-cycle events, and their influence on activity and travel needs. Dynamics are assumed to be triggered by life-cycle events. For the purpose of the study an event-based retrospective survey was conducted in 2011 in the Netherlands. A structural equation model was developed to elicit activity and travel needs and their dependencies on life-cycle and social network dynamics. The estimated model takes history dependence of activity and travel needs into account. Results suggest that activity and travel dynamics are influenced by life-cycle and social network dynamics. Moreover social network and activity travel dynamics were found to be interdependent (i.e. a change in one leads to change in the other). Furthermore, the study results confirm the general assumption that travel needs are for the most part influenced by activity needs. The paper concludes that the theory and modelling framework of travel behaviour dynamics should take the dynamics of personal networks into account. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering merits of the flexible exchange rate as a shock absorber, i.e. being useful in absorbing asymmetric real shocks, empirical results on the basis of a structural VAR suggest that it is not the case for all Central and East European (CEE) countries, as more than 80% of variability in the nominal exchange rate over the four quarters horizon is explained by the neutral shocks. Variability in output, on the other hand, is determined mainly by permanent (non-neutral) shocks, as it is extracted from a two-variable SVAR model based on the familiar Blanchard-Quah decomposition. For Ukraine, the share of neutral shocks in the variance decomposition of nominal and real exchange rates does not exceed 75%, which is somewhat lower if compared with the CEE countries, but it is still not enough to signal shock-absorbing properties of the exchange rate flexibility.","[Shevchuk, Victor] Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Econ Sociol & Philosophy, PL-30084 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Technology,"Shevchuk, V (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Econ Sociol & Philosophy, 24 Warszawska St, PL-30084 Krakow, Poland.",victorshevchuk@netscape.net,"Shevchuk, Victor Oleksiy/F-9951-2019",,,,,,12,7,7,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-43-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,155,164,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367244900016,0

Numerous studies have shown that countries with more economic freedom grow more rapidly and achieve higher level of income per capita than less free economic. Since Slovakia ranks among the most open economies, this paper focused also on analysis of openness of Slovakia. Its macroeconomic development is largely determined by the development of external economic relations.

We employ an experimental design with three treatments that vary the recipient (experimenter, charity) and amount passed (fixed, varying). We find giving to the experimenter not to be significantly different from giving to a charity, when the amount the subject donates crowds out the amount donated by the experimenter such that the charity always receives a fixed amount. This result suggests that the latter treatment, first used by Crumpler and Grossman (J Public Econ 92(5-6):1011-1021, 2008), does not provide a clean test of warm glow motivation. We then propose a new method of detecting warm glow motivation based on the idea that in a random-lottery incentive (RLI) scheme, such as the one we employ, warm glow accumulates and this may lead to satiation, whereas purely altruistic motivation does not. We also provide bounds on the magnitudes of warm glow and pure altruism as motives that drive giving in our experiment.","[Tonin, Mirco; Vlassopoulos, Michael] Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Econ Div, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Tonin, Mirco] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Tonin, Mirco] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Southampton; Central European University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Vlassopoulos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Econ Div, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",m.tonin@soton.ac.uk; m.vlassopoulos@soton.ac.uk,"Tonin, Mirco/H-3697-2019","Tonin, Mirco/0000-0003-4831-9347; Vlassopoulos, Michael/0000-0003-3683-1466",ESRC [ES/H011080/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H011080/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,28,30,2,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2014,76.0,1,,,,,47,67,,10.1007/s11238-013-9360-9,0.0,,,21,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,298QW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330340400004,0

A simple model predicts that World Bank staff will invest more effort in designing an economic policy loan when faced with a left-wing government. Empirically, estimates from a Heckman selection model show that the quality at entry of an economic policy loan is significantly higher for governments with a left-wing party orientation. This result is robust to changes in the sample, alternative measures of ideology, different estimation techniques and the inclusion of additional control variables. Next, robust findings from estimating a recursive triangular system of equations indicate that leftist governments comply more fully with loan agreements. Results also suggest that World Bank resources are more productive-in terms of reform success-in the design of policy operations than in their supervision. Anecdotal evidence from several country cases is consistent with the finding that left-wing governments receive higher quality loans.","[Smets, Lodewijk; Molenaers, Nadia] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Knack, Stephen] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Antwerp; The World Bank,"Smets, L (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium.",lodewijk.smets@ua.ac.be; sknack@worldbank.org; nadia.molenaers@ua.ac.be,"Molenaers, Nadia/AAY-9992-2020","molenaers, nadia/0000-0003-1266-5598",,,,,69,18,20,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Public health campaigns to promote healthier eating often target compliance with recommended dietary guidelines for consumption of individual nutrients such as fats and added sugars. This paper examines the association between improved compliance with dietary guidelines for individual nutrients and excess calorie intake, the most proximate determinant of obesity risk. We apply quantile regressions and counterfactual decompositions to cross-sectional data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2000-01) to assess how excess calorie consumption patterns in the UK are likely to change with improved compliance with dietary guidelines. We find that the effects of compliance vary significantly across different quantiles of calorie consumption. Our results show that compliance with dietary guidelines for individual nutrients, even if successfully achieved, is likely to be associated with only modest shifts in excess calorie consumption patterns. Consequently, public health campaigns that target compliance with dietary guidelines for specific nutrients in isolation are unlikely to have a significant effect on the obesity risk faced by the population.

However, negotiations on services remain hesitant even at the bilateral level. Classifying an RTA according to its degree of liberalisation in services allows accounting for depth' and heterogeneity issues amongst RTAs. I estimate a gravity equation using panel data covering the period 1999-2007, including bilateral and country-and-time fixed effects.

The effect in other sectors is not statistically significant. However, disaggregating the policy data by mode produces stronger results: policy restrictiveness negatively impacts trade in all sectors except wholesale and retail trade. There is thus considerable evidence of cross-sectoral heterogeneity in the impact of regulations. In addition, we find evidence of cross-modal substitution in total services trade, but complementarity in business, financial and insurance services.

Based on a sample of 44 semi-structured interviews and primary and secondary document research on seven reform episodes during 1995-2009, it finds that the EES altered Greek and Portuguese employment policies by empowering policy entrepreneurs and, when the latter were absent, through European Social Fund financial conditionality. While the literature considers policy learning as the chief EES-Europeanization mechanism, little evidence is found herein to support such an explanation.

Traditionally, marketing research has emphasized the product market and finance research has focused on firm profitability and shareholder value. However, contemporary management strategies increasingly seek to enhance profitability and shareholder value via marketing strategies, which suggests the need for further exploration of the connections between marketing efforts and financial performance. Despite this increased attention, little research in the academic fields of tourism and hospitality has focused on bridging marketing and finance. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to introduce the concept of the marketing finance interface and to explain possible applications of the concept in tourism and hospitality management.","[Jang, SooCheong (Shawn); Tang, Chun-Hung (Hugo)] Purdue Univ, Sch Hospitality & Tourism Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Park, Kwangmin] Sejong Univ, Dept Food Serv Management, Coll Hospitality & Tourism, Seoul, South Korea",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Sejong University,"Jang, S (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Sch Hospitality & Tourism Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jang12@purdue.edu; tang14@purdue.edu; kmpark@sejong.edu,"Jang, SooCheong/L-3880-2019; Park, Kwangmin/D-9000-2013","Park, Kwangmin/0000-0002-2749-8932",,,,,38,5,6,4,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Using multiple panel data of a nationally representative sample of US employees between 1990 and 2003, the pattern of workers' short-term movement across various types of boundaries in the labour market is analysed, as well as change over time and by skill group. The result shows that although the probability of switching firms increased for all workers, the career trajectories of lower-skilled groups showed increasingly opposite trends from those of higher-skilled groups. In particular, occupational immobility was reduced significantly for workers in lower-skilled occupations, yet their changes of occupation occurred mainly within their origin class, resulting in strengthening of class boundaries. Implications of this finding are discussed in light of recent debate on class stratification.","Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pohang 790784, Gyungbuk, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Kim, YM (通讯作者)，Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pohang 790784, Gyungbuk, South Korea.",kimyoungmi@postech.ac.kr,,,,,,,48,13,18,1,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In a recent paper of Pruzhansky (Int J Game Theory 40:351-365, 2011) it was shown that under fairy general conditions maximin strategies in completely mixed games can guarantee the same expected payoff as completely mixed Nash equilibrium strategies. Based on this finding, the current paper argues that maximin strategies have important properties. For instance, maximin strategies may refine Nash equilibria in subjective mixed strategies. Further, Bayesian rationality of the players may favor maximin strategies more often than Nash equilibrium strategies. The paper concludes with several suggestions for further experimental research that may shed more light on whether maximin behavior can explain reality better than Nash equilibrium.","RBB Econ, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",,"Pruzhansky, V (通讯作者)，RBB Econ, Bast Tower,Pl Champ de Mars 5, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",vitaly.pruzhansky@rbbecon.com,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2013,75.0,4,,,,,543,561,,10.1007/s11238-013-9376-1,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,216ZJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324325700004,0

The demand of foreign tourists may either rise exogenously (for example, owing to an increase in foreigners' income) or because of advertising efforts of the domestic country. The author develops a short-run, two-sector model with separated non-Walrasian labour markets, characterized by search of the Pissarides type. Unemployment results from time consuming and costly matching of vacancies with searching agents. A 25% long-run increase in foreigners' tourism demand causes unemployment dynamics in both sectors. The economy-wide unemployment rate shows a non-monotone adjustment and is reduced by roughly 0.3 percentage points. Similar results are obtained if the demand increase is due to successful advertising. The model therefore supports the popular view that tourism can reduce unemployment.","Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Schubert, SF (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Piazza Univ 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",stefanfranz.schubert@unibz.it,,,,,,,27,5,5,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We find that consumers are willing to pay, on average, between 66 and 75 US$ for a 1-mile increase in driving range. Ceteris paribus, 100-mile-range cars have to be priced about 60% less than their conventional counterparts to become competitive. In line with intuition, but in contrast to most specifications employed in primary studies, we find that consumers' marginal willingness to pay (WTP) decreases at a diminishing rate with increases in driving range. The variation in the WTP and compensating variation estimates among examined studies can be attributed to differences in the levels of driving range considered, in other elements of the study design and in the country of study. Our findings support stated preference literature's conclusion that short driving range has been a major limitation to the large-scale adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and other AFVs, and that technological developments permitting longer driving ranges will, to some extent, facilitate their market penetration. We further propose that consumer valuation of driving range should not be examined in isolation from other attributes related to refuelling activities, such as refuelling duration and the coverage of refuelling infrastructure.

There are two types of players: informed and uninformed. Each player has a different ability to translate effort into performance in terms of the contest success function. While one player's type is known to both players, the other is private information and known only to the player himself. We compare the Bayesian Nash equilibrium outcome of a one-sided private information contest to the Nash equilibrium with no private information, in which both players know the type of the other player. We show conditions under which uncertainty increases the investment of the uninformed player and the rent dissipation of the contest, while decreasing the expected net payoff of the informed player. In addition, we consider conditions under which the informed player-before knowing his own type-prefers that the uninformed player knows his type. Moreover, we show conditions for the existence/non-existence of equilibrium in a two-stage contest in which the informed player declares his type (or does not declare) in the first stage and in the second stage the two players play according to the information available to them.","[Epstein, Gil S.] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Epstein, Gil S.] CReAM, London, England; [Epstein, Gil S.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Mealem, Yosef] Netanya Acad Coll, Netanya, Israel",Bar Ilan University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Epstein, GS (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel.",gil.epstein@biu.ac.il,,,,,,,20,11,13,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2013,75.0,3,,,,,305,337,,10.1007/s11238-013-9351-x,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,203SC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323312400001,0

Moreover, multiple practices of property have produced both capitalist economies (such as Moscow's early capitalist enterprises) and non-capitalist, ethically guided economies (such as the indigenous enterprises of Arctic reindeer herders).

The variations in returns are driven by economically as well as geographically and psychologically motivated factors, but so far, no asset pricing model that adequately explains systematic risks in cross-sectional housing returns is widely accepted. This paper proposes an asset pricing model for housing returns that includes a market-wide return factor, an economically motivated factor derived from income growth, a geographically based factor derived from land supply elasticity and a momentum factor, which is psychological in nature. The model explains well the systematic risks in housing returns and is robust to different portfolio segmentations. Moreover, the model illustrates that local risk factors indirectly capture the risk previously attributed to market-wide price changes. While housing is not actively traded when compared to other financial assets, understanding the risk-factors that explain housing return in cross-section provides important insight for real estate investors, builders, real estate future traders, homeowners, banks and other mortgage lenders.","[Beracha, Eli; Skiba, Hilla] Univ Wyoming, Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Beracha, E (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, 3985 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",berachae@ecu.edu; hskiba@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,35,13,14,1,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

On the other hand, if the Internet is more spread among high-quality firms than among low-quality ones, then the Internet-induced increase in seasonality is larger for high-quality establishments. The paper's empirical analysis, which differentiates the impact of the Internet on seasonality between 'hotels and similar establishments' and 'other types of accommodation', finds that ICT has a positive effect on seasonality in both instances, but that the impact is quantitatively larger for 'hotels and similar establishments'.","[Boffa, Federico] Univ Macerata, Dept Legal & Econ Studies, Jesi Branch, I-60035 Jesi, AN, Italy; [Succurro, Marianna] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Financial Sci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Macerata; University of Calabria,"Boffa, F (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Dept Legal & Econ Studies, Jesi Branch, Via Angeloni 3, I-60035 Jesi, AN, Italy.",federico.boffa@unimc.it; m.succurro@unical.it,,"Boffa, Federico/0000-0002-2394-9441",,,,,31,1,1,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Optimizing decisions over time on market behavior such as consumption, investment, labor supply, and technology innovation is of practical importance. Interpreting all market behavior in a broad sense, the problem finds further applications in many areas other than economics. Finding the policy function inherent in the associated Euler equation has been an important but challenging task. This note proposes using composite 1-dimensional cubic splines in tensor form to process the Newton iterative scheme on approximating the unknown policy functions. This tensor spline approach has the advantages of freedom in the node collocation, simplicity in the derivative calculation, fast convergence, and high precision over the conventional projection methods. Applications to the neoclassical growth model with leisure choice are used to demonstrate the working of the idea. In particular, tensor products are employed throughout to simplify and effectuate the operations.","[Chu, Moody T.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Math, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Kuo, Chun-Hung] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27698 USA; [Lin, Matthew M.] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Math, Chiayi 621, Taiwan",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; National Chung Cheng University,"Chu, MT (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Math, Box 8205, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",chu@math.ncsu.edu; ckuo2@unity.ncsu.edu; mlin@math.ccu.edu.tw,"Chu, Moody T/I-6663-2015; Chu, Moody/AAZ-9131-2020","Chu, Moody/0000-0001-8544-3588; Lin, Matthew/0000-0002-8144-947X; Kuo, Chun-Hung/0000-0002-6436-2161","National Science Foundation [DMS-0732299, DMS-1014666]; National Science Council of Taiwan [99-2115-M-194-010-MY2]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",Moody T.

As a consequence, exports may be lower than their efficient levels. For this reason, many countries support exporters by underwriting export credit guarantees. The empirical evidence on the effects of those policies is, however, very limited. In this paper, we use sectoral data on export credit guarantees issued by the German government. We investigate whether those guarantees indeed do increase exports and whether they remedy the export-restricting effect of credit market imperfections both on the sectoral and on the export-market levels. Exploiting the sectoral structure of a rich three-way panel data set of German exports, we control for unobserved heterogeneity on the country-year, sector-year and country-sector dimensions. We document a robust export-increasing effect of guarantees. There is some evidence that the effect is larger for export markets with poor financial institutions and in sectors that rely more on external finance.","[Felbermayr, Gabriel J.; Yalcin, Erdal] Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, GEP Nottingham, CESifo,Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Felbermayr, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, GEP Nottingham, CESifo,Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany.",,,"Yalcin, Erdal/0000-0001-9459-1718; Felbermayr, Gabriel/0000-0003-4984-9745",,,,,23,35,37,3,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2013,36.0,8,,,,,967,999,,10.1111/twec.12031,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,198JJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322918500001,0

The Johansen cointegration test and autoregressive distributed lag estimates are used to determine the long-run equilibrium relationships among the variables. In both the short term and the long run, an increase in tourism (both arrivals and real expenditures) causes expansion in economic growth, with tourist arrivals yielding more robust results. In the long run, economic growth causes appreciation (a fall in the real exchange rate), whereas tourism growth causes depreciation, although their overall combined effects are appreciation. Depreciation increases tourist arrivals and real expenditures, but has conflicting effects on economic growth. Hurricanes result in appreciation, whereas the effects of structural changes are mixed. Additionally, hurricanes result in a decline in tourist real expenditure, and cause tourist arrivals to fall briefly before reversing into a modest increase. The tourism-led economic growth findings for both the short term and long run, albeit modest, imply that it can be worthwhile to extend incentives to promote Jamaica as a tourist destination.","Univ W Indies, Dept Econ, Kingston 7, Jamaica",University West Indies Mona Jamaica,"Ghartey, EE (通讯作者)，Univ W Indies, Dept Econ, Kingston 7, Jamaica.",edward.ghartey@uwimona.edu.jm,,,,,,,54,32,35,1,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This increase favoring skilled workers is examined against relative labor supplies within a class of models estimated by dynamic panel methods. Adapting a conventional model of the skill premium to labor supply, we find strong productivity effects. Higher productivity at the maquiladora industry (assumed either exogenous or endogenous to the wage premium) or higher U.S. GDP per worker (exogenous to the industry) are shown to have positive effects on the wage premium. The elasticity of wages to relative labor supply is very stable, implying strong substitution of labor types.

Therefore, our main objective is to analyse the decision behavior of subjects in a repeated-choice experiment by comparing the explanation power of CBDT to reinforcement learning and to classical decision criteria under uncertainty namely maximin, maximax, and pessimism-optimism.

Many empirical economists have noticed that per-worker GDP of poor regions tend to converge to those of richer regions. However more recently it has been observed that the economic convergence might not be achieved if, in the empirical analysis, we consider the entire data set as one sample. The phenomenon should be analyzed considering regions as belonging to different sub-samples with quite similar economy. Many authors refer to this hypothesis as economic convergence clubs. The definition of these homogeneous groups represents a crucial issue in many regional economic growth studies. The aim of this paper is to propose a method for the identification of convergence clubs for the European regions at NUTS 2 level. The econometric specification used is based on the classical, and spatial augmented version of the conditional beta-convergence model. Two different optimization algorithms for the identification of convergence clubs are proposed and compared: Simulated Annealing and Iterated Conditional Modes.","[Postiglione, Paolo; Benedetti, Roberto] G dAnnunzio Univ Chieti Pescara, Dept Econ Studies, I-65127 Pescara, Italy; [Andreano, M.

Citations to patents decline sharply with distance and are strongly constrained by state borders. The effect of distance on citations to scientific publications is less sharp, and the state border effect on publications is significant only for lower-quality public universities. We show that the state border effect is heterogeneous and strongly influenced by university and state characteristics and policies. It is larger for universities that are public and that have strong local development policies, and in states with strong noncompete labor laws, greater reliance on in-state educated scientists, and lower rates of interstate scientific labor mobility. We confirm the impact of noncompete statutes by studying a policy reform in Michigan.","[Belenzon, Sharon] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Schankerman, Mark] London Sch Econ, London, England",Duke University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Belenzon, S (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,,33,121,140,7,73,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Taking annual wage series for nineteen U.K. towns over the historical period 1871-1906, we fit a spatial panel data model to 1871-1890 data and use estimated coefficients to obtain counterfactual predictions of wage levels after the 1890 shock to the end of the post-shock period. This allows us to analyze how actual wages in different towns performed in relation to their counterfactual paths, and to assess their relative resilience to the 1890 and subsequent crises. The key conclusion is that the sectoral composition of local employment is important for economic resilience; our evidence suggests that towns with excessive and increasing specialization in one dominant industry are relatively prone to shocks, because they lack the structural flexibility needed to replace declining sectors with productive and competitive activities, whereas economies with a diversified industrial mix have more scope for restructuring and renewal, and thus are more able to adapt to and tolerate shocks.

We investigate degrees of health and nutritional disparities between urban and rural children in China as well as how such disparities have changed during the period 1989-2006. The results show that on average urban children have 0.29 higher height-for-age z-scores and 0.19 greater weight-for-age z-scores than rural children. Urban children are approximately 40% less likely to be stunted (OR = 0.62; p < 0.01) or underweight (OR = 0.62; p < 0.05) during the period 1989-2006. We also find that the urban-rural health and nutritional disparities have been declining significantly from 1989 to 2006. Both urban and rural children have increased consumption of high protein and fat foods from 1989 to 2006, but the urban-rural difference decreased over time. Moreover, the urban-rural gap in child preventive health care access was also reduced during this period. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the multiple dimensions of passenger crowding related to public transport demand, supply and operations, including effects on operating speed, waiting time, travel time reliability, passengers' wellbeing, valuation of waiting and in-vehicle time savings, route and bus choice, and optimal levels of frequency, vehicle size and fare. Secondly, crowding externalities are estimated for rail and bus services in Sydney, in order to show the impact of crowding on the estimated value of in-vehicle time savings and demand prediction. Using Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Error Components (EC) models, we show that alternative assumptions concerning the threshold load factor that triggers a crowding externality effect do have an influence on the value of travel time (VTTS) for low occupancy levels (all passengers sitting): however, for high occupancy levels, alternative crowding models estimate similar VTTS. Importantly, if demand for a public transport service is estimated without explicit consideration of crowding as a source of disutility for passengers, demand will be overestimated if the service is designed to have a number of standees beyond a threshold, as analytically shown using a MNL choice model. More research is needed to explore if these findings hold with more complex choice models and in other contexts. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Tourism is viewed as a twofold channel for promoting long-term growth. It finances the imports of foreign capital, but also allows non-traded goods to be consumed by tourists. The authors study both channels jointly in a decentralized two-production sector model, in which four different economic agents interact in a dynamic setting: tourists; domestic consumers; competitive firms in the tourism sector; and firms in the non-traded goods sector. The result is an endogenous growth model in which tourism is the growth engine and balanced growth is assured thanks to the quality of tourist services being kept constant. Although tourists' preferences do not affect the long-run growth of the economy, they can determine the sectoral composition of the economy receiving the tourists.","[Albaladejo Pina, Isabel P.; Pilar Martinez-Garcia, Maria] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Martínez-García, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",isalba@um.es; pilarmg@um.es,"Martínez-García, María Pilar/K-7693-2014; albaladejo, pierre/M-6901-2014; Albaladejo, Isabel P./F-2388-2016","Martínez-García, María Pilar/0000-0003-2845-9799; Albaladejo, Isabel P./0000-0001-7441-7392",,,,,23,21,22,2,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The method uses spatial filtering in order to account for uncertainty in spatial linkages. Our procedure is applied to a dataset of income per capita growth and 50 potential determinants for 255 NUTS-2 European regions. We show that ignoring uncertainty in the type of spatial weight matrix can have an important effect on the estimates of the parameters attached to the model covariates. After integrating out the uncertainty implied by the choice of regressors and spatial links, human capital investments and transitional dynamics related to income convergence appear as the most robust determinants of growth at the regional level in Europe.

The individual payoffs from a given network are determined by the difference of an agent specific utility function that depends on the number of her direct links and the sum of her link-costs. These link-costs decompose in a symmetric function that represents the social distance between the two agents and an agent specific function representing the partner's quality. From a theoretical point of view, we analyze strong pairwise stable networks (Belleflamme and Bloch, Int Econ Rev 45(2):387-411, 2004) and show that our model always has a unique strong pairwise stable network which is also strongly stable (Dutta and Mutuswami, J Econ Theory, 76:322-344, 1997). From a practical point of view, we provide an algorithm that reproduces this stable network from information on the individual payoff structure. We illustrate the use of this algorithm by applying it to an informal risk sharing network data set from the village of Nyakatoke in rural Tanzania.","[Vandenbossche, Joost; Demuynck, Thomas] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Demuynck, Thomas] Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Econ Studies, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Ghent University; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Vandenbossche, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",joost.vandenbossche@ugent.be; thomas.demuynck@kuleuven-kortrijk.be,,"Demuynck, Thomas/0000-0003-2957-9223",Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen); Interuniversity attraction poles programme-Belgian Science Policy [P06/07]; FWO [G.0078.05],Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen)(FWO); Interuniversity attraction poles programme-Belgian Science Policy(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); FWO(FWO),"We sincerely thank Dirk Van de gaer for his valuable recommendations and insightful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

The concept of a mode of regulation - central to the Parisian wing of regulation theory - is rejected in favour of a distinction between functional and dysfunctional accumulation regimes. The Fordist regime of accumulation provided a unique institutional context allowing an extraordinary combination of high profits, rising real wages and strong GDP growth. In contrast, the postfordist regime is shown to be inherently dysfunctional, characterized by manifest tendencies toward stagnation and associated regressive trends in work and employment relations. A comparative analysis of profit rates, wage shares, growth rates and debt in the USA, UK and Germany shows that the single model of postfordism as a dysfunctional accumulation regime fits all three countries, although with important differences in forms of dysfunctionality.","Kings Coll London, Dept Management, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Vidal, M (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Management, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",matt.vidal@kcl.ac.uk,"Vidal, Matt/M-8841-2015","Vidal, Matt/0000-0001-7189-7482",,,,,51,47,53,0,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This new scramble' marks the latest chapter of imperialist engagement, with not only Western states and corporations but also those of emerging economies' seeking to consolidate their access to African resources and markets. The new scramble for Africa' involves therefore significant transformations related to shifts in global politico-economic power. However, as this article elaborates, much of the burgeoning literature on the new scramble for Africa' is premised upon problematic substantive, theoretical and ontological claims and debates. In particular, the article seeks to challenge two commonplace and related narratives. Firstly, the highly questionable representations of the scale and perceived threat of emerging powers' (particularly China's) involvement in Africa, in contrast to the silences, hypocrisy and paternalistic representation of the historical role of the West. Second, and relatedly, debate and analysis are framed predominantly within an ahistoric statist framework of analysis, particularly that of inter-state rivalry between China and other emerging' states vs. Western powers. Absent or neglected in such accounts are profound changes in the global political economy within which the new scramble for Africa' is to be more adequately located.","[Ayers, Alison J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Ayers, Alison J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Sociol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Ayers, Alison J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Anthropol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University; Simon Fraser University; Simon Fraser University,"Ayers, AJ (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",ajayers@sfu.ca,,,,,,,162,51,56,1,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

I argue that the Consensus was a transnational policy paradigm, shaped by both scholarly and political forces (Hall, 1993). At the core of the Consensus was the international financial institutions' practice of conditionality making loans to governments in exchange for policy reforms. The Consensus was subsequently weakened by its own unintended consequences, by political forces both within Washington and worldwide and by intellectual changes in the field of economics. However, I argue that the Consensus has yet to encounter any serious rivals.","Boston Coll, Dept Sociol, Boston, MA USA",Boston College,"Babb, S (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Sociol, Boston, MA USA.",,,,,,,,106,169,207,2,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Consequently, researchers have turned to using the difference between virtual and observed prices as an indicator of binding rationing. However, this often requires using external data from another country or an unrationed sample period to estimate virtual prices. In contrast, our methodology uses data from the rationed period to estimate virtual prices. The ration constrained revealed preference approach provides virtual prices that can be used to estimate a system of free demands. We then estimate the impact that rationing had on expenditure on unrationed goods using relationships between free and rationed demand elasticities. We apply our methodology to inter war period data from Belgium. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This risk can be successfully hedged using a financial instrument called weather derivatives. In this study the dynamics of the wind generating process are modeled using a non-parametric non-linear wavelet network. Our model is validated in New York. The proposed methodology is compared against alternative methods, proposed in prior studies. Our results indicate that wavelet networks can model the wind process very well and consequently they constitute an accurate and efficient tool for wind derivatives pricing. Finally, we provide the pricing equations for wind futures written on two indices, the cumulative average wind speed index and the Nordix wind speed index.","[Alexandridis, A.] Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England; [Zapranis, A.] Univ Macedonia Econ & Social Studies, Dept Accounting & Finance, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece",University of Kent,"Alexandridis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England.",A.Alexandridis@kent.ac.uk; zapranis@uom.gr,"Zapranis, Achilleas/M-4906-2019; Zapranis, Achilleas D/G-8381-2019; Alexandridis, Antonis/J-9652-2019","Zapranis, Achilleas/0000-0001-8927-374X; Alexandridis, Antonis/0000-0001-6448-1593",,,,,65,18,19,5,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Attempting to shed light on what drives people to lead, we devise a two-stage public good experiment with endogenous timing. We show that leading by making generous contributions is widespread and relatively persistent. At least three motives explain this behavior. Some use leadership strategically to distill personal gains, with the expectation that others will respond by being at least as generous. Others are more altruistic, volunteering to lead even though this may come at a personal cost. Yet for another fraction of volunteers, a concern for maintaining a positive social image appears to be responsible.

Secondly, computed water efficiency scores are regressed on explanatory variables using a Tobit model, to help identify its determinants. Results indicate that technical efficiency of production in the sample of farms investigated is about 70.72% on average, and water use efficiency is only about 64.86%. This suggests that cereal farms may reduce their water use level while maintaining the same level of production. Furthermore, the estimated Tobit model indicates the positive effect on water use efficiency of variety choice, irrigation sources, membership in water users association, irrigation management and farm size.

The impact of housing market conditions on state-to-state migration,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Negative equity; Geographic labor mobility,RETURN MIGRATION; RESIDENTIAL-MOBILITY; UNITED-STATES; LOSS AVERSION; EQUITY; PRICES,"U.S. policymakers are concerned that negative home equity arising from the housing market crash may be constraining geographic mobility and consequently serving as a factor in the persistently high national unemployment rate. Indeed, the widespread drop in house prices since 2007 has increased the share of homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages. At the same time, migration across states and among homeowners has fallen sharply. Using a logistic regression framework to analyze data from the Internal Revenue Service on state-to-state migration between 2006 and 2009, we discover evidence that house lock decreases mobility but find that it has a negligible impact on the national unemployment rate. A one-standard deviation increase in the share of underwater nonprime households in the origin state reduces the outflow of migrants from the origin to the destination state by 2.7%. When aggregated across the United States, this decrease in mobility reduces the national state-to-state migration rate by 0.05 percentage points, resulting in roughly 103,000 to 140,000 fewer individuals migrating across state lines in any given year. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the impact of reduced mobility due to negative housing equity on the national unemployment rate is likely to be small on the order of less than one-tenth of a percentage point each year.

Two research methods were applied. Firstly, 86 key participants in the Dutch CBA practice were interviewed in-depth in order to obtain an overview and a ranking of perceived substantive problems with CBA in the Netherlands. Secondly, the people interviewed were also asked to fill in a written questionnaire in which they were asked to rank the substantive problems once again, in order to improve the validity of the ranking; 74 of the participants completed this questionnaire. The most important conclusions of this paper are, firstly, that key participants in the Dutch CBA practice consider 'problems with the estimation of the non-monetized project effects' as the most important substantive problem cluster and 'problems with monetizing project effects' as the second most important substantive problem cluster. Secondly, key participants in the Dutch CBA practice consider the 'problem analysis' in a CBA to be a very important substantive problem. Thirdly, there is, in a broad sense, consensus among the different groups in the Dutch CM practice concerning their perception of the seriousness of problem clusters and the way they rank the problem clusters. Fourthly, a large part of the substantive problems mentioned by the key participants in the Dutch CBA practice are non-specific CBA problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The extant literatures on sanctions and transnational non-state groups have largely overlooked the role, if any, the activities of these transnational non-state actors have on the use of economic coercion as a popular policy tool. In this study, we argue that HROs could affect sanction decisions through two distinct mechanisms: information production (shaming and blaming) and local empowerment (local presence). By bringing poor human rights performers into the international spotlight, we argue that this effect should hold even after accounting for human rights practices in the targeted countries. Using dyadic data on HROs and economic sanctions, we find robust support for our basic argument that HRO activities increase the likelihood of sanction events against repressive regimes. Additionally, much of the empirical support highlights the role of information production, as opposed to local empowerment, in leading to sanction onset. Overall, our findings indicate that HROs are powerful actors in influencing foreign policy decisions between states.","[Murdie, Amanda] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA; [Peksen, Dursun] Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Memphis,"Peksen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",murdiea@missouri.edu; dpeksen@memphis.edu,"Murdie, Amanda/GQB-5152-2022","Murdie, Amanda/0000-0002-6459-0594",,,,,86,67,84,1,52,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Measures of rank correlation have been developed in several contexts for more than a century and we were able to cite more than thirty of these coefficients, from simple ones to relatively complicated definitions involving one or more systems of weights. However, only a few of these can actually be considered reasonable measures of concordance/discordance. The main drawback with the vast majority of coefficients is their resistance-to-change which appears to be of limited value for the purposes of rank comparisons that are intrinsically robust. In this article, a new non-parametric correlation coefficient is defined that is based on ratios of two ranks. In comparing it with existing coefficients, it was found to be extremely sensitive to permutation patterns. We have illustrated the potential improvement that our index may provide in economic contexts by comparing published results with those obtained through the use of this new index. The success that we have had suggests that our index may have important applications wherever the discriminatory power of the rank correlation coefficient ought to be particularly strong.","[Tarsitano, Agostino; Lombardo, Rosetta] Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria,"Tarsitano, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, Via Pietro Bucci,Cubo 1C, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",agotar@unical.it; r.lombardo@unical.it,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

It is proved that these estimators have a breakdown point one half. The used method comes from a geometric median. In the first step it is shown that we can employ one half of observations and the estimate stays robust in the sense of the breakdown point. In the second step we show that we can add even more observations which are in some sense close to the geometric median and still get robust results. The robustness is proved in both steps for a multidimensional case. Since we can employ more observations and stay robust in the sense of the breakdown point, we enlarge the used information in comparison to other robust estimators like median and therefore get better results. We combine the advantage of the robust estimator and the classical mean. Our estimators are compared by simulation study with classical estimators like mean, median or alpha windsorised estimator. The comparison is done for different distributions like normal, Cauchy or exponential. We also consider the case, when the normal distribution is with some probability contaminated by another distribution.

To prevent discovery, fraudsters perform normal trading behaviors and disguise themselves as honest members. It is therefore not easy to detect fraud in online auctions. Users must rely on information that is on the web auction systems available, for example user's ratings (reputation), descriptions of the offered items, time frames of different activities and records of transactions. This paper presents a set of characteristics that characterize fraudulent behavior on the internet auction - the sale of counterfeit or stolen goods.

Distant proposal draws are taken in a sequence of steps following the Hamiltonian dynamics of the underlying parameter space, often yielding superior mixing properties of the resulting Markov chain. However, its performance can deteriorate sharply with the degree of irregularity of the underlying likelihood due to its lack of local adaptability in the parameter space. Riemann Manifold HMC (RMHMC), a locally adaptive version of HMC, alleviates this problem, but at a substantially increased computational cost that can become prohibitive in high-dimensional scenarios. In this paper we propose the Adaptively Updated HMC (AUHMC), an alternative inferential method based on HMC that is both fast and locally adaptive, combining the advantages of both HMC and RMHMC. The benefits become more pronounced with higher dimensionality of the parameter space and with the degree of irregularity of the underlying likelihood surface. We show that AUHMC satisfies detailed balance for a valid MCMC scheme and provide a comparison with RMHMC in terms of effective sample size, highlighting substantial efficiency gains of AUHMC.

The EU's share in world merchandise exports is about 15 % and exports of commercial services almost 25 % (WTO, 2011). However, the EU not only exports but also imports some commodities from third countries and its trade balance is negative in the long term. The negative trade balance is created in the import of raw materials and energy such as oil and natural gas. These minerals are imported into the EU mainly from Russia, which therefore occupies the second position among the EU main importers. The dependence of the EU-27 on imports of energy resources from Russia varies in the individual Member States. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the untapped export potential of the EU to Russia by the member countries in 2000-2011 and to propose appropriate measures to improve export in these countries. The quantitative assessment of the export potential of the member countries of the EU to Russia will be done through a gravity model, which is very often used for the purposes of analysis in this area. Removing the unused export potential to Russia would help to achieve trade balance throughout the EU.","[Fojtikova, Lenka] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,lenka.fojtikova@vsb.cz,"Fojtikova, Lenka/JCD-8885-2023",,,,,,11,8,8,0,13,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,171,176,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000030,0

The emphasis is placed on the introduction to control in the budget execution process. Well-established system of financial management and control, which had a long-term effect of good financial management, is also one of the elements of its connectivity with fiscal responsibility. Internal procedures in the field of planning, budget execution, public procurement area, accounting and reporting area represent an efficient coordination of financial management and control in order to ensure fiscal responsibility. Business processes that occur within the institutions / facilities of budget users in the health system, education system and social contributions and benefits are an integral part of the financial management and control. The same is required successful to define and incorporate and describe as internal controls in order to improve the activity of a specific business process. For the needs of undisturbed operation of almost all business processes an important role has public procurement process as a component that provides a more efficient realization of the financial savings. Statement of fiscal responsibility for the budget year or the period in which headmasters or principals of institutions / facilities have performed the duties in the health system, education system and social contributions and benefits system confirm that they were in an institution provided legal, functional and purposeful utilization of budgetary resources as well as effective functioning of the financial management and control system within the budgetary resources apropos planned resources defined by financial plan.

However, equitable and optimal fund allocation for purchasing, operating and maintaining a transit fleet is a complex process. In this study, we develop an optimization model for allocation of funds among different fleet improvement programs within budget constraints over the planning period. This is achieved by minimizing the net present cost (NPC) of the investment within the constraint of a minimum level of fleet quality expressed as a surrogate of the remaining life of the fleet. Integer programming is used to solve the formulated optimization problem using branch and bound algorithm. The model formulation and application are demonstrated with a real world case study of transit agencies. It is observed that minimizing NPC provides a realistic way to allocate resources between different program options among different transit agencies while maintaining a desired quality level. The proposed model is generalized and can be used as a resource allocation tool for transit fleet management by any transit agency. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Literature has shown that there are differences between the success and failure factors in the developed and developing countries with regard to the development and use of Web-based or online information sources for learning purposes in Universities. There is very little literature, and evidence of attention given to this area of study in Zimbabwe in particular. This study is build on the premise that information seeking is socio-culturally bounded and that the success of use of Web-based information is highly related to if not found at, the intersection between the implied by the perceptions of students, that is, information seekers and learners and the technology applied to achieve the desired information search outcomes. The data were collected by use of an instrument of a questionnaire that was administered among postgraduate students at Solusi University, in Zimbabwe, in 2011.The data were analysed quantitatively with SPSS version 17.0 for Windows using mainly cross-tabulations and Chi-squared tests. The statistically significant differences focused on the general Web-based information seeking, management and evaluation in this information environment, and information practices used within the Solusi University. The conclusions drawn from the study were that cultural differences and implications influence the seeking of Web-based learning information and that the impact of cultural differences and implications should be examined more thoroughly in future studies, which should apply both qualitative and quantitative methods.","[Ngwenya, Bongani] Solusi Univ, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",,,nbongani@gmail.com,"Ngwenya, Bongani/AAB-4107-2021","Ngwenya, Bongani/0000-0002-6852-1449",,,,,37,0,0,0,8,"INFORMATION ENGINEERING RESEARCH INST, USA",NEWARK,"100 CONTINENTAL DR, NEWARK, DE 19713 USA",,,978-1-16275-049-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,78,86,,,,,,9,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BGC87,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322345500015,0

In doing so, we shall focus upon the relationship between English Mercantilist economic thought and the evolution of the institutional framework established in order to cope with the problem of poverty and unemployment. In other words, rather than viewing Mercantilism as an 'exercise in economic nationalism' we shall inquiry it under the perspective of social policy. Although the most credited assessments of Mercantilism have depicted it as a doctrine which supported a ruthlessly materialistic ruling class which did not merely neglect but actively exploited the poor, by placing the emphasis on the role played by the allowance system in the overall strategy of poor relief in England throughout the seventeenth century we shall see that during the Mercantilist period social policies were not neglectful of the need of the poor.

Monte Carlo simulations show that tests based on the least squares covariance matrix estimator can frequently lead to finding spurious Granger causality. The degree of oversizing tends to increase with the sample size and is substantially larger for the nonlinear test. On the other hand, heteroskedasticity-robust tests which are based on the fixed design wild bootstrap perform adequately in terms of size and power. Consequently, reliable causality in mean tests can be conducted without the need to specify a conditional variance function.

This leaves the other side in the disadvantage. The process of decision making in the market environment is affected by many factors. In the consumers' information frame consumers express their expectations and preferences for the product they demand. Producers usually work with a greater range of product information than the one available to the consumer. Distributors usually do not communicate complete information from producer to customer. The core motive of this paper is to show the distortion in information which occurs in the market. The essential idea is to capture the basic elements of the information frame and their mutual relationships to express the loss of information and its asymmetry in the market environment. Elements and their relationships are shown using a semantic network. The scales of identified elements in the network are then estimated using Analytic Network Process (ANP).

We use a time series approach instead of often applied multivariate approaches to exclude potential biases across local markets and provide trading strategies to compare predictability across markets and to test whether or not the detected persistence can be exploited by investors to earn excess returns. The results from the monthly and quarterly transaction-based S&P/Case-Shiller house price indices from 1987 to 2009 provide empirical evidence on strong persistence. This is confirmed by both parametric and non-parametric tests for nominal and real house prices based on expected inflation. Furthermore, the empirical findings suggest that investors might be able to obtain excess returns from both autocorrelation-based and moving average-based trading strategies compared to a buy-and-hold strategy, although the results depend on the transaction costs individual investors face.","[Schindler, Felix] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, Dept Int Finance & Financial Management, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany; [Schindler, Felix] Steinbeis Univ Berlin SHB, Berlin, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Schindler, F (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, Dept Int Finance & Financial Management, POB 10 34 43, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",schindler@zew.de,,,,,,,67,17,17,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Moreover, it is assumed that the stochastic characteristics of optimized system are estimated from the data, in non-parametric setting, and that the data may be randomly right-censored. Therefore, certain theoretical results concerning estimators of distribution functions and quantiles under censoring are recalled and then utilized to prove consistency of solution based on estimates. Behavior of solutions for finite data sizes is studied with the aid of randomly generated example.","[Volf, Petr] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, CR-18208 Prague 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,,volf@utia.cas.cz,"Volf, Petr/AAL-7007-2021; Volf, Petr/E-8320-2013","Volf, Petr/0000-0001-5673-6066;",,,,,5,1,1,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1004,1009,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000170,0

We analyze states' choices in trade policy during the current global economic crisis, a situation likely to exacerbate uncertainty in the conduct of commercial relations and to push countries toward beggar-thy-neighbor trade policies. The main argument of the paper is that the numerous international institutions present in the international system during the current economic crisis serve as conveyors of information and mechanisms of commitment and socialization. They mitigate the uncertainty problem that prevails in prisoner's dilemma settings such as trade. Economic international organizations increase the flow of information about the preferences and behaviors of its members. Non-economic organizations also have a role to play as social environments that encourage cooperation. Specialized international institutions devoted to trade, such as the WTO and preferential trade agreements (PTAs), not only provide monitoring and enforcement functions but also lock in commitments to liberal trade through legal obligations that make defections costly. We test our argument using a dataset of trade policies during the current economic crisis and of membership in international organizations. The paper finds strong support for the role of international institutions as commitment and socialization mechanisms in preventing the rise of protectionism.","[Kim, Soo Yeon] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Polit Sci, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Baccini, Leonardo] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, NCGG, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",National University of Singapore; Princeton University,"Kim, SY (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Polit Sci, AS1,04-10,11 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",lbaccini@princeton.edu; sooyeon.kim@nus.edu.sg,"Baccini, Leonardo/A-2852-2011","Baccini, Leonardo/0000-0002-6027-9192",,,,,45,20,23,3,58,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The empirical analysis is based on a theoretical model, which assumes that the output good is produced by capital, labour and energy according to a nested production function framework where capital and energy are combined by a CES function at the intermediate stage. The output responses to energy price changes are derived, using estimates of the elasticity of substitution. While industry suffered more from the oil price shock of the late 1970s than from that of the early 1970s and the 2004-2008 upsurge, evidence suggests the reverse for transportation. Regarding the impact on income distribution, both sectors share the same pattern, whereby in the recent episode, rising energy costs were more than compensated by falling unit labour costs, while in the 1970s, cost structures had been strained by an expansive wage policy in addition to the oil price shocks.","[Knetsch, Thomas A.; Molzahn, Alexander] Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Econ, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Molzahn, A (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",thomas.knetsch@bundesbank.de; alexander.molzahn@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Though the hedonic approach is less wasteful of data than the repeat sales estimator, it relies on an accurate specification of the underlying econometric model. I suggest using a matching estimator as an alternative to the hedonic and repeat sales approaches. Like the repeat sales approach, a matching estimator uses pairs of sales from different dates to estimate the mean difference in sales prices over time. The matching approach preserves much larger sample sizes than the repeat sales estimator while requiring less preimposed structure than the hedonic approach.

Our findings indicate that REIT managers elect to hold less cash to reduce the agency problems of cash flow, supporting the pecking order theory that growth opportunities lead managers to retain more cash on hand. The results show that any deviation from the estimated optimal cash holdings is significantly detrimental to future market performance, suggesting that excess or insufficient cash is harmful to stock returns. The adverse influence of deviations above the optimal value is insignificantly stronger than that of deviations below the optimal value. We also find that the return performances of deviations that do not differ from the expected optimal value surpass those of deviations that differ significantly from the expected level. This implies that REIT managers determine their cash policies based on future growth opportunities and the external costs of capital. Finally, for REIT firms, holding excess or insufficient cash increases the possibility of agency conflict or underinvestment, which will consequently worsen the firm's future performance.","[Chen, Ming-Chi; Wang, Chin-Yu; Shyu, So-De] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University,"Chen, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, 70 Lien Hai Rd, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.",mcchen@finance.nsysu.edu.tw; d964030005@student.nsysu.edu.tw; dshyu@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Ming-Chen/0000-0003-4589-4055",,,,,36,4,4,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We also highlight the importance of survey design techniques. These objectives were accomplished through a stated preference survey of Houston's Katy Freeway travelers. Three stated choice experiment survey design techniques were tested in this study: Bayesian (D-b) efficient, random level attribute generation, and an adaptive random approach. Mixed logit models were developed from responses using each of those designs. The value of travel time savings (VTTSs) estimates do vary across the design strategies, with the VTTS estimates based on the D-b-efficient design being approximately half the estimates from the other two designs. However, among the three design strategies, the value of travel time reliability (VOR) was only significant in the D-b-efficient design. The estimated VTTS from actual Katy Freeway usage (as measured using actual tolls paid and travel time saved on the managed lanes) is $51/h. This likely also includes any value that travelers place on travel time reliability. In comparison, our combined estimate of VTTS and VOR based on the SP survey (D-b-efficient design) was $50/h, which is remarkably close to the estimate from the actual usage data. Based on our dataset, the D-b-efficient design technique proved superior to the other two techniques. Finally, this research also supports the importance of including both travel time and travel time reliability parameters when estimating the willingness to pay for, and therefore benefits derived from, ML travel.

Evidence of cotton textile profitability,EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Industrial Revolution; Schumpeterian growth; Cotton textiles; Prices; Profits,GROWTH,"Price and profit data between the 1770s and the 1820s from accounting records of three Lancashire cotton firms help to illumine the nature of the economic processes at work in early industrialization. Many historians have seen the Industrial Revolution as a Schumpeterian process in which discontinuous technological change led by the mechanized factories of the cotton industry created large profits for innovators that persisted in succeeding decades while technology slowly diffused. In this view imperfect capital markets limited the use of the new technology, keeping profits high. Reinvestment of these profits gradually financed expansion of innovating firms. The new technology dominated only after a long diffusion process. The evidence here, however, supports a more equilibrium view in which the industry expanded rapidly and prices fell in response to technological change. Expansion of the industry led to dramatic declines in the prices of cotton goods as early as the 1780s. There is no evidence of super-normal profits thereafter. Prices continued to fall and output expand thereafter as cost-reducing technological change continued. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It draws on careful analysis of funding bills and primary and secondary sources including government reports, industry and policy newsletters, scholarly articles, and publicly available data on earmarks. It is also informed by interviews with transportation stakeholders involved with earmarks at federal, state, and regional levels. By detailing how Congress pays for earmarks, I show that earmarks do more to redistribute than add to existing transportation resources, and that the intricacy of Congressional funding maneuvers can make earmarks' fiscal impacts hard to discern. Several implications follow for transportation policy and practice. First, critiques that earmarks increase federal transportation spending are misplaced. While such claims make it easy to discredit national investment in transportation, skepticism is in order when earmarks are invoked to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Second, earmarks' true costs are related not to increased deficits but rather to opportunity costs incurred when unplanned earmarks replace other investments, particularly projects identified through regional and state planning or competitive selection by an executive agency. Finally, this work suggests productive directions for future earmark reform, such as limiting earmarks to projects in regional or state plans and making explicit for any earmarks in a bill the funding mechanisms that support them. Such steps could lessen the opportunity costs (and administrative inefficiencies) of earmarks, increase transparency in earmarking, and potentially make the practice less objectionable if used to facilitate passage of the long overdue surface transportation authorization bill.

The aim of this paper is to assess the role the country of origin plays in the preferences of German consumers for peaches. Since German legislation requires fresh fruit sold on the market to clearly display the products country of origin, German consumers usually make their choice with this information at hand. We attempted to investigate such concerns through a choice experiment approach conducted by means of a questionnaire-based survey administered to a representative sample of 300 German households. In the experiment, respondents were asked to choose their favorite peach among four alternatives. Each peach was described as imported from four specific countries (Italy, Spain, Turkey and France) and available at 0 specific price: some of the peaches were certified as Organic or PDO. The stated choices are analyzed using a latent class choice model to derive estimates of preferences for peaches. Results indicate the presence of three distinct consumer segments in the German peach market. The hugest segment (48%) showed a strong preference for Italian peaches as well as for organic and PDO certification. For this segment. price was not an important attribute. The second segment (41%) showed a strong preference for Spanish produce and organic certification. Price was important in this case. The third segment (11%) had a negative preference for Italian and Spanish peaches, with price being the main attribute.","[Cicia, Gianni; Cembalo, Luigi; Del Giudice, Teresa] Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Econ & Polit Agr, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Cicia, G (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Econ & Polit Agr, Naples, Italy.",,"Cicia, Gianni/B-1822-2012","Cicia, Gianni/0000-0003-4188-241X; Del Giudice, Teresa/0000-0001-9417-7816; Cembalo, Luigi/0000-0002-3808-5797",MiPAAF (Italian Ministry for Agricultural and Forestry Policy),MiPAAF (Italian Ministry for Agricultural and Forestry Policy),"Research financed by the MiPAAF (Italian Ministry for Agricultural and Forestry Policy), QUAGRI Project.",,14,10,10,0,7,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2012,11.0,3,,,,,75,79,,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,046MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311769300009,0

The scores relating to technical efficiency indicate that the average technical efficiency in organic farms is about 93% as against 80% of conventional farms. Thus efficiency is positively affected by the farm history when the organic production method is adopted while it is affected by water and soil management, farmers' training level and multi-activity in conventional farming.

I take issue with this claim, arguing that the norms, motivations and perceptions that make supranational democracy possible can also emerge through processes that do not presuppose shared communal identifications. These include the gradual externalization of domestic democratic norms and practices to the EU level, the incorporation of the resulting supranational democratic attachments back into existing national identifications and the build-up of transnational political trust propelled by the practice of supranational democracy itself. Such an outcome is not inevitable, but it is conceivable in that it is theoretically coherent and has limited empirical analogies and precedents. The range of options for the EU's further democratic development is therefore broader and the chances of its success greater than many analysts assume.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Theiler, T (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland.",tobias.theiler@ucd.ie,,"Theiler, Tobias/0000-0002-7302-3276",,,,,66,7,7,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

J,"Demange, G",,,,"Demange, Gabrielle",,,On the influence of a ranking system,SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Ranking systems are becoming increasingly important in many areas, in the Web environment and academic life for instance. In a world with a tremendous amount of choices, rankings play the crucial role of influencing which objects are tasted or selected. This selection generates a feedback when the ranking is based on citations, as is the case for the widely used invariant method. The selection affects new stated opinions (citations), which will, in turn, affect the next ranking. The purpose of this paper is to investigate this feedback in the context of journals by studying some simple but reasonable dynamics. Our main interest is in the long run behavior of the process and how it depends on the preferences, in particular on their diversity. We show that multiple long run behaviors may arise due to strong self-reinforcing mechanisms at work with the invariant method. These effects are not present in a simple search model in which individuals are influenced by the cites of the papers they first read.","PSE EHESS, F-75014 Paris, France",,"Demange, G (通讯作者)，PSE EHESS, 48 Bd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",demange@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,21,5,5,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2012,39.0,2-3,,,SI,,431,455,,10.1007/s00355-011-0631-5,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,968FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305963200010,0

The IPL acted as a holding company, securing the participation of players through a guaranteed base price and then selling these players to the various IPL franchises though an auction system which determined their final payment. There were thus two components to a player's value: the base price determined by the IPL and the final price paid at the IPL auction by the winning bid for that player. The basic assumption made in this article is that the base price for a player is founded for the most part on the publicly available information about him. However, auction under IPL 2008 was characterized with large and unexpected base-final price differences. This raises the possibility that the bidding process was driven by the irrational exuberance created within the newly formed franchises. This article measures the scale of such exuberance and evaluates, on the basis of their IPL record, whether players were good or bad buys.","[Borooah, Vani K.] Univ Ulster, Sch Econ, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, North Ireland; [Mangan, John] Univ Queensland, Dept Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia",Ulster University; University of Queensland,"Borooah, VK (通讯作者)，Univ Ulster, Sch Econ, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, North Ireland.",VK.Borooah@ulster.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,2,3,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The author proposes a simple theoretical model for a nature-based destination, in which a tourist's willingness to pay (WTP) depends on the environmental quality of the place. He hypothesizes that, at some points in time, there is a rational economic incentive to experience a temporary decrease in frequentation in order to allow the stock of natural assets to regenerate. The author uses a sample of 80 seaside hotels in Corsica to show that tourists' WTP for a night stay depends positively on environmental quality. The results indicate that a deterioration of the environmental quality of the destination would reduce the WTP for a night stay in Corsica by more than 25%. This finding tends to confirm the paper's initial hypothesis since, if the environmental quality of Corsica falls, rational hotel owners should ask for a limited and temporary slowdown in frequentation so that the environmental quality and the WTP can regain a higher and more profitable level.","Univ Corsica, UMR CNRS LISA 6240, F-20250 Corte, Corse, France",,"Giannoni, S (通讯作者)，Univ Corsica, UMR CNRS LISA 6240, Ave Jean Nicoli,Campus Mariani, F-20250 Corte, Corse, France.",giannoni@univ-corse.fr,"Giannoni, Sauveur/AAO-7702-2020; Giannoni, Sauveur/HHZ-5683-2022","Giannoni, Sauveur/0000-0001-8565-8829;",,,,,19,0,0,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

But BMI representing obesity is a tightly specified function of weight and height, and there is a room for weight given height (i.e. obesity given height) to better explain wage when the tight specification gets relaxed. In this paper, we address the question of weight effect on wage given height, employing two-wave panel data for white females and adopting a semi-linear model consisting of a nonparametric function of weight and height and a linear function of the other regressors. We find that there is no weight effect on wage up to the average weight, beyond which a large negative effect kicks in. Linear BMI models give the incorrect impression of the presence of a 'wage gain' by becoming slimmer than the average and of a 'wage loss' that is less than what it actually is when going above the average.

When non-strict preferences are also allowed, a dictatorial social welfare function is defined as a function for which there exists a single voter whose strict preferences are followed. This definition allows for many different dictatorial functions, since non-strict preferences of the dictator are not necessarily followed. In particular, we construct examples of dictatorial functions which do not satisfy Transitivity and IIA. Thus Arrow's theorem, in the case of non-strict preferences, does not provide a complete characterization of all social welfare functions satisfying Transitivity, the Weak Pareto Principle, and IIA. The main results of this article provide such a characterization for Arrow's theorem, as well as for follow up results by Wilson. In particular, we strengthen Arrow's and Wilson's result by giving an exact if and only if condition for a function to satisfy Transitivity and IIA (and the Weak Pareto Principle).

Even though the United States is a relative newcomer to these narrower economic agreements, it has signed several different types with dozens of partner countries. These agreements, which often require partners to make costly policy changes, are nonetheless attractive because they provide preferential access to the US market and promise increased inward investment. In this paper, we compare the investment effects of three different types of agreements and find little evidence that existing international agreements (trade and investment framework agreements, bilateral investment treaties or preferential trade agreements) tend to increase investment from the United States.

In parallel there have been major research efforts aimed at developing modelling approaches for predicting the potential vulnerability of such networks, and in forecasting the future impact of any mitigating actions. In practice-whether monitoring the past or planning for the future-a confounding factor may arise, namely the potential for systematic growth in demand over a period of years. As this growth occurs the networks will operate in a regime closer to capacity, in which they are more sensitive to any variation in flow or capacity. Such growth will be partially an explanation for trends observed in historic data, and it will have an impact in forecasting too, where we can interpret this as implying that the networks are vulnerable to demand growth. This fact is not reflected in current vulnerability methods which focus almost exclusively on vulnerability to loss in capacity. In the paper, a simple, moment-based method is developed to separate out this effect of demand growth on the distribution of travel times on a network link, the aim being to develop a simple, tractable, analytic method for medium-term planning applications. Thus the impact of demand growth on the mean, variance and skewness in travel times may be isolated. For given critical changes in these summary measures, we are thus able to identify what (location-specific) level of demand growth would cause these critical values to be exceeded, and this level is referred to as Demand Growth Reliability Vulnerability (DGRV). Computing the DGRV index for each link of a network also allows the planner to identify the most vulnerable locations, in terms of their ability to accommodate growth in demand. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the principles and computation of the DGRV measure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Watling, David; Balijepalli, N.

We show that teams of coaches who follow the heuristic do not win significantly more often, and that coaches significantly decrease the number of changes in the starting line-up even after wins caused by the exogenous home field advantage.

Drawing on interviews with Indian call centre employees, the present study reveals how professionalism is understood by employees as an ideal that is binding on managers as much as on workers. Respondents draw on it to articulate grievances against managerial abuse, corruption, sycophancy and negligence, and to express their preference for so-called 'western' management practices to protect their rights and dignity in the workplace. This evidences a form of professionalism 'from below', fostering mobilization potential which unions seem to tap into.

The speed with which these post-colonial accessions took place, however, varied widely: some states joined immediately upon independence, while others joined much later. Still other post-colonial states passed on this opportunity, only to subsequently begin the longer, more onerous accession process required of other GATT/WTO applicants. Our paper seeks to explain this variation in the timing of post-colonial states' accession to the GATT/WTO. We argue that three key variables explain the timing of accession decisions: 1) a country's trade ties with existing member-states; 2) its existing preferential trade agreement (PTA) commitments; and 3) its domestic political institutions-specifically, the country's level of democracy. Furthermore, we argue that the effects of these variables are conditional upon each other: post-colonial countries with more extensive trade ties to existing member-states were more likely to accede rapidly under Article XXVI:5(c), but only under specific conditions-namely, when they had not already locked in ties with key trading partners through bilateral or regional PTAs, and when they were governed by a more democratic regime. We test this argument empirically using an original dataset of 61 post-colonial states from 1951 to 2004. Our results strongly support this explanation of GATT/WTO accession and help to clarify the pattern of participation in the multilateral trading system that we have observed over the last half-century.","[Copelovitch, Mark S.; Ohls, David] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Polit Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Copelovitch, Mark S.] Univ Wisconsin, Robert M La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Copelovitch, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Polit Sci, 306 North Hall,1050 Bascom Mall, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",copelovitch@wisc.edu; ohls@wisc.edu,,,,,,,73,19,24,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Model estimation with large numbers of alternatives remains computationally expensive. In the context of the multinomial logit (MNL) model, limiting the number of alternatives in estimation by simple random sampling (SRS) yields consistent parameter estimates, but estimator efficiency suffers. In the context of more general models, such as the mixed MNL, limiting the number of alternatives via SRS yields biased parameter estimates. In this paper, a new, strategic sampling scheme is introduced, which draws alternatives in proportion to updated choice-probability estimates. Since such probabilities are not known a priori, the first iteration uses SRS among all available alternatives. The sampling scheme is implemented here for a variety of simulated MNL and mixed-MNL data sets, with results suggesting that the new sampling scheme provides substantial efficiency benefits. Thanks to reductions in estimation error, parameter estimates are more accurate, on average. Moreover, in the mixed MNL case, where SRS produces biased estimates (due to violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property), the new sampling scheme appears to effectively eliminate such biases. Finally, it appears that only a single iteration of the new strategy (following the initialization step using SRS) is needed to deliver the strategy's maximum efficiency gains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This was sought to be done by estimating growth equations for a group of 19 states in India as well as sub-groups of these states during the period from 1981-1982 to 2004-2005. It has been found that, systematically, the contribution of educational attainment (social sector capital) to the growth process is larger than the contribution of physical capital. An important concern in the article is whether growth regressions estimated for a large group of 19 states can be replicated for smaller sub-groups. The problem of parameter heterogeneity is investigated, and the results of this study show that there is considerable parameter heterogeneity in the growth equations across groups. Rates of convergence estimated in this article also vary from extremely low levels (in the absence of the education variable) to more than 10% (in the presence of the education variable). The results of this study thus point to the great importance of education in improving the growth performance of Indian states.","[Karnik, Ajit] Middlesex Univ Dubai, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Lalvani, Mala] Univ Mumbai, Dept Econ, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",Middlesex University; University of Mumbai,"Karnik, A (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ Dubai, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",A.Karnik@mdx.ac; Mala.lalvani@gmail.com,"Karnik, Ajit/ABC-9627-2021","Karnik, Ajit/0000-0002-9817-9648",,,,,50,5,5,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The key benefit of our chosen methodology is that it allows a simultaneous consideration of both commuting and migration decisions.

There is a lack of research in comparing the performance of older and younger establishment of business incubators in different countries. Secondary data related to characteristics and performance of different incubators world-wide are collected and evaluated. These incubators are compared based on the number of graduate firms versus the number of existing client firms per year. Preliminary results indicate that older establishments in general may perform better than younger ones. This is probably due to the experience involved in managing these entities. However, this does not hold true in all cases. In fact, for some of the incubators compared in this study, younger incubators are doing relatively well compared to more established and older incubators This led to the preliminary conclusion that the length of an incubator, while important, may not be the determining factor on how such an entity will perform. It is speculated that the skills in managing these centers, along with proper mission, strategy, and planning are more critical in influencing the success of an incubator.","[AL-Mubaraki, Hanadi Mubarak] Kuwait Univ, Safat 13060, Kuwait; [Wong, Siew Fan] Sunway Univ Malaysia, Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Kuwait University; Sunway University,"AL-Mubaraki, HM (通讯作者)，Kuwait Univ, Safat 13060, Kuwait.",,,,,,,,13,1,1,1,2,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,221,+,,,,,,3,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600020,0

The industry underwent significant changes in the past twenty years primarily with regards to its ownership structure. The new owners do not pay enough money and attention on innovation yet relative to several other international agricultural machinery producers. Due to lack of development, the Hungarian producers have lost their former roles on the Hungarian market (too). A bit more than one-quarter (26-27 percent) of the current total domestic market turnover derives from domestic manufacturers. The extent of market loss and the general situation of the Hungarian agricultural machinery manufacturers justify that the present of this sector and within it he role of innovation must be dealt with by searching the ways-out of the crisis and make steps for development. The conclusions of our paper are based on the examination results of questionnaires and in-depth interviews that were carried out at 35 Hungarian agricultural machinery manufacturing companies. The characteristic features of the companies that were involved in the examination reflect the situation of the entire sector in Hungary properly. According to our experience and sources, the Hungarian conditions are also applicable and typical of the agricultural machinery production of the other ex-Socialist countries.

Furthermore, some of the indicators of the innovation performance of the companies are also presented.

While the authors clarify that this is relevant for yes/no decisions (such as whether to add insulation to a home), this argument has been widely cited even in investment decisions that involve a choice over multiple appliances or vehicles. In this note we consider how uncertainty and irreversibility would impact a consumer's decision about when to buy which new product. We show that, a priori, applying an option value framework is as likely to lead to slow diffusion of inefficient products as to slow diffusion of efficient products. This casts some doubt on the idea that an option value framework is the primary driver of the slow diffusion of energy efficient technologies.","Univ Massachusetts, Elab 220, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Baker, E (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Elab 220, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",edbaker@ecs.umass.edu,"Baker, Erin/R-7481-2019","Baker, Erin/0000-0002-4139-9930",,,,,24,9,10,1,21,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2012,33.0,4,,,,,49,59,,10.5547/01956574.33.4.3,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,012QL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309251500003,0

Commencing from the previous scientific knowledge related to cognitive learning as a complex mental process of forming opinions, attitudes, making decision for reacting either positively or negatively, etc, the main goal of this paper is to prove its impact on consumer behaviour. The field of research is the tourism business, while tourist consumers are the respondent sample (generally domestic) who have stayed in Ohrid. Through opinion polling of tourist consumers about the impact advertising has on the creation of their travel decision, directly, through their expressed judgment, a conclusion could be made about the importance of cognitive learning. The information obtained point out to the need of restructuring of advertising messages for reasons that the dominating factor for making a decision whether and where to travel lies in the consumer personality, in its structure to store knowledge and experience. The applied psychology finds scientifically founded methods and procedures on how to more reliably motivate and convince consumers to use products and services through cognitive learning. This paper makes a modest contribution not only in resolving the obstacles for attracting consumers in the tourism business, but to achieve higher credibility of suppliers as well.

The driving force is the negative demand externality imposed by the merging firms on the non-merging units in the same locations, which tends to counteract the increase in the composite price (or overall cost of shopping) in the locations with a merger. Since however some of the outsiders are harmed, we also consider how the possibility of a subsequent merger by the initially harmed outsiders may change the incentives for the first integration. Our results show that if the number of firms is sufficiently large, then the initial merger will still be carried through. It follows then that there would be a real need for regulation: market power and market interactions may provide firms with incentives to merge, just like efficiency gains do. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The most important finding is the impact of changes in the values on the surroundings. The basis for precedence analysis is the definition of system objects, elements and relationships. The system is then transformed into incidence matrices. Because of examining the changes that have occurred in the selected variables in a certain time interval, we analyze the mutual influence of the relative and absolute changes in the values of the selected element to the neighboring elements. Based on relative and absolute values of these changes, we can determine the increases or decreases directions of these variables in the system. Then we are able to examine antecedents (precedences), consequents (successions) and multiple precedences and successions. The problem in assessing the transport infrastructure is the choice of criteria and their weights to determine the significance of transport infrastructure in the region and the subsequent search of the significance of changes in the time interval. In this paper we deal with changes in road infrastructure, increase or decrease of highways, expressways and I, II., and III. class roads. The search of weights for these transport structures is also presented in the paper.","[Botlik, Josef; Botlikova, Milena] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Comp Sci, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Botlík, J (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Comp Sci, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",botlik@opf.slu.cz; botlikova@opf.slu.cz,"Botlíková, Milena/AAB-9477-2020; Botlík, Josef/Q-9340-2019","Botlík, Josef/0000-0002-8792-1325",,,,,7,3,3,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,43,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900008,0

Against 'technicist' models of productive reason, it defends a 'phronetic' model on both normative and pragmatic grounds. The discussion begins with a description of the general principles underpinning technicist theories of workplace organisation, principles which continue to inform work design approaches to this day. The technicist model is thereafter criticised on three counts: that it represents a specific managerial agenda which privileges sectional interests; that it is suspect morally for a number of reasons; and that despite its aspiration of arriving at 'one best method', it represents but one way of organising work processes. The phronetic model is then set out using the notion of 'practices' as a guide. This notion is important in providing a view of production in which technical reason is subsumed under a broader practical reason incorporating individual experience and judgement. Against the charge that this view is merely an instance of nostalgic craft romanticism having little relevance to present industrial realities, there are recognisable contemporary instances of phronetic production, one of the most interesting being Volvo's innovations in automotive assembly systems.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Studies & Philosophy, Belfast BT7 1PA, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Breen, K (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Studies & Philosophy, 21 Univ Sq, Belfast BT7 1PA, Antrim, North Ireland.",k.breen@qub.ac.uk,,,,,,,85,12,12,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Through a focus on the discursive elements of identity formation it will be argued that public projections of Russian-speaking identity are both a counter-reaction to, and a synthesis with, constructed 'Latvian', 'Russian' and 'European' identities and discourses. It will be shown that although Latvia's Russian-speaking identity is often constructed negatively, in opposition to the Latvian state and the Latvian 'Other', it is now increasingly premised upon an acceptance of various Latvian narratives and discourses which are enabling the emergence of a more positive Latvian-Russian identity.","Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Cheskin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, 8-9 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland.",a.cheskin.1@research.gla.ac.uk,"Cheskin, Ammon/AAB-3907-2020","Cheskin, Ammon/0000-0003-3765-3227",,,,,38,13,15,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,2,,,,,325,347,,10.1080/09668136.2011.642582,0.0,,,23,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,912DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301775700006,0

It is assumed that the owner of a family farm is an entrepreneur who manages the business venture. Many family farms use assets that are not registered on farm's asset list in production processes. In addition, family farms which produce more than one primary product do not know the economics of internal operations and the profitability of individual sorts, cultures and products. Is there a financial model that solves this problem? Do the owners of family farms consider the information about the internal economics of their business as important for further business decisions? This paper is based on a tested statistical sample of family farms in Vukovar-Syrmia County and proves that their knowledge level of crucial internal-economic information, which is necessary in successful decision making, is very poor.

Using a more expansive definition of the new international financial architecture, one that includes the institutional nexus of international monetary management along with the rules and regulatory bodies governing capital, this argument is developed through an analysis of the origins and functions of two institutions comprising the new international financial architecture - the Basel Capital Accord and the diffusion of inflation targeting regimes across central banks. This paper excavates the neoliberal logic inscribed in these institutions and further shows how these new forms of institutional logic contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 by putting in place a set of opportunities and constraints that led to rapid growth in the market for asset-backed securities. The implications of this analysis for the future of regulatory reform are discussed, with particular attention paid to the question of what role central banks should play in this process.","SUNY Albany, Dept Sociol, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Major, A (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Dept Sociol, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",,,,,,,,59,38,44,1,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The study of sustainable finance has become the attention of investors around the world, however, this study is to analyse whether this sector of investment (green companies) will interest investors.

At the same time, the variability of wind generation and the need for higher levels of reserve generating capacity to maintain reliability standards impose additional costs on the system that should not be ignored. The important implication for regulators is that the capacity payments [missing money] for each MW of peak system load are now much higher Hence, the economic benefits of reducing the peak system load using storage or controllable demand will be higher with high penetrations of wind generation. These potential benefits are illustrated in a case study using a test network and a security constrained Optimal Power Flow (OPF) with endogenous reserves (SuperOPF).

The role of organizations to do so is not neutral. Organizational systems are also in need of development for a sustainable future, just as technologies are. To enable a sustainable future, it requires organizations to consider learning systems, whereby adaptive organizational structures emerge to operationalize adapting sustainable technological developments. A general introduction to theoretical principles of a learning system meta-structure is the main aim of the paper. Adaptive environmental management and human resource management both contribute to sustainable development. The research is empirically based on the case study of the Malaysian electricity generation industry. The meta-structure that has emerged is driven by the need for life-enhancing creative co-evolution with the total (ecological, social, economic and cultural) environment of the organization. There are vertical and horizontal dimensions to this. The vertical dimension is concerned with strategic adaptability to balance the needs of the multiple stakeholders constituting the total environment. The horizontal dimension is the requirement for facilitation of innovative synergistic teams to achieve the continually adapting strategic goals of the organization in its co-evolutionary trajectory. A secondary aim of the paper is to cross reference the above generally accepted meta-structure for learning organizations, with the political science discipline's analysis of the roles of social capital and civil society, along with the recognition in postcolonial theory of the need for mutual acculturation to maintain and enhance healthy global cultural diversity in rejection of attempted forced assimilation into a global cultural hegemony. A key point here is that political science recognizes the need for loose coupling of semi-autonomous cultural grouping (social capital) both within organizations and those making up the total environment (civil society). Another key point is that social capital and civil society recursively nurture each other as a self-regulating learning system.","[Mustafa, Mazlina] Lincoln Univ, Lincoln, NE USA; [Morrison, Keith Donald] Inst Sustainable Commun Dev Res Ltd, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",,"Mustafa, M (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Lincoln, NE USA.",,,,,,,,62,0,0,0,10,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,919,+,,,,,,6,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600080,0

The trends in the international banking will be analyzed also from the perspective of the banking activities on Macedonian banks. Speaking of changes, there are two tendencies that can be determined in the international banking: 1) increased competition that influence on the banking products and pricing, 2) technology improvements that affects the distribution channels of selling and the operating cost on the banking activities. Increased competition and sharing the same target market along with other financial institutions affects the banks' market share and prices of their products. In developed economies there is a trend of suppression of banks from certain market segments and reducing their market share. This trend is mostly expressed in USA and is less pronounced in EU. Also rapid technology development and penetration of Internet in everyday life doesn't leave immune nor the banking sector. The technological improvements affect the banking industry through introduction of new products, increasing efficiency in terms of operating costs and developing new distribution channels. Banks are forced to adapt their products to a new generation that is coming and who grew up in the Internet Age. The biggest changes have been made in terms of payment methods by allowing transactions to be made 24 hours a day from anywhere. The development of technology also affects on the improvement of data bases which enable better assessment of credit risk to individual products and customers. Banks along with other financial institutions are joining in collecting and sharing of customer data that enables better assessment of the credit risk. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

What is less well known is that Viner's theological reading of Smith developed over the next 40 years through intense study of eighteenth century natural theology, and some of his views changed. This article traces the development of Viner's interpretation of Smith. It assesses the suggestion of D. D. Raphael that Smith moved away from a theological framework over time and that Viner repudiated his theological reading of Smith. I argue instead that Viner's mature work broadened and strengthened the theological reading. Much of the literature on Smith and Viner wrongly assumes that naturalistic explanation and theological frameworks are mutually exclusive. This may be the dominant twentieth century view, but it was not so in the eighteenth century, as Viner well understood.","Australian Catholic Univ, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2060, Australia",Australian Catholic University,"Oslington, P (通讯作者)，Australian Catholic Univ, Sch Business, Edward St, Sydney, NSW 2060, Australia.",paul.oslington@acu.edu.au,"oslington, paul/AAQ-2603-2021","oslington, paul/0000-0001-6819-3601",,,,,39,4,4,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

I demonstrate this flexible trend specification on a New Keynesian DSGE model of two economies, which I consequently estimate on the data of the Czech economy and Euro Area 12, using Bayesian techniques. The advantage of the proposed trend specification is that the trend component and the cyclical component are modeled jointly in one model and the model itself decides which part of the data belongs to the trend component and which part belongs to the cyclical component. The proposed trend specification is flexible in the sense that smoothness of the trend can be easily modified by different calibration of the trend parameters. Results suggest that this method is able to find very reasonable trend in the data. Moreover, according to the Bayes factor the proposed specification decisively outperforms the original specification of the model estimated on the demeaned log differences with the same number of shocks.","[Slanicay, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,slanicay@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,811,816,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900139,0

Using the currency indexes for a set of selected currencies, a given foreign currency assets can be managed as a dynamic portfolio of currency indexes. This paper proposes such a dynamic currency allocation model using the mean-variance kernel of the Markowitz portfolio theory on moving windows. The time length of the moving window and the frequency of currency allocation adjustment are two control parameters whose values can be determined via the distribution of the final rate of return. Test on historical foreign exchange market data turns out that this model really works in the sense that the total value of the initial capital has been preserved with a non-decreasing equity curve.

The present paper extends this idea beyond the conventional trade openness measures by analyzing the relationship between country size and the number of documents required to export and import, a measure of trade facilitation. Three important results follow. First, trade facilitation does improve as country size becomes smaller; that is, small countries perform better than large countries in terms of trade facilitation. Second, the relationship between country size and trade facilitation is nonlinear, much stronger for the relatively small than the large countries. Third, contrary to what existing studies might suggest, the relationship between country size and trade facilitation does not appear to be driven by the fact that small countries trade more as a proportion of their gross domestic product than the large countries.","[Amin, Mohammad] World Bank, Enterprise Anal Unit, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Haidar, Jamal Ibrahim] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",The World Bank; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics,"Haidar, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France.",mamin@worldbank.org; Jamal.Haidar@parisschoolofeconomics.eu,"wassie, mengistu/ABT-3222-2022","Haidar, Jamal/0000-0002-9975-9441",,,,,15,7,8,7,48,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Different parametric models have been proposed in the literature, each attempting to capture empirical characteristics and stylized facts of the electricity market like the spiky behavior of the spot prices. Although jump-diffusion and regime-switching models perform reasonably well, there is always a trade-off between model parsimony and adequacy. The results in the literature indicate that none of the models seem to consistently outperform its counterparts. This paper avoids making parametric assumption about the drift and the diffusion coefficient functions of the underlying electricity spot prices, and estimates these functions together with the market price of risk in a nonparametric way. The latter allows us to price futures contracts written on electricity spots. Using electricity spot prices and futures data from the regional electricity markets in Australia, we show that besides offering a convenient way of estimating the continuous-time models for electricity spot prices, our nonparametric estimation procedure performs well in-and out-of-sample when dealing with pricing of future contracts.","Univ New S Wales, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Ignatieva, K (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Australian Sch Business, Kensington Campus, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",k.ignatieva@unsw.edu.au,"Ignatieva, Katja/W-8813-2019","Ignatieva, Katja/0000-0001-7472-5475",,,,,48,2,3,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

During the EU programming period 2007-2013, Aragon received agricultural subsidies worth 4,055 million Euros. These grants are received by farmers and then redistributed through their spending towards other institutional sectors. CAP funds carry in Aragon an average annual GDP growth of 2.6 % or an average annual increase of agricultural GVA by 19.6% among other results. This analysis is important because CAP is changing and resources for this EU policy are expected to be reduced. In February 2013, the European Council approved the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 in which the overall EU budget decreases, is redistributed and clearly restricts allocations for agricultural policies.","[Perez y Perez, Luis] Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon, Zaragoza, Spain; [Monrobel Alcantara, Jose Ramon; Medina Lopez, Ana] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Pérez, LPY (通讯作者)，Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon, Zaragoza, Spain.",,"Medina, Ana/F-6200-2016; Monrobel, Jose Ramón/F-7850-2016; Perez y Perez, Luis/Q-9343-2018","Medina, Ana/0000-0003-1956-1839; Monrobel, Jose Ramón/0000-0002-1805-4213; Perez y Perez, Luis/0000-0001-8362-000X",,,,,15,2,2,0,4,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2014,13.0,4,,,,,30,38,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CD5HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351118700004,0

Having defined a model in which the actual set of alternatives becomes known only after a vote has been taken, we characterize approval voting as the only voting procedure (to be precise, family of ballot aggregation functions) that satisfies faithfulness (F), consistency (C), stability on selected alternatives (SSA), and independence of dropped alternatives (IDA). SSA, which is a version of the property introduced by Arrow (Economica 16:121-127, 1959), states that if the actual set of alternatives is smaller than the original set, we should select those alternatives, if any, that would have been selected on the first vote and that are still feasible. On the other hand, IDA suggests that we should select alternatives based on the outcome of the second vote. Therefore, given F and C, approval voting is the only voting procedure that selects the same set of alternatives irrespective of which vote counts, that is, the first or second vote.","Nagoya Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Atsuta Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4568612, Japan",,"Sato, N (通讯作者)，Nagoya Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Atsuta Ku, 1-25 Atsuta Nishimachi, Nagoya, Aichi 4568612, Japan.",nrsato@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,6,6,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,DEC,2014,43.0,4,,,,,809,825,,10.1007/s00355-014-0811-1,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AU0UC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345339100002,0

We also carry out a comparative analysis across four US states. We find that on average US consumers are more sensitive to fuel cost reductions and alternative fuel station availability than are Japanese consumers. With regard to the comparative analysis across the four US states, consumers' WTP for a fuel cost reduction in California is considerably greater than in the other three states. We use the estimates obtained in the discrete choice analysis to examine the EV/PHEV market shares under several scenarios. In a base case scenario with relatively realistic attribute levels, conventional gasoline vehicles still dominate both in the US and Japan. However, in an innovation scenario with a significant purchase price reduction, we observe a high penetration of alternative fuel vehicles both in the US and Japan. We illustrate the potential use of a discrete choice analysis for forward-looking policy analysis, with the future opportunity to compare its predictions against actual revealed choices. In this case, increased purchase price subsidies are likely to have a significant impact on the market shares of alternative fuel vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The study provides evidence that tourism market potential and agglomeration density are statistically significant and quantitatively important in explaining the revenue of tourism firms. This finding is robust, controlling for input factor density and endogeneity using instrument variables. Tourism market potential is found to matter through the mechanisms promoted by new economic geography theory.

However, there is little empirical evidence supporting BRT's potential to meet these objectives. This research improves our knowledge of BRT's potential as an alternative to vehicle ownership at the household level and provides new evidence of the role of urban form in supporting transit investment. We use a difference-in-differences research design to examine the change in vehicle ownership from before to after implementation of Bogota, Colombia's TransMilenio BRT system. Our results indicate access to TransMilenio's main trunk system is significantly and negatively associated with vehicle ownership for higher wealth households. Among lower wealth households, access to the trunk system and the complementary feeder system (designed to bring passengers from peripheral neighborhoods into the main trunk system) are both associated with an unexpected increase in the odds of vehicle ownership; however, that increase appears to be reversed in neighborhoods where the built environment supports transit and non-motorized travel. This research contributes a methodology for joint analysis of urban form and transit availability on vehicle ownership, and demonstrates that urban form and transit access can have a synergistic effect. Neglecting this synergy would be a missed opportunity to further leverage the benefits of BRT investments. Our findings also suggest that, in the case of Bogota, the vehicle ownership impacts of BRT investment may not accrue to lower income households unless that investment is coordinated with policies to promote supportive urban form.

Using panel data on China's 30 provinces over the period 1987 2010, this study examines the direct and indirect effects of tourism on long-term economic growth. Four transmission channels widely held in the resource curse hypothesis are applied in the tourism industry: Dutch disease effect, crowding-out effect, deterioration of institutional quality and volatility of resource trade. The empirical results show that even in the non-tourism-dependent economies there is a possibility that the tourism resource curse will occur in the long term. Tourism resource development tends to reduce economic growth, mainly through crowding out human capital. A tourism boom seems to have a crowding-out effect on industrial production; however, the effect is small and insignificant in the large non-tourism-dependent economies. The physical investment channel is identified as the most important positive transmission channel through which tourism activity exerts more influence on growth.","[Deng, Taotao; Cao, Jianhua] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Ma, Mulan] Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Tourism & Event Management, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of International Business & Economics,"Ma, ML (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Tourism & Event Management, 1900 Wenxiang Rd, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",fly-mulan@hotmail.com,,"Deng, Taotao/0000-0002-7380-6000",,,,,34,39,41,10,111,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We further find that the utilization of optimal reservation rules is independent from the stochastic nature of the search cost.","[Di Cagno, Daniela] LUISS Guido Carli Rome, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy; [Neugebauer, Tibor] Univ Luxembourg, LSF, L-1246 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Neugebauer, Tibor] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, UJI Castellon, Lab Expt Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Neugebauer, Tibor] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, EBEL, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Rodriguez-Palmero, Carlos] Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Econ, Valladolid, Spain; [Sadrieh, Abdolkarim] Univ Magdeburg, Dept Econ, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany",Luiss Guido Carli University; University of Luxembourg; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Universidad de Valladolid; Otto von Guericke University,"Neugebauer, T (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, LSF, 4 Rue Albert Borschette, L-1246 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",tibor.neugebauer@uni.lu,"R.

To maintain incentive compatibility, banks lend below the amount that firms need for optimal production. The longer time needed for export shipments induces a tighter credit constraint on exporters than on purely domestic firms. In our application to Chinese firms, we find that the credit constraint is more stringent as a firm's export share grows, as the time to ship for exports is lengthened, and as there is greater dispersion of firms' productivities, reflecting more incomplete information.","[Feenstra, Robert C.] Univ Calif Davis, Sacramento, CA 95820 USA; [Feenstra, Robert C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Li, Zhiyuan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhiyuan] Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yu, Miaojie] Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Peking University,"Feenstra, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Sacramento, CA 95820 USA.",,"Yu, Miao/HRC-0342-2023",,,,,,36,280,327,23,179,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In response to this barrier, state and federal government have implemented many programs that provide down payment assistance to potential home buyers. Numerous studies have shown that this assistance can increase homeownership rates, but few have measured how receiving assistance may alter borrowing behavior. Using data from a down payment assistance grant in the Midwest, this study compares the loan type and size of grant recipients to other borrowers that report similar income and buy homes in the same census tract. Results indicate grant recipients are more likely to use conventional loans, which are less expensive than other loan types that require a smaller down payment. Estimates also suggest that the grant may reduce loan size for borrowers who are on the margin of using a conventional loan.","[Lang, Bree J.; Hurst, Ellen H.] Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, Cincinnati, OH 45207 USA",University System of Ohio; Xavier University,"Lang, BJ (通讯作者)，Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, 3800 Victory Pkwy, Cincinnati, OH 45207 USA.",langb1@xavier.edu; hurste@xavier.edu,,"Lang, Bree/0000-0001-7436-8623",,,,,24,4,8,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We investigate if there is a risky choice theory that fits group decisions better than alternative theories, and if there are significant differences between individual and group choices. Experimental findings reported in this paper provide answers to both of those questions showing that expected utility gains a winning position over higher-level functionals (we considered disappoint aversion and two variants of rank-dependent utility) when risky choices are undertaken by individuals as well as by small groups. However, in the group experiment, alternatives (and, most notably, disappoint aversion) improve their relative performance, a fact that hints at the existence of differences between individual and group choices. We interpreted this result as evidence that feelings-like disappointment aversion become stronger in group decision.","[Morone, A.] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Studi Aziendali & Giusprivatist, Bari, Italy; [Morone, A.] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Morone, P.] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Law Philosophy & Econ Studies, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Universitat Jaume I; Sapienza University Rome,"Morone, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Studi Aziendali & Giusprivatist, Bari, Italy.",a.morone@gmail.com; piergiuseppe.morone@uniroma1.it,,"Morone, Piergiuseppe/0000-0002-3240-7089",,,,,35,5,5,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2014,77.0,3,,,SI,,403,422,,10.1007/s11238-014-9431-6,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AO8VB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341632000010,0

For platforms in the western Gulf of Mexico, extraction yields damage due to air pollution that average between $0.31 and $0.75 per unit of oil extracted. For platforms in the central Gulf of Mexico, damage due to air pollution averages between $0.26 and $0.57 per unit of oil extracted. The distribution of marginal social costs is right-skewed; the paper finds that in 2008 115 platforms produce damages in excess of $12.80 per barrel of oil.

They become blurred and weak once better estimates of the standard errors are obtained and the development of wages is investigated at a finer time grid. Furthermore, Arent and Nagl's reform effects shrink considerably when a more appropriate price index is used to deflate the wages and when the censoring of wages is treated correctly.

Trajectories are captured by combining partnership, employment and motherhood over a 20-year span (from the age of 16 to the age of 35). Using Optimal Matching Analysis, four different patterns in female trajectories are identified: (1) early marriage/non-working mother/high fertility; (2) late marriage/working mother/low fertility; (3) early marriage/working mother/high fertility; and (4) late marriage/low participation/low fertility. A multinomial probit model contrasts whether or not the patterns found are compatible with the human capital approach to female labour market participation and fertility and/or Hakim's preference theory. Results show that both theoretical frameworks partly explain the observed trajectories although neither of them, not even both together, suffices to determine female employment and family careers.","[Davia, Maria A.; Legazpe, Nuria] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Albacete 02071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Davia, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Edificio Melchor Macanaz,Plaza Univ,S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain.",mangeles.davia@uclm.es,"Davia, Maria A/Q-8045-2017; Davia, Maria A./AAA-1722-2022; Legazpe Moraleja, Nuria/C-8079-2016","Davia, Maria A./0000-0001-9551-6111; Legazpe Moraleja, Nuria/0000-0002-2161-3768",,,,,49,16,16,0,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Empirical evidence tends to show small differences in performance between the two approaches, with the implied preference between the models being dataset specific. In the present paper, we discuss how in the context of choice tasks involving an opt out alternative, the differences are potentially more clear cut. Specifically, we hypothesise that when opt out alternatives are framed as a rejection of all the available alternatives, this is likely to have a detrimental impact on the performance of RRM, while the performance of RUM suffers more than RRM when the opt out is framed as a respondent being indifferent between the alternatives on offer. We provide empirical support for these hypotheses through two case studies, using the two different types of opt out alternatives.

This has consequences for the practical applicability of these models in studies on, for instance, timetabling, train capacity management strategies, project appraisal, and passenger satisfaction. Here we propose four methods to include the effect of crowding, based on existing studies on passengers' perception and response as well as often-used crowding indicators. These four alternative methods are implemented in the train passenger assignment procedure of the Dutch national transport model, and evaluated with respect to their impacts on the model results for the Dutch railway network. The four methods relate to four different ways in which an additive trip penalty and/or time-multiplier can be incorporated in the train utility function for different travel purposes, to capture the disutility of crowding as measured by the load factor. The analyses of the test case favor the hybrid method using both a boarding penalty (capturing seat availability upon boarding) and a time-multiplier (capturing physical comfort and safety throughout the trip). This method produces consistent results, while the additional computational effort that it imposes is acceptable. Further empirical underpinning is needed to conclusively show which of these methods best captures passengers' response behavior quantitatively (for different travel purposes and conditions).

In fact, REIT returns would display regime shifts that are more abrupt and persistent than in the case of other asset classes. In this paper we ask whether and how simple linear predictability models of the vector autoregressive (VAR) type may be extended to capture the bull and bear patterns typical of many asset classes, including REITs. We find that nonlinearities are so deep that it is impossibile for a large family of VAR models to either produce similar portfolio weights or to yield realized, ex-post out-of-sample long-horizon portfolio performances that may compete with those typical of bull and bear models. A typical investor with intermediate risk aversion and a 5-year horizon ought to be ready to pay an annual fee of up to 5.7 % to have access to forecasts of REIT returns that take their bull and bear dynamics into account instead of simpler, linear forecast.","[Bianchi, Daniele; Guidolin, Massimo] Bocconi Univ, Dept Finance, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Guidolin, Massimo] Bocconi Univ, IGIER, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Guidolin, M (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Finance, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",daniele.bianchi@unibocconi.it; massimo.guidolin@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,59,10,11,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

J,"Kent, JL",,,,"Kent, Jennifer L.",,,Driving to save time or saving time to drive? The enduring appeal of the private car,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Automobility; Cycling; Public transport; Car use; Time; Sydney,PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS; ONTOLOGICAL SECURITY; TRAVEL-TIME; AUTOMOBILITY; MOBILITY; WORK; MODE; EXPERIENCE; TRANSPORT; BICYCLE,"Use of the private car is often viewed as highly problematic. It is regularly associated with global physical, social and ecological harms such as climate change and the high incidence of lifestyle diseases, including heart disease. Attempts to address these problems generally include provision for day-to-day physical mobility based on alternatives to the private car. Labelled alternative transport, these modes include public transport, walking and cycling. Yet the private car continues as the preferred way to travel in many cities. A deeper understanding of this preference can reveal under explored sites of resistance to alternative transport modes. This paper contributes to these understandings by examining the role the car as a time saving device plays in sustaining automobility. Its central proposition is that individual decisions to drive are not necessarily motivated by the desire to save time. The paper draws on empirical evidence on the journey to work in Australia's largest city, Sydney. Using a systematic process of trip substitution analysis, a group of people were identified who could use alternative transport to get to work in the same amount of time it currently takes them to drive. These people then participated in a series of in-depth interviews where deeper attachments and motivations for private car use were explored. This approach has enabled development of the multi-layered understanding that informs the central proposition that individual decisions to drive are not necessarily motivated by the desire to save time. Instead, automobility is sustained by appeals to flexibility and autonomy, as well as the interminable pull of the sensory experience provided by the cocoon of the car. This way of thinking about resistance to alternative transport exposes a series of inconsistencies between the expectations of those planning for, and those anticipated to one day use, alternative transport.

PeT effects are more individualized than conditional treatment effects from a randomized setting with the same observed characteristics. PeT effects can be easily aggregated to construct any of the mean treatment effect parameters and, more importantly, are well suited to comprehend individual-level treatment effect heterogeneity.

Ironically, in the same cases, the welfare of many group members would be negatively related to the size of their individual stake.","[Nitzan, Shmuel] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Ueda, Kaoru] Nanzan Univ, Fac Econ, Nagoya, Aichi 4668673, Japan",Bar Ilan University,"Nitzan, S (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",nitzans@mail.biu.ac.il; k-ueda@nanzan-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,25,16,21,2,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2014,43.0,1,,,,,219,238,,10.1007/s00355-013-0762-y,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AI7RS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337094300012,0

Strategic manipulation refers here to the possibility that a team may lose a match on purpose in order to increase its prospects of winning the competition. In particular, the paper looks at round-robin tournaments where both first- and second-ranked players proceed to the next round. This standard format used in many sports gives rise to the possibility of strategic manipulation, as exhibited recently in the 2012 Olympic games. An impossibility theorem is proved which demonstrates that under a number of reasonable side-constraints, strategy-proofness is impossible to obtain.","Univ Groningen, Fac Philosophy, NL-9712 GL Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Pauly, M (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Philosophy, Oude Boteringestr 52, NL-9712 GL Groningen, Netherlands.",m.pauly@rug.nl,,"Pauly, Marc/0000-0001-6289-9929",,,,,17,22,26,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2014,43.0,1,,,,,29,46,,10.1007/s00355-013-0767-6,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AI7RS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337094300003,0

By synthesising an empirically driven case study with conceptual insights from the existing literature, I highlight three intervening variables that enabled the Legislative Mandates passed by the US Congress in 2009 on the use of social-spending targets (education and health expenditure ring fences) in IMF concessional lending to be rapidly translated into operational change. The intervening variables that stood between US domestic action and rapid operational change are: first, the existence of effective enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance from the US Executive Director with the Mandate; second, preference congruence between other primary principals and the content of the Mandate, and; third, the existence of effective enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance from IMF staff with the principals' collectively-sanctioned goal. The outcome observed - the near universal incorporation of social-spending targets into concessional lending arrangements - adds credence to calls for further empirical work to assess the extent of a post-Washington Consensus transition at the IMF.","Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Clegg, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,93,14,14,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It has been established to enable the EU to achieve its external and internal policy objectives and further its interests. This article argues that recent criticism of the EU's regulatory approach in the literature and the press is exaggerated. It explains why the EU has avoided a 'pillar'-based legislative approach to regulating classified information based on policy domains, and forged a broad degree of convergence across EU institutions and Member States on a pragmatic approach largely based on internal rules.

(in press). For a wide range of parameter values for social interactions, this model has a unique equilibrium and is not subject to multiple equilibria and other model coherency related issues for discrete choice models. I specify peer reference group based on actual friendship networks. The data are from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). A school fixed effect strategy is employed to control for the confounding effects. Two ways of calculating marginal effects are evaluated. Robustness analysis is performed with regard to several alternative spatial weights matrices. I find that both endogenous and contextual effects exist in all the activities considered, even after controlling for school fixed effects. Similar to the case of continuous variables, the results are robust to several alternative specifications of the weighting matrix based on friend heterogeneity, providing justification for the common practice of assigning equal weight among friends. The changes in the results under the friendship reciprocity assumption indicate the relevance of the real friendship nomination network. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The central hypothesis is that the development of the nonagricultural economy in the Northern cities drove the location of agricultural output and inputs during the interwar years. A new database on Italian agriculture around 1930 fully confirms the key role of access to domestic markets in shaping agricultural activity. Thus, the causes of Southern agriculture falling behind are revealed: it is not very surprising that an agricultural divergence joined an already ongoing industrial divergence during a period in which international markets collapsed. It was the growth of Northern industry that led to the growth of Northern agriculture, and not vice versa.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Social Sci, Madrid 28903, Spain",,"Martinelli, P (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Social Sci, C Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain.",pablo.martinelli@uc3m.es,"Martinelli Lasheras, Pablo/HJG-7802-2022","Martinelli Lasheras, Pablo/0000-0003-3529-4654",,,,,48,5,7,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

In addition, they assess the impact of several job characteristics (business size, full-time contracts and permanent contracts) and personal characteristics (gender and worker nationality) on wages. Using an expanded Mincerian wage equation and data from the 2006 Spanish Wage Structure Survey, they estimate separate regressions for each educational group analysed: overeducated, undereducated and adequately educated workers. The results show that the return on human capital and the real hourly wage may be quantitatively influenced by educational mismatch. Moreover, evidence is presented regarding the impact of firm size on wage returns and the data also reveal wage differentials by the gender and nationality of workers in the Spanish hospitality industry.","[Garcia-Pozo, Alejandro; Luis Sanchez-Ollero, Jose; Marchante-Mera, Andres] Univ Malaga, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Appl Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Sánchez-Ollero, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Appl Econ, Plaza El Ejido S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",jlsanchez@uma.es,"Pozo, Alejandro García/F-1426-2015; García-Pozo, Alejandro/AFR-2199-2022; SÁNCHEZ-OLLERO, JOSE LUIS/Q-3519-2019","Pozo, Alejandro García/0000-0002-4609-2495; García-Pozo, Alejandro/0000-0002-4609-2495; SÁNCHEZ-OLLERO, JOSE LUIS/0000-0003-0834-8493",,,,,55,14,14,0,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

A simple theoretical model is introduced to highlight a negative relationship between the wealth effect and risk aversion. The paper empirically tests for this negative relationship, using data from the U. S. Consumer Expenditure Survey. The investigation involves two steps. In the first step, we make use of households' demographics and their risky and liquid asset holdings to estimate risk aversion. The Heckman correction model is applied to address the issue of limited stock market participation. For the second step, we construct pseudo panel data through grouping households by their birth years and their predicted values of risk aversion, and then, we estimate the responses of households' consumption changes to house price fluctuations by risk-attitude group. Consistent with the prediction of the theoretical model, the estimation results suggest a significant negative relationship between the housing wealth effect and households' risk attitudes. Households, who are less risk averse, experience greater consumption changes in response to house price appreciation.","[Liao, Wen-Chi; Sing, Tien Foo] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Liao, Wen-Chi; Sing, Tien Foo] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Zhao, Daxuan] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore 119613, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Liao, WC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",wliao@nus.edu.sg; zhaodaxuan@gmail.com; rststf@nus.edu.sg,"Liao, Wen-Chi/K-1559-2013; Sing, Tien Foo/J-9381-2013","Liao, Wen-Chi/0000-0002-5672-2016; Sing, Tien Foo/0000-0002-4101-851X; Zhao, Daxuan/0000-0002-9542-779X",,,,,34,9,11,1,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Postintervention, I find a significant reduction in postneonatal mortality in the malarious regions relative to the nonmalarious regions. In contrast, I find no evidence of an impact on neonatal mortality, which is consistent with epidemiological literature that finds neonates enjoy significant protection from malaria. I rule out alternative explanations such as differential preexisting trends, changes in maternal and infant care, or the contemporaneous expansion of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.

The article suggests that, following their accession, Poland, and later the Czech Republic, used the Charter and Lisbon Treaty negotiations, including their opt-outs from the Charter, to engage in a game of power politics that had both domestic and European undertones. This politics of power game-play reflected a need by both states, and Poland in particular, to respond to both the political conditionality that they had been required to sign up to as part of the accession process and to emphasise how membership had improved their negotiating power. The article suggests that the consequence of this action by both states has not only further devalued the Charter but potentially undermined the rights of Polish and Czech citizens.","Univ Cent Lancashire, Lancashire Law Sch, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire,"Puchalska, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Lancashire, Lancashire Law Sch, Harris Bldg, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England.",bapuchalska@uclan.ac.uk,,,,,,,53,2,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,MAR 16,2014,66.0,3,,,SI,,488,506,,10.1080/09668136.2013.855019,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AE4KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333950100008,0

Current explanations of this paradigm shift emphasize the agency of transnational advocacy networks, but ignore the role of academics. Scholars interested in global IP politics have failed to engage in reflexive thinking. Building on the results from a survey of 1679 IP experts, this article argues that a community of academics successfully broke the policy monopoly of practitioners over IP expertise. They instilled some scepticism concerning the social and economic impacts of IP among their students as well as in the broader community of IP experts. They also provided expert knowledge that was widely amplified by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and some intergovernmental organizations, acting as echo chambers to reach national decision makers. By making these claims, this article illustrates how epistemic communities actively collaborate with other transnational networks, rather than competing with them, and how they can promote a paradigm change by generating, rather than reducing, uncertainty.","Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Polit Sci, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Morin, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Polit Sci, Brussels, Belgium.",,"Morin, Jean Frederic/AAF-4645-2020; Morin, Jean-Frederic/K-2341-2013","Morin, Jean-Frederic/0000-0003-1053-5597",,,,,73,26,29,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Recentered Influence Function (RIF) regressions are used to decompose the contribution of education to the changing distribution of Body Mass Index (BMI) in France, between 1981 and 2003, into a composition effect (the shift in population education due to a massive educational expansion), and a structure effect (a changing educational gradient in BMI). Educational expansion has reduced overall BMI inequality by 3.4% for women and 2.3% for men. However, the structure effect on its own has produced a 10.9% increase in overall inequality for women, due to a steeper education gradient starting from the second quartile of the distribution. This structure effect on overall inequality is also large (7.6%) for men, albeit insignificant as it remains concentrated in the last decile. Educational expansion policies can thus reduce overall BMI inequalities; but attention must still be paid to the BMI gradient in education even for policies addressing overall rather than socioeconomic health inequalities.

The research covers two periods: one of economic upturn and one of economic downturn, and uses a rich employer-employee dataset. Results show that experiencing a plant closure in a recession has more severe individual repercussions than experiencing a plant closure in an expanding economy, particularly for immigrants. In good times, the long-term effects of plant closure are very small for both immigrants and natives, while in a recession, effects are more severe for immigrants, possibly leading to lasting scars for this group. These results appear robust using both matching techniques and fixed-effect models.","[Hardoy, Ines; Schone, Pal] Inst Social Res, N-0208 Oslo, Norway",,"Schone, P (通讯作者)，Inst Social Res, PB 3233, N-0208 Oslo, Norway.",iha@samfunnsforskning.no; psc@samfunnsforskning.no,,,,,,,29,3,3,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The authors demonstrate how regime responses to these dilemmas - typically efforts to maintain control while avoiding outright repression and societal backlash - have negative outcomes, including a weakening of formal institutions, proliferation of substitutions (e.g., substitutes for institutions), and increasing centralization and personalization of control. Efforts by Russian leaders to disengage society from the sphere of decision-making entail a significant risk of systemic breakdown in unexpected ways. More specifically, given significantly weakened institutions for interest representation and negotiated compromise, policy-making in the Russian system often amounts to the leadership's best guess (ad hoc manual policy adjustments) as to precisely what society will accept and what it will not, with a significant possibility of miscalculation. Three case studies of the policy-making process are presented: the 2005 cash-for-benefits reform, plans for the development of the Khimki Forest, and changes leading up to and following major public protests in 2011-2012.","[Petrov, Nikolay] Higher Sch Econ, Dept Polit Sci, Moscow, Russia; [Lipman, Maria] Carnegie Moscow Ctr, Soc Program, Moscow, Russia; [Hale, Henry E.] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); George Washington University,"Hale, HE (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",hhale@email.gwu.edu,,,,,,,55,117,130,2,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The realization of principles of socially oriented economics promotes a progress of society and of an individual in theoretical and methodological context in terms of globalization and post-industrialization. Achieving these targets requires the realization of corresponding socio-economic state policy in practice. The development of human potential, preservation of national and cultural identity and providing state social guaranties should become the basis of this policy. Postindustrial challenges and demographical problems have caused the crisis of traditional state of common welfare and set a task of forming the postindustrial state.

A key component in the model is the infinite number of users in the network, all of whom have common knowledge about the distribution of preferences in the population. In this setting, the congestion level is endogenously determined in the equilibrium of a game with a continuum of players. For the estimate, we use the first-order conditions of the users' utility maximization problem to derive the likelihood function. For inference, we apply a two-step, semi-parametric method. Using data from Santiago, Chile, we show that the estimated parameters confirm the effect of congestion on individuals' preferences and that demand elasticities obtained by using our framework are consistent with results reported in the literature. We use the model to evaluate the effect on the welfare of increasing the cost of car trips and implementing a second-best fare schedule for bus transit.

Cultural contents of a tourist destination, as a motive for tourist travels, encompass specific elements representing a reflection of culture of a nation, consisting of culturohistorical monuments, archeological sites, cultural institutions, cultural manifestations and various anthropogenic factors inciting a motivation for an acquaintance with the customs, tradition, popular art, traditional crafts and trades, gastronomy and other cultural characteristics of a region. The recognition of cultural contents as tourist motives centralizes an issue of structuralization of cultural offer and its adjustment to an overall tourism offer of a receptive area, and thereby also the issue of promotion of cultural tourism as a specialized tourism form, which should satisfy a cultural tourists' need for an active vacation through versatile forms of selective offer and through an enrichment of knowledge and cultural experiences.

The results of an analysis of culturohistorical resources of the City of Orahovica direct toward a conclusion that the authenticity of destinations based on a culturohistorical heritage of the City of Orahovica represents a solid tourist attraction basis, whereby a tourist valorization of culturohistorical artefacts and localities should be based upon a sustainable management of cultural resources as the realistic or potential cultural attractions and an efficacious coordination of all the factors comprising a cultural offer spectrum of the City of Orahovica as a cultural tourist destination.","[Bedekovic, Vesna] Coll Management Tourism & Informat Virovitica, Virovitica 33000, Croatia",,"Bedekovic, V (通讯作者)，Coll Management Tourism & Informat Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia.",vesna.bedekovic@vsmti.hr; zeljka.hajba20@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,522,530,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600051,0

This concept describes all the influences that affect the institutional processes, including those of the appointment of auditors or regulators, involved in the organization of production and sale of goods and services (Turnbull, 1997). We will approach the issue of corporate strategy versus corporate governance as a way of organization's efficient resource management. We consider that organizations should adhere to corporate governance concepts, principles, standards and regulations, in order to be assessed and to achieve expected relevant policies and performance, given that corporate governance codes and policies became a balance between compliance and performance. Due to globalization of business, their owners become increasingly distant from their management. In most cases, the owners of large business can not be personally involved in the management of their business. Reasons may vary: business expansion beyond traditional borders; the rapidly evolving technologies and the business' increasing complexity; the necessary technical knowledge required to ensure efficient governance; the inability to simultaneously know and assimilate local features of the environment in which the business functions. There is not a single model of corporate governance. The extent to which companies respect the principles of corporate governance becomes an increasingly important factor in the decision-making process concerning investment. The relationship between corporate governance practices and the increasingly international character of investment becomes highly relevant. The well-managed listed companies with strong corporate governance structures, with adequate social and environmental programs, are more successful on the market than their competitors; institutional investors being willing according to a 2013 PWC report to pay with over 16% more for their shares in the developed markets and over 27-28% in the emergent countries.","[Boghean, Florin; Boghean, Carmen; Ciubotariu, Marius] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Boghean, F (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,661,669,,,,,,9,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800082,0

However the potential for mistargeting of program funds is high. This article focuses on the social consequences arising from misallocation of resources in close-knit communities. We find that the mistargeting of a cash transfer program in Indonesia had significant negative social consequences. The prevalence of crime within communities increased and participation in community groups declined. Hence poorly administered transfer programs have a potentially large negative downside that extends beyond the pure financial costs that have been the focus of the literature to date.,"[Cameron, Lisa] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Cameron, Lisa] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Shah, Manisha] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Shah, Manisha] NBER, Cambridge, MA USA",Monash University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cameron, L (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",lisa.cameron@monash.edu; ManishaShah@ucla.edu,"Cameron, Lisa/HNI-6455-2023","Cameron, Lisa/0000-0002-7539-2198",,,,,31,28,37,0,22,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

Mayo, from the homonymous play by Robert E. Sherwood. The movie is somehow atypical if compared to the classic gangster movie, because of it's disillusioned and fatalist atmosphere, which foreshadows the noir genre. The moral skid of the two main male characters-interpreted by Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart-skillfully represents, apparently in opposite, but in reality specular ways, the American mood during the Great Depression. Furthermore, the metaphorical setting of a saloon in the middle of nowhere, nearby the Petrified Forest of the desert of Arizona (where, due to a sand storm, both the gang of outlaws led by Duke Mantee-Bogart-and its hostages are held, with the errant poet played by Howard and the daughter of the owners of the saloon, interpreted by Bette Davis, among the latter), together with the dialogues from Sherwood's play, constantly refer to a 'petrified' America, deprived of its values.","Univ Turin, Dipartimento Studi Umanist, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Carluccio, G (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Studi Umanist, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",giulia.carluccio@unito.it,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

These endeavours have been outstandingly successful, as can be seen from increased vegetable production and income generation as well as enhanced nutrition in urban households. In view of these results, this paper recognizes the emerging and crucial role that enterprises producing and marketing indigenous vegetables could play in addressing poverty and hunger in the area studied. The paper also identifies various potentials, opportunities and challenges associated with such enterprises and recommends a policy agenda which should be set up to optimize them: 1) seek to promote the systematic and strategic improvement of indigenous vegetable species through research and development studies; 2) establish urban land use legislation that will control use of available land resources in urban area for farming; 3) ensure and promote environmental sanitation and sustainability; 4) seek to protect public health.","[Ekwe, K.

Various EU documents, such as ESSnet Culture (2012), Eurostat (2011) and DZS (2013), define nomenclature categories of various components of this sector, hence publishing sector as well. The Glagolitic script, as well as Glagolitic tradition, is a Croatian cultural phenomenon unique for its linguistic, graphic, ethnological, anthropological and semiotic characteristics (Lukic and Horvat, 2013). What differentiates Glagolitic from other scripts is the fact that its creator is known (St. Ciril Constantine), as well as its mission (promoting Christianity) and vision (simultaneous acceptance of both script and faith). It is the only script which justified its regional, global and economic purpose already in the 9th century. These and other unique characteristics of the Glagolitic script are prerequisites of economic expedience as well as may be utilised for the exploitation of the Glagolitic script and tradition in various components of creative industries. From the standpoint of a cultural property, Glagolitic tradition and monuments testifying to its existence potentially generate those components of creative industries which have been, through cultural and religious tourism, oriented towards the consumption of existing cultural properties (seeing museums, churches, exhibitions, breviaries, etc.). Besides tourist connection, Glagolitic artefacts contain economic gain reflected in the production of new cultural properties inspired by original, authentic Glagolitic artefacts (the business concept of the brand Croata, boutique Mara, novel AZ, etc.). This paper aims at researching the economic expedience of the Glagolitic script within and outside of creative industries. Main resultssuggestthat intangible cultural heritage could be both protected and exploited through publishing. In this sense, the paper puts forward the concept of the production of books as cultural products based on intangible cultural heritage, i.e. on its exploitation in the context of publishing. Further, the paper implies methodological inconsistencies in statistical nomenclatures referring to creative and cultural industries. The research impetus of this paper may be summed up in the following short syntagm: cultural consumption (of the publishing cultural product) invigorates and broadens national culture and its cultural identity.","[Horvat, Jasna; Mijoc, Josipa] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Ljevak, Petra] Naklada Ljevak Ltd, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Tomasevic, Nives] Univ Zadar, Zadar 23000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of Zadar,"Horvat, J (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",jasna@efos.hr; jmijoc@efos.hr; petra.ljevak@naklada-ljevak.hr; ntomasev@unizd.hr,"Mijoč, Josipa/J-9969-2018; Horvat, Jasna/AAC-5827-2022","Horvat, Jasna/0000-0001-9665-1470",,,,,16,1,1,0,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,321,334,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600030,0

This situation is rooted in the following causes: 1. Most Russians are not able to save up for housing. High interest rates on mortgage loans limit the use of mortgage as a tool to finance consumer demand in the housing market. 2. Existing conditions of mortgage programs and high security of the asset, such as real estate, from the market uncertainty lead to increased investment demand, which brings about the continued positive dynamics in housing prices. The authors believe that the government control should be primarily aimed at: 1. Higher availability of mortgage credits as result of consumer demand assessment. To this end, the government may look at state co-financing programs of mortgage lending. 2. Reduced investment demand for housing. It is clear that today sees no trend towards a better geopolitical situation, so the only way is to influence on the real estate profitability by amending taxation. 3. Prevention of cartel agreements between developers to keep unreasonably high prices. 4. Increased construction and reduced price growth dynamics. For this purpose, it is necessary to support and promote fair competition in the industry, which will enable new companies to enter the market. In addition to increased housing availability, developing housing construction will make it possible to greatly intensify investment processes in the whole country, as well as raise income levels and improve quality of life. This results from a significant multiplier effect from investments in real estate and parallel development of industries producing complementary products. Today one of the key areas in the state economic policies should be increased public spending in housing and public support for this industry. It is obvious that over time and with improved living standards in Russia the government should curb its involvement in housing matters.","[Kirsanova, Natalia Yurievna; Lenkovets, Olga Mikhailovna] Natl Mineral Resources Univ Univ Mines, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg Mining University,"Kirsanova, NY (通讯作者)，Natl Mineral Resources Univ Univ Mines, St Petersburg, Russia.",,"Kirsanova, Natalia/AAE-3479-2019; Lenkovets, Olga/AAG-5877-2019","Kirsanova, Natalia/0000-0003-1012-4763; Lenkovets, Olga/0000-0003-4144-1331",,,,,7,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,555,561,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900071,0

We adapted the General Product Attitudes (GPA) for the Portuguese context, a subscale belonging to the Country-of-Origin Scale [1]. The reliability analysis conducted to the exclusion of six items from the original GPA, and the Principal Component Analysis (Varimax rotation) have reproduced the original factorial structure of the GPA, with score loadings higher than .49: Fl-Desirable product attributes (37.4% of the total explained variance; alpha =.77; M = 5.73, SD = 1.10) and F2-Distribution-promotion based on desirable attributes (12.2% of the total explained variance; alpha = .79; M = 4.52; SD = 1.23). Women showed more favorable attitudes towards Fl-Desirable product attributes in comparison with men, and both have similar attitudes concerning to F2-Distribution-promotion based on desirable attributes. This second factor has received less favorable attitudes between people with higher schooling, higher income, and between workers (in comparison with unemployed or retired).

The debate is not, however, being supported by reliable data on the relative contribution of UPH to urban food consumption and income, as compared with other sources of food and income supply. This paper has drawn on the relevant data on the origin of urban food products from consumption and market surveys, and also from surveys and case studies of farmers' strategies and economic results in various cities in Africa and Southeast Asia. The undeniably patchy results nevertheless show the importance of urban agriculture in two areas: overall supply of the most perishable vegetables, namely, leafy vegetables; and complementarity of UPH with rural vegetable production. The results also show the specific contribution of UPH in the supply of vegetables with specific food safety characteristics, in particular organic vegetables, because when the production of these types of vegetables is combined with direct sales between producers and consumers, the consumers gain a certain level of responsibility in the production process. UPH contributes to livelihoods in a variety of ways, from the unique provision of incomes to urban households with few alternative sources, to an additional source of cash to urban entrepreneurs and civil servants. This paper highlights the need for additional research in economics on UPH in Africa. The available data on food and economic contribution of UPH are incomplete and need to be updated, and comparisons need to be made between cities to understand the reasons for differences. There should be more systematic comparison between UPH and rural horticulture in terms of income generation, price of vegetables, and labour use and energy use. The economic advantages of a multifunctional UPH should be evaluated based on contingent evaluation methods. Finally, the advantages of proximity in terms of increasing consumers' awareness of the consequences of their purchase choices on the local economy should be better communicated and publicized.","Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev, CIRAD, Montpellier, France",CIRAD,"Moustier, P (通讯作者)，Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev, CIRAD, Montpellier, France.",,,"Moustier, Paule/0000-0003-2916-6496",,,,,50,4,4,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-08-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1021.0,,,,,,211,226,,,,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB5GQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343861400017,0

The effect of minimum wage is controlled for influence of business-cycle as well as labor markets' institutional setting and unemployment benefits. Our results indicate that the significance of the effect found depends on the measure used. The real minimum wage growth rate has a positive and significant effect on unemployment rate but the estimates obtained for median-based measures of minimum wage are insignificant. Despite the statistical significance the economic effect found is very limited.

Distinguishing between US single and multiple petitions, we examine the trade effects of US AD actions against China based on an unbalanced panel of quarterly trade data. The results show that a US single petition investigation greatly restrains US imports of the filed products from China but also causes more significant import diversion from non-named countries. In the short run, a preliminary AD duty imposed on China via a US multiple petition not only restrains US imports of the filed products from China but also prevents trade diversion from non-named countries. In the long run, a final AD duty on China resulting from a US multiple petition creates a larger destructive effect on China and causes US import diversion from non-named countries. Thus, a final AD duty imposed on China following a US multiple petition not only harms China's exports but also fails to help the US achieve import substitution. Furthermore, we have been able to reveal the negative trade effect of a preliminary AD duty even in cases where the ultimate decision is not to impose a final duty.","[Shen, Guobing] Fudan Univ, Inst World Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Fu, Xiaolan] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",Fudan University; University of Oxford,"Shen, GB (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Inst World Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",,,"Shen, Guobing/0000-0003-0988-5960",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530252] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,21,14,15,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2014,37.0,1,,,,,86,105,,10.1111/twec.12125,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,287GL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329529900005,0

The calibrated parameters vary across commodities consistent with their expected level of sophistication. The results are robust to alternative specifications of the calibration. Using fitted data, it also show that export sophistication is highly correlated with GDPper capita. Overall, the parameters are comparable with estimates from other studies. Finally, counterfactual experiments are conducted to quantify the effects of changes in technology and trade costs for the countries in the bottom quintile. The findings imply that these countries have a huge technological disadvantage, particularly in more sophisticated commodities.","Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Weldemicael, E (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",,,,,,,,52,21,26,5,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2014,37.0,1,,,,,14,41,,10.1111/twec.12071,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,287GL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329529900002,0

A microeconomic perspective of cultural tourism is provided, in which the main point of interest is to analyse the attitudes of visitors regarding culture and their overall vacation. To this end, visitors' behaviour is examined through survey data obtained at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. A zero-truncated negative binomial model is empirically estimated, unlike in other studies, as a generalization of a Poisson distribution. The analysis identifies the main determinants that influence the length of stay of cultural tourists: nationality, age, employment, income, costs associated with the journey - all have an impact on the length of stay. Specifically, variations in these factors correspond to variations in the duration of the vacation. The duration is also positively affected by the presence of the icemen Otzi in the museum and of other cultural attractions. The findings provide an essential tool for managing heritage resources and planning future tourism developments around the Otzi museum.","[Brida, Juan Gabriel] Free Univ Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management TOMTE, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Meleddu, Marta; Pulina, Manuela] Univ Sassari, Econ Dept DiSEA, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Meleddu, Marta; Pulina, Manuela] Univ Sassari, CRENoS, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Sassari; University of Sassari,"Pulina, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Econ Dept DiSEA, Via Torre Tonda, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",juangabriel.brida@unibz.it; mmeleddu@uniss.it; mpulina@uniss.it,"Meleddu, Marta/HFZ-7852-2022; Brida, Juan Gabriel/H-3727-2015","Meleddu, Marta/0000-0003-3081-0584; Brida, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-2319-5790",,,,,40,41,42,4,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This is done using the example of banking sector reforms in two small European Union (EU) member states, Ireland and Denmark. Two key arguments are put forward: (1) National governments' ability to make credible claims about their ability to influence the direction of European integration is crucial in enabling them to justify sector reforms. Thus, as a full member of the European Monetary Union (EMU), Irish decision makers are able to make credible claims about their influence on European financial integration, an option not available to Danish decision makers since Denmark is not a Eurozone member; (2) Globalisation comprises a particularly compelling set of discourses which enables decision makers to carry through sector reforms in line with European integration measures, even in the absence of national commitment to the latter. Discourses of globalisation have thus become the last resort' for Danish decision makers in justifying and coordinating reforms that are in line with EU regulations and recommendations.","[Lynggaard, Kennet] Roskilde Univ, Dept Soc & Globalisat, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Lynggaard, K (通讯作者)，Roskilde Univ, Dept Soc & Globalisat, Univ Vej 1,Build 25-1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",kennetl@ruc.dk,,"Lynggaard, Kennet/0000-0002-6534-5371",,,,,91,11,12,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We use rich register data which allow us to distinguish between a warning that a benefit reduction may take place in the near future and the actual withdrawal of unemployment benefits. Adopting a multivariate mixed proportional hazard approach to address selectivity, we find that warnings do not affect subsequent employment stability but do reduce post-unemployment earnings. Actual benefit reductions lower the quality of post-unemployment jobs both in terms of job duration as well as in terms of earnings.

We explore reasons for this evolution. We show that a likely explanation of this empirical fact is that both the short-run price elasticities of oil demand and of oil supply have declined considerably since the second half of the 1980s. This implies that small disturbances on either side of the oil market can generate large price responses without large quantity movements, which helps explain the latest run-up and subsequent collapse in the price of oil. Our analysis suggests that the variability of oil demand and supply shocks actually has decreased in the more recent past, preventing even larger oil price fluctuations than observed in the data.

Together, the long-term consequences of a different choice of main transport mode (camel versus ship) and the development of forms of local participative government in Europe that made cities less dependent on the state explain why Europe's urban development eventually outpaced that in the Islamic world.","[Bosker, Maarten] Univ Utrecht, Erasmus Univ Rotterdam, CEPR, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bosker, Maarten] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Utrecht University,"Bosker, M (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Erasmus Univ Rotterdam, CEPR, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,,"buringh, eltjo/0000-0002-6847-3328",,,,,116,134,152,1,37,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Using an extended gravity model the study investigates which influence the trade partners' innovation potential, as well as the research intensity of foreign multinational companies (MNCs) has upon German exports. The novel aspect of this study is the introduction of a direct measure for knowledge spillover. The findings show, that the trade partners' innovation potential as well as their FDI has a significant positive influence upon trade.

More worrisome is the inability of the paradigmatic approach to the study of IPE in the United States - Open Economy Politics (OEP) - to shed much light on the causes of the crisis. We develop the conceptual distinction between risk and uncertainty to explain why the rationalist (and largely materialist) American School of IPE failed so badly. OEP followed orthodox economics in conflating risk and uncertainty. Preserving the distinction, as constructivist IPE scholars and economic sociologists have done, enables us view the crisis through dual rationalist and sociological optics. Our illustrative evidence, drawn from public (the Federal Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve) and private actors (accountants, credit rating agencies, and arbitrage traders) in financial markets, shows that only eclectic approaches that make use of both rationalist and sociological optics give IPE scholars the depth of vision and the breadth of imagination necessary to make sense of the financial crisis of 2008.","[Katzenstein, Peter J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Nelson, Stephen C.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL USA",Cornell University; Northwestern University,"Katzenstein, PJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",,,,,,,,156,23,23,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Typically, unobserved heterogeneity is estimated either with continuous or discrete mixture models. However, in order to avoid estimation difficulties, most of the empirical analysis assumes a relatively constrained mixture, standard examples being models where only few coefficients are allowed to vary with independent normal distributions or with discrete distributions with few mass points. We compare labour supply elasticities obtained with these typical specifications of unobserved heterogeneity with those from a more general model that we are able to estimate through an EM algorithm for the nonparametric estimation of mixed models. Results show that labour supply elasticities change significantly with respect to a basic model without unobserved heterogeneity only when the joint distribution of the varying tastes is left completely unspecified.","[Pacifico, Daniele] Treasury Italian Minist Econ & Finance, Italian Dept, I-00187 Rome, Italy; [Pacifico, Daniele] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, Ctr Anal Publ Policies, I-41121 Modena, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Pacifico, D (通讯作者)，Treasury Italian Minist Econ & Finance, Italian Dept, Via 20 Settembre,97, I-00187 Rome, Italy.",daniele.pacifico@tesoro.it,"Pacifico, Daniele/AAC-3852-2022",,,,,,32,8,9,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This is a mistake, but an interesting one. The paper traces the idea of the methodological individualist isolated individual in Hobbes, Locke, Bentham, Austrian and neoclassical economics. The idea is untenable because it prevents a distinction between the individual and the economy in which it supposedly pursues its interest. But the mistake pushes beyond itself, pointing to a tenable alternative, plural individuality. The alternative view is thus grounded in its contrary, rather than simply rejecting it.","Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80209 USA",University of Denver,"Urquhart, R (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Dept Econ, 2000 E Asbury Ave, Denver, CO 80209 USA.",rurquhar@du.edu,,,,,,,52,2,2,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Yet, almost all of them have ignored the role of leisure for status comparisons. Inspired by Veblen (The theory of the leisure class. Macmillan, New York, 1899), this paper assumes that people care about their relative consumption and that leisure has a displaying role in making relative consumption more visible, based on a two-type model of optimal income taxation. While increased importance of relative consumption typically implies higher marginal income tax rates, in line with previous research, the effect of leisure-induced consumption visibility is to make the income tax more regressive in terms of ability.","[Aronsson, Thomas] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Johansson-Stenman, Olof] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Umea University; University of Gothenburg,"Aronsson, T (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Econ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",Thomas.Aronsson@econ.umu.se; Olof.Johansson@economics.gu.se,,"Johansson-Stenman, Olof/0000-0003-4460-4765",,,,,52,9,9,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2013,41.0,3,,,,,551,578,,10.1007/s00355-012-0701-3,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,202XT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323254900005,0

What is lacking so far are explanations for this trend. In this paper we derive four potential explanations and empirically test them. The first two, society-centered, hypotheses focus on the process of socio-economic modernization on the one hand and civil society structures on the other. The second pair of polity-centered hypotheses focuses on the decision-making power of international institutions and on their legitimacy. We measure politicization on the basis of a quantitative content analysis of US quality newspaper articles about four decisions of different international institutions in the issue area of international taxation. Our finding is that politicization is driven by the increasing decision making authority of international institutions rather than by the lack of legitimacy of their procedures or the factors emphasized by society-centered approaches.","[Rixen, Thomas] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany; [Zangl, Bernhard] Univ Munich, D-80538 Munich, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; University of Munich,"Rixen, T (通讯作者)，Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany.",thomas.rixen@uni-bamberg.de; Bernhard.Zangl@gsi.uni-muenchen.de,"Rixen, Thomas/AAZ-4571-2020; Rixen, Thomas/I-6074-2016","Rixen, Thomas/0000-0001-8777-5949; Rixen, Thomas/0000-0001-8777-5949",,,,,46,27,28,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Our main findings are as follows. First, for countries which were not a resource producer before, a resource discovery causes nonresource FDI to fall 16% in the short run and by 68% in the long run. Second, for countries that were already a resource producer, a doubling of resource rents induces a 12.4% fall in nonresource FDI. Third, on average, the contraction in nonresource FDI outweighs the boom in resource FDI. Aggregate FDI falls by 4% if the resource bonanza is doubled. Finally, these negative effects on nonresource FDI are amplified through the positive spatial lags in nonresource FDI. We also find that resource FDI is vertical, whereas nonresource FDI is of the export-fragmentation variety. Our main findings are robust to different measures of resource reserves and the oil price and to allowing sample selection bias.","[Poelhekke, Steven] Univ Oxford, OxCarre, De Nederlandsche Bank, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, OxCarre, CEPR, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Poelhekke, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, OxCarre, De Nederlandsche Bank, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,"Poelhekke, Steven/0000-0001-9256-7853",,,,,67,57,63,2,38,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In this exercise we formulate a flexible regression model that can be used to assess the sustainability of a more recent build-up of fiscal deficits and debt that would be of major concern to policy makers. The analysis of US data shows that, after adjusting for some fundamentals, the gross Federal debt-income ratio has been growing at an unsustainable rate of 4 % per year since 2007. The net debt-income ratio does not show such a significant trend. Since not all government assets are readily available to reduce debt, significant positive trends in the gross debt-income ratio calls for policy actions.","[Abeysinghe, Tilak] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Jayawickrama, Ananda] Univ Peradeniya, Dept Econ & Stat, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka",National University of Singapore; University of Peradeniya,"Abeysinghe, T (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",tilakabey@nus.edu.sg; anandaj@pdn.ac.lk,,,,,,,45,7,7,0,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

These optimum control problems consist in minimizing a quadratic objective function for linear and nonlinear econometric models with additive and multiplicative (parameter) uncertainties. The algorithm was programmed in C# and in MATLAB and allows for stochastic control with open-loop and passive learning (open-loop feedback) information patterns. Here we compare the results of applying the OPTCON2 version of the algorithm to two macroeconomic models for Slovenia, the nonlinear model SLOVNL and the linear model SLOVL. The results for both models are similar, with open-loop feedback controls giving better results on average and less outliers than open-loop controls.

Moral economy is an analytical framework that gives voice to critical concerns for the workings of an increasingly disconnected capitalism, its inherent tendencies to treat labour as a fictitious commodity' and the impact this has on the well-being of individuals and wider society. Hence, at the heart of the approach suggested here is a normative understanding of mutual reciprocality and embedded sociality that raises questions about how to support the human capacity to flourish.","[Bolton, Sharon C.] Univ Stirling, Sch Management, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Laaser, Knut] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Management, Sch Business, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Stirling; University of Strathclyde,"Bolton, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Sch Management, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",Sharon.bolton@stir.ac.uk,,"Laaser, Knut/0000-0002-3230-3423",,,,,107,85,100,0,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We study the possible implications of such changes on ACP countries' sugar production and exports by using a spatial price equilibrium model specifically developed for the sugar market.

This article examines the turn from a discourse of climate refugees', in which organisations perceive migration as a failure of both mitigation and adaptation to climate change, to one of climate migration', in which organisations promote migration as a strategy of adaptation. Its focus is the promotion of climate migration management, and it explores the trend of these discourses through two sections. First, it provides an empirical account of the two discourses, emphasising the differentiation between them. It then focuses on the discourse of climate migration, its origins, extent and content, and the associated practices of migration management'. The second part argues that the turn to the promotion of climate migration' should be understood as a way to manage the insecurity created by climate change. However, international organisations enacts this management within the forms of neoliberal capitalism, including the framework of governance. Therefore, the promotion of climate migration' as a strategy of adaptation to climate change is located within the tendencies of neoliberalism and the reconfiguration of southern states' sovereignty through governance.","Univ Lausanne, Quartier UNIL Dorigny, Inst Etud Polit & Int, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Felli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Quartier UNIL Dorigny, Inst Etud Polit & Int, Batiment Anthropole, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",romain.felli@unil.ch,,,,,,,101,56,60,2,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Traditional indicators exploit only aggregate survey information, namely the proportions of respondents who report up' and down'. This paper examines disaggregate or firm-level survey responses. It considers how the responses of the individual firms should be quantified and combined if the aim is to produce an early indication of official output data. Having linked firms' categorical responses to official data using ordered discrete-choice models, the paper proposes a statistically efficient means of combining the disparate estimates of aggregate output growth which can be constructed from the responses of individual firms. An application to firm-level survey data from the Confederation of British Industry shows that the proposed indicator can provide early estimates of output growth more accurately than traditional indicators.

Two-worker households are likely to play an increasingly important role in determining future transportation demand but their expected impact has been subject to debate. This research uses a novel approach to quantify the degree to which partner commute distance affects individual commute distance. It quantifies the degree to which partners adjust their behavior to reduce total commute distance. It also provides empirical evidence that two-worker households do indeed adjust their residence workplace configuration to reduce commute distance. It does so through the use of an adaptation of common approaches to analyzing commute distance (modeling total as well as individual commute distances) with innovative variables inspired by the literature on household location and tenure. Findings from this study reconfirm the empirical research suggesting that members of two-worker households travel the same or less than one-worker households. They also confirm that partner commute distance has a positive impact on individual commute distance, suggesting partner commute distance is complementary. At the same time, it is shown that this does not imply that partner's do not trade-off commute distance, rather two-worker households apply strategies to decrease their total commuting distance. This research could help policy makers in better understanding the commuting patterns of two-worker households to help in adapting land use and transportation policies that can address the needs of this growing population group.

Moreover, we identify particular economies that are characterized by diverging ULC inflation after the introduction of the Euro. While the German economy is characterized by ULC inflation which is persistently below the sample average, Spain and Italy have suffered sustained losses of price competitiveness against their trading partners within the Euro area.

Service provision in the rural county is less diverse and less effective than in the urban county due to place-based factors; however, in the urban county more financial resources and capacity translates into more regulation of the clientele as well as resistance to neoliberal practices. Organisations whose existence depends upon benevolent elites adapt to their funding requirements by regulating clients of social services, including tactics of surveillance, elaborate verification, and restriction. The enforcement of low-wage work that is bracketed by national policy is highly constraining, but can be challenged through a welfare organisation when the right conditions are present for an empowered grassroots approach.

This article explores this question and measures prospect theory for a sample of private bankers and fund managers. We obtained clear support for prospect theory. Our financial professionals behaved according to prospect theory and violated expected utility maximization. They were risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses and their utility was concave for gains and (slightly) convex for losses. They were also averse to losses, but less so than commonly observed in laboratory studies and assumed in behavioral finance. A substantial minority focused on gains and largely ignored losses, behavior reminiscent of what caused the current financial crisis.","[Abdellaoui, Mohammed; Kammoun, Hilda] HEC, Paris, France; [Bleichrodt, Han] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Bleichrodt, H (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",abdellaoui@hec.fr; bleichrodt@ese.eur.nl,,,,,,,35,49,57,1,76,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2013,74.0,3,,,,,411,429,,10.1007/s11238-011-9282-3,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,077RT,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314045900005,0

Corridor implied volatility is implicitly linked with the concept that the tails of the risk-neutral distribution are estimated with less precision than central values, due to the lack of liquid options for very high and very low strikes. However, there is no golden choice for the barrier levels, which are likely to change depending on the underlying asset risk neutral distribution. The latter feature renders its forecasting performance mainly an empirical question. The aim of the paper is to investigate the forecasting performance of corridor implied volatility by choosing different corridors with symmetric and asymmetric cuts, and compare the results with the preliminary findings in Muzzioli (CEFIN working paper no 23, 2010b). Moreover, we shed light on the information content of different parts of the risk neutral distribution of the stock price, by using a model-independent approach based on corridor measures. To this end we compute both realized and model-free variance measures accounting for both falls and increases in the underlying asset price. The forecasting performance of volatility measures is evaluated both in a statistical and an economic setting. The economic significance is assessed by employing trading strategies based on delta-neutral straddles. The comparison is pursued by using intra-day synchronous prices between the options and the underlying asset.","[Muzzioli, Silvia] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Muzzioli, Silvia] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, CEFIN, I-41121 Modena, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Muzzioli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, Viale Berengario 51, I-41121 Modena, Italy.",silvia.muzzioli@unimore.it,"Muzzioli, Silvia/B-3717-2016","Muzzioli, Silvia/0000-0003-0738-6690",,,,,32,18,18,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

We contribute to the existing literature in two ways: (i) we explicitly model persistence in the debt-to-asset ratio, and (ii) we incorporate firm heterogeneity with respect to firm size and legal form. Empirically, this implies the use of dynamic panel data econometrics. We employ a panel of about 110,000 firms from 22 countries of the European Union between 1999 and 2007. First, we find that capital structures exhibit a substantial degree of persistence over time. Second, and in line with theoretical expectations, we find that the debt ratio is positively affected by the statutory corporate income tax rate. Specifically, we observe a marginal effect of around 0.3 in our baseline specification, translating into a short-run (long-run) elasticity of about 0.2 (0.3-1.5). Finally, our empirical results show that large firms react more sensitively to the incentives of corporate taxation, while this effect is smaller for public limited companies.","[Stoeckr, Matthias; Winner, Hannes] Salzburg Univ, A-5010 Salzburg, Austria; [Winner, Hannes] Osterreich Inst Wirtschaftsforsch WiFo, A-5010 Salzburg, Austria",Salzburg University,"Stöckr, M (通讯作者)，Salzburg Univ, Residenzpl 9, A-5010 Salzburg, Austria.",matthias.stoeckl@sbg.ac.at; Hannes.Winner@sbg.ac.at,,,,,,,59,3,3,0,20,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The generation of technological knowledge consists in the recombination of existing bits of heterogeneous technological knowledge that is necessarily possessed by a myriad of agents. As such, much technological knowledge is external to each agent and yet an essential input. In this context, knowledge governance mechanisms play a key role in the identification, recollection, and provision of the specific items of necessary technological knowledge, external to each agent. Effective knowledge governance mechanisms engender pecuniary knowledge externalities that take place, mainly at the regional level, when and where existing units of external knowledge can be identified, accessed, unbundled, and used-again-at costs that are below equilibrium ones for the recombinant generation of new technological knowledge.","[Antonelli, Cristiano] Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy; [Antonelli, Cristiano] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Antonelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ, Via PO 53, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",cristiano.antonelli@unito.it,"ANTONELLI, CRISTIANO/HTN-7364-2023","Antonelli, Cristiano/0000-0002-5652-0510",,,,,45,17,18,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We employ the Clapp and Giacotto (Journal of American Statistical Association, 87(418), 300-306, 1992) assessed-value method to estimate price indices for commercial properties in Florida. The estimated Florida commercial property price index is compared to the Moody's/REAL Commercial Property Price Index (CPPI) and to the transaction-based index (TBI) produced at MIT. Our results are promising, suggesting that this widely-available data source can be used to produce commercial property price indices for a variety of precise market locations and specific investor segments. A secondary but interesting objective of this paper is to use our rich and comprehensive database to examine the price performance of two specific subsets of properties in more detail. First, we narrow our range to focus on just the office sector for Florida. We compare price movements for the Florida office sector with the comparable CPPI. Estimates produce very similar price movements providing support to both methods. Second, we contrast the price performance of higher- and lower-valued properties and reject the hypothesis that their periodic price index levels are equal. The mean price changes of Florida commercial properties assessed at $2.5 million and above are observed to be slightly higher than for properties assessed below $2.5 million, although not statistically different. In particular, higher-valued properties had higher mean price changes relative to lower-valued properties during periods of economic expansion. This economic difference represents an important contribution toward beginning to understand the relative performance of smaller and investment-grade commercial properties.","[Gatzlaff, Dean] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Ctr Real Estate Educ & Res, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Holmes, Cynthia] Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Dept Finance, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Gatzlaff, D (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Ctr Real Estate Educ & Res, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",dgatzlaff@fsu.edu; cynthia.holmes@ryerson.ca,,,,,,,8,8,9,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This study assesses whether individuals respond to WTP questions on an individual or a group basis and whether reported WTP values are affected by changes in wording to address this issue explicitly. The authors' analysis reveals statistically significant differences in mean WTP when the payment vehicle is worded more generally, compared to specific language questioning respondents about increases in their share of the cost. Further, dividing the WTP from the standard CVM survey language by group size did not restore the equality of individual average WTP.

The coincidence of these two events has led some observers to argue that financial speculation caused the oil-price increases. Yet several arguments cast doubt on the validity of this claim. For example, although the quantity of oil implied by the number of open futures contracts is much larger than U.S. daily oil consumption, comparing these two statistics is misleading because not all paper oil is immediately deliverable. In addition, changes in financial firms' positions do not predict oil-price changes, but oil-price changes predict changes in positions. Other explanations for the oil-price increases include macroeconomic fundamentals such as increased demand from emerging Asia. Of these explanations, the most consistent with the facts relates the oil-price increases to a series of positive demand shocks emanating from emerging Asia.","[Alquist, Ron; Gervais, Olivier] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Alquist, R (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",ralquist@bankofcanada.ca; ogervais@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,39,47,53,1,33,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,34.0,3,,,SI,,35,54,,10.5547/01956574.34.3.3,0.0,,,20,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,173NB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321085100003,0

Actually, from a bounce-back augmented threshold model, it appears that i) the null hypothesis of no bounce-back effect is strongly rejected by the inventory investment data and ii) the one-step ahead forecasting performances of the models accounting for this bounce-back effect are well improved compared to linear or standard threshold autoregressions. This supports the conventional wisdom that inventory investment exacerbates aggregate fluctuations, in line with the recent theoretical models by, e. g., Wang and Wen (Wang, P., and Y. Wen. 2009.

A large amount of studies is based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) for evaluating such policies. One of the main reasons why DEA gain so much popularity is, that it allows to measure efficiency, when production process presents the structure of multiple inputs and outputs, without knowing information about prices. On the other hand the complete freedom in choosing weights for inputs and outputs can cause overestimation of efficiency levels for some DMUs. The objective of this paper is to evaluate relevance of this fact in railway sector. For this purpose it's performed common CCR, BCC and SBM model and after a deeper insight into the results assurance region method is drawn up. Finally efficiency levels of selected models and resulting rankings of European countries are compared. Analysis is performed on the national rail system data for the year 2008 for 23 European countries using passenger and freight services as outputs and length of lines,staff, freight and passenger transport stock as inputs.","[Bil, Jaroslav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,jbil@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,8,2,2,0,5,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,43,48,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000008,0

This rule is used in all New Keynesian DSGE models. The Taylor rule represents the behavior of the central bank. Currently, there are many versions of Taylor rules. This paper deals with the Taylor rule which is used by the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic in the model which is called HUBERT. It is a DSGE model that quantifies impacts of fiscal policy. The Taylor rule consists of gap and steady state variables. The empirical time series must be transformed into the steady state variables using the Hodrick-Prescott filter. The parameter estimates are performed using two different methods. The first approach uses the instrumental variables technique. It is necessary to estimate the compound expression which is present in the Taylor rule and in the second is the whole Taylor rule estimated. For both steps is used the Least-Squares method. The second approach estimates the whole Taylor rule at once using the Marquardt algorithm. It is the Least-Squares method which allows estimating the non-linear parameters. These two approaches are compared and the Marquardt algorithm is chosen as the best one. The paper verifies the quality of the Taylor rule and the results of the parameter estimates might be used for the calibration of the New Keynesian DSGE model of the Czech Republic.","[Bouda, Milan] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,bouda.mil@seznam.cz,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,72,76,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000013,0

An empirical model is estimated on annual data for over 950 plants from 1996 to 2006. Model estimates show that access to wholesale electricity markets and retail choice together increased the efficiency of investor-owned plants by about nine percent and that these gains stem from organizational and technological changes within the plant. Although not directly targeted by restructuring initiatives, similar efficiency gains are also found for municipality-owned plants. This result suggests that the potential benefits from competition have spilled over to public electricity generation.","[Craig, J.
