Offer prices are biased toward recent peak prices although they are economically unremarkable. An offer's probability of acceptance jumps discontinuously when it exceeds a peak price. Conversely, bidder shareholders react more negatively as the offer price is influenced upward toward a peak. Merger waves occur when high returns on the market and likely targets make it easier for bidders to offer a peak price. Parties thus appear to use recent peaks as reference points or anchors to simplify the complex tasks of valuation and negotiation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Based on an original dataset of 94 European companies from 2005 to 2009, we use a panel regression analysis to study the relationship between CDS premiums and liquidity. We measure the level of liquidity, look at liquidity risk, and study the liquidity spillovers from the bond and equity markets to the CDS market. We show that the effect of liquidity on CDS premiums is dominated by the influence of worsening credit conditions and deteriorating investors' expectations about default risk. Controlling for credit risk, we also find that liquidity risk is priced in the European CDS market and that liquidity spillovers from the bond market matter in determining CDS premiums.","[Petitjean, Mikael] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Sch Management, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Petitjean, Mikael] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Lesplingart, Clothilde] BNP Paribas Fortis, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Majois, Christophe] FSMA, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; BNP Paribas,"Petitjean, M (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Sch Management, 151 Chaussee Binche, B-7000 Mons, Belgium.",mikael.petitjean@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,32,8,9,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

One attribute that has particular significance where the evaluation task is complex and time dependent is Affect. Affect refers to the positive or negative feeling state associated with a particular decision. Trust is one of the most recognized affective states as it is the implicit backbone of cooperative behavior. Trust is a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon expectations of the intentions and behavior of the trusted party. It has been noted that there is hardly an economic transaction that does not involve trust to some degree. This brief paper is the first to empirically examine interpersonal trust as an attribute of individual investment risk perceptions and as an influence on aggregate market risk premiums.

As ranking policies is an often subjective process, there is always the concern of bias, both intentional and not. Expert bias is difficult to discern in the policy world, but surveys of expert opinion are compiled and tested for accuracy weekly in college football, allowing for hypothesis testing. Although previous research has used college football rankings to determine the ability of surveys to incorporate relevant information, this article examines the Associated Press and American Football Coaches' Association rankings for evidence of systematic bias. Specifically, more than 1,300 games from the 2003 to 2008 regular seasons are tested for factors that are systematically correlated with upsets. Both polls predict the winner nearly 80% of the time, and although there is evidence of systematic conference bias, correcting the rankings would only improve the accuracy of the polls by about 1%. There is no evidence of a bias favoring big market teams, nor teams that have strong journalism programs or are from the East Coast.

Improved understanding of this relationship will assist planners when making transport and land use decisions. The findings suggest that several geographical, spatial and land use factors have important influences on freight activity in urban areas. Commercial and industrial land use patterns affect the types and quantities of goods produced, consumed, and hence the total quantity of freight transport handled. This also influences the distances over which goods are moved and by what specific mode. There has been relatively low growth in warehousing in many of the selected areas over the last decade compared to the national average as well suburbanisation of warehousing in some locations. This affects the origin and destination of journeys visiting these facilities and typically increases the distance of such journeys. A greater proportion of road freight has been shown to be lifted on internal journeys in large urban areas than in smaller ones. journeys within urban areas have been shown to be less efficient than journeys to and from the urban area in the 14 locations studied due to the much smaller average vehicle carrying capacities and lower lading factors for journeys within urban areas. The length of haul on journeys to and from urban areas studied was found to be greatest for those areas with a major seaport and/or which were geographically remote. This affects the road freight transport intensity of goods. transport journeys. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Research in behavioural sciences indicates that individuals' choices in a wide range of contexts deviate from the predictions of the rational man paradigm inspired the research agenda in the field of travel behaviour. New concepts and practices of government aim to apply some behavioural economics insights in the design of behavioural change initiatives and measures, an approach recently advocated in the US and the UK. This paper provides a brief review on the use and potential of behavioural economics from the perspective of transport and climate change, in two main contexts: travel demand modelling and design of behaviour change measures. The discussion of limitations and knowledge gaps associated with the implementation of behavioural economics to a travel behaviour context might contribute to the debate and help in defining research agenda in this area.

We analyse the consequences of becoming an exporter on a firm's energy consumption. We show theoretically and empirically with firm-level data that the increase in energy use when exporting is negatively correlated with energy intensity. This is because, although energy use rises with exporting due to greater production and transportation, it can be offset by adopting more energy-efficient technology. This second effect is strongest for high energy intensity firms. As such, analysis of average effects, as in other studies, conceals important connections between the trade and the environment.","[Batrakova, Svetlana; Davies, Ronald B.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Batrakova, S (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland.",s.batrakova@lse.ac.uk,"Davies, Ronald/AAT-4531-2021","Davies, Ron/0000-0002-9738-9256",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,48,53,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The paper presents a narrative on the evolution of capital controls in India and calculates a new index of capital account liberalization using cumulative monthly changes in restrictions on inflows and outflows. It employs the de jure indices of changes in restrictions on capital inflows and outflows to identify particular policy episodes, and tests the de facto effects of restrictions by calculating deviations from covered interest parity (CIP) utilizing data from the three-month offshore nondeliverable rupee forward market. The paper estimates no-arbitrage bands for each episode using SETAR where boundaries are determined by transactions costs and by the effectiveness of capital controls. It finds that Indian capital controls are asymmetric over inflows and outflows, have changed at one stage from primarily restricting outflows to effectively restricting inflows; and that arbitrage activity closes deviations from CIP when the threshold boundaries are exceeded in all subperiods. Moreover, the results indicate a significant reduction in the barriers to arbitrage since 2009, suggesting that gradual liberalization of India's capital account has played an important role in integrating onshore and offshore markets. The paper also applies the methodology to the Chinese RMB NDF market and find that capital controls are strictly limiting capital inflows with the exception of two periods of regional and international financial turbulence. The intensity of Chinese controls varies over time, indicating discretion in the application of capital control policy but, unlike India, shows no sign of gradual relaxation or liberalization.

Effects of these policies have been analyzed using numerical urban simulation models. At the same time, the US Energy Information Administration's Residential Energy Consumption Survey has allowed researchers to investigate the relation between household energy consumption and characteristics of housing units. This paper links these two lines of inquiry by demonstrating how simulation results on the implications of land use and transportation policies for the spatial form of cities can be used to compute implications for energy consumption. The resulting Urban Energy Footprint Model, UEFM, allows one to trace the implications of a change in land use zoning or transportation policy through its effects on housing markets and residential location to the resulting changes in energy use for residential and commuting purposes - i.e. to understand the energy footprint of transportation, housing, and land use policies. Accordingly, the UEFM provides, perhaps for the first time, a link between urban and energy economics, and can allow measurement of rebound effects of energy policies in a more general equilibrium context.

Since then, the media, policymakers, pundits, and intermediate macro students have used the so-called Okun's law as a rule of thumb to relate changes in unemployment to changes in output growth. However, some studies have suggested that the relationship has not been stable over time. Furthermore, the slow recovery of U.S. unemployment relative to output after the Great Recession has led some to question whether Okun's law has changed permanently. In this light, the authors reconsider the evidence on instability in Okun's law and, in particular, examine whether the Great Recession has contributed to the breakdown of the empirical relationship.","[Owyang, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Sekhposyan, Tatevik] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Bank of Canada,"Owyang, MT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Owyang, Michael T/I-5750-2016","Owyang, Michael T/0000-0002-2109-3432",,,,,15,59,60,1,17,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

We have found that fewer firms are choosing the United States as their initial export destination. This trend suggests that a growing number of firms are not following the traditional stage model of internationalization. Furthermore, our results suggest that government support should be targeted towards young and small Canadian-controlled firms, since they are more likely than established firms to encounter barriers and to gain benefits from exporting to a wider range of foreign markets.","[Sui, Sui] Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Global Management Studies Dept, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Yu, Zhihao] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University; Carleton University,"Sui, S (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Global Management Studies Dept, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,", Sui/0000-0001-8719-962X",,,,,36,8,8,1,9,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

According to the logic of appropriateness, decision changes result from changes in answer to the question, what does a person like me do in a situation like this? In two studies, transient group affiliation is systematically manipulated to test its influence on the appropriateness question both in the present and future. Novel methodologies (videotaping group interactions to obtain observed levels of group affiliation, implicit measures of social concept activation and aspect listing protocols) were used to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the influence of group affiliation. Increases in group affiliation are accompanied by increases in the accessibility of social constructs, higher levels of cooperation, personal satisfaction and trust in one's group. Similar patterns are observed for decisions in the present and future. There is an order effect observed with decisions to cooperate in the future carrying over to subsequent decisions to cooperate in the present, but a decision to initially cooperate in the present does not translate as strongly to a decision to cooperate in the future. This is in part because a more analytical approach is used for decisions pertaining to the future, while decisions in the present tend to be more affect-based. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the volatility of U.S. firms is higher mostly because of good volatility.

Financial constraints are more important in explaining the performance of share buybacks for firms with high actual repurchase ratios. Constrained firms, especially those with high actual repurchase ratios, experience a significantly greater increase in post-buyback distress risk than unconstrained firms.

Moreover, borrowers who appear more trustworthy indeed have better credit scores and default less often.

In their economy, which is distorted by monopolistic competition in the steady state, we show that they underestimate the welfare cost of these fluctuations by ignoring the negative effect of aggregate volatility on average consumption and leisure. As monopolistic suppliers, both firms and workers aim to preserve their expected markups; the interaction between aggregate fluctuations and price-setting behavior results in average consumption and employment levels that are lower than their counterparts in the flexible-price economy. This level effect increases the efficiency cost of business cycles. It is all the more sizable with the degree of inefficiency in the steady state, lower laborsupply elasticities, and when prices instead of wages are rigid.","[Hairault, Jean-Olivier] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Hairault, JO (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",joh@univ-paris1.fr; flangot@univ-lemans.fr,,"langot, francois/0000-0001-7737-5319",,,,,12,2,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Sutton (Sunk costs and market structure: price competition, advertising, and the evolution of concentration, 1991) points to technology and advertising races as two key drivers of market concentration. This study uses an own-built longitudinal data set of the population of firms and breweries, and reveals the importance of institutional factors in explaining the dynamics of market structure. The practice of tying outlets to brewers and legal restrictions on opening retail outlets, together with a permissive policy towards mergers, made acquisition of medium-sized firms and brewery closure (shortly after acquisition) the main driving mechanism towards industry consolidation. During this period, the number of firms and plants fell sharply (by 74% and 60%, respectively) and production rose (by about 25%), with no firm entry and just one new brewery opening. As a result, concentration increased and the market transformed from a highly fragmented one into a stable oligopoly.","Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Esteve-Pérez, S (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",sesteve@uv.es,"ESTEVE, SILVIANO/AAD-2029-2021","ESTEVE, SILVIANO/0000-0001-8096-6259",,,,,40,3,3,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This comparison is performed by estimating a true random effects stochastic distance frontier model-a model that is capable of disentangling unobserved heterogeneity from inefficiency-within a Bayesian framework. We find that failure to consider unobserved heterogeneity results in a misleading ranking of banks and mismeasured technical efficiency, productivity growth, and returns to scale. Our results show that, compared with community banks, large banks have experienced much higher productivity growth and higher levels of returns to scale. Our estimates of total factor productivity growth show a clear downward trend for both large and community banks, and our decomposition of the output-distance-function-based Divisia productivity index indicates that technical change is the driving force behind this trend.

In principle, the GA methodology can be applied to any risk-factor model of portfolio risk. Thus far, however, analytical results have been derived only for simple models of actuarial loss, i.e., credit loss due to default. We demonstrate that the GA is entirely tractable for single-factor versions of a large class of models that includes all the commonly used mark-to-market approaches. Our approach covers both finite ratings-based models and models with a continuum of obligor states.

A nonparametric matching approach, which imposes no specific functional forms and can be applied to a broad range of data structures, is employed to estimate the FTA effect on the growth. We find that FTAs exert insignificant effects on aggregated growth from one to 10 year period after launch, but detect a significant upward trend in the gap between the growth rates of per capita GDP within a bilateral FTA.

In a forest context, the seasonal analysis is particularly interesting because of inter-temporal change in forest attributes throughout the year which can influence trip-taking behavior. In this paper, the model of seasonal forest visitation is developed to provide a richer understanding of the role played by seasonal fluctuation on a distribution of forest social benefits. The analysis is based on an on-site survey conducted in four forests in Poland. Results show that the most valuable forest trips are those taken in fall and that seasonal trips are separable.","[Bartczak, Anna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw Ecol Econ Ctr, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland; [Englin, Jeffrey] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness & Resource Management, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Pang, Arwin] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan",University of Warsaw; Arizona State University; Feng Chia University,"Bartczak, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw Ecol Econ Ctr, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",bartczak@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Bartczak, Anna Małgorzata/AAZ-9274-2020; Bartczak, Anna/AAN-1875-2021; Englin, Jeff/AAN-2322-2020","Bartczak, Anna Małgorzata/0000-0001-5917-5989; Bartczak, Anna/0000-0001-5917-5989;",,,,,15,12,14,1,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

It also relates to questions of how best to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Questions remain, however, about whether foreign aid spent on trade facilitation increases trade flows of developing countries. Does it work differently from aid in general? Using detailed data on aid flows from the OECD, the analysis here estimates the relationship between specific types of aid and trade flows, both globally and of the aid recipients. The findings indicate that aid spent on promoting trade is positively associated with global trade. For most types of such aid-for-trade facilitation, it is relatively more strongly associated with recipient exports than their imports. In contrast 'other' types of aid are more strongly associated with recipient imports. Based on elasticities estimated over 16 years of trade and aid data for 40 donor countries and about 170 country trading pairs, our results suggest that a 1% increase in aid-for-trade facilitation (of about US$ 220 million in 2008) correlates to about US$ 290 million of additional exports from the aid receiving countries.","[Wilson, John S.] World Bank Grp, Dev Res Grp Trade, Washington, DC USA; [Helble, Matthias] World Trade Org, Trade & Environm Div, Geneva, Switzerland; [Mann, Catherine L.] Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Waltham, MA USA",The World Bank; World Trade Organization; Brandeis University,"Wilson, JS (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Dev Res Grp Trade, Washington, DC USA.",matthias.helble@wto.org; clmann@brandeis.edu; jswilson@worldbank.org,"wassie, mengistu/ABT-3222-2022",,,,,,53,54,58,4,68,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

This paper suggests key issues which need to be addressed related to the sustainability and change in the banking sector in Serbia. The main aim of this study is to assess sustainability and readiness for change in transition environment. This paper contributes to the existing literature by assessing readiness for change in selected bank. Regarding different characteristics of national cultures, the construct validity of research methodology developed in one society will be investigated for a Serbian sample. The qualitative data about sustainability were sourced from publicly available information about bank. The Organizational Diagnosis Questionnaire (ODQ) developed by Preziosi (1980) is used to assess the bank's readiness for change. The sample consisted of 137 managers different socio demographic variables from bank. The research findings revealed possible practical implementation of ODQ in Serbia. The sustainable attitude of the bank is rewarded by different organizations in Serbia. The results revealed that changes in the bank should be led top down. The findings add to the existing literature on factors causing organizational effectiveness in cross-cultural organizational contexts.

The transition of organizations to the principles of knowledge-based economy involves a major change in organizational culture. The dynamism and complexity of the new type of society, which implies a higher and more diverse level of training, together with a continuous superior training of the workforce, increasing investment in research and development and, not least, a growing volume and a diversification of information, all these represent, chained together, an element of well-being for the future generations. The introductory section summarizes the concept of sustainability and places the development of companies and economies they aggregate, in a contemporary context of organizational change pressures, on the principles of the knowledge-based economy as the only resource, virtually inexhaustible in the long-term, and which leads to a sustainable development. There follows a methodological section, consisting in the instrumental description of the method of work and in reference to the database, thus providing the theoretical and practical foundation for the confrontation between the sustainable development index (SDI) in Romania and in the European Union (EU). The results and discussion section of the paper includes a confrontation between the sustainable development of Romania and that of the European Union, drawing on the SDI for each case. This statistical tool was calculated starting from the values of several statistical indicators (available in EUROSTAT statistics), issued from four information subsystems (an economic one, a social one and an environment one as major subsystems of sustainable development, to which was added the institutional environment). The SDI confirms a considerable gap between Romania and the EU-27 average, and the organizational change on the principles of knowledge-based economy is emerging as the optimal solution and gradual recovery of these gaps.","[Lazar, Cristina Mihaela; Bunda, Ramona Nicoleta] OVIDIUS Univ Constanta, Constanta, Romania",Ovidius University,"Lazar, CM (通讯作者)，OVIDIUS Univ Constanta, Constanta, Romania.",lazarcristinam@yahoo.com,"Dinu, Nicoleta Ramona/AAQ-8937-2021","lazar, cristina mihaela/0000-0002-5081-5633",,,,,31,4,4,0,28,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2012,14.0,32,,,,,380,392,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,964ED,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305675600007,0

Sustainability requires the full integration of social and environmental aspects into the vision, culture and operations of an organization, a profound process of organizational change being essential. The purpose of this paper is to present the main drivers of corporate sustainability, illustrating - after a thorough literature review - the link between the following elements: corporate sustainability - a necessity in the current global context; eco-innovation - as a way to implement sustainability in an organization; responsible leadership - as the art of building and maintaining strong and moral relationships with all stakeholders; organizational culture and organizational change - the basic elements through which organizations continuously renew their processes and products, adapting them to the new context. Furthermore, the paper provides an overview of organizations active in Romania in terms of sustainability practices, in general, and the ecological component of sustainable development, in particular, by presenting the results of an exploratory questionnaire-based research. The research reflects the importance of visionary management in adopting and implementing sustainability in the responding organizations.","[Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai; Nemoianu, Estera Laura; Langa, Claudia Adriana; Szabo, Tuende] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Nemoianu, EL (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",estera.nemoianu@doesec.ase.ro,"Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/O-9071-2016","Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/0000-0002-4559-3466",,,,,45,66,74,2,120,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2012,14.0,32,,,,,404,419,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,964ED,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305675600009,0

In particular, it addresses the question of whether dynamic capabilities impact directly or indirectly on performance. In doing so, the article articulates and measures a construct of dynamic capabilities and using structural equation modeling it examines whether their impact on performance is mediated through operational-marketing and technological-capabilities. The proposed model is tested in different levels of environmental dynamism using data on 271 Greek firms belonging to the manufacturing sector. Empirical findings suggest that dynamic capabilities impinge on operational capabilities which in turn have a significant effect on performance. Direct effects on performance are found to be insignificant. Furthermore, similar effects seem to hold for both higher and lower levels of environmental dynamism.

In the present paper, I show that capital gains from a nonrenewable resource can be divided into two terms: real price change effects and real interest rate change effects. By application of sectoral income theory developed by Asheim and Wei (Environ Res Econ 42:65-87, 2009), only the former term is part of real income of the resource and the latter term should not be included. This result is significant in the sense that all change in real resource wealth can be included as part of real income only if future real interest rates are assumed to be constant. Hotelling rule always implies that capital gains from nonrenewable resources coincide with real interests on resource wealth; net investment generated from the resource cancels out current cash flow from the resource; and real income comes from price change effects.","Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo CICERO, N-0318 Oslo, Norway",,"Wei, TY (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo CICERO, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",taoyuan.wei@cicero.uio.no,"Wei, Taoyuan/B-1788-2013","Wei, Taoyuan/0000-0002-6007-148X",,,,,12,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The analysis made use of discrete choice random utility models estimated on an specific stated preferences survey. Homoscedastic and heteroscedastic formulations were estimated, different correlation structures were tested, non-linear effects of level of service attributes were investigated, and sensitivity analyses were performed. All was carried out in a hitherto uninvestigated Italian multi-airport region (Campania, southern Italy). Major findings were: (i) access time, airfare, age, experience and income proved to be the most significant variables; (ii) non-linear transformation of access time and frequency (for direct flights) and of in-flight travel time (for connecting flights) appreciably improved models goodness-of-fit; (iii) correlation criteria based on geographical considerations or on operating airlines should be investigated; (iv) airport choices if only connecting flights are available cannot effectively be simulated through models estimated for direct flights; (v) airport choice probabilities may be significantly different as travel plans change; (vi) though Mixed Multinomial Logit and Cross-Nested Logit models statistically outperformed closed form formulations, Multinomial Logit model continue to be an effective modelling solution.

We provide both an in-depth exploration and analysis of the travel patterns and preferences of Nairobi residents and a discussion of the implications of these results for transport policy in this city. The data show that the lack of suitable transport infrastructure exacerbates travel challenges for residents across all income groups. A substantial portion of the local population cannot regularly afford any form of motorized transportation. They thus are forced to locate in slums near sources of employment, and the widespread lack of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure increases the risk that they face when traveling. The middle income group who cannot afford private cars is almost completely dependent on the informal public transport system, which provides good geographic service coverage at the expense of service quality. Approximately 15% of Nairobi's households own cars. Our analysis shows that without policies that make non-motorized transport safer and public transport service better, car ownership and use will increase sharply as the city's residents become wealthier, further congesting already-overloaded roadways.

It examines how the tax rates set at each level of both countries vary in a given setting, when a federal and a unitary country compete for mobile tax base, or both countries are organised as federations. The paper discusses whether or not tax rates set in every jurisdiction will be too high or too low in equilibrium. The externalities triggered by a tax regime change are analysed and the respective impact on revenues is considered. The results essentially hinge on the relative strategic interaction of tax rates, as well as the elasticity of the tax base with respect to the tax rate.","[Tillmann, Lisa; Wigger, Berthold U.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Tillmann, L (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

This effect manifests because any increase in the firm's systematic risk can be hedged by a CEO who can trade the market portfolio. Consistent with this prediction, we find that vega gives CEOs incentives to increase their firms' total risk by increasing systematic risk but not idiosyncratic risk. Collectively, our results suggest that stock options might not always encourage managers to pursue projects that are primarily characterized by idiosyncratic risk when projects with systematic risk are available as an alternative.

These forecasts are both rational and directionally accurate but suggest different loss structures. The Federal Reserve forecasts tend to significantly under-predict and imply asymmetric loss. The private forecasts, however, are free of such bias, suggesting symmetric loss. Given that the Federal Reserve forecasts are made to help with policymaking, our findings point to the Fed's cautiousness not to incorrectly predict the downward moves in growth in corporate profits. The private forecasts are made by experts who (with a strong profit-motivated interest) attempt to generate financial gain and thus predict the upward moves as accurately as the downward moves.

First, why might a country want to reduce its current account deficit or surplus? And second, why might the international community ask for more? We argue that, in many cases, current account balances reflect underlying domestic distortions. It is then in the interest of the country to remove those distortions and, in the process, reduce imbalances. We then discuss cases where spillover effects, either from deficits or surpluses, suggest a direct role for multilateral surveillance. This process can play two potentially useful roles: first, as a discussion of the differences in assessments; second, as a potentially useful commitment device for countries to implement some of the required but politically unpalatable fiscal or structural adjustments.

We critically assess this characterization by mapping and estimating statistical models of welfare as a function of deforestation at the municipal level. After controlling for potential confounding variables and spatial autocorrelation, estimation results are consistent with a frontier boom generated by exploitation of natural resources, followed by a bust during which forests continue to fall but there is no compensating gain in welfare. However, average per capita welfare increases again with deforestation at very high levels. This second turning point in average welfare, along with the strong bivariate correlation between deforestation and municipal GDP/km(2), may encourage local leaders to equate deforestation with development. This confirms the need for international incentive payments for global public goods, such as biodiversity and carbon sequestration, that are provided by the Amazon forest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The increase becomes smaller when the price of oil is excluded. Evidence for pass-through increasing in deflation has not previously been found in the existing literature and presents a new understanding of the pricing behavior of firms.

The effects of weather on surface water availability are explicitly addressed using the hydrological model MIKE-Basin. Farmers' adjustments to changes in precipitation, surface water availability, and other factors are quantified using an economic model based on non-linear programming techniques. The models are externally linked. Results show that regional impacts, at the sub-basin level, vary depending on the location of each sub-basin relative to river flows. The effects of water use regulations and of exogenous price shocks on agriculture depend on weather, location, product mix and production technology. Implications of these results for policies designed to manage agriculture and water use are discussed.","[Torres, Marcelo De O.] Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, Secretaria Coordenacao Posgrad Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Maneta, Marco] Univ Montana, Dept Geosci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Howitt, Richard; Vosti, Stephen A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wallender, Wesley W.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bassoi, Luis H.] EMBRAPA, Semiarid Trop Res Stn, Petrolina, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Lineu N.] EMBRAPA, Savannah Res Stn, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia; University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"Torres, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, Secretaria Coordenacao Posgrad Econ, Campus Darcy Ribeiro,Caixa Postal 4302, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",motorres@hotmail.com.br; Marco.Maneta@mso.umt.edu; howitt@primal.ucdavis.edu; vosti@primal.ucdavis.edu; wwwallender@ucdavis.edu; lhbassoi@cpatsa.embrapa.br; lineu@cpac.embrapa.br,"Maneta, Marco P/A-3123-2009; Rodrigues, Lineu Neiva/B-8401-2015; Bassoi, Luis Henrique/P-7694-2014","Rodrigues, Lineu Neiva/0000-0001-5971-3441; Bassoi, Luis Henrique/0000-0001-9469-8953; Torres, Marcelo/0000-0003-4277-8497",,,,,35,25,28,0,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

However, existing empirical evidence is limited to certain applications and has yet to generalize the effectiveness of this approach as a policy strategy to reduce environmental risks. This study evaluates the disclosure rule of the residential lead paint hazard (Title X) introduced in 1996. This regulation is one of the most prominent environmental disclosure laws, but its effectiveness has been relatively under-investigated. Title X was intended to induce information recipients risk prevention behavior by proclaiming lead paint risk in old homes. Specifically, this study assumed three types of behavioral changes could be induced by Title X(1) testing for lead paint, (2) maintaining painted surfaces in a proper condition, and (3) switching buying choice from old houses to new houses. In addition, using the national American Housing Survey, this study examined whether Title X increased the occurrence of those three behaviors. The results show that Title X increased the probability of homebuyers lead testing and decreased the probability of the existence of peeling paint in old homes. The analyses on households buying choices found that Title X did not result in a substantial switch from old houses to new houses in any socioeconomic status groups. However, it was found that the policy reduced the instances of households with young children occupying old homes. The findings in this study indicate that the policy generally induced more risk management behavior on existing risks and greatly influenced families with young children to such an extent that they changed their buying choice.","N Carolina State Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Dept Publ Adm, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Bae, H (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Dept Publ Adm, Campus Box 8102,212 Caldwell Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",,,,,,,,80,12,19,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

We find a positive cross-listing and negative delisting effect on stock price, both of which dissipate in the long run. No significant changes in the market risk are found for either event. Foreign cross-listing and delisting are associated with increasing and decreasing long term trading volume respectively. Further analysis reveals that firms delist in response to low host market return and low firm trading volume in the host market. The changes in liquidity and market risk from delisting relate those from cross-listing.

Consequently, with a view to manufacture products with minimum impact on environment as well as to influence the conduct of consumers and improve the ecological performance of products and services, the ISO 14000 standards were elaborated for ecological labelling and analysis of life cycle of products and national and regional systems of ecological labelling of products were introduced. Also, in order to support a healthy and non-polluting environment, the European Commission adopted, pursuant to some specialised studies, a legislation related to the assignment of the condition of ecological product to different categories of products and services, having as purpose the environment protection and ensuring a durable consumption. At the same time, in order to improve the range of instruments of environment protection, financial and technical instruments were introduced as well The European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme - EMAS, but also the European ecological label Eco-label. The European ecological label is useful in order to supply to the consumers essential information that may allow them to make choices knowingly, acting as well as a passport that authorises the free circulation of products on the European territory. All the European Union's states adopted the communitarian ecological label. Consequently, the integration of Romanian in the European Union imposed a range of measures related to the procedure of granting the ecological label. In Romania, there is a specific legislative frame concerning the determination of the procedure of granting the ecological label and of their conditions of use. Each group of products to which a label is assigned is governed by a specific legislation that sets forth the granting criteria. The main objectives of article concern the featuring of some fundamental elements related to eco-labelling by emphasizing the main theoretical-methodological and conceptual delimitations, the presentation of this phenomenon on international, European and national level, ending in an analysis related to the attitude of Romanian consumers towards the ecological labelling of products.","[Dinu, Vasile; Schileru, Ion; Atanase, Anca] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dinu, V (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",dinu_cbz@yahoo.com,"Atanase, Anca/AAP-6027-2021; Dinu, Vasile/L-5051-2017","Atanase, Anca/0000-0002-4400-9344;",,,,,13,35,35,0,29,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2012,14.0,31,,,,,8,24,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,900SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300910600002,0

In the most relevant model accounting for interdependencies between women and men's decisions, we derive the gendered responses to traditional push factors. Females and males do not respond with the same intensity to the traditional determinants of labor mobility and gender-specific characteristics of the population at origin. In addition, female willingness to follow their spouse is more pronounced with respect to the male one, other things being equal. Once such interdependencies are accounted for, our analysis reveals that skilled women are not more internationally migratory than skilled men.

(2008) show that exchange rate risk measured by contemporaneous exchange rate changes is priced in the US stock market. However, by construction, their exchange rate risk factor has a strong correlation with the size factor, and their exchange rate sensitivity portfolios have a strong factor structure. To test whether their results are spurious, we carry out two sets of tests. The first set is motivated by Lewellen et al. (2010), where the second set is motivated by the voluminous literature which suggests that stock returns are heavy-tailed (e.g. Rachev and Mitnik, 2000). Different from Kolari et al. (2008), we find that exchange rate risk measured by contemporaneous exchange rate changes is not priced in the US stock market if we use industry portfolios which do not have a strong factor structure as the testing assets or if we use more robust methods to estimate firm-specific exchange rate sensitivity. Our findings therefore suggest that researchers take a new perspective on exchange rate risk. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Harvesting activities may directly impact the habitat, beyond the influence caused by changing the balance between species. When harvesting activities impact stock size and habitat health in different ways, both states must be explicitly considered. A classic fisheries model is embedded in a habitat that exhibits shallow lake dynamics, where carrying capacity depends on habitat health and fishing effort damages the habitat. Hysteresis in the habitat dynamics can manifest itself as multiple steady states for both the dynamic and open access solutions. Numerical explorations of the model suggest that a new fishery in such a setting should often be managed to protect the health of the habitat, while it may not be optimal to restore a fishery in an already degraded habitat.

Measuring tournament incentives as the pay gap between the CEO and the next layer of senior managers, we find a significantly positive relation between firm risk and tournament incentives. Further, we find that greater tournament incentives lead to higher R&D intensity, firm focus, and leverage, but lower capital expenditures intensity. Our results support the hypothesis that option-like features of intra-organizational CEO promotion tournaments provide incentives to senior executives to increase firm risk by following riskier policies. Finally, the compensation levels and structures of executives of financial institutions have received a great deal of scrutiny after the financial crisis.

Using data on cooperative and private farms in El Salvador, we find greater shortfalls in efficiency between cooperatives and private farms, as well as among cooperatives, for coffee, a crop requiring numerous steps in its cultivation, than for maize and sugar, which require fewer steps. Thus the undersupply of effort in cooperatives may be less than differences in productivity suggest, and cooperative agriculture is most likely to be successful where production does not involve many sequential steps.","[Ahn, Seung C.; Brada, Josef C.; Mendez, Jose A.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Ahn, Seung C.] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Sogang University,"Brada, JC (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",josef.brada@asu.edu,"Ahn, seung/KBA-4451-2024","Ahn, seung/0000-0003-0686-5630",,,,,30,12,12,1,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

However, limited rigorous empirical work on the economics of soil conservation exists. This study examines the factors affecting the adoption of mulching technology and its attendant impact on yam output supply and net returns among sampled yam farmers in Osun State, Nigeria. Probit model and propensity score matching were used to analyse the factors influencing the adoption of mulching technology and its impact on yam output and net returns among yam farmers respectively. The study shows that seed quantity and access to credit are the most significant factors influencing the adoption of mulching technology. Yam farmers in the study area who adopted mulching technology were found to experience a higher output supply than non-adopters, which resulted in a positive and significant effect on their output and net return. Hence, policies targeted at increasing yam output through increasing soil fertility need to include mulching technology as a potentially viable option.","[Akinola, A. A.; Sofoluwe, N.

First, the model with non-parametric baseline hazards is unidentifiable with only grouped mortgage duration data. Therefore, assumption on the functional form of the baseline hazard is necessary for any meaningful inference. Second, under some parametric assumptions such as piece-wise constant baseline hazards, the sample likelihood function has an explicit analytical form. Therefore, there is no need for the approximation formula widely adopted in the previous literature. Both Monte Carlo simulations and actual mortgage data are used to demonstrate the adverse impact of the approximation.","[An, Mark Y.; Qi, Zhikun] Fannie Mae, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae),"An, MY (通讯作者)，Fannie Mae, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",mark_y_an@fanniemae.com; zhikun_qi@fanniemae.com,,,,,,,19,13,13,0,7,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

In a long term-based relationship, SMEs have to provide more collaterals and of greater value than in the case of a trust-based relationship. SMEs also enjoy more favourable treatment from banks trusting on managers/owners of the companies, and less by the effects of long relationships.

The result of analysis is finding that the contemporary tax policy in the Czech Republic is suboptimal from the point of view of tax burden distribution between production factors and consumption. Theoretical findings are confirmed by analysis of data from European countries. Every percentage above the EU27 average of consumption taxes share on total tax quota results into increase of GDP growth by 0,04% to 0,05% p.a. The Czech political elite determines the fiscal policy to be popular and recent surveys confirmed Czechs' dislike towards consumption taxes, especially value added tax.

But not all nations are created equal in this regard. The macro response to commodity booms and busts depends both on the structural characteristics of the economy and on the policy framework that is in place. This paper investigates the macro response of a group of commodity-producing nations in episodes of large commodity prices shocks. First, it provides a theoretical framework to analyze how shocks to commodity prices affect the domestic economy. For this the paper uses a simple open-economy model with nominal rigidities and financial frictions. Then it provides empirical evidence (using commodity price boom and bust episodes) that commodity price shocks have a significant impact on output and investment dynamics. Economies with more flexible exchange rate regimes exhibit less pronounced responses of output during these episodes. The paper also provides evidence that the impact of those shocks on investment tends to be larger for economies with less developed financial markets. Moreover, it finds that international reserve accumulation, more stable political systems, and less open capital accounts tend to reduce the real exchange rate appreciation (depreciation) in episodes of commodity price booms (busts).

In particular, variation across firms and through time of estimated productivity parameters for physical assets and managerial input and corresponding variation in optimal compensation contract and firm size combine to deliver the well-known hump-shaped relation between Tobin's Q and managerial ownership. To assess the effectiveness of standard econometric approaches to the endogeneity problem, we apply those remedies to panel data generated from the model. The unfortunate conclusion is that, at least in the ownership-performance context, proxy variables, fixed effects, and instrumental variables do not generally provide reliable solutions to simultaneity bias.

In Britain, the real price of lighting fell dramatically (3,000-fold between 1800 and 2000) and quality rose. Along with rises in real income and population, these developments meant that total consumption of lighting was 40,000 times greater by 2000 than in 1800. The paper presents estimates of the income and price elasticities of demand for lighting services over the past three hundred years, and explores how they evolved. Income and price elasticities increased dramatically (to 3.5 and - 1.7, respectively) between the 1840s and the 1890s and fell rapidly in the twentieth century. Even in the twentieth century and at the beginning of the twenty-first century, rebound effects in the lighting market still appear to be potentially important. This paper provides a first case study of the long run effects of socio-economic change and technological innovation on the consumption of energy services in the UK We suggest that understanding the evolution of the demand for energy services and the factors that influence it contributes to a better understanding of future energy uses and associated greenhouse gas emissions.","[Fouquet, Roger] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao Bizkaia 48008, Spain; [Fouquet, Roger] IKERBASQUE Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao Bizkaia 48008, Spain; [Pearson, Peterj.

The Built Environment and Active School Transport (BEAT) project was undertaken to explore the ways in which the transport-BE interface gives rise to the use of active or non-active travel modes as the primary travel mode for school trips. We wanted to know how children experienced and understood the transport-built environment relationship. We selected four Toronto elementary school sites in areas that differed with respect to socio-economic status and built environment. We conducted photovoice interviews with 41 children, 21 who walked to/from school, and 20 who were driven. Adopting a thematic analytic approach, this paper examines the similarities and differences in the visual narratives of children's transport geographies and discusses some of the benefits of using photovoice with children in a study of the transport-built environment relationship.

While some rules perform better than others, the authors demonstrate that inflation is more stable after a persistent productivity shock when monetary policy targets the output growth rate (not the output gap) or the price-level path (not the inflation rate). Both the output growth and price-level path rules generate less volatility in output and inflation following a persistent productivity shock compared with the Taylor rule.

Regionalization and globalization have reduced transaction costs through economic integration in different ways and degrees, in the first case by attracting regional countries and in other cases by attracting almost all countries around the world. Growth and trade theories have shown that the processes of regional and global integration have had an enormous impact on trade intensity and labor division between the countries involved. Any transaction includes direct and indirect costs, in different degrees. These direct and indirect costs vary according the location of transaction, in an area of regional integration such as European Union or worldwide. The commercial results show that the main driving forces for a better integration in European trade are: technological progress, information, communications and transport, and the institutional progress through national and supranational commercial policy measures.

Both single-equation and system estimates of the model consistently suggest the long-run crowding-in effects of public capital. The error-correction as well as over-parameterized level-VAR models consistently suggest uni-directional Granger-causality from public to private capital. The support for the significant crowding-in effects of public capital has important implications for the formulation of long-term growth and development strategies. It underlines the need to accelerate public infrastructure to induce the distortions-free and market-driven increases in private capital and to attract the inflow of foreign direct investment. The inflows of foreign capital have witnessed perceptible increases since the beginning of the 1990s. The geographical and sectoral distributions of FDI inflows remain asymmetric and skewed in favor of the select regions and the services industries.

Models are tested using data from a stated preference survey involving 432 matched pairs of married parents. Analysis builds on a collective model of resource allocation that incorporates household production of perceived health risks and allows for differences in preferences and risk perceptions between parents. Results are consistent with Pareto efficiency within the household. Thus, for a given proportionate reduction in health risk, (1) parents are willing to pay equal amounts at the margin to protect themselves and the child and (2) parents' choices for their children are based on household valuations, rather than individual valuations. The marginal willingness to pay of mothers and fathers for health risk protection appears insensitive to shifts in their relative contributions to the household budget.","[Adamowicz, Wiktor; Zinner, David] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environ Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Dickie, Mark; Gerking, Shelby] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Econ, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Gerking, Shelby] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Gerking, Shelby] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Veronesi, Marcella] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Veronesi, Marcella] ETH, Inst Environm Decis Professorship Environm Policy, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Alberta; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Tilburg University; Tilburg University; University of Verona; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Adamowicz, W (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environ Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",vic.adamowicz@ualberta.ca,"Veronesi, Marcella/JAX-3674-2023","Veronesi, Marcella/0000-0001-5520-8093; Adamowicz, Wiktor/0000-0002-7634-2985",,,,,58,15,15,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

A Fishing Game to Study the Value of Endangered Species,ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Endangered species; Valuation; Behavior economics; Fishery game; Resource management,ECOSYSTEM,"Previous research proposes that human beings are motivated to protect endangered species for various reasons: consumptive use value, non-consumptive use value, non-use value, and intrinsic value. However, it has been difficult to tease apart these values at the behavioral level. Using an innovative fishing game, we study an important tradeoff between one kind of use value (monetary value) and one kind of non-use value (existence value) of the endangered Steller sea lion. In the fishing game, players make repeated decisions on how much pollock to harvest for profit in each period in a dynamic ecosystem. The population of the endangered sea lion depends on the population of pollock, which in turn depends on the harvesting behavior of humans. The data show that in general, people responded to the financial value (as a tourist resource), but not the existence value, of the sea lion by cutting down commercial fish harvesting to keep more sea lions in the ecosystem. However, not all people behaved the same regarding the existence value. Females displayed a higher existence value than males, as did people who reported stronger pro-environmental attitudes than those with weaker pro-environmental attitudes. Our findings have multiple implications on public opinion elicitation and public policy design.","[Gong, Min] Altisource, Winston Salem, NC 27103 USA; [Gong, Min] Columbia Univ, Ctr Res Environm Decis, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Heal, Geoffrey] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Gong, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Ctr Res Environm Decis, 406 Schermerhorn Hall,MC 5501,1190 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mingong@gmail.com,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0951516] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,21,1,1,1,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In recent years, so-called pay or waive compensation legislation was passed in a number of US states, requiring governments to compensate property owners for losses due to land-use regulations or grant exemptions from the regulations in lieu of compensation. We provide an overview of the compensation statutes in six US states, discuss the economic issues raised by the statutes, and examine the effects of the statutes in practice. Although these laws require that just compensation be estimated accurately and consistently, measuring the effects of land-use regulations on property values is extremely challenging in practice. We find that rather than providing relief to property owners unfairly burdened by land-use regulations, the compensation statutes appear primarily to discourage local governments from developing and implementing land-use regulations.

There is lack of assessments on inter-city travel which has less redundancy and is more exposed to extreme weather threats. In addition, much of the research has been carried out in developed countries. This paper provides new perspectives by investigating how people adapt their inter-city travel behaviour to flooding impacts in Bangladesh. With an orthogonal design of three flooding scenarios, questionnaire data were collected in 14 coastal and inland areas. Results of the statistical analyses identify the significant impacts of flooding on people's inter-city travel and reveal significant differences in attitudes and responses to flooding and extreme weather in coastal compared to inland locations. The main factors significantly affecting travel behaviour choice are road disruption, isolation by flood water, and flood frequency. These factors are felt differently in coastal and inland locations. The most common responses are cancelling trips or changing destinations. It is recommended that when making flooding adaptation decisions, it is important to protect road infrastructure and guarantee accessible routes in coastal areas, while offering more flood adaptation education to the inland people.

We consider whether royalty payments are simply the means for franchisors to acquire revenue from franchisees (revenue hypothesis), or are to preserve incentives for the franchisors to exert appropriate efforts (incentive hypothesis). We propose a new variant of the revenue hypothesis, which is derived from an elementary model of franchise contracts with input sales. We hypothesize that the royalty rate is higher when the total margin ratio of the franchise chain is higher (when the sales revenue ratio is lower). We use OLS to explore data on 118 Japanese franchise chains in 2001 and find evidence supporting this hypothesis, which provides an explanation for higher royalty rates for service-type franchises.

We utilize data from the limit order book and transactions in individual stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. We demonstrate that, on the one hand, the risk of non-execution increases, while the risk of being picked off, on the other hand, decreases when: 1) the depth on the incoming investor's side becomes thicker, 2) the bid-ask spread becomes narrower, 3) volatility declines, and 4) the depth on the opposite side to the incoming investor becomes thicker. In addition, we report asymmetric determinants of non-execution and picking-off risks between buy and sell limit orders, as well as among our sample firms. We interpret the asymmetry to be attributed to differences in transaction volume and order book thickness between buy and sell sides of the order book as well as among the firms. More transactions lead to higher quote competitions among limit order traders, increasing the thickness of the order book inside of the spread. It then decreases the rate of executions and of being picked off for limit orders existing outside of the spread. Our results suggest that real-time information on order book and transactions is highly valuable to stock investors, who trade individual securities and manage a portfolio of individual stocks, such as ETFs. Our findings assist real stock investors in reducing the monitoring cost, making more profitable order choices among market and limit orders and exposing/hiding/canceling/revising limit orders, and understanding the price formation process in an order-driven market. They are crucial for investors for better risk management in actual stock markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using actively managed equity mutual funds between 2005 and 2011, we find that Chinese investors generally have no mutual fund selection ability, a. result contrary to the smart money effect in the United States. We show that mutual funds that receive more new money subsequently underperform significantly. The findings are robust to several risk-adjusted performance measures. The unique data of China provide separate accounts of institutional and individual investors' new money flowing into and out of mutual funds, allowing us to examine the mutual fund selection ability of institutional and individual investors. We document that institutional investors exhibit a smart money effect, that is, they are able to move new money into (out of) future good (poor) performers. In contrast, individual investors exhibit a dumb money effect. Our results provide useful information for regulators to review their rules, especially for the protection of individual investors regarding mutual fund investing in China.

The model introduces an interaction between capital adjustment costs and trade costs in different sectors of production, and then pins down the direction and the size of the effect those interactions have on the gap between the returns to labor in the skilled-labor-abundant (North) and unskilled-labor-abundant (South) countries. The results indicate that at low capital adjustment costs, higher trade volumes lead to a decrease in the rate of skilled migration, though the decrease is smaller than it would be if there were zero capital adjustment costs.

This study reveals that PE and VC financing have positive impacts on single entity business establishments' net sales and employment growth. The impact of PE financing on establishments' growth is slower and smaller than VC financing. However, we find that the benefit of PE financing lasts longer than VC financing. We also find that ethnic minority, female, and foreign business owners are less likely to receive PE and VC financing. Finally, we find evidence that although establishments with government contracts are more likely to receive PE and VC financing, those contracts fail to produce marginal post-funding growth and employment benefits.

EPSs stem from an unexpected event (unanticipated need or timing of a need), as well as high product importance, which are associated with a short time frame for consumer decision-making. Our conceptual review integrates largely disconnected strands of research and theories relevant to EPSs and offers a series of independent propositions to understand how these situations might affect consumer decision-making, specifically heuristic versus reflective information processing in product evaluation. We discuss changes induced by the buying context in terms of regulatory focus, perceived time pressure, and stress. Our propositions further account for purchase involvement in the form of product importance, purchase risk, and product substitutability. Finally, we consider how individual differences (expertise and trust) may affect evaluation processes. Our discussion reflects on the implications of our model, avenues for future research, and how an understanding of EPSs can be used to improve managerial practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Both candidates were populists who rose to prominence in the context of public disillusionment with incumbent president Yudhoyono; Prabowo, however, condemned Indonesia's democratic system and promised to take Indonesia in a more authoritarian direction. We trace democracy's close call through five phases: the dying months of Yudhoyono's presidency, the rise of populist alternatives, the parliamentary elections of April 2014, the July presidential campaign, and the aftermath. We attribute the strength of Prabowo's campaign to superior organisational and financial support, while Jokowi's victory rested upon strong identification with him among poor and rural voters. Also determining the outcome was the fact that public satisfaction with democracy remained strong, undermining the effectiveness of Prabowo's authoritarian-populist message. Nevertheless, democracy's future remains uncertain, given that Prabowo and his supporters now control a sufficiently large number of parliamentary seats to continue promoting a rollback of democratic reforms.","[Aspinall, Edward; Mietzner, Marcus] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Aspinall, E (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,16,35,36,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The crisis did not hit all markets in the same way. We measure the strength and direction of linkages between 16 EU sovereign bond markets using a factor-augmented version of the VAR model in Diebold and Yilmaz (2009). We then provide a novel test for contagion by applying the multivariate structural break test of Qu and Perron (2007) on this FAVAR detecting significant sudden changes in shock transmission. Results indicate substantial spillover, especially between EMU countries, with Belgium, Italy and Spain being key markets during the financial crisis. Contagion has been a rather rare phenomenon limited to a few well defined moments of uncertainty on financial assistance packages for Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Most of the frequent surges in market co-movement are driven by larger shocks rather than by contagion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, this paper questions the efficiency of infrastructure privatization policies. Through a survey of the empirical literature (more than 60 studies), it provides an exhaustive assessment of the effects of these policies. Overall results show that microeconomic effects of infrastructure privatization in DCs are mixed and that macroeconomic impacts are largely disappointing because they do not comply with the targeted goals. More precisely, it appears that the efficiency of infrastructure privatization closely depends on the income level of developing countries. This reflects the impact of the quality of the economic, political and institutional environment. In particular, the presence of an independent regulation agency and the corruption level are major determinants of the success of infrastructure privatization.","Univ Paris 01, CNRS, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Foch, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CNRS, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",arthur.foch@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,81,0,0,0,23,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We distinguish between investments that reduce industrialized countries' abatement costs and investments that reduce developing countries' abatement costs. Unlike earlier contributions, we include global trading in emission permits. This changes the nature of the game. With global permit trading, industrialized countries should in many cases invest strategically in technologies that only reduce abatement costs at home. This comes in addition to investments abroad.

We evaluate this policy experiment and find that the auctioning of licenses without an obligation to divest has no discernible effect on prices. An obligation to divest lowers prices by 1.3-2.3% at divested sites. Moreover, prices decrease by 0.9-1.2% at sites nearby.

Firms in this region use creative and physical capital to produce output. We model learning by doing formally and our analysis of the working of this creative region leads to four results. First, we derive analytic expressions for the growth rates of physical capital and technology. Second, we draw phase diagrams and show that in the steady state, the preceding two growth rates must be equal. Third, we show that the economy of our creative region converges to a balanced growth path (BGP) in which the growth rates of physical capital, technology, and the output of the final good are identical. Finally, we investigate the impact that an increase in the savings rate has on the economic growth of our creative region in the long run. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Students' satisfaction is influenced by the degree to which higher education institutions meet or exceed their expectations. Higher education managers in general and business higher education managers in particular need to determine the students' level of satisfaction in order to assess their performance. This, however, is difficult to achieve because satisfaction is an abstract concept and no clear consensus exists over its definition and measurement. Although, on account of education's complexity and peculiarities, the investigation of satisfaction with educational services has been laborious, the literature review reveals a growing number of papers dealing with this issue. These papers consider the factors affecting satisfaction mostly as individual coefficients and ignore the latent relationships between constructs. However, since the determinants of partial student satisfaction simultaneously manifest in the overall satisfaction, it may be considered that an individual approach to them, would partially cover the issue being studied. For this reason, the purpose of this paper is to develop a model for measuring student satisfaction with business education services, a model which should be approached holistically and whose latent structure should be taken into account. The proposed measurement tool, based on the study of the literature, was tested on the students of a business educational institution and the results confirm the goodness-of-fit, reliability and validity of the model. The developed tool encompasses a number of factors that allow the assessment of student satisfaction with a wide range of services provided by business education institutions and relate to: educational process (syllabus, training of teaching staff, examination policy), administrative staff, admission process (information, staff), management of the faculty, image of the faculty, library, general information, cafeteria, campus climate, tutors, collaboration between faculty and business environment, international cooperation, leisure activities supported by the faculty.","[Bacila, Mihai-Florin; Pop, Marcel Ciprian; Scridon, Mircea Andrei; Ciornea, Raluca] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Pop, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",marcel.pop@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Bacila, Mihai/AAZ-7530-2020; Pop, Marcel Ciprian/U-6186-2017; Scridon, Mircea Andrei/J-7270-2013; CIORNEA, RALUCA/B-1073-2015","Bacila, Mihai/0000-0002-4211-0721; Scridon, Mircea Andrei/0000-0001-8243-8695; CIORNEA, RALUCA/0000-0002-0222-6738; Pop, Ciprian Marcel/0000-0002-9320-5528",,,,,60,8,10,0,33,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,841,856,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400011,0

While this may be true, the content of such programs bears equal influence in skill acquirement, which in turn, has an impact on managerial performance (Perry, 1989). The contemporary economic and social environment poses numerous and complex challenges to public leaders, who need to be equipped with the adequate set of skills and competencies in order to have a proper response. The present paper aims to find out the whether the current educational programs from the business field can be a solution for preparing the next generation of public (and private) leaders. My argument is that the latest developments in public management reform (New Public Management, Good Governance and Public Entrepreneurship) combined with new demands for effectiveness, efficiency and high quality public services could increase the relevance of such programs. In support for this I presented a series of research results that point to a set of common leadership challenges that transcend the public-private divide. Finally I explored the offerings of the top 5 MBA programs in the world to see whether this is reflected in their educational programs. Not surprisingly, three out of the five programs analysed offer dual degree programs that combine business and public management education as a solution for the leadership challenges that lay ahead.","Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Ticlau, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",ticlau@fspac.ro,,"Ticlau, Tudor/0000-0002-5148-2420",,,,,35,2,3,0,26,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,885,901,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400014,0

From realized excess returns on synthetic variance and skewness swap contracts, we infer that variance and (to a lesser extent) skewness risk premia are negative and time varying.

Our findings clearly indicate that growth with redistribution (lower income inequality) was the key to reducing poverty continuously and in an important manner during 2000-2006. However, after 2006, decreasing per-capita income, coupled with the persistently high inequality (Gini of 52%), caused the reversal of the favorable trend observed since 1996, raising poverty to pre-2002 levels. Consequently, it is argued that, for Mexico, a middle-income country exhibiting quite low growth rates and high inequality levels, the further improvement in its distribution of income and assets is essential if the economy is to succeed in making a real dent in poverty. For that purpose, the implementation of an active pro-poor growth policy should be strongly encouraged. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This indicates a possible and until now unexplored link between social trust and central-bank independence. Our empirical findings, based on data from 149 countries, confirm such a link, in the form of a u-shaped relationship. We suggest that two factors help explain this finding: the need for this kind of reform and the ability with which it can be implemented. At low trust, the need for central-bank independence is sufficiently strong to bring it about, in spite of a low ability to undertake reform. At high trust, the ability to undertake reform is sufficiently strong to bring high independence about, in spite of a low need for it.

Instead, this paper builds a model of strikes where a perception of unfairness provides an expressive benefit to vote for a strike. The asymmetry of information is now reversed such that management are uninformed about the emotionality of union members. The model predicts that larger union size increases both wage offers and the incidence of strikes. An empirical test using UK data provides support for the predictions. In particular, union size is positively correlated with the incidence of strikes and other industrial actions, even when asymmetric information regarding profitability is controlled for.

The results suggest high-growth firms perceive problems in six areas: recruitment, skill shortages, obtaining finance, cash flow, management skills and finding suitable premises. Potential high-growth firms feel held back by the economy, obtaining finance, cash flow and their management skills, but are less likely to perceive regulation is a problem.

Second, I document a significant increase in advertising spending prior to insider sales and a significant decrease in the subsequent year. Additional analyses suggest that the inverted V-shaped pattern in advertising spending around insider sales is most consistent with managers' opportunistically adjusting firm advertising to exploit the temporary return effect to their own benefit.","[Lou, Dong] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lou, D (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Finance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",d.lou@lse.ac.uk,"Lou, Dong/AAZ-5994-2021","Lou, Dong/0000-0002-5623-4338",,,,,69,187,223,10,111,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

There are two plausible reasons why misgovernance might intensify around elections: (i) attention and effort of elected officials is directed to campaigning instead of governing; and (ii) the misgovernance may benefit special interests and serve as a pork barrel transfer that is hard to monitor or control. Empirically, we find that redistributive politics are likely a dominant cause of electoral misgovernance. In the case of wildfires we also find evidence that political competition tends to increase electoral misgovernance; furthermore, electoral misgovernance helps incumbents get reelected. While misgovernance may manifest differently among countries, our analysis suggests that electoral cycles everywhere may be much more multifaceted and harmful than previous literature suggests.","[Skouras, Spyros; Christodoulakis, Nicos] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Skouras, S (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens, Greece.",skouras@aueb.gr,,,,,,,48,22,22,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2014,159.0,3-4,,,,,533,559,,10.1007/s11127-013-0071-0,0.0,,,27,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AD3PD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333157200013,0

Using quantile regressions, we find that higher market variance is significantly related to large future carry trade losses, which is consistent with the unwinding of the carry trade in times of high volatility. The decomposition of market variance into average variance and average correlation shows that the predictive power of market variance is primarily due to average variance since average correlation is not significantly related to carry trade returns.

Therefore, future integration of route choice behaviour by route planners and measures to improve liveability and safety standards should be pursued. The Spatial Plan for Flanders, which is the overarching spatial policy plan in the northern part of Belgium, determines a system of road categories aimed at optimising the liveability of sensitive areas, such as residential neighbourhoods or school precincts, without jeopardizing accessibility. This paper examines to what extent routes proposed by commercial route planners differ from more socially desirable routes that are guided by the policy principles of road categorisation in Flanders as proposed by the plan. Results show that commercial route-planners' routes choose more often roads of the lowest category than socially acceptable. However, for some of the assessed connections, the socially desired alternative is a feasible route as well, which is not excessively increasing time consumption or distance travelled. It is concluded that the implementation of the prevailing road categorisation system in Flanders in routing algorithms has the potential to promote more sustainable route choices, while infrastructural measures that discourage cut-through traffic may help materialising the categorisation system.

Transit connectivity considers in-vehicle time, access/egress times, waiting time, service reliability, frequency, and 'seamless' transfers along multi-modal paths. In addition, transit connectivity weighs the impedance components according to their relative importance to travelers. The assessment of equity was performed for the multi-modal transit system in the Greater Copenhagen Area, renowned for its transit-oriented finger-plan. The assessment method used a GIS representation of the network (i.e., service lines, timetables, metro stations, train stations, and bus stops), and transit assignment results (i.e., level-of-service times, passenger flows). The assessment method proved effective in calculating location-based and potential-accessibility measures and Gini coefficients of inequality in the Greater Copenhagen Area. Results show that the transit-oriented development contributes to spatial equity with high connectivity in densely populated zones, vertical equity with comparable connectivity in high income and low income zones, inter-generational equity with good connectivity provision for students to higher-education and job opportunities. Also, results show that the north-west 'finger' is less equitable with lower connectivity for low population density and lower connectivity to higher-education opportunities regardless of the high number of students.

The lending function with a loan guarantee of the bank creates the need to model equity as a down-and-out call (DOC) option with a capital injection due to the bank in distress. We provide validation of the DOC model by showing that the values of down-and-out call at various levels of bailout are economically significant for the distressed bank. We show that a loan guarantee, a capital injection, or a combination of the two tends to be successful in improving bank equity return. From an equity-return perspective, the bank prefers the combined package to either the solo bailout. Alternatively, from an equity-risk perspective, the government (and thus the taxpayers) prefers either the solo bailout to the combined package. The results may cast doubt on the effectiveness of the combined rescue program to simultaneously exert equity return-increasing and equity risk-reducing effects on the distressed bank.

However, there is little evidence on whether there are asymmetric effects of an appreciation versus depreciation. This article uses firm-level data over a period of a large currency appreciation followed by a large depreciation to examine possible asymmetries in firm survival and entry resulting in the endurance of exchange rate effects. We find that when real currency appreciations precede depreciations, appreciations reduce firm entry rates to a greater degree than depreciations increase that rate; but appreciations reduce the probability of firm survival at a magnitude not significantly different from the increase in probability that results from a depreciation. Taken together, we find that a 10% reciprocal episode of exchange rate appreciation and depreciation will result in 1,647 (5.2%) fewer firms compared with a regime with no change in the exchange rate. These results are consistent with exchange rate hysteresis whereby a transitory exchange rate shock has a permanent effect.

If market discipline is improved, we should see a lower discount for size on yield spreads, particularly for banks identified as too-big-to-fail (TBTF) or systemically important (SIFI). Using secondary market subordinated debt transactions we find that the size discount is reduced by 47% and TBTF discount is reduced by 94% after the DFA. The DFA has been effective in reducing, but not in eliminating the size and TBTF discounts on yield spreads. Market discipline of banks appears to have improved further after the rating criteria changes by Moody's.

Regulators and debt market observers have criticized the issuer-pay model for creating an independence problem. However, the issuer-pay model allows for economic bonding between rating agencies and issuers through explicit contractual arrangements, which should improve the flow of nonpublic information. Using a difference-in-difference research design, I find that more optimistic ratings by issuer-pay rating agencies predict greater future profitability, differences between the ratings of issuer-pay and investor-pay rating agencies are associated with narrower secondary bond market bid-ask spreads, and that issuer-pay rating agencies become relatively more accurate and timely predictors of default compared to investor-pay agencies after the adoption of issuer-pay. These results reinterpret the recent findings of optimistic ratings by Jiang et al. (2012) as consistent with more informative bond ratings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the majority of compliant firms (approximately 56%) add independent directors following SOX. However, we find a nontrivial number of firms (approximately 26%) actually decrease the number of independent directors to move closer to the stated 50% requirement. For firms that decrease independence, the CEO turnover performance sensitivity significantly decreases following SOX.

Hyperbolic discounting is a conventional way to model impulsive decision making, and short planning horizons have been used to represent myopia. One might expect that interacting both mechanisms within the same model would compound the inadequacy of saving. However, our key finding takes the form of a paradox: hyperbolic discounting does not affect consumption and saving allocations if the planning horizon is short and fixed, although it will affect allocations if the planning horizon is equal to the remaining life span.

We extend the classic Rogoff-Siebert model to show that political budget cycles are possible in a legislative context with rational voters. We then demonstrate that the development of a strong party system can restrain political budget cycles in a majoritarian electoral system. Finally, we follow prior work in using vote share volatility as a measure of the institutionalization of the party system. Using newly collected vote-share data for 433 elections for 90 democracies from 1980-2007, we calculate a measure of party institutionalization.

We test our theory using a field experiment involving voting to provide a public good. Experimental results are consistent theoretical predictions and cast doubt on the relevance of a large experimental literature using inconsequential questions and non-incentive-compatible mechanisms to make inferences about CV.

Pretax subsidies, which arise when energy consumers pay less than the supply cost of energy, are high in many developing and emerging economies. Although pretax subsidies are not prevalent in advanced economies, they have large tax subsidies. These arise when energy is taxed below the rate of other consumption goods and are not high enough to capture the negative externalities from energy consumption, including the effects on climate change, local pollution, and traffic congestion. Posttax subsidies (the sum of pretax and tax subsidies) are estimated at about US$2 trillion (2.9 percent of global GDP) in 2011, with advanced economies accounting for a substantial share of the total. Energy subsidies aggravate fiscal imbalances, depress growth, damage the environment, and reinforce inequality. Country experience suggests that well-designed energy subsidy reform strategies can win public support. A far-reaching communications strategy, appropriately phased energy price increases, and targeted mitigating measures to protect the poor are among the most important elements of these strategies.","[Clements, Benedict; Coady, David; Fabrizio, Stefania; Gupta, Sanjeev; Shang, Baoping] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Clements, B (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",bclements@imf.org; dcoady@imf.org; sfabrizio@imf.org; sgupta@imf.org; bshang@imf.org,,"Clements, Benedict/0000-0001-8710-8927",,,,,27,20,20,1,15,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

The motivation lies not only on the widespread consensus that the VIX is a barometer of the overall market sentiment as to what concerns investors' risk appetite, but also on the fact that there are many trading strategies that rely on the VIX index for hedging and speculative purposes. Preliminary analysis suggests that the VIX index displays long-range dependence. This is well in line with the strong empirical evidence in the literature supporting long memory in both options-implied and realized variances. We thus resort to both parametric and semiparametric heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) processes for modeling and forecasting purposes. Our main findings are as follows. First, we confirm the evidence in the literature that there is a negative relationship between the VIX index and the S&P 500 index return as well as a positive contemporaneous link with the volume of the S&P 500 index. Second, the term spread has a slightly negative long-run impact in the VIX index, when possible multicollinearity and endogeneity are controlled for. Finally, we cannot reject the linearity of the above relationships, neither in sample nor out of sample. As for the latter, we actually show that it is pretty hard to beat the pure HAR process because of the very persistent nature of the VIX index. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In a first step, we focus on the case of a single decision maker, and make use of an approach pioneered by Kimball (2014) for studying the impact of a marginal change in risk in optimal stochastic control models. Using a simple model with only one state variable and one control variable, we show how the optimal carbon tax responds to an increase in risk. It is found that the third derivative of the decay function of the stock of pollution may play a decisive role. In a second step, we investigate the extent to which Kimball's approach may be extended to the case of stochastic dynamic games. We show how strategic interactions complicate the task of evaluating the effects of an increase in risk. Interestingly, in a dynamic model of the tragedy of the commons, we find that an increase in risk can increase welfare even though all agents are risk averse. The reason is that higher risk can cause agents to be more conservative, and this mitigates the tragedy of the commons.","[Grafton, Quentin; Kompas, Tom] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Ngo Van Long] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",Australian National University; McGill University,"Grafton, Q (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Kompas, T/F-5930-2010; Kompas, Tom/M-8851-2019; Grafton, Quentin/AAS-2316-2021","Kompas, Tom/0000-0002-0665-0966; Grafton, Quentin/0000-0002-0048-9083",,,,,32,0,0,0,13,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

Those clauses were primarily designed to reduce contractors' uncertainty without considering the impact of such initiatives on bidding and the budget. We analyze a newly constructed, detailed panel of observations on bids for construction contracts and compare bidding behavior across periods and projects, and across items within projects. Estimates from a difference-in-differences approach, indicate that bidding becomes more aggressive and less dispersed after the implementation of this policy. The difference is more pronounced when we consider itemized bids than overall project bids.

Disentangling intermediation and size effects of financial systems,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financial intermediation; Financial sector size; Finance growth nexus; Volatility,STOCK MARKETS; GROWTH; DIVERSIFICATION; VOLATILITY; RISK; CONSTRAINTS; IMPACT; BANKS,"Financial systems all over the world have grown dramatically over recent decades. But is more finance necessarily better? And what concept of financial system - a focus on its size, including both intermediation and other auxiliary non-intermediation activities, or a focus on traditional intermediation activity - is relevant for its impact on real sector outcomes? This paper assesses the relationship between the size of the financial system and intermediation, on the one hand, and GDP per capita growth and growth volatility, on the other hand. Based on a sample of 77 countries for the period 1980-2007, we find that intermediation activities increase growth and reduce volatility in the long run. An expansion of the financial sectors along other dimensions has no long-run effect on real sector outcomes. Over shorter time horizons a large financial sector stimulates growth at the cost of higher volatility in high-income countries. Intermediation activities stabilize the economy in the medium run especially in low-income countries. As this is an initial exploration of the link between financial system indicators and growth and volatility, we focus on OLS regressions, leaving issues of endogeneity and omitted variable biases for future research.

Assembly markets for maize are found to be highly competitive in terms of the number of traders operating and marketing margins. Farmers' market access conditions in remote areas are particularly improved by the operation of assembly traders. Direct state operations in markets have sometimes unintentionally exacerbated market access conditions for farmers through their effects on rural assembly markets. While smallholder farmers face important marketing challenges, the brightest prospects for effectively addressing them require greater support for the development of competitive assembly markets rather than supplanting them.

The historically unique monetary expansion has not yet fully reached M-2. Using a cointegration approach, we aim to show the hidden risks for the future development of M-2 and correspondingly prices.

It studies a semi-open economy where the private sector has no access to international capital markets but the central bank has full access. Moreover, it assumes limited financial development generating a large demand for saving instruments by the private sector. The paper analyzes the optimal exchange rate policy by modeling the central bank as a Ramsey planner. Its main result is that in a growth acceleration episode it is optimal to have an initial real depreciation of the currency combined with an accumulation of reserves, which is consistent with the Chinese experience. This depreciation is followed by an appreciation in the long run. The paper also shows that the optimal exchange rate path is close to the one that would result in an economy with full capital mobility and no central bank intervention.","[Bacchetta, Philippe] Univ Lausanne HEC, Swiss Finance Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bacchetta, Philippe; Benhima, Kenza] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Benhima, Kenza] Univ Lausanne HEC, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Kalantzis, Yannick] Banque France, Paris, France",Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Bacchetta, P (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne HEC, Swiss Finance Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland.",,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017","Benhima, Kenza/0000-0002-7765-3398; Bacchetta, Philippe/0000-0001-9233-5040",,,,,25,5,5,0,10,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The period observation spans 2005-2012, representing a period of economic growth, crisis and stagnation and is expressed as GDP per capita. To depict the situation of households as the main variable, the total gross income as reported in the primary survey Statistics on Income and Living Conditions of the European Union (EU SILC) has been used. The paper uses these empirical data and through mathematical functions describes the evolution of the household income situation. Similarly, an empirical investigation of total household expenditure for each commodity according to COICOP describes how the level of household spending has trended. The parameters of the selected functions allow us to analyse the nature of changes in both variables during the observed period of time. The paper aims to answer whether the function that best describes the trending of incomes and expenditures of households and the growing annual increases in the gap in both observed variables (resembling an open pair of scissors), can be used to describe the movement of both variables for different groups of households by quintile classification with an emphasis on households at risk of poverty.

This paper presents a model of irreversible destruction where exchange rate intervention may be justified if the export sector is financially constrained. However, the criterion for intervention is not whether there are bankruptcies or not, but whether these can cause a large exchange rate overshooting once the factors behind the appreciation subside. The optimal policy includes ex-ante and ex-post interventions. Ex-ante (that is, during the appreciation phase) interventions have limited effects if the financial resources in the export sector are relatively abundant. In this case the bulk of the intervention takes place ex-post, and is concentrated in the first period of the depreciation phase. In contrast, if the financial constraint in the export sector is tight, the policy is shifted toward ex-ante intervention and it is optimal to lean against the appreciation.","[Caballero, Ricardo J.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lorenzoni, Guido] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Northwestern University,"Caballero, RJ (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1024619] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,32,19,21,1,6,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Within this research stream, the process of local market knowledge transfer has been widely discussed. However, the issues of the source (especially the internal and external sources) for MNCs to obtain local market knowledge have not been well studied, especially in the emerging market context. Also, the consequence of choosing a local market knowledge source, which interests practitioners more, is rarely appeared in the literature. This study aims to be the first conceptual paper discussing both antecedents and outcomes of choosing either inside or outside local market knowledge source in the emerging market context. The framework we propose, using MNCs as the unit of analysis, includes both micro-environmental factors (organizational culture and the home market performance of MNCs) and macro-environmental factor (the openness of the economic system in the emerging market) that impact the local market knowledge source choice (insider or outsider) of MNCs. In addition, we discuss how the extent of the environmental turbulence (especially market turbulence) in the emerging market moderates the relationship between either inside or outside local market knowledge source and the performance of MNCs in the emerging market. We believe our framework is a parsimonious and systematically clear way of explaining what is actually a complicated phenomenon and we hope that this paper provides a conceptual framework, which stimulates subsequent empirical studies.","William Paterson Univ, Mkt, Cotsakos Coll Business, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA",,"Chao, MCH (通讯作者)，William Paterson Univ, Mkt, Cotsakos Coll Business, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA.",,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,0,ASIAN BUSINESS ASSOC,CENTRL HONG KONG,"9 FLR, ANTNA TOWER, 148 DES VOEUX RD, CENTRL HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2357-190X,2357-1918,,P CHIN MARK INT CONF,,,2014,,,,,,,98,114,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359385500005,0

If our hypothesis will be proved, previous evidence about significant indirect effects of money illusion, causing significant long-lasting deviations of the economy from equilibrium after the shock, might be significantly alleviated, weakening thereby predictions of the New Keynesian model. Our findings suggest that even well-educated individuals do not have the ability to pierce the veil of money and do not form expectations properly after a fully anticipated monetary shock.

Asian Tsunami of December 2004 affected many SMEs in southern Sri Lanka. The study was developed to identify the main issues encountered by the Tsunami affected SMEs in Southern Sri Lanka in the process of their post-tsunami recovery. The study: a) identifies tsunami damage and loss in micro and SMEs in the Galle district; b) ascertains the type of benefits received from various parties by the affected micro and SMEs; c) evaluates the problems and difficulties faced by the beneficiary organizations in the benefit distribution process; and d) recommends strategies and policies for the tsunami-affected micro and SMEs for them to become self-sustaining within a reasonable time frame. Fifty randomly selected tsunami-affected micro and SMEs were surveyed for this study. Interviews were conducted in person with the business owners in order to identify the damages, recovery, rehabilitation, re-establishment and difficulties faced in the benefit distribution process. The analysis identifies that the benefits were given the wrong priorities and that they were not sufficient for the recovery process. In addition, the many governance-related problems that arose while distributing benefits are discussed. Overall, the business recovery rate was approximately 65%, and approximately 88% of business organizations were sole proprietorships. Therefore, the policies of the tsunami relief agencies should adequately address the needs of sole proprietorship business requirements. Consideration should also be given to strengthen the capacity and skills of the entrepreneurs by improving operational, technological, management and marketing skills and capabilities.

Design/methodology/approach - We conduct detailed empirical analysis of the determinants of firm level exposure and their impact using panel regression techniques and conduct several robustness tests to confirm the validity of these results. Findings - Among other factors, exchange rate volatility appears as a significant determinant of average firm level exposure with the direction of relationship supporting the presence of Moral Hazard in firm's risk-taking behavior. Further large operational exposure is associated with significantly lower output growth, profitability, and capital expenditure during episodes of large currency depreciation at the firm level. Research limitations/implications - This paper leaves several questions to be answered. Further research is called for to explore the nature of distortions in the production process encouraged by exchange rate volatility and their impact on firm level productivity. Looking at the relationship between the use of financial and operational hedges is another fruitful area of future research. Practical implications - Our results have important implications for policy makers worried about mitigating the impact of exogenous shocks. Implicit and explicit guarantees with regards to the value of exchange rate tend to raise the vulnerability of the economy to exchange rate shocks at same time that they encourage capital expenditures and possibly output growth during normal times. Our findings indicate that the policy makers must take into account the incentive effects of their intervention in foreign exchange markets. Originality/value - Unlike the existing papers in the literature, we use a measure of operational currency exposure based on foreign currency revenues and costs of firms. In most of the existing papers the focus is on the mismatch between the currency denomination of assets and liabilities. Little attention has been paid to the currency mismatch between costs and revenues of the firms. Such operational mismatches are potentially equally important and deserve attention of policy makers and academics alike.","Indian Inst Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore,"Dhasmana, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",anubha.dhasmana@iimb.ernet.in,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78350-756-6; 978-1-78350-755-9,INT SYMP EC,,,2014,23.0,,,,,,59,84,,10.1108/S1571-038620140000023003,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358526100003,0

The degradation of quality metrics may be a useful mean to detect malicious activities that are not reported by intrusion detection systems. This paper deals with this need by proposing a novel Petri Net-based approach that enables the detection of attacks even if there are missing or false alerts by introducing novel kind of transitions that ensure the evaluation of the degradation of the quality of IS resources in addition to the identification of the most probable transitions. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is evaluated by considering the Petri Net that models a sales management information system and the set of attached quality parameters. The proposed scheme enables the prediction of the set of actions that lead to the degradation of the quality of the IS in addition to the localization of IS resources that should be protected.","[Djemaiel, Yacine; Boudriga, Noureddine] Commun Networks & Secur Res Lab, El Ghazala, Tunisia; [Djemaiel, Yacine; Boudriga, Noureddine] Commun Networks & Secur Res Lab, El Ghazala, Tunisia",,"Djemaiel, Y (通讯作者)，Commun Networks & Secur Res Lab, El Ghazala, Tunisia.",ydjemaiel@gmail.com; noure.boudriga2@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,622,631,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300068,0

The paper tests the influence of changes in the debt-equity structure and of some important macroeconomic variables on the performance of Romanian companies. The major independent variables taken into consideration are changes in leverage and changes in debt tax shields. Thus a static panel analysis is used to test the relationship between these variables and the performance of Romanian companies of the three most dominant sectors of industry (engineering, fuel & power and chemical & pharmaceutical) over a period of ten years. Empirical results, obtained using a fixed effect regression, sustain the traditional theory which states that leverage is an important determinant of firm's performance, and demonstrate a negative relation between indebtedness, measured in the paper by leverage, and the value of the company.

The present study examines some aspect of its application focussing on Mediterranean irrigation area where frequent water shortages may generate significant income reductions in the current climate conditions, and may be further exacerbated by climate change. This enhanced loss of income in the future would occur due to a change in climate variability. This change would appreciably reduce the probability of weather conditions that are favourable for irrigation, but would not significantly increase either the probability of unfavourable weather conditions or the magnitude of their impact. As the IST and other insurance tools that protect against adversity and catastrophic events are only activated under extreme conditions, farmers may not consider them to be suitable in dealing with the new climate regime. This would leave a portion of the financial resources allocated by the RDP unused, resulting in less support for climate change adaptation.","[Dono, Gabriele; Cortignani, Raffaele; Giraldo, Luca] Univ Tuscia, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Pasqui, Massimiliano] CNR, Rome, Italy; [Roggero, Pier Paolo] Univ Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",Tuscia University; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); University of Sassari,"Dono, G (通讯作者)，Univ Tuscia, Dept Sci & Technol Agr Forestry Nat & Energy, Via San Camillo de Lellis Snc, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",dono@unitus.it,"Pasqui, Massimiliano/F-8259-2010; Cortignani, Raffaele/ABF-9897-2021; Roggero, Pier Paolo/D-2580-2012; Dono, Gabriele/J-5807-2012; Pasqui, Massimiliano/M-9971-2019","Pasqui, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0926-362X; Cortignani, Raffaele/0000-0002-2685-9783; Roggero, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-7269-4334; Pasqui, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0926-362X; Dono, Gabriele/0000-0002-0272-178X",Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,"This study was carried out under the Agroscenari (http://www.agroscenari.it/) and the MACSUR (http://www.macsur.eu/) projects funded by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

The results of the analysis show that the impact of fiscal policy on economic growth is significantly determined by institutional conditions. In both groups of countries unproductive government expenditure and productive expenditure on general public services have negative impact on economic growth. Other productive expenditures have pro-growth influence on economic growth but only in case of countries with high institutional conditions.

The results suggest that greater concentration fosters financial fragility and that lower pricing power also induces bank risk exposure after controlling for a variety of macroeconomic, bank-specific, regulatory and institutional factors.

But in doing so, are they foregoing important benefits in terms of lower inflation? We argue that the de jure commitment, by making exit more costly, imparts greater credibility, which better anchors inflationary expectations, thereby leading to lower inflation than de facto pegging alone. Our empirical analysis, based on a novel data set of IMF de jure and de facto exchange rate regime classifications for 146 EMDCs over 1980-2010, finds that inflation is indeed lower especially in emerging markets by some 4 percentage points when the central bank both de jure commits and de facto pegs the exchange rate than when it de facto pegs alone. Thus, analogous to inflation targeting, where the formal commitment to the framework is thought to help anchor inflationary expectations, the de jure commitment to the peg may also be important to reap the frill price-stability benefits of pegs.","[Ghosh, Atish R.] IMF, Res Dept, Syst Issues Div, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Qureshi, Mahvash S.; Tsangarides, Charalambos G.] IMF, Res Dept, Washington, DC USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Ghosh, AR (通讯作者)，IMF, Res Dept, Syst Issues Div, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,23,5,5,1,9,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Existing organizational structures, mainly in creative industry segment and high technologies, are not in the position of achieving maximal result. It is due to the strong traditional resource influence and classical managerial concepts. Finding out suitable organizational forms for acting in contemporary conditions is one of the biggest challenges of contemporary economy. Because of everything mentioned above, our team presents new organizational form called fusion organization. This organizational form is suitable for acting within creative industry and high technologies and for all the activities based on innovation and knowledge. Fusion organization enables maximally rational usage of alpha employees' creative potentials as well as other resources like data base and informal network. Our research is based on relevant empirical research results presented in the literature, corporative practice, theoretical models comparison and categorial ideas synthesis. That theoretical effort resulted in new organizational structure formulation and new approach to human resources. In the process, we point out the importance of finding out, engaging and suitable managing of extra talented individuals. While doing so, suitable organizational structure should be articulated. The importance of hyper trust stands out and it is necessary to ensure the transparency of all the business processes. Gradual articulation of new economy demands the establishment of new organizational forms. A new structural form called fusion organization is suggested by our team. Also, essential elements of managerial model suitable for managing new organizational form mentioned above are pointed out. Polycentric power system, hyper trust, alpha and beta employees and hybrid model of managing intellectual property, knowledge in particular, are characteristic for this organizational model. It is also necessary to make all the processes and sub-processes and extremely important essential activities transparent and networked, integrating them within local, regional and global surrounding. In brief, development and the importance of managing processes will be analysed. The findings confirm that the fusion organizations are appropriate forms of action in the field of high technology and the creative industries. To prove the hypothesis scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, and the comparative method were applied.","[Horvat, Duro] Coll Finance & Law Effectus, Zagreb, Croatia; [Kovacic, Marinko] Croatian Chamber Econ, Zadar, Croatia; [Ivanek, Ljiljana Kristijan] Lekcio Ltd, Zadar, Croatia",,,horvat@edukator.hr; nnkovacic@hkg.hr; ljiljana.kristijan-ivanek@lekcio.hr,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,10,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,48,59,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000004,0

However, such models are ineffective in alternative economic environments or industries. This is one of the reasons for the necessity of adjusting existing models or creating better new models. There are many papers on creating bankruptcy prediction models, but many of these papers deal with the problem of finding a better set of predictors or finding a better classification algorithm, while limited attention is paid to the problem of setting optimal cut-off scores or grey zone borders. As the grey zone problem can be viewed as a trade-off between a model's accuracy and the number of companies that remain unevaluated, it represents a factor influencing model accuracy and effectiveness. In this paper we aim to suggest a criterion that can be used for deriving a grey zone that on one hand maximizes model accuracy, while on the other hand minimizes the number of unevaluated companies.","[Karas, Michal; Reznakova, Maria] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Karas, M (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",karas@fbm.vutbr.cz; reznakova@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Reznakova, Maria/AAQ-6282-2020; Karas, Michal/C-1261-2018; Karas, Michal/HDN-2653-2022","Reznakova, Maria/0000-0002-7261-607X; Karas, Michal/0000-0001-8824-1594; Karas, Michal/0000-0001-8824-1594",,,,,26,2,2,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,911,919,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300095,0

The paper analyses the impact of human capital on economic resilience of regions in the context of the economic crisis on the example of NUTS 2 regions of selected states.","[Klementova, Tereza; Svoboda, Ondrej] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Klementová, T (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",tereza.klementova@student.upce.cz; ondrej.svoboda@upce.cz,"Svoboda, Ondřej/A-8878-2013; Svoboda, Ondřej/T-4467-2018","Svoboda, Ondřej/0000-0001-6456-7098; Svoboda, Ondřej/0000-0001-6456-7098",,,,,5,0,0,0,7,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-366-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,457,463,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH1NN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398250000061,0

The structural equation model shows that social presence has a positive effect both on recommendation agent trust and behavioral intentions. In turn, recommendation agent trust influences website trust and behavioral intentions.

If in the previous years we have witnessed manifestations related to tax evasion, gambling or bribery, nowadays the aspects of the underground economy are represented by organizing criminal activities after the model of legal businesses (reception, production, transport, recovery, protection sectors) and white-collar crime. Sometimes these activities of organized crime surpass the capacity of the state to limit them as the specialists in the tax and legal areas prefer to offer their services to private employers who afford to pay them more than the state. Last but not least the globalization has created conditions in which money, weapons or human trafficking runs optimally between international groups of organized crime through the easy access to international networks of data or transport. Moreover, organized crime groups became focused on the control of financial institutions or banks, under the cover of which they could transfer huge amounts of money. In this respect, it appears that besides its positive features, globalization has created an environment in which organized crime groups have easily extended beyond state borders becoming real transnational crime industries.

One important research topic in social choice theory is the study of voting methods. In this paper we make an analysis of several voting methods based on a computer science approach. Our goal is to study the problem of finding the voting method that best approximates all the other methods from a given set of voting methods.

Vietnam has a large growing diaspora thanks to special context and an open door policy in both economic and international relations with other nations. One of the visible gains from Vietnam's international migration is the surge in international remittance inflows in Vietnam in recent years. This could be explained by economic growth in Overseas Vietnamese around the world and the contribution of the labor export industry. This paper reviews the situation of overseas Vietnamese, who have been studied in numerous research papers about the economic and social impact of international remittances in Vietnam. It highlights the benefits as well as the challenges and issues of concern with relation to international migration. Previous studies have shown that migration and remittance both support the development and increase living standards and income of migrant households. The remittance inflows contribute significantly to deal with many socioeconomic problems in Vietnam: by providing an extra source of income flows for households, job opportunities for rural workforce, and other issues such as education and better living standards of the migrants' families. In Vietnam, the potential gain in terms of investment and knowledge from the growing overseas diaspora can be larger if appropriate management mechanisms and guidance are implemented by the Vietnamese government. The important challenge is to secure the continuing inflows of remittance and secure productive investments from this valuable financial capital for economic and business activities.","[Nguyen Anh Duy] Univ Pau, Lab CATT, F-64000 Pau, France",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,,Anhduybiz@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,13,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,390,414,,,,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200030,0

The effect of deregulation on banking TFP growth still depends on national environment, and this effect is not robust in previous studies in other emerging market economies.

Next, the impact of determinants of productivity growth that is measured by GMM estimator. The first contribution of this study is that Government intervention and market discipline co-evolve to increases TFP growth, which implies that good supervision is better than strict supervision. Secondly, this study finds out the dynamic relation among bank's business model, its TFP growth, and activity restriction regulation. The activity restriction regulation could drive the bank's diversification strategy to be optimal in social welfare. Finally, state-owned banks are drivers of TFP growth rate because of their dominance in banking system.","[Nguyen Ngoc Danh] Univ Econ HCM, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Do Thi Thanh Nhan] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Ton Duc Thang University,,danhnn@ueh.edu.vn; nhandtt@tdt.edu.vn,"Nguyễn, Hương/JUV-6128-2023; Nguyen, H.T/AAG-1974-2021","Nguyen, H.T/0000-0001-5580-2877",,,,,64,0,0,0,13,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,457,474,,,,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200034,0

The events are classified into hydrological, meteorological, geological, and biological types. In terms of the frequency of the events, floods were the highest at 56 followed by severe thunder storms at 21, 19 wildfires, 17 tornadoes, 14 winter storms, and less than 10 events each of epidemics, drought, unspecified storms, extreme cold and heat, sinkholes, and hurricanes. Damage to critical infrastructure, both short term and long term included damaged power lines due to flooding and ice storms, highway closures, disruption to the ferry service, and back up of sewer with raw sewage onto the streets. Disruptions occurred in critical facilities, such as fire services, isolation of hospitals, no home delivery of milk, ice, and fuel posing threat to life for vulnerable population. Even though flooding was common to both long and short term impacts, for short term impact, the second highest are severe thunder storms and tornadoes followed by epidemics; whereas for long term impact events, the second highest hazard is wildfire followed by severe thunder storms.

In the present article we focus on one aspect of the problem-namely, challenges associated to the adoption of SM tools for human resources management (HRM). To identify these challenges, we conducted a Delphi survey of 28 HR managers in Canada.

In general, risk abatement within engineering is concerned with minimising both components, with the balance of effort being determined by cost-effectiveness. Risk assessment is the action (or inaction) taken to address the risk issues identified and evaluated in the assessment and analysis efforts, generally with a view to containing or reducing the risk. While the private sector may enhance management by controlling risk, it is more difficult for the public sector to do the same with their shareholders (population), as the risks relate to other sectors, mainly infrastructure. This paper presents a risk assessment framework to address the multiple goals of disaster risk reduction in order to be coherent with the planning of social and economic development, providing a design concept for the development of risk management policies. The legal basis for risk reduction policies is critical for transparent decision-making and allocating public funding for disaster mitigation. Risk management actually takes place on three different levels: (1) Before the disaster - planning, drills and communication (2) During the event - communication, operations associated with the operation of existing systems (3) After the disaster - assessment and reconstruction.

Once the resilience options have been identified to meet the vulnerability of a system, it is necessary to compare the degree of resilience that the different alternatives may offer. The different concepts are examined to propose both a qualitative and a possible quantification of the degree of resilience that may be achieved by the different measures proposed for implementation. Cost Benefit Analysis is one technique used by governments and public authorities for appraising the societal benefits of public investment projects and policies. Generally, it is used to organize and present the costs and benefits, and inherent trade-offs, and to ultimately estimate the economic efficiency of projects. Is it better to be content with protection against 20-year floods or should an extra cost be considered to provide safety against centennial floods? Thus, after showing that the benefits outweigh the costs of the project and adding value to society, Cost Benefit Analysis can be used to single out the best option. As benefits and costs are difficult to estimate with certainty, some measure of uncertainty or sensitivity has to be discussed when comparing the resilience project options. (C) 2014 The Authors.

It is also emphasized that inter-institutional interaction of the country, municipalities and non-governmental organizations is also needed to motivate the integration of the employed into the labor market, as it allows to provide complex methodological and other help for the socially vulnerable groups.

State aid should be forthcoming only once funds available from shareholders, owners of subordinated debt and uninsured depositors have been exhausted. Credit by a central bank should be granted only to temporarily illiquid banks. Primarily as this credit assistance can have significant monetary implications, in as much as it leads to the growth of reserves in the banking system. The impact on the economy then depends primarily on the credit activity of commercial banks. The author compares theory against practice and, using the U.S. and the EMU as an example, analyses the monetary impact using the development of money multipliers.","Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Revenda, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",revy@vse.cz,,"Revenda, Zbynek/0000-0002-1218-5845",,,,,18,1,1,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The aim is to explain the development of social expenditure levels in the period 1990-2010 and estimate its sensitivity to basic economic, social, political and institutional determinants. Over 60 potential determinants are derived from the literature and analysed theoretically, and 21 of these variables are used as independent variables in the regression (a fixed-effects model with robust standard errors). Five variables are identified as both robust and theoretically consistent. Social expenditure levels seem to depend on unemployment, GDP growth, population ageing, GDP per capita and the openness of an economy. The results confirm the theory of socio-economic determination of the level of social expenditure. Empirical evidence for other theoretical explanations is not robust, as it is strongly dependent on the exact model specification.","Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Rozensky, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",xrozv03@vse.cz,,,,,,,30,2,2,1,25,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In Greece, many measures have been taken, over the past three years, in the field of social insurance. The Insurance Act has been modified several times in the last decade. In this study we will present and analyze the relevant legal provisions in comparison with the last one and with the aims of the European policy in this sector. Through comparative analys is in countries that have already implemented this scheme we will try to determine to what extent this newly introduced system can have positive results for the well being of a state, especially in Greek society, and under which conditions it can become reality.

In this paper, we will argue that until now all the solutions that have been agreed on the European level do not help to solve the root causes of the Greek financial problem. The national governments of the European Union do not follow any of the Keynesian ideas to overcome the crisis. The European leaders seem to have forgotten their role to act as a policy makers. Under these conditions, even if the Greek financial problem can be moderated, it cannot be solved. The above observation is highly significant for the future of the European Union because every currency union in order to survive needs a mechanism of fiscal transfers. This mechanism does not exist in the Eurozone. Thus, this crisis will continue to affect the performance and function of the EU. (C) 2014 The Authors.

HEIs aim to reduce the mismatch between what they deliver and what is required by the industry. Built environment professionals require continuous update of knowledge and education in order to effectively contribute to disaster management. However, the complex and multidisciplinary nature of disaster management education pose a challenge to the higher education institutions to make them more responsive to the industrial needs and to prepare the students for careers in disaster resilience. Adopting a lifelong learning approach would be appropriate for HEIs to maintain a through-life studentship and to provide disaster related knowledge and education on a continuous basis to respond to the labour market requirements. However, incorporating lifelong learning approach within the system of higher education is not easy and straightforward for HEIs. This is mainly because of the formal and bureaucratic nature of HEIs that acts as a barrier for providing effective lifelong learning education. In resolving this issue, HEIs are increasingly relying on the benefits associated with fostering close collaboration with external organisations such as industries, professional bodies and communities.

The benefits of using BPM, we can identify improving organizational productivity and responsiveness, cost reduction, acceleration cycle times, improving relations with external customers and obtaining new orders. Projects of Business Process Management such as process modelling or reengineering require vast organisational changes. These changes are supported by detailed methodology and various software applications. But there is also an important factor which is often put away but which is of the highest importance. By this factor we mean people. There are many risks connected with human factor in BPM projects. They can be divided into two categories. In the first category there are risks connected with change management. There are always people who are not supportive about a project. Cynic and negative people, who reject the change, people who fear the change or people with their own interests. Even if project's risks in technology or finance are managed well, there is very often problem with risks of human factor. The other category is directly connected with BPM projects. Competencies of process owners are different than that of managers of traditional departments. It is not possible just to develop process model and rename managers to process owners. Such transformation is totally insufficient. The article aims to point out the potential of increasing efficiency of support processes using BPM methodologies which will result in increased profitability of the company. The case studies try to point out benefits and importance of focusing not only on the management of core business processes but also the management of support processes. In our article we would like describe, Competence management context in organizations that are on the way to Business Process Management too. It is not a matter of days, weeks or months. The aim of this paper is to indicate impacts of human factor on such projects and to explore knowledge, skills and properties e.g. competencies which process owners need for managing the process which often flows through several functional departments.","[Tucek, David; Hrabal, Martin] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Tucek, D (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Nam TG Masaryka 5555, Zlin, Czech Republic.",tucek@fame.utb.cz; hrabalm@seznam.cz,"Tuček, David/ABG-8573-2020",,,,,,26,4,4,0,27,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,264,272,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000033,0

Although conceptual and empirical linkages between both indicators can be assumed based on previous research, relatively little is known about the actual causality. Using heterogeneous Time Series Cross Section Granger causality analysis for the period 1980-2010, we explore the presence of four 'causality scenarios' amongst different country-pairs: (1) there is no co-evolution, implying that both patterns develop independently (e.g. Japan-Australia); (2) there is 'real' co-evolution in that both patterns influence each other through feedback loops (e.g. South Korea-Philippines); (3) air passenger traffic is facilitated by trade (e.g., South Korea-Philippines); or (4) trade is facilitated by air passenger traffic (e.g. Australia-Malaysia).

Sri Lanka has currently achieved eradication of malaria but as it is a small island, developing country, it is vulnerable to climate change threats. Therefore the social influences, host immunity, anti-malarial resistance, prosperity and travel, were investigated with particular reference to potential climate change-induced malaria. Development of immunity depends on the intensity and stability of transmission within the region. Although Sri Lanka recently eradicated malaria, it was previously considered a region of low to moderate transmission, with most individual inoculation resulting in infection and disease at all ages. Self-medication when unrequired is particularly significant in contributing to the global issue of anti-malarial resistance. Despite known drug resistance, distribution continues to be widespread due to low over-the-counter cost and rapid relief of symptoms. Poverty promotes transmission of malaria and in turn malaria impedes economic growth. Malaria imposes economic loss beyond direct medical costs and associated effects to macroenomic costs by impacts on worker productivity, school children performance, etc. However improved economic growth is insufficient to eradicate malaria e.g. Oman. Air travel is a vital factor in malaria transmission due to conveyance of asymptomatic carriers from endemic to non-endemic countries, leading to outbreaks of epidemic malaria. Incidence of imported malaria has been observed mainly due to lapse or absence of prophylaxis. The management of malaria was examined under the categories of public healthcare services and mitigation measures. Mitigation measures were evaluated in relation to social factors, to determine their efficacy in the event of resurgent malaria. Mitigation techniques of prominence were anti-malarial therapy, Indoor Residual Spraying, Insecticide Treated Nets and Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets and lastly environmental management. Malaria is borne out of multiple risks; both environmental (i.e. climate change and environmental degradation) and social (i.e. anti-malarial resistance, migration and poverty). As observed in Sri Lanka, strong political commitment in prioritising malaria control with sustained resource allocation is vital to eliminate malaria. A multi-measure approach cross cutting public health care services and malaria interventions has proven effective despite some evident climate change impacts.

However, these demands are related to different organisational structures, contexts, cultures and the firm's intellectual capital. Especially, the firm's intellectual capital (human, social and organisational capital) is highly related to a successful trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Until now, only Kang and Snell (2009) have addressed the dependencies between intellectual capital and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Their proposed framework describes two distinctive architectures of intellectual capital facilitating ambidextrous learning. However, this framework fits rather static than dynamic approaches of ambidexterity. In order to bridge that research gap, the authors extent Kang and Snell's (2009) framework. They propose an intellectual capital architecture, which considers a dynamic switch among the dimensions of intellectual capital to enable an organisation to be ambidextrous. Three important facts can be mentioned. First, organizational capital switches between organic and mechanistic organisational capital. In this context, organic organisational capital fosters innovation and exploration, while mechanistic organisational capital fosters efficiency and exploitation. Second, social capital is related to organisational culture that can be classified into two different types. One type stresses freedom (open), the other lays emphasise on a constraining (closed) normative system. Open social capital increases autonomy, innovation as well as the firm's explorative focus, while closed social capital increases coordination, efficiency as well as the firm's exploitative focus. The negative secondary effects of each dimension (e.g. organisational capital) are buffered by the opposite end of the other dimension (e.g. social capital). If an organisation switches between organic and mechanistic organisational capital, the dimensions of social capital adjust with temporal delay. Third and by contrast, the human capital dimension is characterised by a constant degree: only a slight switch between the degree of specific and generic human capital is necessary due to the highly unique character of specific human capital.","[Winnen, Lothar; Wilms, Rafael] Business & Informat Technol Sch, Iserlohn, Germany",,"Winnen, L (通讯作者)，Business & Informat Technol Sch, Iserlohn, Germany.",lothar.winnen@bits-iserlohn.de; rafael.wilms@bits-iserlohn.de,"Wilms, Rafael/GSN-1480-2022",,,,,,32,2,2,0,12,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,316,325,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000039,0

We find that banking sector reforms are associated with lower corporate debt in emerging market firms, consistent with the notion that these reforms improve banks' risk management and result in tighter lending standards, leading firms to use less bank debt in their capital structure. These effects are less pronounced for financially constrained firms, suggesting a relative increase in the supply of bank credit to firms which were rationed prior to the banking sector reforms.

The recent extreme financial market events such as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) commencing in 2007 and the following developments in European markets mean that there is a great deal of attention paid to risk measurement and risk hedging. In particular, to risk indices and attached derivatives as hedges for equity market risk. The techniques used to model tail risk such as VaR have attracted criticism for their inability to model extreme market conditions. In this paper we discuss tail specific distribution based Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and evaluate different methods that may be used to calculate VaR ranging from well known econometrics models of GARCH and its variants to EVT based models which focus specifically on the tails of the distribution. We apply Univariate Extreme Value Theory to model extreme market risk for the FTSE100 UK Index and S&P-500 US markets indices plus their volatility indices. We show with empirical evidence that EVT can be successfully applied to financial market return series for predicting static VaR, CVaR or Expected Shortfall (ES) and also daily VaR and ES using a GARCH(1,1) and EVT based dynamic approach to these various indices. The behaviour of these indices in their tails have implications for hedging strategies in extreme market conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Instead, variation in economy-wide credit conditions is the main determinant of leverage in buyouts.

The need to concretize these issues stems partly from a general interest in defining the current research domain and partly from the more specific tasks confronting the prize committee of the Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research. Entrepreneurship has developed in many sub-fields within several disciplines-primarily economics, management/business administration, sociology, psychology, economic and cultural anthropology, business history, strategy, marketing, finance, and geography-representing a variety of research traditions, perspectives, and methods. We present an analytical framework that organizes our thinking about the domain of entrepreneurship research by specifying elements, levels of analysis, and the process/context. An overview is provided of where the field stands today and how it is positioned relative to the existing disciplines and new research fields upon which it draws. Areas needed for future progress are highlighted, particularly the need for a rigorous dynamic theory of entrepreneurship that relates entrepreneurial activity to economic growth and human welfare.

Using a unique dataset of commercial banks and political factors, we find that state-owned banks report significantly smaller net interest income ratios during the years of parliamentary elections. The proxy cumulative amount of net interest income lost by state-owned banks during the election years equals, on average, 0.38% of each country's GDP. The decrease in the profitability of state-owned banks is caused primarily by the lower interest rates charged on loans. In contrast, we document that the lending growth of state-owned banks is not affected by the political cycle. Hence, to a certain extent, this study supports the view that state-owned banks constitute a tool that serves political goals in Central European countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

While urban travel has been widely analysed in the literature, travel over longer distances and particularly across countries, has received much less attention. While this may be justified due to the number of travellers it cannot be justified when looking at the mileage consumption and its resulting environmental impacts. In this paper, we investigate international long-distance travel preferences related to travel between Scandinavia and Central Europe with particular focus on the Fehmarn Belt fixed link between Germany and Denmark to be opened in 2021. To facilitate long-term demand forecasts for the future fixed link, stated preference data were collected in 2011. Based on these data a discrete choice model for long-distance travellers was developed in order to estimate the value of travel time savings (VTTS). The final model, which was formulated as a nested logit model and included Box-Cox transformed travel time and cost attributes, revealed several interesting findings. Firstly, we found damping effects in both cost and time - most strongly in cost. Secondly, we found significant interactions among travel cost and time, and journey characteristics, such as distance and duration. This had direct impact on the VTTS, which was shown to decrease with distance and duration. Thirdly, we found that air travel implies a higher average VTTS, which is to be expected but rarely supported by empirical evidence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The indicators are estimated at the level of the traffic analysis zone (TAZ) and include: (1) the average level of emissions generated per individual and (2) the level of emissions occurring in a zone as a proxy for air pollution exposure. A regional traffic assignment model is extended with capabilities for emission modeling at an individual trip level while taking into account vehicle (type and age) and trip attributes (road type, speed, and volume). We observe that individuals who generate higher emissions from travel tend to reside in areas with lower exposure to traffic emissions while individuals associated with low levels of travel emissions (e.g. travel smaller distances, conduct less trips, and use alternative modes) reside in areas with high levels of traffic pollution. A regression analysis of the two indicators against a set of land-use and socio-economic variables shows that generated emissions per individual are positively associated with car ownership and larger vehicles, while being negatively associated with ownership of newer vehicles, and location in dense and walkable neighborhoods with high levels of commercial land-use. Meanwhile, exposure to emissions is positively associated with dense and walkable neighborhoods and negatively associated with car ownership and larger vehicles. These findings indicate major inequities in the generation of and exposure to traffic-related air pollution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This is because the FDI is typically concentrated in urban areas that abound in manufacturing and it neglects the rural areas where agriculture predominates.

This evidence, often regarded as the consequence of Senate malapportionment, in reality conflates the effects of state population size with that of state population growth. Analyzing outlays for the period 1978-2002, this study shows that properly controlling for population dynamics provides more reasonable estimates of small-state advantage and solves a number of puzzling peculiarities of previous research. We also show that states with fast-growing population loose federal spending to the advantage of slow-growing ones independently of whether they are large or small. The two population effects vary substantially across spending programs. Small states enjoy some advantage in defense spending, whereas fast-growing ones are penalized in the allocation of federal grants, particularly those administered by formulas limiting budgetary adjustments. Hence, a large part of the inverse relationship between spending and population appears to be driven by mechanisms of budgetary inertia, which are compatible with incrementalist theories of budget allocation.","[Larcinese, Valentino] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Rizzo, Leonzio] Univ Ferrara, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Rizzo, Leonzio] Univ Barcelona, IEB, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Testa, Cecilia] Royal Holloway Univ London, London, England; [Testa, Cecilia] Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Ferrara; University of Barcelona; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Larcinese, V (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London Sch Econ, Dept Govt, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",v.larcinese@lse.ac.uk,,"Rizzo, Leonzio/0000-0001-8099-8699",,,,,51,13,13,0,31,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

We distinguish between 'minor diversification' (adding a new product variation within a familiar submarket) and 'major diversification' (expanding the product portfolio into new submarkets). Our analysis reveals four main insights. First, we observe that firms have lower diversification rates as they grow older, and that eventually diversification rates even turn negative for old firms on average (where negative diversification corresponds to exit from certain product lines). Second, we find that product portfolios of larger firms tend to be more diversified. Third, with respect to consecutive diversification activities, quantile autoregression plots show that firms experiencing diversification in one period are unlikely to repeat this behavior in the following year. Fourth, survival estimations reveal that diversification activities reduce the risk of exit in general and to a varying degree at different ages. These results are interpreted using Penrosean growth theory.","[Coad, Alex] Freeman Ctr, SPRU Sci & Technol Policy Res, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Coad, Alex] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark; [Guenther, Christina] Max Planck Inst Econ, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Guenther, Christina] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany",University of Sussex; Aalborg University; Max Planck Society; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Guenther, C (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany.",A.Coad@sussex.ac.uk; guenther@econ.mpg.de,"Coad, Alex/H-8938-2012","Coad, Alex/0000-0002-5706-0528","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H008705/1, ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H008705/1, ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,57,22,28,0,65,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

These fundamental differences have significant impacts on the performance of REITs compared to other stocks listed on Borsa Istanbul (BIST), especially in terms of the inflation-hedging characteristics and time-varying systematic risk behaviour. This article evaluates the Turkish REIT industry by using a time-varying multifactor model, which compares the REIT industry excess returns with various macroeconomic factors, including GDP growth, industrial production growth, inflation risk premium, and stock market risk premium. Our results provide the evidence of time-varying linkages among macroeconomic risks and the conditional first and second moments of excess returns on REITs. We find that among the macroeconomic factors, inflation risk appears to be the major concern in REIT investment. Additionally, Turkish REITs behave more like stocks than real estate. The documented perverse inflation hedges of REITs, the positive correlation between REIT returns and volatility of real economic activity, and the significant influence of ISE equity risk premium on REIT returns can be quoted as the indications of deviation of REITs' performance from real estate performance. If REITs behave more like stocks than real estate, the diversification benefits of having REITs in a multi-asset portfolio is seriously reduced.","[Erol, Isil] Ozyegin Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ileri, Adem] Middle E Tech Univ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Ozyegin University; Middle East Technical University,"Erol, I (通讯作者)，Ozyegin Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Cekmekoy Campus, Istanbul, Turkey.",isil.erol@ozyegin.edu.tr; aileri@metu.edu.tr,,"Erol, Isil/0000-0001-8125-9118",,,,,31,4,4,1,41,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

The current research aimed to make up for this research deficit by studying the impact of regulatory focus on the endorsement of job-related values and job attraction. It was predicted that the stronger individuals' promotion focus is, the more they endorse the job-related values power and self-direction, whereas the stronger the prevention focus, the more they endorse the value security at work. In addition, regulatory focus was expected to predict attraction by a job with characteristics meeting the values fitting an individual's regulatory focus. One longitudinal and two cross-sectional studies supported these predictions.

Climate economics, therefore, is centrally concerned with the treatment of risk and time. Yet conventional assumptions about utility and optimal economic growth create a perverse connection between risk aversion and time preference, such that more aversion to current risks implies less concern for future outcomes, and vice versa. The same conflation of risk aversion and time preference leads to the equity premium puzzle in finance. A promising response to the equity premium puzzle, the recursive utility of Epstein and Zin, allows separation of risk aversion and time preference-at the cost of considerable analytic complexity. We introduce an accessible implementation of Epstein-Zin utility into the DICE model of climate economics, creating a hybrid EZ-DICE model. Using Epstein-Zin parameters from the finance literature and climate uncertainty parameters from the science literature, we find that the optimal climate policy in EZ-DICE calls for rapid abatement of carbon emissions; it is similar to standard DICE results with the discount rate set to equal the risk-free rate of return. EZ-DICE solutions are sensitive to the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, but remarkably insensitive to risk aversion. Insensitivity to risk aversion may reflect the difficulty of modeling catastrophic risks within DICE. Implicit in DICE are strong assumptions about the cost of climate stabilization and the certainty and speed of success; under these assumptions, risk aversion would in fact be unimportant. A more realistic analysis will require a subtler treatment of catastrophic climate risk.","[Ackerman, Frank; Stanton, Elizabeth A.; Bueno, Ramon] Synapse Energy Econ, Cambridge, MA USA; [Bueno, Ramon] Stockholm Environm Inst US Ctr, Somerville, MA USA",,"Ackerman, F (通讯作者)，Synapse Energy Econ, Cambridge, MA USA.",frankackerman12@gmail.com; stantonea88@gmail.com; Ramon.Bueno@sei-us.org,,"Ackerman, Frank/0000-0002-7940-482X",,,,,26,40,43,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

It shows that a formal firm has about 6.4 times the sales of an informal firm with no social capital, but informal firms use their social capital to compensate for the lack of formal productivity benefits. By being formal, firms obtain permanent visibility because they can operate a shop or a visible production location and they can produce in locations with better public infrastructure. Informal firms, in contrast, sell in one place - typically in street markets in front of formal shops - and produce in another typically in the outskirts. Social capital increases accessibility of informal firms and provides them with security benefits at their production location. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Bank lending behavior, especially its scale, scope and timing, is largely driven by bank business models which differ between privately owned and state-owned banks. Using a unique dataset on private small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) we find that an increase in relative borrowings from local state-owned banks significantly reduces firms' financial constraints, while there is no such effect for privately owned banks. Improved credit availability and private information production are the main channels that explain our result. We also show that the lending behavior of local state-owned banks can be sustainable because it is less cyclical and neither leads to more risk taking nor underperformance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In response, regulators periodically impose short sale constraints aimed at preventing excessive stock market declines. One explanation is that policy makers regard short sellers as behaving like positive feedback traders. Relying on the theoretical model put forward by Sentana and Wadhwani (1992), which stresses the conditional nature of returns' persistence, bans on selected financial stocks in six countries during the 2008/2009 global financial crisis are examined. These provide us with a setting to analyze the impact of short sale restrictions on feedback trading. Our findings suggest that, in the majority of markets examined, restrictions of this kind amplify positive feedback trading during periods of high volatility and, hence, contribute to stock market downturns. On balance then, short selling bans do not contribute to enhancing financial stability. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We show that in the first round of the electoral process, spending on equipment (including infrastructures) can influence the voter, and that electoral competition has a strong impact on the incumbent's score. In the second round, the incumbent's vote is affected more by national considerations and local budget variables have no effect.

Dynamic probit analysis concludes that the probability of manipulation of a stock is significantly higher for stocks that have been previously manipulated. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the aim is to predict U.S. bear and bull stock markets with dynamic binary time series models. Based on the analysis of the monthly U.S. data set, bear and bull markets are predictable in and out of sample. In particular, substantial additional predictive power can be obtained by allowing for a dynamic structure in the binary response model. Probability forecasts of the state of the stock market can also be utilized to obtain optimal asset allocation decisions between stocks and bonds. It turns out that the dynamic probit models yield much higher portfolio returns than the buy-and-hold trading strategy in a small-scale market timing experiment. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present a model where workers (females and males) are subject to idiosyncratic employment risk and where capital markets are incomplete. A household is formed by a female and a male, who decide on consumption, savings and labor supplies. In a calibrated version of our model we find that intra-household risk sharing has its largest impact among wealth-poor households. While the wealth-rich use mainly savings to smooth consumption across unemployment spells, wealth-poor households rely on spousal labor supply. For instance, for low-wealth households, average hours worked by wives of unemployed husbands are 8% higher than those worked by wives of employed husbands. This response in wives' hours makes up 9% of lost family income. We also study consumption losses upon an unemployment spell, precautionary savings and the crowding out effects of the public unemployment insurance program on the extent of risk sharing within the household.

We observe a statistically significant and robust negative relationship between central bank financial strength and inflation. This relationship is robust in the presence of other determinants of inflation and for alternative estimation methods. Our results have important implications for policy makers and central bankers.

But while it is often thought that exchange-rate volatility hurts trade, the economic literature has found that this is not always true. This study examines bilateral export and import flows between the United States and Brazil from 1971 to 2010, using cointegration analysis to estimate the effects of this risk. This study arrives at three main conclusions. First, while the majority of industries are not affected by volatility in the long run, an unexpectedly large share of those that are affected responds positively to increased risk. Second, sensitivity to risk differs markedly by industry sector: Brazilian exports of agricultural products are particularly harmed, while U.S. machinery imports are not impacted at all. Finally, products with small trade shares more likely to respond to increased uncertainty than are major exporters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We study a transshipment system of centrally managed retailers by utilizing a realistic model for various retail industries.

However, many family firms fail at this task because of financial issues. Although a vast number of studies have investigated the succession process, research thus far has failed to determine how and why family firms select particular forms of financing for succession-related expenditures. Accordingly, this study conceptually and empirically investigates succession financing. We introduce a conceptual framework that investigates the reasons behind an owner-manager's intent to use debt for succession financing. Specifically, our model accounts for general and succession-related personal factors. However, we also include a set of firm-specific financing behavioral controls in our research. The empirical results are derived from a sample of 187 German family firms, and the results highlight financial knowledge, attitudes, succession experience, and succession planning as significant determinants of the owner-managers' debt usage intentions.

A unique large-scale longitudinal (1997-2004) dataset which includes 2600 Canadian exporters is constructed by linking multiple administrative databases at Statistics Canada. Our results suggest traditional sequential exporting patterns do not apply to all Canadian exporters. Since 2001, there has been an increasing trend among a new generation of exporters to target emerging markets as their initial export destination; and both macroeconomic and firm-specific factors seem to account for this development. Compared with foreign-controlled firms, Canadian-controlled firms are less likely to export to the emerging markets. In order to successfully expand into emerging markets, Canadian firms have had to improve their productivity and reduce their labor costs.","[Sui, Sui] Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Global Management Studies Dept, Toronto, ON M5G 2C5, Canada; [Yu, Zhihao] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University; Carleton University,"Yu, ZH (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",sui.sui.66@gmail.com,,", Sui/0000-0001-8719-962X",,,,,33,4,4,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Simultaneously, the tourism sector plays a key role in many of these economies. In this paper, the Hausman-Taylor estimator is used to investigate a tourism demand function in SIDS in which marine and terrestrial biodiversity play a key role, in addition to the traditional economic and price variables. This estimator allows for both the presence of time-invariant variables, a standard feature of environmental data, and the existence of endogenous covariates. Levels of biodiversity are found to have a significant influence on tourism in SIDS and, in particular, a test for redundant variables shows that the biodiversity variables are jointly significant. This justifies their inclusion in a tourism demand function, over and above the conventional economic factors, and points to the importance of national and international policy in protecting the biodiversity of SIDS.","[Teelucksingh, Sonja S.] Univ W Indies, Dept Econ, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Teelucksingh, Sonja S.; Watson, Patrick K.] Univ W Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine; University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine,"Teelucksingh, SS (通讯作者)，Univ W Indies, Dept Econ, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",sonja.teelucksingh@sta.uwi.edu; patrick.watson@sta.uwi.edu,,,,,,,34,7,7,0,31,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

To this end a survey was held among university students asking them about details of their last leisure trip made with a friend. Cluster analysis suggests that four typical leisure trip patterns can be derived. Three clusters seem to be determined by the residential locations of ego and alter. Depending on the residential distance between ego and alter, leisure trip distances are either short for ego and alter (if residential distance is very short), somewhat longer for both (if residential distance is slightly longer) or long for at least one partner (if residential distance is large). A fourth cluster includes cases with long leisure trips for both partners, independent of residential distance, representing cases where specific destinations are visited. A more detailed analysis of travel distance suggests that travel distance depends on size of the residential municipality, residential distance and objective and perceived quality of leisure facilities such as cafes, bars and restaurants. Overall, our study provides support for the idea that leisure trip decisions should be understood on the level of social network ties (i.e. ego and alter) rather than based on individual characteristics only. Also, it provides support for the idea that a focus on single ties, rather than on the structure of social networks as a whole, increases our insight in leisure trip decision making.Keywords: Social network links, Social-recreational travel, Spatial context, Students (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Multivariate extreme value theory approach is used to estimate these measures. Using six big Canadian banks as the proxy for Canadian banking sector, we apply these measures to identify systemically important banks in Canadian banking sector and major risk contributors from international financial institutions to Canadian banking sector. The empirical evidence reveals that (i) the top three banks, RBC Financial Group, TD Bank Financial Group, and Scotiabank, are more systemically important than other banks, while we also find that the size of a financial institution should not be considered as a proxy of systemic importance; (ii) compared to the European and Asian banks, the crashes of the U.S. banks, on average, are the most damaging to Canadian banking sector, while the risk contribution to the Canadian banking sector from Asian banks is quite lower than that from banks in the U.S. and euro area; (iii) the risk contribution to Canadian banking sector exhibits home bias, that is, cross-country risk contribution tends to be smaller than domestic risk contribution.

Acquirers reduce capital expenditures, wages, and employment in target plants, though output is unchanged. Acquirers improve targets' investment efficiency through reallocating capital to industries with better investment opportunities. Moreover, changes in productivity help explain the merging firms' announcement returns. The combined announcement returns are driven by improvements in target's productivity. Targets with greater productivity improvements receive higher premiums. These results provide some first empirical evidence on the relation between productivity and stock returns in takeovers.

Many observers see this as a sign that American consumers have accepted transgenic foods, due to a different attitude to risks, food and nature. This explanation has been discussed since with a focus on the institutional dynamics of the public debate. Our paper can be considered as an extension of these previous researches, although we criticize the bias assimilation and polarization hypothesis about a public opinion split on this issue. Our data come from the 2000-2010 ISSP (International Social Survey Program) on environment. The heterogeneous choice (aka location-scale) model helps us to separate the effects of time and country.

Unlike an earlier study, the current study has a rich set of negotiation variables in addition to political, geographical, and organizational variables associated with the perpetrators or targets of the attacks. The 33 years of data permit a split into two subperiods: 1978-1987 and 1988-2010, before and after the rise of religious fundamentalist terrorist groups. Logistical success depends on resource and target vulnerability proxies, while negotiation success hinges on bargaining variables. Among many novel findings, democracy significantly hampers logistical success throughout the entire period. Kidnappings, tropical climates, and high elevations foster logistical success. Religious fundamentalist terrorists' logistical advantage during 1978-1987 was lost during 1988-2010. Abducting protected persons, making demands on the host country, and staging incidents in a democracy limit negotiation success for the terrorists. If terrorists moderate or replace one or more demands, the likelihood of negotiation success for the terrorists goes up.","[Santifort, Charlinda; Sandler, Todd] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Econ, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Sandler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Econ, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, 800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",csantifort@gmail.com; tsandler@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,16,12,13,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2013,156.0,1-2,,,,,125,137,,10.1007/s11127-012-0008-z,0.0,,,13,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,164WW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320443600009,0

To conduct our study, we use a comprehensive and hand-collected dataset covering exited buyouts in the UK between 1995-2004, and we control for sample selection and investment risk. Our study shows that governance variables generally have a limited role in driving value creation but that use of a ratchet is positively related to both equity and enterprise value returns; we also find that leverage has a positive impact on median and top-quartile equity returns. Moreover, returns are driven by the size of the buyout and the acquisitions made during the holding period.

This article draws on social movement theory to explore the creation of 'pop-up campaign' Londoners on Bikes, formed to pressure the 2012 London mayoral candidates over cycling issues. Interviews and field notes are used to explore the complexities of framing cycling politically and generating a positive cycling identity in the context of stigma. In negotiating these issues, core activists drew upon their experience within other movements, including feminist and environmental campaigns. The paper concludes that the campaign made both distributional (issue-based) and recognition (identity-based) claims, seeking to influence cycling cultures and identities as well as cycling infrastructures.

We show that these liquidity suppliers withdraw from risky securities during the crisis and their participation does not recover for an extended period of time.

We propose 132 legal indexes accounting for the main functions of bankruptcy codes: namely, the accessibility of the procedures, their ability to disclose information, the protection of debtor's assets, the coordination of the claimants and their decision power, and the sanction of management. The French procedures are more protective of the debtor's assets and prioritize the coordination of claims. In England, liquidation procedures protect more secured claims, while unsecured creditors have more decision power under reorganization procedures. Our indexes are then used to explain recovery rates on a set of 833 bankrupt SMEs. Several bankruptcy rules are associated with higher recoveries: namely, accessibility of the procedure, protection of the debtor's assets, protection of claims, and sanction of faulty management. On the contrary, information disclosure has negative impact on recoveries, probably due to the breach in confidentiality. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We allow for endogenous migration, whereby immigrants are disproportionately attracted to areas with higher wages. Our results suggest that immigration sufficient to increase Thailand's total labour force by one per cent would reduce Thai wages by approximately half a per cent.

We test this hypothesis with a panel data set of auctions held in the Italian Veneto region between 2004 and 2006, including small size public projects in sectors such as road works and building maintenance.

The key reason is that voters cannot commit to re-elect a government that does not reform during bad times. This voters' commitment problem stems from economic voting, i.e., voters' tendency to punish the government for a poorly performing economy.

The estimation results using both the US and the UK data show that the estimated macro-factors significantly predict actual inflation and the output gap.

In our research, a total of 211 employees from 45 small organisations were asked to rate the presence of HPWPs in their organisation. These averaged perceptions were linked to information provided by the owner-managers on the size of their firm and their own expertise and attitudes. The findings support that smaller but coherent bundles of HPWPs can be found in small organisations and that the implementation of these bundles depends on available resources, strategic decision-making and the combination of the two.

We use a compound option framework to analyze the impact of decision contingency and learning on formation and duration of joint ventures. Critical thresholds are presented which allow to characterize the conditions under which termination takes place and to estimate the duration of international joint ventures revealing a novel perspective on existing empirical Findings. In particular, we find that exchange rate uncertainty and learning have ambiguous effects on investment.

Our empirical analysis focuses on the effects of administrative overheads, public funding and the interrelations between these two factors on the probability of market exit for almost 900 US based NGOs with overseas aid activities since the mid-1980s.

The empirical results also suggest that the regime-switching Nelson-Siegel term structure model forecasts better out-of-sample than the single-regime Nelson-Siegel model and other competing models. In addition, our economic analysis is favorable to the better forecasting performance of the regime-switching Nelson-Siegel model.

We test this theory in the banking sector by investigating whether CEOs with larger inside debt holdings compared to their equity-based compensation hedge more their banks' interest rate risk. Our results show that CEO inside debt holdings have a positive effect on the extent to which a bank uses interest rate derivatives for hedging purposes, implying that debt-like compensation mitigates bank executives' risk-taking incentives.

Drawing on the oral testimonies of elderly residents of Sada and Ilinge townships, the paper shows how gendered and generational inequalities within households were crucial factors shaping individuals' experiences of resettlement from the farms. The paper engages with an older literature that regarded the abolition of labour tenancy and linked resettlement programmes as the final stage of farm tenants' proletarianization. It highlights the problems of this linear narrative, and argues that men and women experienced and understood this process in radically different ways. Male labour migration and the remnants of farm paternalism meant that while resettlement cemented the status of migrant men, for women and non-migrant men this process was characterized by contradiction: on the one hand, escape from the spatial hegemonies of farm paternalism and, on the other, heightened economic exposure.","Univ Western Cape PLAAS, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies PLAAS, UWC, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Evans, L (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape PLAAS, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies PLAAS, UWC, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",laura.k.evans@googlemail.com,,"Evans, Laura/0000-0003-2471-7439",,,,,63,5,6,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The results suggest that CPI bias was negative during the 199798 crisis but has been positive since 2000. From 1993 to 2008, CPI bias averaged 4% annually, equivalent to almost one-third of the measured inflation rate.","[Olivia, Susan] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gibson, John] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand",Monash University; University of Waikato,"Olivia, S (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,"Gibson, John/AAM-6159-2020","Gibson, John/0000-0003-3886-6873; Olivia, Susan/0000-0002-4124-8104",,,,,24,4,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Accordingly, I document that a firm's acquisition propensity is decreasing in the age of its CEO: a firm with a CEO who is 20 years older is similar to 30% less likely to announce an acquisition. This negative effect of CEO age on acquisitions is strongest among firms where CEOs likely anticipate or can influence high post-acquisition compensation, and is absent for other investment decisions that are not rewarded with permanent compensation gains. The age effect cannot be explained by the selection of young CEOs by acquisition-prone firms, nor by a story of declining overconfidence with age.

In this paper, we examine the impact of HSEEs on dropout during a period when these exams became more common and rigorous. Further, we study whether offering alternate pathways to graduation for students who cannot pass HSEEs moderates any dropout effects. Using a district-grade-level panel assembled from the Common Core of Data, we exploit the fact that new exit exam policies first affect a particular graduating class, so we can isolate the impact of exposure to HSEEs for students in one grade in a district separate from other unaffected grades in the same district. We estimate dropout effects by grade for all students, and by race, sex, and urbanicity. We find that HSEEs increase dropout rates for students in the 12th grade, with especially large effects for African-American students. Dropout effects are uniformly larger in states that do not provide alternate pathways to receive a diploma or alternative credentials for students that cannot pass exit exams. We estimate that 1.25 percent of 12th graders in these states do not graduate with their high school class, likely due to having a diploma withheld because of inability to pass the requisite HSEE.

Combining microdata on individual workers with area data, we are able to consider the effects on worker migration of tax policy differences across countries. Our ability to identify highly skilled individuals using these data enables us to simulate the effects of changes to taxes (under balanced budget conditions) on the migration propensities of individuals, as well as the magnitude of the aggregate migration streams. Simulations suggest that increasing Canadian after-tax returns to skills and implementing fiscal equalization (reducing the average Canadian tax rate to the average US level with offsetting expenditure reductions to maintain budget neutrality) would effectively reduce southward migration, especially amongst highly skilled workers. The required reductions in tax rates and public expenditures are relatively large, however, and therefore would be expected to raise other substantial public policy concerns.","[Hunt, Gary L.] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, Orono, ME USA; [Mueller, Richard E.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Lethbridge,"Hunt, GL (通讯作者)，Univ Maine, Sch Econ, Orono, ME USA.",,"Mueller, Richard E/W-9054-2018","Mueller, Richard E/0000-0001-6749-0348",,,,,44,1,1,0,7,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The effect is stronger for firms in industries that produce durables rather than nondurables, exhibit greater cyclicality in sales, require longer lead times, and are subject to more technological innovation. We then construct a production-based asset pricing model with two types of capital, fixed capital and inventories, to explain these empirical findings.

We identify two important aspects where it may be of importance. On the one hand there is in the evaluation of predictors of the measure. On the other there is in the interpretation and communication of it.

We adapt a standard model of capital structure choice under corporate taxation, focusing on the financing and investment decisions typically faced by a firm. Our model suggests that the debt ratio is associated positively with the corporate tax rate and negatively with firm age. Further, we predict that the tax-induced advantage of debt is more important for older firms than for younger ones. To test these hypotheses empirically, we use a cross-section of around 405,000 firms from 35 European countries and 127 NACE three-digit industries. In line with previous research, we find that a firm's debt ratio increases with the corporate tax rate. Further, we observe that older firms exhibit smaller debt ratios than their younger counterparts. Finally, consistent with our theoretical model, we find a positive interaction between corporate taxation and firm age, indicating that the impact of corporate taxation on debt increases over a firm's lifetime.","[Pfaffermayr, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Stoeckl, Matthias; Winner, Hannes] Salzburg Univ, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria",University of Innsbruck; Salzburg University,"Pfaffermayr, M (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Michael.Pfaffermayr@uibk.ac.at; Hannes.Winner@sbg.ac.at,"Pfaffermayr, Michael/AAR-2786-2020","Pfaffermayr, Michael/0000-0002-8558-7757; Winner, Hannes/0000-0001-9350-6892",ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,41,21,26,3,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

The better-skilled illegal migrants thus face two taxes: being paid less than if they were legal, and being averaged down. Therefore, better-skilled illegal migrants can be expected to expend more effort to become legal than lower-skilled illegal migrants. And once legalized, there is no reason for the better-skilled illegal migrants to want to return to their country of origin more than the lower-skilled illegal migrants. Thus, it is the lower-skilled illegal migrants that are likely to dominate the return migration flow. We argue that in other respects too, the model of Coniglio et al. is not based on reasonable assumptions, and that even under the postulated assumptions, the model suffers from several inconsistencies. In particular, when the rate of return to savings is an increasing function of skill level, we would expect there to be few better-skilled individuals among illegal migrants in the first place. Also, an obvious distinction between savers and borrowers is ignored.","[Stark, Oded] Univ Klagenfurt, Vienna, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Byra, Lukasz] Warsaw Univ, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Klagenfurt; University of Vienna; University of Warsaw,"Stark, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",ostark@uni-bonn.de; lbyra@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Byra, Łukasz/ABB-1563-2020","Byra, Łukasz/0000-0003-1935-7264",,,,,2,1,1,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The local municipal in United States have provided three types of property tax incentives for green buildings which are property tax exemption, property tax reduction and property tax credit. Each of these models was developed according to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) criteria. Whereby Malaysia are using Green Building Index (GBI) criteria as listed in GBI's Malaysia. Therefore, this paper focuses on LEED'S criteria that been used in the property tax incentives in order to establish property tax incentives according to GBI on green buildings in Malaysia. This is essential in order to explore the potential of property tax incentives on green building to be develop in Malaysia. Thereby, this paper attempts to determine the bases used in formulating these property tax incentives models for green building by achieving these two objectives which are: 1) to explore types of property tax incentives that available for green buildings in United States and 2) to determine the bases in formulating property tax incentives model for green buildings.

Management is the set of tasks or activities that govern, design and maintain the environment in which employees work together while competing at the same time for the organization's resources to accomplish a set of jobs or tasks effectively and efficiently. As such, structuring the organization is a fundamental management task. With the new large sized organizations, and more so with the modern virtual organizations that are becoming more common in the present, structuring an organization has become an extremely complicated process. However, such big organizations have started using structuring methods that are anchored on information and communication technology (ICT) to tackle this complexity. The ICT approaches take their cue from computer operating systems and from that springboard several approaches have been put forward to structure the organization. These approaches such as the monolithic, hierarchical, and object-oriented approaches have a similar end goal but different designs. In the end they all provide the structure on which the organization structure is built and operated. This paper sets out to explore one of those ICT-based management approaches the object-oriented approach and to explain how it is structured. It also presents a proposal of how this approach can be adopted to structure and manage the multitude of complex tasks of the virtual organization. It also presents a proposal on how the object-oriented approach can be applied to the structure and management of a virtual organization. The rest of this paper is divided as follows. Section 2 provides a background on organizations and explores the differences between traditional organizations, virtual organizations and virtual offices. It also addresses organization management, organization structure and resource management and highlights the similarity between management and operating systems and how issues related to the organization structure can be resolved through replicating the ICT structure of those operating systems. Section 3 introduces several ICT approaches that are used to structure operating systems but focuses primarily on the object-oriented approach and its typical use as a fundamental management tool. Section 4 proposes an organization structure model based on the object-oriented approach and highlights the advantages of such a model. Section 5 concludes the paper.","[Badr-El-Din, Amr] Amer Univ Cairo, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); American University Cairo,,abadreldin@aucegypt.edu,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,893,900,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100095,0

Based on the analysis of a sample of 97 companies over the period from 1996 to 2011, it can be concluded that more innovative companies are smaller and their debt level is negatively correlated with profitability. During financial crisis (2008-2011), a divergent feature can be found - more innovative companies use more short-term debt and total debt. This might indicate that, during the economic boom, the companies finance their innovations by using other financing sources than debt, while during economic recession when internal resources are not sufficient to cover innovative projects debt financing is required. To companies it is recommended to analyse and evaluate the possible innovative projects diligently, and if their future incoming cash flow exceeds the required investment, then it is lucrative to finance their investments using external debt.","[Berzkalne, Irina; Zelgalve, Elvira] Latvian State Univ, LV-1063 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,irina.berzkalne@inbox.lv; elzelg@lu.lv,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,122,131,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100013,0

Banks were willing to grant loans to governments. There are a lot of parameters and indices for the analysis of the financial condition of local governments. For many local government units, due to statutory changes, the year 2011 was a difficult test of financial capacity. The budgets of local governments and other financial statements, however, do not provide all the relevant information about the changes occurring in the financial condition of local governments and subordinate units. Analysis of the real estate market allows for the assessment of the issues, which are often not related directly to property appraisal. Combining the facts, which are seemingly from divergent areas of reality, allows to carry out a fundamental analysis of the studied phenomenon. Increased sale of government assets, if observed during a period of at least two years, usually indicates declining credit worthiness of a municipality. Among numerous tasks to be performed for the local community, the government should deal with the environmental protection. In order to properly fulfill its mission, the local government must have adequate financial resources. Lack of financial discipline will result in expenditure of own income, and in practice it reduces the possibilities of local authorities to undertake effective actions in the field of environmental protection. Covering current expenses of constantly growing administration and mismanagement is usually reflected in the sale of property and taking out another loan. A critical point in mismanagement is debt rollover, i.e. paying off one loan with another one. According to the authors, exceeding this point completely rules out in practice a possibility of effective actions taken by a government to protect the environment. Analyzing the real estate market and changes in the budget over the period of one year, the authors show a specific example of a space that should be especially thoroughly checked before deciding whether to grant another loan to a local government. The financial condition of a town translates directly to the level of fiscal liabilities of its residents and the protection of the environment. This paper presents a model example of the effects of rising municipal costs on economic decisions, which have a direct impact on the environment.","[Dabrowski, Janusz; Parzych, Piotr; Bydlosz, Jaroslaw] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Dabrowski, Janusz] State Univ Technol & Econ Jaroslaw, Krakow, Poland",AGH University of Krakow,,,"Bydlosz, Jaroslaw/N-2127-2014","Bydlosz, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-0350-8112",,,,,4,1,1,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,41,48,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400006,0

The relatively new concept of art-based learning (Jackson, 2007; Needlands, 2004; Nicholson, 2006) is a management training technique in which various issues are acted out in theatrical fashion. Since theatre creates a type of meta-language that allows and/or reinforces the generation of dialogue (Asikainen, 2003) by making thought visible (Boal, 1995, p. 137), it can trigger in the participants a sense of ownership and interest in the targeted organisational structure, management, or customer oriented culture change and can be used as a catalyst for transformation. Six non-homogeneous groups, containing a maximum of twelve participants each, were observed in a theatre-based learning setting using three experiential and transformative theatrical arts-based processes/techniques. A formal evaluation of the programme's efficiency showed that the number of proposals of innovative practices / tools generated by the newly empowered employees was substantial. In more than eighty percent of the cases, the participants' capacity to reflect and gain new insights into non-traditional solutions and possibilities had increased, thus resulting in more innovative behaviour and practice.","[Descubes, Irena; McNamara, Tom] ESC Rennes Sch Business, F-35065 Rennes, France",ESC Rennes School of Business; Universite de Rennes,,irena.descubes@esc-rennes.fr; tom.mcnamara@esc-rennes.fr,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,320,328,,,,,,9,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100033,0

We describe conceptual models together with results from a number of empirical studies. The conceptual models analyze valuation issues from the perspective of parents; treat health risk as endogenously determined; and demonstrate that in equilibrium, marginal willingness to pay to reduce risk for the child relative to marginal willingness to pay to reduce risk for the parent should equal the ratio of marginal risk reduction costs. Empirical studies treat both mortality and morbidity associated with exposure to environmental health risks. These studies generally find that parents are willing to pay more for absolute risk reductions for their children than they are willing to pay for corresponding risk reductions for themselves. Possible reasons for this outcome along with suggestions for further research are discussed.","[Gerking, Shelby; Dickie, Mark] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Econ, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Gerking, Shelby] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Gerking, Shelby] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Gerking, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Dept Econ, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",sgerking@ucf.edu; mdickie@ucf.edu,,,,,,,47,13,13,0,17,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

In growth equations the dependent variable is the growth rate of real GDP per head and forward moving averages of this growth rate. Descriptive statistics reveal that in the examined period the nonfinancial corporations' debt has been rising steadily (first of all in Sweden, the Netherlands and Portugal). The basic estimation technique has been panel fixed effects corrected for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. The coefficients showing the impacts of corporate debt on GDP growth have had the sign minus and have been highly statistically significant. A 10 percentage point increase in nonfinancial corporations' debt has been associated with an approximately 5 basis point reduction in per head real GDP growth.

This paper argues that there is also a nonlinear wealth transfer from shareholders to creditors causing shareholder loss. The magnitude of the wealth transfer can be quantified in a setting where equity is a call option on firm assets as in the Merton (1974) model. The wealth transfer originates from maturity shortening of the call option as a result of Chapter 11 filing. I present a parsimonious model to explain why Chapter 11 can be voluntarily filed by managers acting in the interest of shareholders with the existence of the wealth transfer. The model-predicted stock return has comparable magnitude as observed stock returns around filing, and explains the cross-sectional variation of the latter. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Some argue the specificity between cash dividend behavior and ownership structure is due to split share structure. To examine this argument, the paper uses the data of A-share non-financial listed companies to analyze the influences of Split-share Structure Reform on cash dividend behavior of the listed companies under the framework of Heckit model and two-part model by adopting the difference-in-differences method. Results show the reform reduces the propensity of cash dividend, but doesn't negatively influence the positive relationship between ownership concentration and cash dividend, which means the split-share structure does influence the cash dividend, but not the main reason causing the specificity between cash dividend behavior and ownership concentration.","[Liu Yan; Chen Tao; Zhang Rongxia] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 102488, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,5,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-063-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,675,679,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BGR19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323863400120,0

However, little is known about children's mobility. This paper analyses the energy consumption, travel distances and mode choices for school commuting based on two decennial surveys in Belgium. The results highlight the following: (1) mobility behaviours have evolved drastically over the past decades for school commuting, an evolution that cannot be entirely related to land-use variables, (2) the energy consumption for school commuting is strongly dependent upon the school level, and (3) the links between land-use patterns and energy consumption for school commuting are different than those highlighted within the literature between urban forms and home-to-work commutes. The concentration of secondary schools and tertiary institutions in urban centres induces higher energy consumption rates, whereas the decentralisation of nursery and primary schools across the entire territory leads to very low local energy consumption and increased walking and cycling. These results provide a better understanding of school commuting within the European context and could guide future policies focused on transport energy consumption at the local scale.

All the conditions imposed by the European authorities were complied with by Romania in 2004 when all the negotiating chapters were closed. Until that year, Romania had to converge its commercial policy with the EU based on the Common Commercial Policy of the EU block. Based on the analysis made by Burnete (1999), Sun. (2000), Giurgiu (2008), combined with the data provided by the National Institute of Statistics and the National Commission of Prognosis, the industrial production percentage in the formation of the GDP between 1989 - 2016, and the evolution of the industrial production index between 1990 - 2011 will show the mutations suffered by this sector, with a direct impact on the Romanian economy and trade flows. Then the paper addresses its impact on the evolution of exports between 1989 2011, classified in eight sectors, presenting a cyclical evolution that changes the landscape of Romania's trade. Furthermore, the paper addresses the concept of comparative advantage based on the Lafay indicator of Romania's foreign trade between 1991 - 2012. The indicator is calculated based on the statistical data offered by the National Institute of Statistics of the combined nomenclature with its XXII sections. The conclusions based on the prior results argue whether the accession to the EU has had a beneficial or harmful effect on the Romanian economy, its international trade flows, and its external competitiveness.","[Negrea, Adrian] Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Int Relat, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,,ngr_adrian@yahoo.com,"Negrea, Adrian/U-7133-2017","Negrea, Adrian/0000-0001-9300-3099",,,,,9,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,560,568,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500052,0

I start with four large trends and issues: population growth, climate change, the global economy, and energy.

For each issue, I suggest questions and needed analyses that we as economists could address and help farmers and many others deal with these changes and improve the likelihood of a better future.

The paper is based on conducting a counterfactual impact evaluation of the Operational Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme, support area 1.1 in the Czech Republic. This support area finances private companies in the field of training and improvements in the systems of human resource development. Our study has a quasi-experimental design, as the programme assistance has not been designed as a randomized experiment. We analysed a data sample of 31604 firms, of which 2630 were applicants for the ESF assistance. We applied the propensity score matching (PSM) method, the regression discontinuity design (RDD) method and the instrumental variable (IV) method to estimate the impact. The estimated impact of the ESF on sales varies according applied methods and a size of firms. The PSM method indicates a positive impact of ESF on sales for all size groups of firms. On the other hand the IV method indicates a negative impact.

The next section explains the differences between the overall unemployment rate and the unemployment rate of young people aged 15-29 years. The article describes the declining population of young people in the Czech Republic and thus decreasing labor force of this age group. The final part of the article focuses on the development of long-term unemployment among young people. For all indicators, not only data for the entire population, but also separate data for women and men are used. It is evident that the youth unemployment rate is higher than the unemployment rate of the whole labour force. Young people also suffered a significantly higher level of long-term unemployment than the whole population. Unemployment among young people is at the center of attention not only in the Czech Republic, but it is serious problem of whole European union and this is the reason why governments of member states adopt various types of measures which are also discussed in this paper.","[Sirucek, Pavel; Pavelka, Tomas] Univ Econ Prague, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,sirucek@vse.cz; pavelkat@vse.cz,,,,,,,9,4,4,2,11,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1278,1287,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100128,0

Municipalities with more than 3000 inhabitants in the Czech Republic create about 93 % of all municipalities and home to a total of 3.3 million inhabitants, i.e about one third of the population of the country. This size category is in this research considered to be part of rural space. Some of these municipalities are growing, some are not. This development is affected not only its geographic location, but also many other factors. Many authors seek how these communities can be diversified (different typologies of rural areas are created) and how the differences between rural communities can be reduced (addressing disparities). In recent years, it appears that one of the major factors that cause differences between municipalities is social capital. The question remains, however, how to measure social capital at the level of individual municipalities. This paper presents a methodology how to measure the social capital of municipalities that was developed within two years of research supported by the GAUK. Using the research design of case studies that closely monitor and evaluate hundred characteristics in 18 villages in three different regions of the Czech Republic, 10 indicators were found, from which an index of potential development potential of communities was developed. Half of this index consists of indicators related to social capital (individual and collective). The paper presents these indicators, the way they were determined and the possibility of subsequent use of the partial index of social municipal capital.","Univ Karlova Praze, Fak Socialnich Ved, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Skála, V (通讯作者)，Univ Karlova Praze, Fak Socialnich Ved, Smetanovo Nabr 6, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic.",skala@ptl.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,315,321,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300028,0

These decisions can be decomposed into portfolio rebalancing and portfolio growth components, as highlighted by theoretical models. The empirical literature draws attention to the relative importance of portfolio rebalancing to explain fluctuations in capital flows, although they do not shed light on the mechanisms behind these rebalancing effects. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence of the importance of portfolio rebalancing driven by changes in investment opportunities for the dynamics of the current account. In particular, we evaluate the predictions of a partial-equilibrium model of the current account with dynamic portfolio choices, in which portfolio rebalancing is driven by changes in expected asset returns. Focusing on the dynamics of the current account between Japan and the US, we find evidence supporting innovations in investment opportunities as an important mechanism to explain international capital flows.

While a number of national-scale water quality models have been used over the years, there has been less exploration of economic models to estimate benefits.

The rise of the skilled class leads to a majority for an initial expansion of public education spending. This expansion further boosts the number of skilled parents and, thus, future demand for higher education. The induced shift in demand implies that the initial subsidy per student becomes too expensive to be politically sustainable. The initial educational 'take-off' provokes a backlash at the polls. A majority now successfully calls for higher private contributions to the costs of university education. Nevertheless, overall enrolment continues to rise. But equality of opportunity, that went up in the expansion period, declines afterwards. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While the bill was intended by the provincial Conservative government to reduce costs and increase efficiency, the FPA has also had substantial unanticipated consequences for political party organizations in Ontario. I first review the introduction of the FPA and, second, draw on 60 interviews with party constituency association officials, including seven long-term participants with experience prior to the introduction of the FPA, and make a comparison of associations in Ontario and New Brunswick (where boundaries are not identical) to demonstrate that congruent boundaries facilitate integration and cooperation between national and provincial political parties in the constituencies. Congruent riding boundaries do so by merging the geographic and ecological contexts that both national and provincial party organizations structure themselves in response to, and by reducing the number of actors participating in national-provincial cooperation. The FPA can therefore be understood as a case study of legislation containing important unanticipated consequences, and I conclude the article by evaluating the FPA from this perspective.","Univ Manitoba, Dept Polit Studies, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Koop, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Polit Studies, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,1,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We conduct our empirical approach in two steps. First, we estimate the Boone indicator, which is a measure of competition. We then regress this measure and other explanatory variables on the banking stability inefficiency derived simultaneously from the estimation of a stability stochastic frontier. Unlike previous findings, this paper concludes that competition affects risk-taking behavior in a non-linear way as both high and low competition levels enhance financial stability, while we find the opposite effect for average competition. In addition, bank size and capitalization are essential factors in explaining this relationship. On the one hand, the larger a bank is, the more it benefits from competition. On the other hand, a greater capital ratio is advantageous for banks that operate in collusive markets, while capitalization only enhances the stability of larger banks under high and average competition. These results are of extreme importance when considering bank regulations, especially in light of the recent turmoil in the global financial markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Young cohorts initially have no assets and wages are the main source of income; these cohorts prefer relatively low real interest rates, relatively high wages, and relatively high rates of inflation. Older cohorts work less and prefer higher rates of return from their savings, relatively low wages, and relatively low inflation. In the absence of intergenerational redistribution through lump-sum taxes and transfers, the constrained efficient competitive equilibrium requires optimal distortions on relative prices. The authors' model allows the social planner to use inflation/deflation to try to achieve the optimal distortions. In the model economy, changes in the population structure are interpreted as the ability of a particular cohort to influence the redistributive policy. When older cohorts have more influence on the redistributive policy, the economy has a relatively low steady-state level of capital and a relatively low steady-state rate of inflation. The opposite happens when young cohorts have more control of policy. These results suggest that aging population structures, such as those in Japan, may contribute to observed low rates of inflation or even deflation.

There is considerable debate about whether population ageing puts downwards or upwards pressure on house prices. The empirical approach differs from earlier studies of this relationship, which are mainly regression analyses of macro time-series data. A micro-simulation methodology is adopted that combines a macro-level house price model with a micro-level household formation model. The case study is Scotland, a country that is expected to age rapidly in the future. The parameters of the household formation model are estimated with panel data from the British Household Panel Survey covering the period 19992008. The estimates are then used to carry out a set of simulations. The simulations are based on a set of population projections that represent a considerable range in the rate of population ageing. The main finding from the simulations is that population ageing or more generally changes in age structure is not likely a main determinant of house prices, at least in Scotland.","[Chen, Yu; Gibb, Kenneth] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Leishman, Chris] Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wright, Robert] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow; Heriot Watt University; University of Strathclyde,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,"Leishman, Chris/HDM-4393-2022; Leishman, Christian/AAL-5333-2021","Leishman, Chris/0000-0002-7853-5035; Leishman, Christian/0000-0002-7853-5035; Chen, Yu/0000-0002-7694-4441",ESRC [ES/G027153/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G027153/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,31,12,19,5,57,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

It takes into account endogenous effects of changes in fiscal policy on the economy and in turn the effect of changes in the economy on the deficit. A base run is first obtained for the 2013:12022:4 period in which there are no major changes in U.S. fiscal policy. This results in an ever increasing debt/GDP ratio. Then transfer payments are decreased by an amount sufficient to stabilize the long-run debt/GDP ratio. The results show that transfer payments need to be decreased by 2% of GDP from the base run, which over the 10 years is $3.2 trillion in 2005 dollars and $4.8 trillion in current dollars. The real output loss is 1.1% of baseline GDP. Monetary policy helps keep the loss down, but it is not powerful enough in the model to eliminate all of the loss.

We find mixed evidence on the relation between charter value and our measures of bank risk. The results also show a positive association between off-balance sheet activities and bank risk. It is also evident that dividend payout ratio is negatively related to all risk measures. We find large banks reflect higher total risk and lower credit risk. Following the creation of the Economic Monetary Union, we also observe an increase in bank risk sensitivity to both bank capital and off-balance sheet activities and a decrease in the sensitivity of bank risk to charter value.

J,"Wang, XH",,,,"Wang, Xianghong",,,When workers do not know - The behavioral effects of minimum wage laws revisited,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Minimum wage; Fairness; Employment; Asymmetric information,LABOR; FAIRNESS,"Previous experimental results have shown that the introduction of a minimum wage increases wages in a monopsonistic labor market. The results rely on the assumption that the minimum wage laws are common knowledge among employers and workers, which is often violated in less developed labor markets. This paper examines the effect of asymmetric knowledge about the minimum wage, and its interaction with the level of the minimum wage standard. We find that, whether the workers have knowledge about the minimum wage significantly changes the behavioral impacts of the minimum wage policy. With common knowledge, most firms offer wages beyond the minimum wage level. When workers do not know about the minimum wage policy, many firms, including those who used to pay higher wages before the introduction of the policy, choose to pay wages at the minimum level or lower their offers toward the minimum level. This causes the introduction of the minimum wage not effective in increasing average wages when the minimum wage standard is low. Therefore, a low minimum wage under asymmetric knowledge may potentially have a negative spillover effect on wages. The asymmetric knowledge also affects the employment level negatively. These findings help explain why the impacts of minimum wage are different in labor markets where workers have different degree of information access. This has strong implications for the implementation and welfare impacts of minimum wage laws. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Data on fiscal expenditures and growth for a database of 140 countries (118 developing countries) over 1972-2005 are reorganized around turning points providing a summary but encompassing description of what is in the data. For this sample, the probability of occurrence of a fiscal event is about 10%, and, the probability of a growth event once a fiscal event had occurred is around 26%. For developing countries, fiscal events followed by growth events occur under situations of (i) significantly lesser deficit, (ii) fewer resources devoted to non-interest general public services and (iii) shift in primary expenditures toward transport & communication. After controlling for the growth-inducing effects of positive terms-of-trade shocks and of trade liberalization reform, probit estimates indicate that a growth event is more likely to occur in a developing country when surrounded by a fiscal event. Moreover, the probability of occurrence of a growth event in the years following a fiscal event is greater the lower is the associated fiscal deficit, confirming that success of a growth-oriented fiscal expenditure reform is associate with a stabilized macroeconomic environment (through limited primary fiscal deficit).

Using a methodology based on linear transfer function models, the objective of this paper is to reflect on the future of hubs and on whether their role as large geographical air transport nodes is in doubt. Although Spanish hubs have continued to strengthen their position of dominance, the consequences of this enforced coexistence has manifested itself in a substitution effect, with LCCs replacing FSNCs at the hubs for international, primarily intra-European, flights. The market for national flights, however, has not experienced any significant changes as this new development of LCCs in this market is fundamentally based on new demand from both new passengers and the greater travel frequency of current passengers. There is also room for complementarity between the two models, as national connections with LCC hubs feed long-distance destinations exploited solely by the FSNCs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This analysis is complemented with a study of the commercial evolution of the three airports. It is noticeable the impact of low-cost carriers in the evolution of the configuration of the network over time. A de-concentration effect is also shown to occur, due to the interaction between airport and airline decisions that favour network development.

We find that an investor may not reduce her investment in risky assets when facing more frequent jumps, as suggested by a single-asset jump-diffusion model.

More specifically, we apply this model to examine the explanatory and predictive power of price range and trading volume for return volatility. Our findings indicate that a negative relation between equity market returns and volatility prevails even after having controlled for the time-varying determinants of conditional volatility within each regime. We also find an asymmetry in the effect of price range on intra- and inter-regime return volatility. While price range has a stronger effect in the high volatility state, it appears to significantly affect only the transition probabilities when the stock market is in the low volatility state but not in the high volatility state. Finally, we provide evidence consistent with the 'rebound' model of asset returns proposed by Samuelson (1991), suggesting that long-horizon investors are expected to invest more in risky assets than short-horizon investors.

The results confirm the importance of using nonlinear models to address companies' exchange rate exposure. The results indicate that when compared to the linear model commonly used in literature, the nonlinear model leads to an increase in the number of firms exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which allows a more accurate analysis of the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of firms. In addition, the paper shows that exporters and companies that hold foreign currency denominated debt are more likely to be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations and that the nonlinearity of companies' foreign exchange exposure is associated with the use of foreign currency derivatives.

When a guaranty fund is advantageous given homogeneous firms in the market, all policyholders benefit from it to the same extent, if they have the same underlying risk preferences and are charged identical premiums. In a more realistic heterogeneous setting, the introduction of an insurance guaranty fund is in general no longer beneficial for all policyholders in the same manner. Hence, systematic wealth transfers take place between the policyholders of different insurance companies.

This paper estimates a system of FYM allocation regressions to examine the role of returns to FYM and farmers' impatience on the propensity to allocate FYM to different uses. We parameterize the model using data from a sample of 493 households in Ethiopia. Results indicate a heightened incentive for diverting FYM from farming to marketing for burning outside the household when returns to selling FYM and the farmer's discount rate are high. These reveal the need for policies that will help to reduce farmers' impatience and encourage the substitution of alternative energy sources to increase the use of FYM as a sustainable land management practice.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Teklewold, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Hailemariam.Teklewold@economics.gu.se,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Despite the evident policy demand for this combined transfer and scaling up of values, an approach to value transfer that addresses the challenges inherent in assessing ecosystem changes at a national or regional level is not available. This paper proposes a methodology for scaling up ecosystem service values to estimate the welfare effects of ecosystem change at this larger geographical scale. The methodology is illustrated by applying it to value the impact of climate change on European wetlands for the period 2000-2050. The proposed methodology makes use of meta-analysis to produce a value function. The parameters of the value function include spatial variables on wetland size and abundance, GDP per capita, and population. A geographic information system is used to construct a database of wetland sites in the case study region with information on these spatial variables. Site-specific ecosystem service values are subsequently estimated using the meta-analytic value function. The proposed method is shown to enable the adjustment of transferred values to reflect variation in important spatial variables and to account for changes in the stock of ecosystems.","[Braeuer, Ingo] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Gerdes, Holger] Inst Ecol, D-10717 Berlin, Germany; [Ghermandi, Andrea] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Kuik, Onno; Schaafsma, Marije; Wagtendonk, Alfred] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1018 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Markandya, Anil] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Bilbao 48008, Bizkaia, Spain; [Navrud, Stale] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway; [Nunes, Paulo A.

It appears that service demand and housing supply are essential in creating the linear movement of housing prices.

When the tax rate applicable to realized losses exceeds that on realized capital gains, it can be optimal to realize capital gains immediately and pay capital gain taxes to regain the option to use potential future losses against a higher tax rate. This incentive adds an entirely new and as yet unstudied dimension to the portfolio problem. It causes risk averse investors to hold more equity and attain higher welfare levels than is the case when trading under a tax system that seeks to collect the same amount of taxes, but does not allow for tax rebate payments. This is because the benefit to these investors from having their losses subsidized is greater than the suffering from having profits taxed at a higher rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, critics suggest an excess supply of REDD credits may disrupt emerging carbon markets and raise north-south equity concerns. In this context, we investigate the economic implications of REDD regulations and future emissions reduction commitments. Numerical model simulations show that unrestricted exchange of REDD units reduces the international carbon price by half and cuts compliance costs by roughly one-third. Developed nations' requirements for policy supplementarity, which restrict demand for REDD credits, reduce such price impacts but go at the expense of both economic efficiency and benefits to rainforest areas. Instead, unlimited REDD access facilitates climate policy targets to be tightened by almost a quarter at constant compliance cost, tripling the environmental ambition of the Kyoto Protocol and providing considerable wealth transfers to developing countries.","[Anger, Niels] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Anger, N (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, POB 10 34 43, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",niels.anger@gmail.com; alistair.dixon@kea3.co.nz; erich.livengood@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

This phenomenon is called the persistence of innovation. Although the literature has established that innovation persistence is indeed important from an empirical point of view, relatively little attention has been paid to identifying the reasons why this is the case. In this article, we contribute to the literature by proposing that differences in innovation strategies across firms are an important driving force behind innovation persistence. We analyses this issue using a panel database constructed from R&D and Community Innovation Surveys in Norway. Empirical measures of five innovation strategies are identified by means of an inductive method: ad hoc, supplier based, market driven, R&D intensive and science based. A dynamic random effects probit model is used to estimate whether and to what extent these innovation strategies are a source of persistent innovation. The results support the idea that the differences in innovation strategies across firms are an important determinant of the firms' probability to repeatedly innovate. More concretely, we found that firms pursuing the strategies market driven, R&D intensive, and science based were more likely to be persistent innovators. We also distinguish the effects of strategy differences on the persistence of product and process innovation in all firms, and within high-tech versus low-tech firms.","[Pohjola, Mikko] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Turku Sch Econ, Ctr Collaborat Res, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Pohjola, Mikko] Univ Turku, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Clausen, Tommy] Nordland Res Inst, N-8027 Bodo, Norway; [Sapprasert, Koson] Univ Oslo, TIK, Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture TIK, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Verspagen, Bart] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; University of Turku; University of Oslo; Maastricht University,"Pohjola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Turku Sch Econ, Ctr Collaborat Res, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",tcl@nforsk.no; Mikko.Pohjola@tse.fi; mupohj@utu.fi; b.verspagen@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Verspagen, Bart/ABE-6732-2020","Verspagen, Bart/0000-0001-6975-8141",,,,,75,97,108,6,110,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Looking at the export side, we find (on the basis of the system generalized method of moments estimator) a positive effect of exports on industry wage premia. The results also show that import penetration has a significant and negative impact on industry wage differentials.

The volatility of Swiss-franc-East-Asian currencies' exchange rates is higher during the synchronization period than during the de-synchronization period. Contrary to traditional arguments concerning the yen-bloc, we find that the Export-Similarity Index and Foreign Portfolio Investment between Japan and East Asian countries are the two main determinants of yen-synchronization in the region. Finally, microstructural analysis shows that the weeks of synchronization is greater when the yen is strong for Korea and Taiwan, but there are no asymmetric responses for Thailand.

Our analysis is centered on three issues. First, we test whether the US house prices are converging over time using log t convergence test by Phillips and Sul (2007). The test results suggest that there is little evidence of overall convergence. The second issue is to investigate the possibility of a convergence club where the cross-sectional dispersion of house prices of the club members decreases over time. We utilize a clustering algorithm and the results support that there is strong evidence of multiple convergence clubs. Finally, we examine the general characteristics of the various convergence and divergence subgroups as well as some important driving forces of convergence clubs. We find that housing supply regulation together with climate are important determinants of convergence club membership. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Individuals who have recently experienced extreme weather (heat waves or droughts) are more likely to support laws to protect the environment. We find evidence that the channel through which weather conditions affect policy preference is via perceptions of the importance of the issue of global warming. Furthermore, environmentalists and individuals who consult more sources of news are less likely to have their attitudes toward global warming changed by current weather conditions. These findings suggest that communication and education emphasizing consequences of climate change salient to the individual's circumstances may be the most effective in changing attitudes of those least likely to support proenvironment policy.

We use SHARE data to study the influence of current health status and future health risk on the decision to hold risky assets, across ten European countries with different health systems, each offering a different degree of protection against out-of-pocket medical expenditures. We find robust empirical evidence that perceived health status matters more than objective health status and, consistent with the theory of background risk, health risk affects portfolio choices only in countries with less protective health care systems.

However, researchers have yet to systematically investigate whether political criteria influence the distribution of funds through Bolsa Familia. This is especially surprising given the program's prominence in the international community. In this paper, I examine whether political criteria explain the federal government's distribution of Bolsa Familia.

This paper argues that a possible reason why some studies may conclude that aid is ineffective in promoting economic growth might be that not all aid is given for development purposes (i.e. aid given for strategic considerations, humanitarian reasons or emergency relief). This study classifies foreign aid into four subcategories: agricultural aid, social infrastructure aid, investment aid, and non-investment aid. Using the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique on a Barro type growth regression with panel data from the aid recipient economies, this paper finds that when aid is directed to the agricultural sector of the developing countries, it is positively and significantly related to growth and can affect economic growth in the short run.","[Kaya, Ozgur] UAE Univ, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Gunter, Lewell] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Kaya, Ilker] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",United Arab Emirates University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; American University of Sharjah,"Kaya, O (通讯作者)，UAE Univ, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",okaya@uaeu.ac.ae; lgunter@uga.edu; ikaya@aus.edu,"kaya, ozgur/X-4406-2019; kaya, ilker/S-7910-2019","kaya, ozgur/0000-0001-7034-8780; kaya, ilker/0000-0002-8666-8794",,,,,46,22,22,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The premium persists only for withdrawn-IPOs that are acquired before their IPO withdrawals after other factors are controlled for.

(2007, GBR) compare a social welfare (SW) indicator with the ecological footprint (EF) indicator for measuring spatial sustainability of a set of land use configurations. Their main result is that the SW and the EF indicator can yield completely different rankings and only for extreme parameterizations of environmental externalities the rankings coincide. We adapt the model by interpreting total natural land as a resource constraint and differentiate between weak and strong sustainability. In a sensitivity analysis we show that the main results of GBR (2007) correspond to the case of weak sustainability in our adapted model version. In the case of strong sustainability our adapted model version shows the same welfare rankings for both indicators without the extreme parameterization that is necessary to obtain the same results in the original GBR (2007) model.","[Kratena, Kurt] Austrian Inst Econ Res, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Streicher, Gerhard] Ctr Econ & Innovat Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",,"Kratena, K (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res, Obj 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",kurt.kratena@wifo.ac.at,,"Kratena, Kurt/0000-0003-2159-2108",,,,,9,7,8,3,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The main theories have been centered in (1) the study of the individual behavior of people (donors, non-profit entrepreneurs), (2) one single factor or (3) one single country. To quantify this approach, data for 38 countries have been used, extracted from World Values Survey, United Nations Development Program and Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. A structural modeling approach based in partial least squares (PLS) has been applied. The results provide evidence of the strength of environmental factors such as trust, economic development and social care public expenditures in non-profit activity. The model doesn't confirm the existence of a positive relationship between entrepreneurship and non-profit activity.

The latter effect seems to be entrepreneurship-specific, because the investment behavior of the generally more talented does not differ from that of other participants.

We find that the largest and most creditworthy buyers receive contracts with the longest maturities from smaller suppliers, and that discounts for early payment tend to be offered to riskier buyers.","[Laeven, Luc] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Rajan, Raghuram] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rajan, Raghuram] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Klapper, Leora] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",International Monetary Fund; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; The World Bank,"Laeven, L (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",Llaeven@imf.org,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0962321] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,28,198,221,9,87,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The sample covers nine major central banks from January 1999 to July 2007. We find, first, that transparency reduces the bias in money market expectations and dampens their variation. Second, informal communications help manage financial market expectations by reducing the variation of expectations. Third, various subcategories of the Eijffinger and Geraats (2006) transparency index lead to a smaller bias in expectations (in particular, evaluation of policy outcome and explanation of interest rate decisions) and to a reduction in the variation of expectations (in particular, explicit prioritization of objectives and provision of information on unanticipated macroeconomic disturbances).

According to the understanding of new regional development, the investments for developing social infrastructure and human capital are as important as for public production and physical infrastructure. In fact, the former group of investments is essential to benefit from the latter This study analyzes the effects of public capital on the income of provinces in Turkey for the 19872001 periods.

While some scholars claim that water-based conflicts can never occur, this analysis identifies a negotiation interval whose size depends on water availability and asymmetry in productive ability between countries. This interval is assimilated to the probability-to-conflict which is decreasing with its size. We show that the risk of conflict increases with scarcer water resources but, as well, the higher the asymmetry level, the higher is the probability-to-conflict. Whenever this heterogeneity is extremely large, there is no opportunity for cooperation. Then, given the existence of this negotiation interval, we turn to the Nashbargaining solution to highlight the optimal water allocation. We show that the amount of water allocated to a country is decreasing as long its productive ability increases.","[Soubeyran, Antoine; Tomini, Agnes] Aix Marseille Univ, GREQAM, F-13290 Les Milles, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Tomini, A (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, GREQAM, Route Milles, F-13290 Les Milles, France.",soubey@univ-amu.fr; agnes.tomini@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,41,2,3,1,28,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Yet, we still lack a reliable empirical estimate of the effect. This study addresses the econometric shortcomings of the literature and provides an estimate of the causal impact of corruption on gross domestic product per capita across countries. Certain dimensions of a country's culture are used as instruments for corruption. These instruments stay strong when the other deep determinants of economic development, geography, and the remaining dimensions of institutions and culture are controlled for. In the process of choosing controls, however, the entire set of variables available in the Quality of Governance online database (QOG) that includes all central variables from the literature on institutions and culture are included.

Therefore estimating environmental benefits allows, on the one hand, environment's monetization, and on the other hand to formulate opinions about awareness regarding environmental issues and their impact on individual wellbeing. Departing from these facts, the paper aims to measure the environmental benefits of a real estate goods consumer, realizing an estimation of incompliant landfills (ICL) proximity's impact on the value of these goods. For estimation, it was used the method of hedonic pricing and were processed regarding Bucharest periphery. Providing quantitative information regarding the importance of ecological criteria in the procurement of real estate goods, verification of the relevance of available estimations for Romania and the identification of the model that explains the impact of ICL on the value of real estate goods are the main contribution brought to knowledge development. In fact, the results obtained are aligned with the results of similar assessments made in Europe, indicating that 31,2% of the variation of real estate goods' value is determined by the proximity of landfil.

This structure is unique in that industrial companies and securities firms are affiliated and operate within the same group. We investigate the informational content of earnings forecasts, stock recommendations and target prices made by the chaebol-affiliated analysts, using data collected between 2000 and 2008. The chaebol analysts tend to make more optimistic earnings forecasts for the member companies. The mean EPS forecast error (5.36%) of the affiliated analysts for the same chaebol company are significantly larger than that (3.23%) of other chaebol and independent analysts. The chaebol analysts also assign better recommendations by almost one level and set target prices 2.5% higher to the member companies after controlling for company and analyst characteristics. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chaebol analysts' reports are biased by conflicts of interest. Stock market reactions do not differ in response to announcements of stock recommendations issued by affiliated vs. non-affiliated analysts. This suggests that capital markets do not recognize the conflicts of interest inherent in chaebol analysts' reports. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Reduced competition in the banking system was due to regulations adopted by many countries after the financial crisis of the 1930s. At that time, authorities believed that the high risks which banks have assumed, in a fierce competition context, led to destabilization of the financial system. After the 1980s, deregulation, financial liberalization and technological change were important factors that have led to increased competition in the banking sector. Therefore, an important issue for regulators and supervisors is the relationship between competition in the banking system and financial stability. The specialty literature, both theoretical and empirical, has not reached a consensus on the effects of competition on financial stability. This problem became more acute under the global financial crisis. Against this background, the paper analyses the role of competition in the Romanian banking system in the context of the global crisis. The paper is structured as follows: the first section reviews the arguments supporting that increased competition in banking system leads to improved financial stability; the counterarguments are mentioned later. The role of regulations in managing the competition in banking system is also emphasised. The last section analyzes developments on competition and stability in the Romanian banking system.

The stock market is the archetypal example, which in most developed economies captures a lot of attention and resources. Is the stock market just a sideshow or does it affect real economic activity? In this review, we discuss the potential real effects of financial markets that stem from the informational role of market prices. We review the theoretical literature and show that accounting for the feedback effect from market prices to the real economy significantly changes our understanding of the price formation process, the informativeness of the price, and speculators' trading behavior. We make two main points. First, we argue that a new definition of price efficiency is needed to account for the extent to which prices reflect information that is useful for the efficiency of real decisions (rather than the extent to which they forecast future cash flows). Second, incorporating the feedback effect into models of financial markets can explain various market phenomena that otherwise seem puzzling.

We test a model that determines how the influence on EO of external factors and internal factors differs in first-, second- and third-and-beyond-generation family firms. We argue that while the founder is vital in the first generation, EO is more subject to interpretations of the competitive environment in the second generation and that in the third generation and beyond, access to non-family resources drives EO to a greater extent. Our findings show that perceptions of the competitive environment and EO correlate differently in family firms, depending on the generation in charge, and it is generally stronger in second-generation family firms. Further, we find that non-family managers on the top management team makes a positive difference for EO only in the third-generation and beyond family firms. The significance of non-family investors' on EO is particularly strong in third-generation-and-beyond firms.","[Nordqvist, Mattias] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, SE-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Cruz, Cristina] Inst Empresa, Madrid 28006, Spain",Jonkoping University; IE University,"Nordqvist, M (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, POB 1026, SE-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",cristina.cruz@ie.edu; mattias.nordqvist@ihh.hj.se,,,,,,,73,280,308,2,139,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

These advantages include being applicable when attendance zones are not available or less relevant to educational outcomes as arises with within district school choice and for examining the effect of factors like school spending or property taxes that do not vary within districts. However, school district boundaries have often been in place for many years allowing households to sort based on school quality and potentially creating distinct neighborhoods on either side of boundaries. We estimate models of housing prices using repeated cross-sections of housing transactions near school district boundaries in Connecticut. These models exploit changes over time to control for across boundary differences in neighborhood quality. We find significant effects of test scores on property values, but those effects are notably smaller than both OLS and traditional boundary fixed effects estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, announcements that reflect an unexpected improvement in the economy tend to have a negative impact on gold and silver prices; however, they tend to have a positive effect on copper prices.

The CBO's deficit projections for the current fiscal year (FY) and the next 10 FYs are widely followed because they provide an assessment of the medium-term budget outlook based on current law and a presumed path for the economy over the next decade. Admittedly, this task is more difficult because of the required assumption that the laws governing future outlays and revenues do not change. Nevertheless, given its nonpartisan nature and the CBO's well-respected staff of professional economists and budget analysts, its projections are closely followed. In this article, the authors update their 2001 assessment of the accuracy of the CBO's short- and medium-term budget projections by adding an additional 10 years of data. Such analysis is useful in light of the dramatic change in actual and expected fiscal policy, especially over the past few years. In addition, they investigate the extent to which the CBO's projection errors are affected by errors in forecasting key economic variables and the extent to which the errors relate more to inaccurate projections of revenues or expenditures.

The WTI was constructed by authors using hard data as well as soft data expressing qualified expert opinion gained from a questionnaire survey conducted among tax specialist from OECD countries. It is a multi-criteria index consisting of several sub-indices that deal with different groups of taxes, which are basically consistent with the classification according to the OECD. All the parts are used in further regression analysis to approximate the tax burden in growth model. As an alternative, also the tax quota is used, being the most applied indicator of tax burden. Results show that tax quota is not suitable for tax burden approximation, especially in case of corporate taxes or VAT.

To extend their work, Lam, Liu, and Wong [2010] have developed a model of weight assignments using a pseudo-Bayesian approach that reflects investors' behavioral biases. In this parsimonious model of investor sentiment, weights induced by investors' conservative and representative heuristics are assigned to observations of the earning shocks of stock prices. Such weight assignments enable us to provide a quantitative link between some market anomalies and investors' behavioral biases. This paper extends their work further by developing a theory to explain some market anomalies, including short-term underreaction, long-term overreaction, and excess volatility. We also explain in detail the linkage between these market anomalies and investors' behavioral biases.","[Wong, Wing-Keung] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, WLB, Dept Econ, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Taisheng] Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong Ltd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Wong, WK (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, WLB, Dept Econ, Shaw Campus, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",awong@hkbu.edu.hk,"Wong, Wing-Keung/B-8864-2013",,,,,,66,21,21,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

With that objective in mind, asset pricing models have been developed, starting with the capital asset pricing models of Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Mossin (1966). Consumption-based asset pricing models use marginal rates of substitution to determine the relative prices of the date, event-contingent, composite consumption good. This model class is characterized by a stochastic discount factor process that puts restrictions on the joint process of asset returns and per capita consumption. This review takes a critical look at this class of models and their inability to rationalize the statistics that have characterized US financial markets over the past century. The intuition behind the discrepancy between model prediction and empirical data is explained. Finally, the research efforts to enhance the model's ability to replicate the empirical data are summarized.","[Mehra, Rajnish] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Mehra, Rajnish] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Sch Finance, L-1468 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Mehra, Rajnish] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Luxembourg; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mehra, R (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Rajnish.Mehra@asu.edu,,,,,,,79,27,30,0,20,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4804-5,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

There are also times when a run-up in S&P 500 index is accompanied by a run-up in volatility, in line with views of Corsi (2004), Marcelo et al. (2006). This relationship is also asymmetric in the sense that negative S&P 500 index returns yield bigger proportional changes in VIX than positive returns do. If S&P 500 index rises by 1%, the VIX will fall by 2.9734%, on the other hand, if S&P 500 index edges down by 1%, VIX will recovers 3.3621%. From the angle of S&P 500 index yield, asymmetric ARCH model results confirms the robustness of asymmetric movements, which further reviews market participants' demand for portfolio insurance (Whaley, 2008). The empirical studying also finds that VIX is Granger causality to S&P 500 index and its return rate. VIX serves as the better roles of directing and forecasting stock index changes. Furthermore, there is a steady equilibrium in the long run.

Consequently, language instructors are required to adjust course materials, teaching objectives and didactic strategies in order to address the students' adequate English language speaking abilities. The finality of these language acquisitions consists of equipping students with proper communicational tools which should allow them to be competitive agents on both the Romanian labor market and abroad.

However, none of the studies deals with the social security systems including their coordination as a relevant explanatory factor. The paper focuses on the social security systems in Europe, their mutual coordination and their influence on international migration. The influence of social systems on economic migration can be twofold: influencing the labour migration, i.e. migrants who move for work, and also influencing the benefit migration, i.e. migrants who move in order to receive social benefits. We present the advanced migration model extended by the factors of social security coordination. The main finding is that the labour migration prevails significantly over the benefit migration. Role of social systems as social magnets was not proved to be statistically significant.","[Tepperova, Jana; Klazar, Stanislav] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Tepperová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",jana.tepperova@vse.cz; klazar@vse.cz,"Klazar, Stanislav/C-4619-2008",,,,,,49,5,5,1,26,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

More specifically we show that MNL acreage choice models can be defined as parts of consistent multicrop models. When coupled with suitably designed crop production models, e.g. a specific parameterization of the standard quadratic yield function, the parameters of these multicrop models are easily interpreted and estimated. Although MNL acreage choice models are usually derived by aggregating crop choices defined at the plot level, we show that these models can also be derived by considering a profit maximisation problem at the farm level. This provides a simple theoretical background for the Standard MNL acreage share model, as well as for simple extensions of these models: the Nested MNL acreage share models. An empirical application on French farm-level data over the period 1996-2007 investigates the empirical performances of the multicrop econometric models based on the proposed MNL framework for modelling acreage choices.","[Carpentier, Alain; Letort, Elodie] INRA, SMART UMR1302, F-35000 Rennes, France",INRAE; Universite de Rennes,"Carpentier, A (通讯作者)，INRA, SMART UMR1302, 4 Allee Adolphe Bobierre, F-35000 Rennes, France.",Alain.Carpentier@rennes.inra.fr,,,,,,,38,18,21,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Based on a detailed cross-sectional survey of English households, it finds that housing demand is significantly determined by a household's human capital, and that housing demand generally increases with age. After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household's demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.

The BIXI system has been a success, accounting for more than one million trips annually. This success has increased the interest in exploring the factors affecting bicycle-sharing flows and usage. Using data compiled as minute-by-minute readings of bicycle availability at all the stations of the BIXI system between April and August 2012, this study contributes to the literature on bicycle-sharing. We examine the influence of meteorological data, temporal characteristics, bicycle infrastructure, land use and built environment attributes on arrival and departure flows at the station level using a multilevel approach to statistical modeling, which could easily be applied to other regions. The findings allow us to identify factors contributing to increased usage of bicycle-sharing in Montreal and to provide recommendations pertaining to station size and location decisions. The developed methodology and findings can be of benefit to city planners and engineers who are designing or modifying bicycle-sharing systems with the goal of maximizing usage and availability.

The complexity of the financial sector means that a wide range of financial variables is needed to fully characterize its functioning in real time. In this paper we construct a financial conditions index (FCI) for the euro area following the studies by Hatzius et al. and Brave and Butters. Our FCI successfully tracks both worldwide and euro-area-specific financial events. We then incorporate the FCI into a VAR model comprising output, inflation, the monetary policy rate, bank loans and bank lending spreads to identify credit supply shocks with sign restrictions. These shocks are estimated to have caused around one-fifth of the decline in euro-area manufacturing production at the trough of the financial crisis and a rise in bank lending spreads of around 30 basis points.","[Moccero, Diego Nicolas] European Cent Bank, Macro Financial Linkages Div, Frankfurt, Germany; [Paries, Matthieu Darracq; Maurin, Laurent] European Cent Bank, Monetary Anal Div, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; European Central Bank,"Moccero, DN (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Macro Financial Linkages Div, Frankfurt, Germany.",diego.moccero@ecb.int,,,,,,,29,11,14,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Using nationally representative data from Bangladesh, this study analyses changes in fish consumption from 2000 to 2010. Rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture pegged down fish prices, resulting in increased fish consumption by extreme poor and moderate poor consumers and those in rural areas. These outcomes are closely linked to the pro-poor nature of national economic growth during this period.

This study analyzes the impacts of the Mexican tariff on USA, Mexican and world apple markets by using theoretical analysis and developing a spatial equilibrium trade model. The results show that this tariff increases apple prices in Mexico, to the benefit of Mexican producers but harming Mexican consumers. Even though Mexico collects revenues from its tariff, the overall welfare impact is negative because consumers' loss outweighs producers' gain and tariff revenues. Since the USA exports less to Mexico, its prices and production decline, but consumption increases. To mitigate the export market loss to Mexico, the USA redirects its exports to other importing countries, displacing other apple exporting countries' trade with these importing countries.","[Devadoss, Stephen] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Ridley, William] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Ridley, W (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",devadoss@uidaho.edu,"Ridley, William/JWF-6189-2024","Ridley, William/0000-0002-9829-5913",,,,,31,7,10,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In our model, entrepreneurs consider undertaking risky projects in the real sector as well as selling part of their projects to investors. To capture the idea of an asymmetric environment, the returns on the alternative risk-free investment are allowed to differ between the entrepreneurs and the investors, i.e., agents have different opportunity costs of participating in the risky projects. We first show that the presence of asymmetric options establishes links between the risk-free and risky sectors as well as between the real and financial sectors. In particular, an asymmetric environment implies that the amount of risk sharing depends on the risk-free rates and the expected return of the risky project. Moreover, the level of real investment also depends on the risk-free rates. Second, we show how different risk-free rates may encourage or discourage risk sharing, and even prevent risk sharing altogether. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

On average, exporting firms are more productive than firms that sell on the national market only. The Melitz (Econometrica 71: 1695-1725, 2003) model, however, has implications for not only mean differences but also differences in the distribution of productivity. Furthermore, exporting firms may be different from non-exporting firms for reasons that are not included in the Melitz model. We believe that conditioning on firm fixed effects and studying the distribution of productivity are both necessary for empirical tests of the Melitz model. This paper is the first to employ a new quantile estimation technique for panel data introduced in Powell (Did the economic stimulus payments of 2008 reduce labor supply? Evidence from quantile panel data estimation. RAND Corporation Publications Department, Santa Monica, 2014). We find that the premium is positive at all productivity levels, but highest at the lowest quantiles. These results support theoretical models which suggest that there is a division in productivity between exporters and non-exporters.","[Powell, David] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA; [Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Luneburg, Germany",RAND Corporation; Leuphana University Luneburg,"Powell, D (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA.",dpowell@rand.org; wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012; Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536;",,,,,43,43,44,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Since the average duration of crises in this sample of countries is longer than one year, the predictive performance of standard binomial logit models is likely to be hampered by the so-called crisis duration bias. The bias arises from the decision to either treat crisis years after the onset of a crisis as non-crisis years or remove them altogether from the model. To overcome this potential drawback, we propose a multinomial logit approach, which is shown to improve the predictive power of our EWS compared to the binomial logit model. Our results suggest that crisis events in low income countries are associated with low economic growth, drying up of banking system liquidity and widening of foreign exchange net open positions.

To achieve this goal, the signal extraction approach proposed by Kaminsky et al. ( 1998) is used to monitor the evolution of a number of economic indicators that tend to exhibit unusual behavior in the periods preceding a financial stress event. Based on the individual indicators from 13 OECD countries, we propose three different composite indicators, the summed composite indicator, the extreme composite indicator and the weighted composite indicator. The in-sample forecasting results for the 13 OECD countries indicate that the three composite indicators are useful tools for predicting financial stress events, while none of them outperforms the others across all the criteria considered. The out-of-sample forecasting results suggest that for most of the 13 OECD countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, the weighted composite indicator performs better than the two others across all the criteria considered.

We find first that utilities experience fewer rate reviews in states with consumer advocates, consistent with utilities strategically postponing requests for rate increases. Second, after controlling for observed and unobserved state characteristics, we find that PUCs in states with consumer advocates permit returns on equity that are on average 0.45 percentage points lower than states without advocates-equivalent to a $7.9 million (3.7 %) reduction in average utility operating income, all else equal.

The MES of an institution can be defined as its expected equity loss when the market itself is in its left tail. We estimate the dynamic MES recently proposed by Brownlees and Engle (2012) for a panel of 68 large US banks over the last decade and a half. Running panel regressions of the MES on bank characteristics, we first find that the MES can be roughly rationalized in terms of standard balance-sheet indicators of bank financial soundness and systemic importance. We then ask whether the cross section of the MES can help to identify ex ante, i.e. before a crisis unfolds, which institutions are more likely to suffer the most severe losses ex post, i.e. once it has unfolded. Unfortunately, using the 2007-2009 crisis as a natural experiment, we find that some standard balance-sheet ratios are better able than the MES to predict large equity losses conditionally to a true crisis.

Our contention is that entry into a new market poses challenges to complementary resources that are already being exploited and that diversification thus comes at a substantial cost to the diversifying firm. Using a sample of the world's largest manufacturers, we find that the effect of diversification on productivity is positive for firms with an initially low level of overall technological complementarity. Firms that specialize and have existing complementarities are negatively affected by diversification because the process of unbundling and rebundling technological resources is disruptive to productive firms.","[Nasiriyar, Maryam] ESC Rennes Sch Business, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Nesta, Lionel] OFCE SciencesPo, SKEMA Business Sch, GREDEG UMR CNRS 6321, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Dibiaggio, Ludovic] Univ Lille Nord France, SKEMA Business Sch, F-06560 Sophia Antipolis, France",Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business; Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School; Universite de Lille; SKEMA Business School,"Nasiriyar, M (通讯作者)，ESC Rennes Sch Business, 2 Rue Robert dArbrissel, F-35065 Rennes, France.",maryam.nasiriyar@esc-rennes.fr; Lionel.nesta@sciencespo.fr; Ludovic.dibiaggio@skema.edu,,,,,,,60,8,11,2,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Banks have reacted to the challenges posed by the new operating environment by creating new products and expanding their activities to some uncharted business areas. In this paper, we study how modern banking which gave birth to the off-balance-sheet leverage activities affected the risk profile of U.S. banks as well as the level of systemic risk before and after the onset of the late 2000s financial crisis. Towards this, we separate on- from off-balance-sheet leverage and capture the latter with different, yet complementary, measures which do not exist in the current literature. Special attention is paid on the deleveraging process that occurred in the banking market after the crisis erupted, which is an additional innovative feature of this study. Our findings reveal that leverage, both explicit and hidden off-the-balance-sheet, increases the individual risk of banking firms making them vulnerable to financial shocks. Reverse leverage, on the other hand, is beneficial for individual banks' health, but is found to be harmful for financial stability. We also demonstrate that the banks which concentrate on traditional lines of business typically carry less risk compared to those involved with modern financial instruments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is a lack of standard measure for evaluating GHG emissions generated from freight transport operations. To improve this situation, Chinese policy makers need to evaluate GHG emissions for energy saving and pollution reduction. This background leads us to examine the GHG emission trajectories and features of Chinese freight transport patterns in the last decade, i.e. between 2000 and 2011. In this study, we examine different regions' freight turnover and energy consumption by various transport modes (i.e. railway, highway, waterway, aircraft, and oil pipeline) in China. Our results show that the total amount of GHG emissions caused by the Chinese freight transport sector reached 978 million tons in 2011, indicating an average annual growth of 74 million tons CO(2)e for the last decade. Shandong, Anhui, and Henan are the main provinces producing GHG emissions, representing 11.7%, 10.3%, and 10% of total emissions generated from the freight transport sector in China, respectively. This study also compares the regional GHG emissions from different freight transport modes including railway, highway, waterway, air transport, and oil pipeline. Based on the findings, policy implications are provided on how to mitigate freight transport emissions among different Chinese regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the network analysis results, the ATNC has significantly improved in connectivity based on (1) rising alpha, beta and gamma indices, (2) declining diameter and centre index and (3) decreasing average path length and increasing clustering coefficient. The network centralization index reveals a fluctuation phase before 1952, a pre-1980 centralization phase before the economic reform era, a centralization phase after the mid-1990s deregulation, and a decentralization phase between. The k-core decomposition method helps identify the evolution of core network and hierarchy of the ATNC over time. The spatial development model characterizes its structure change in six stages: (1) scattered development, (2) trunk line connection, (3) circular linkage, (4) hub formation, (5) a complex network structure, and (6) emerging multi-airport systems.

We find that workers who face externally regulated pressures (pressure arising from involuntary part-time or casual labour contracts) to search for alternate employment are less likely to find better work, than workers who use autonomous motives to search for work. Our findings suggest that labour market policies trending towards 'labour market flexibility/deregulation' which provide workers with controlled motives to search for work will contribute to workers cycling through spells of insecure employment and possibly intermittent spells of unemployment with no realistic prospect of career development.

During financial booms, banks draw the best workers away from the regulatory sector and misbehavior increases.

When rating agencies are compensated only for solicited ratings under the issuer-fee scheme, a separating equilibrium results, in which high-quality firms signal through solicited ratings while low-quality firms are revealed through unsolicited ratings.

In the main, business cycle synchronization until 2007 had moved in a direction positive for the operation of a single currency, suggesting that the common monetary policy was less costly in terms of lost flexibility at the national level. However, as a result of the Great Recession of 2007 and the subsequent Eurozone Crisis, a number of periphery countries, most notably Greece, have experienced desynchronization of their business cycles with the EU12-wide cycle.

If individual nations evolve along this pattern, a vicious cycle could form with reduced social concern amplifying primal increases in inequality. Exploring movements around these long-term levels, however, this study finds mixed evidence regarding the vicious cycle hypothesis. Larger compensation differentials are accepted as inequality grows. Weighing against this, growth in inequality is met with greater support for government-led redistribution. Inequality shocks can be reinforced in the labor market but do not result in weaker political preferences for redistribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Economic theory predicts that the market participation propensity should increase as the correlation between income growth and stock market returns decreases. Surprisingly, empirical studies find limited support for the income hedging motive. Using a rich, unique Dutch data set and the National Longitudinal Survey of the Youth (NLSY) from the United States, we show that when the income-return correlation is low, individuals exhibit a greater propensity to participate in the market and allocate a larger proportion of their wealth to risky assets. Even when the income risk is high, individuals exhibit a higher propensity to participate in the market when the hedging potential is high. These findings suggest that income hedging is an important determinant of stock market participation and asset allocation decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The manager sequentially chooses a pollution level that allows learning about the threshold, thereby improving future decisions. If crossed, damage can be reversed at some cost. We analyze the conditions under which experimentation is optimal, and explore how experimentation depends on restoration costs, information about the threshold, and the discount rate. Our results suggest that the level of experimentation, defined as the difference between the optimal activity with and without learning, is non-monotonic in costs and decreasing in the discount rate. We identify two stopping boundaries for the experiment, depending on cost levels compared to the lower bound of the threshold's interval. We show that when costs are high the stopping boundary under an infinite number of decisions is the same as when there are only two decision moments. A computational extension to more than two decisions suggests that an optimal sequence of experiments can cross the same threshold several times before experimentation ceases. These results shed light on a large class of environmental decision problems that has not been examined in the literature.","[Groeneveld, Rolf Adriaan] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Springborn, Michael] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Costello, Christopher] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Costello, Christopher] UMR1135 Lameta, Montpellier, France; [Costello, Christopher] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Wageningen University & Research; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Groeneveld, RA (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",rolf.groeneveld@wur.nl,"Groeneveld, Rolf/B-3119-2010","Groeneveld, Rolf/0000-0002-3699-1200",,,,,30,8,8,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

By employing factor analysis, we identify five main dimensions of bank bankruptcy frameworks: (1) difficulty of forbearance and ease of court appeal, (2) availability of supervisory tools, (3) court involvement, (4) supervisory powers with respect to managers, and (5) supervisory powers with respect to shareholders and preinsolvency phase. We use cluster analysis to identify and group countries according to two prevalent types of bank bankruptcy frameworks: a court-led and administrative bank bankruptcy regime. Administrative bank bankruptcy regimes are associated with less court involvement in the resolution process, less likely forbearance, a higher possibility of court appeal, greater availability of supervisory tools, weaker supervisory powers with respect to managers and stronger supervisory powers with respect to shareholders, and a preinsolvency phase as opposed to the court-led bank bankruptcy regimes. Administrative bank bankruptcy regimes are also associated with fewer creditor rights, less government effectiveness, and lower institutional quality than court-led bank bankruptcy regimes. We find some evidence that the type and main dimensions of a bank bankruptcy regime are related to the occurrence and severity of the global financial crisis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from China is of particular importance because China is the world's largest emerging and transitional economy. At first we show that there is a negative relationship between bank loan ratios and investment for Chinese publicly listed firms. And this negative relationship is much stronger for firms with low growth than firms with high growth. Secondly, we find that both short-term and long-term loan ratios are negatively correlated with investment. However, the higher the long-term loan ratios are, the weaker the negative relationship between long-term loan ratios and investment is. Thirdly, firm ownership only matters to the effect of short-term bank loans on investment in our sample. That is, the negative relationship between short-term loan ratios and investment is weaker for SOEs than for non-SOEs. Lastly, we show that the reform of China's banking system in 2003 has not strengthened the negative relationship between bank loans and investment. Our findings suggest that although Chinese state-owned banks are severely intervened by government policies, they still have a disciplining role on firms' investment, especially in firms with low growth.

Theory suggests that, as port systems become mature, they tend to deconcentration, partly due to the emergence of secondary ports. Previous research has examined the region's dominant ports, but an unanswered research question is how the evolution of this port system is influencing and being influenced by the actions of those ports currently occupying a secondary rank in the LAC port hierarchy. The methodology is based primarily on analysis of time series data on container movements between 1997 and 2012, revealing patterns of cargo flows and transhipment location choices. The institutional context of devolution processes and new investments in the region provides additional insight into the performance of selected ports. From a theoretical perspective, this analysis is situated within the context of recent institutional approaches that examine the port's ability to act through critical moments and junctures, in order to deepen understanding of which of the various factors influencing port system deconcentration are the most sensitive to successful institutional adaptations. Results show that the manufacturing of strategic locations can be successful and may have driven the emergence of secondary ports in the LAC system. This finding demonstrates how path dependence can be challenged by new developments, the identification and success of which are nevertheless contingent on factors such as the first mover advantage, port planning regimes and diversification of port roles. The paper identifies some of the key factors influencing the transition of a port system from concentration at a few dominant ports to a deconcentrated system of primary and secondary ports, which can be applied to other port systems in future research.

With second-best instruments, a higher level of income redistribution calls for a lower level of Pigouvian taxation. More redistribution implies higher distortions from income taxation. Pigouvian tax revenues become more valuable, and the optimal level of environmental taxation decreases. With first-best instruments, however, the relation between levels of redistribution and Pigouvian taxation is reversed.

In such a model, it is important to consider the source of rising mean-to-median ratios. Income growth of the poor can lead to less redistribution as more agents perceive themselves to be rich, which tends to reduce the support for redistribution.

Notwithstanding the recent trend of the stock market development in emerging countries, some argue that Islamic countries' stock exchanges are still infantile. The central aim of this research, therefore, is to investigate factors impeding stock market development (SMD) in Islamic countries. We explore a panel annual data of 11 main Islamic countries vis-a-vis the developed countries for the period of 1996-2011. The findings show that all of our concerned macroeconomic determinants play a major role in the developed countries. On the other hand, financial openness has substantially less contribution in Islamic countries, while the financial intermediary development plays a major role. The results are also indicative of the need for the Islamic countries to improve their legal environment and economic freedom. lastly, we also attempt to measure the integration level, where the findings tend to indicate a relatively lower and unstable pattern of integration for the Islamic countries, suggesting the impact of volatile inflows.

It presents evidence on the income and price elasticities of demand for domestic heating, passenger transport, and lighting in the United Kingdom over the last two hundred years. As the economy developed and energy service prices fell, income elasticities have generally followed an inverse U-shape curve, and price elasticities have generally followed a U-shape curve. However, these general trends also appear to have been affected by energy and technological transitions, which boosted demand (by either encouraging poorer consumers to fully enter the market or offering new attributes of value to wealthier consumers). The evidence presented offers insights that will be helpful for identifying likely future trends in energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, and for developing long-term climate policies.","[Fouquet, Roger] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Fouquet, Roger] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Spain; [Fouquet, Roger] Ikerbasque, Bilbao, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Fouquet, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",R.Fouquet@lse.ac.uk,,"Fouquet, Roger/0000-0003-4732-0821",ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,66,84,89,1,31,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

We show that these two components have very different degrees of power of prediction on future long-term excess stock market returns. Namely, continuous volatility is a key driver of medium to long-term risk-return relationships. In contrast, jumps do not predict future medium or long-term excess returns. We use inference methods that are robust to persistent predictors in a multi-horizon setup. Specifically, we use a rescaled Student-t to test for significant risk-return relationship and simulate its exact behavior under the null in the case of multiple regressors with different levels of persistence. We also perform tests of equality of the risk-return relationship at multiple horizons. We do not find evidence against a proportional relationship between long-term continuous volatility and future returns.","[Jacquier, Eric] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jacquier, Eric] MIT Sloan, Cambridge, MA USA; [Okou, Cedric] Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Okou, C (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",okou.cedric@uqam.ca,,,,,,,49,8,8,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Addressing this research gap, this article elicits the individual preferences of decision makers by using the pairwise-comparison-based preference measurement (PCPM) technique and records individuals' search patterns using eye tracking. Our results show that an increased context-based complexity leads to an increase in information acquisition and the use of a more attribute-wise search pattern. Moreover, the information search pattern changes within a choice task as information is processed attribute-wise in earlier stages of the search process and alternative-wise in later ones. The fact that we do not find an interaction effect of context-based complexity and decision stages on the search patterns indicates that the influence of complexity on search patterns stays constant throughout the decision process and suggests that the more complex the choice task is, the later the switch from attribute-wise strategies to alternative-wise strategies will be.","[Pfeiffer, Jella; Rothlauf, Franz] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Informat Syst & Business Adm, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Meissner, Martin] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Odense, Denmark; [Meissner, Martin] Monash Univ, Dept Mkt, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Brandstaetter, Eduard] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Social & Econ Psychol, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Riedl, Rene] Univ Appl Sci Upper Austria, Sch Management, Linz, Austria; [Riedl, Rene] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Business Informat Informat Engn, Linz, Austria; [Decker, Reinhold] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm, Bielefeld, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Southern Denmark; Monash University; Johannes Kepler University Linz; Johannes Kepler University Linz; University of Bielefeld,"Pfeiffer, J (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Informat Syst & Business Adm, Jakob Welder Weg 9, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",jella.pfeiffer@uni-mainz.de,"Brandstätter, Eduard/C-6721-2013; Meißner, Martin/O-3209-2019; Rothlauf, Franz/O-4704-2016","Meißner, Martin/0000-0002-3574-4283; Rothlauf, Franz/0000-0003-3376-427X",,,,,54,14,15,2,25,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The methodology is a combination of the Bai & Perron structural break filter, and validation of the structural breaks identified using de jute evidence of reforms. The procedure is sequential and it ensures that the identified reforms originate from policy changes and that these have a statistically significant impact on economic data. This paper also adds new empirical evidence to the political economy literature of determinants of economic reforms. Applying the methodology to the healthcare sector allows us to identify 22 de facto healthcare financing privatisations in a sample of 23 OECD countries. It is analysed which factors trigger or hinder healthcare financing privatisations. Robust evidence is found in favour of the 'crises induce reform hypothesis'. Contrary to theory and conventional wisdom, robust evidence is found that political factors do not have an impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Instead of concentrating on R&D cooperation among firms, the paper focuses on one-way externality flow in which each firm forms links in the attempt to acquire others' R&D knowledge. It is assumed that a firm has an internal R&D strategy (in-house R&D) and an external R&D strategy (knowledge acquisition) and that these two strategic options are substitutes. It is found that a firm will trade off its own investment cost and acquisition cost. Consequently, the equilibrium network is empty when investment or linkage cost is high, whereas the equilibrium network is of core-periphery structure when both costs are relatively low, with core firms investing in R&D activities and periphery firms accessing R&D knowledge from core ones. The paper also investigates efficiency and the conclusion is that although an efficient R&D network is a periphery-sponsored star, the core firm tends to underinvest in Nash equilibrium.","[Li, Ziran] China Financial Futures Exchange, Shanghai 200122, Peoples R China; [Cui, Zhiwei] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zu, Lei] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Management Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beihang University; University of International Business & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zu, L (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Management Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",lizr@cffex.com.cn,,"Cui, Zhiwei/0000-0002-2822-2145",,,,,13,1,1,1,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Though there are similarities to other non-point agricultural emissions like nitrogen that have been studied extensively, phosphorus is often characterized by the presence of large stocking capacities for phosphorus in farm soils and long time-lags between applications and emission. This makes it important to understand the dynamics of the phosphorus emission problem when designing regulatory systems. Using a model that reflects these dynamics, we evaluate alternative regulatory systems.

It is shown that market access in a region affects income inequality measures, working through the cutoff productivity for entrepreneurship. Compared with the smaller region, selection into entrepreneurship is more likely for individuals in the larger region with better firm market access whereas the local income inequality is higher. Both regional inequality and regional disparities in the local income inequality measures exhibit an inverted U-shaped pattern when the regional integration level increases.","Xiamen Univ, Dept Int Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Yang, X (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Dept Int Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",yangxi0206@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Since labor unions compress wages between skilled and unskilled workers, a rising skill premium encourages skilled workers to withdraw from the union. If this withdrawal is accompanied by a fall in the productivity of unskilled workers, firms become reluctant to hire the relatively expensive union workers, reinforcing the decline in the unionization rate. Evaluating this hypothesis, we find that the rise in the skill premium explains about 40% of the decline in the unionization rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Banks with low levels of ownership concentration do not display such discretionary income smoothing behavior.

However, the development of systematic theory has been hampered by the difficulty of adequately specifying foundational assumptions. We address this problem by defining a concept of collective performance, which brings together a range of recurring organizational action patterns that have been studied under labels such as routine, practice, standard operating procedure, or genre of action. All these forms of organizational action are based on human habit to a significant degree. We propose a conceptual framework for such habit-based organizational action patterns. The framework is a set of core principles and desirable model properties that can serve as a guide in the development of formal models of collective performance. It provides micro-foundations for the modeling of collective performance that are aligned with contemporary developments in psychology.

These infusions include private market infusions (seasoned equity offerings (SEOs)) as well as injections of government capital under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The sample period covers both business cycle expansions and contractions, and the recent financial crisis. We present evidence on the factors affecting FIs' decisions to raise capital, the determinants of investor reactions, and post-infusion risk-taking of the recipients, as well as a sample of matching FIs. Investors reacted negatively to the news of private market SEOs by FIs, both in the immediate term (e.g., the two days surrounding the announcement) and over the subsequent year, but positively to TARP injections. Reactions differed depending on the characteristics of the FIs, and the stage of the business cycle. Smaller, more financially constrained non-bank institutions were more likely to have raised capital through private market offerings during the period prior to TARP, and firms receiving a TARP injection tended to be riskier and more levered. In the case of TARP recipients, they appeared to finance an increase in credit risk with more stable financing sources such as core deposits, which lowered their liquidity risk. However, we find no evidence that banks' capital adequacy increased after the capital injections.

Consistent with central clearing reducing counterparty risk, CDS spreads increase around the commencement of central clearing and are lower than settlement spreads published by the central clearinghouse. Furthermore, the relation between CDS spreads and dealer credit risk weakens after central clearing begins, suggesting a lowering of systemic risk. These findings are robust to controls for frictions in both CDS and bond markets.

We capture the influence of risk by partitioning bonds into investment and speculative grades. We use earnings changes as a proxy for cash flow news and T-Bill rate changes as a proxy for discount rate news. As expected, during non-crisis periods, we observe a positive relation between earnings changes and bond returns and a negative relation for T-Bill rate changes. A combination of government bailouts of large financial institutions and mark-to-market accounting preserves the positive relation for earnings changes during the crisis for investment grade bonds, while absence of these factors leads to an insignificant relation for speculative grade. Intervention by the Federal Reserve to induce lower interest rates as earnings were declining, a flight to safety shifting demand from corporate bonds to T-Bills, and low cost funds invested in risk free investments explain a reversal of the relation between bond returns and T-Bill rate changes for both grades.

A quantitative logical model shows that while there are multiple equilibrium sets of institutions, each involves some trade-off between the size of the country, the territorial structure of government and the electoral system. Specifically, the larger the country, the more important is federalism in comparison to proportional representation electoral rules for the durability of democratic institutions. The explanatory power of the model is positively tested on all current durable democratic countries. It is also illustrated with a few both fitting and deviant cases. A relevant implication is that the room for manipulation of the choice of institutions is large, but not unlimited, as the choices for a durable democracy are constrained by bounded trade-offs between the values of major institutional variables.","[Colomer, Josep M.] CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Barcelona, Spain; [Colomer, Josep M.] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC USA",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Georgetown University,"Colomer, JM (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Barcelona, Spain.",josep.colomer@gmail.com,"Colomer, Josep M/B-1739-2012",,,,,,44,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2014,158.0,3-4,,,SI,,559,576,,10.1007/s11127-012-0014-1,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AA3GM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330980900014,0

We organize our investigation around a term-structure model in which risk-averse arbitrageurs absorb shocks to the demand and supply for bonds of different maturities. These shocks affect the term structure because they alter the price of duration risk. Consistent with the model, we find that the maturity-weighted-debt-to-GDP ratio is positively related to bond yields and future returns, controlling for the short rate.

This situation is called contest uncertainty. In both contests, effort is additively distorted by a contest noise parameter which affects the sensitivity of the contest success function (CSF). In Contest A (B), this parameter is linearly added to (subtracted from) effort. We analyze the interaction of contest uncertainty and contest noise on contestant behavior and profit. For symmetric contestants, contest noise has an ambiguous effect on effort and profit. We show that more contest uncertainty can imply greater effort. Furthermore, an introduction of an infinitesimal degree of contest uncertainty can have a large impact on effort and profit. Based on the analysis, this article presents the contest organizer's incentive to manipulate the degree of uncertainty in the contest. For profit or effort maximization, the contest organizer should always eliminate any uncertainty. If contestants are asymmetric, more contest noise increases effort as well as competitive balance if both Contests A and B have the same probability of occurrence. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Efficient risk sharing rules among countries are the same as the conditions for full financial integration. Input prices and interest rates as well as technology shocks are found to be the driving variables for cross-country output co-movements. The international correlation puzzle reflects an inability to account for production risk sharing among countries in previous studies. The degree of international risk sharing is substantial relative to earlier estimates, which is largely realized from pooling production risks rather than consumption risks among countries. J.

Second, by focusing on data from one national assembly consistently using this procedure, I demonstrate that insincere or strategic voting is very rare. The finding does not indicate that politicians necessarily behave in a non-strategic or unsophisticated manner.

Downward biases in the conglomerate discount measure,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Conglomerate discount; Cash bias; Multiplier aggregation bias,CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION; CASH HOLDINGS; SPINOFFS; MARKETS; DEBT,"The Berger and Ofek (1995) excess value measure, comparing a conglomerate's actual market value to an imputed value based on standalones, has become the standard method to determine value effects of diversification. In this paper, we address a significant bias in this procedure stemming from the difference in cash holdings between diversified and standalone firms. Excess values are based on firm values, including corporate cash positions. As standalones hold significantly more cash, the imputed cash value is higher than the conglomerate's actual cash value, resulting in a downward biased excess value. We thus propose to calculate excess values based on enterprise values, replacing total debt by net debt. Based on an extensive US sample, we show that there is significantly less evidence of a diversification discount when adjusting for the cash bias. In terms of average dollar losses, the firm value-based models overestimate the conglomerate discount by at least 25%. Apart from removing the cash bias, we propose a second modification to the excess value measure, arguing that standalone industry multipliers should be calculated using geometric mean aggregation instead of median aggregation.

By pairing both sides to each deal, we show differences in firm characteristics, returns, and subsequent performance of buying and selling firms. Unlike mergers between whole firms, most subsidiary deals straddled different industries. Most sellers were larger, more diversified and less profitable than buyers. Our event study reveals that abnormal returns were positive for buyers yet insignificantly different from zero for sellers. However, subsidiary sales in the core business earned negative returns, the more so the larger the deal. An analysis of ex-post operating results shows that the performance of sellers often declined after the trade, in particular for firms that divested a core-related subsidiary. We conclude that subsidiary trades in Japan in this period contributed importantly to strategic repositioning and a more efficient use of corporate assets. J. Japanese Int. Economies 31(2014)36-52.

This increase is larger among banks with a bigger exposure to the ABCP market, credit lines that pose more liquidity risk to banks, and borrowers that are likely dependent on the credit-line provider.

Using a sample of firms declaring a hard freeze on their DB plans between 2002 and 2007, we observe an increase in total risk (proxied by the standard deviation of EBITDA and asset beta), equity risk (standard deviation of returns), and credit risk following a DB-plan freeze. The increase in credit risk is reflected in a decline in credit ratings and an increase in bond yields for freezing firms. When we examine investment strategies, we observe a shift in investment from capital expenditures before the freeze to more-risky R&D projects after the freeze, and an increase in leverage. These strategies (increased focus on R&D and higher leverage) increase the operating and financial risk the firm faces. Overall, we observe an increase in risk-taking following DB plan freezes, consistent with theories that DB plans act as inside debt that aligns managers' interests with bondholders'.

Symptoms include absentee teachers, leakage of public funds, monopolized trucking, and employment-restricting regulations. Can civil society do anything about these failures? Would external donor support to civil society help? We argue that the challenge for civil society is to improve government functioning by strengthening political incentives-the underlying cause of government failure-rather than bypassing or supplanting the state. This paper reviews the available evidence on civil society interventions from this perspective. Although the current increase in political competition and extensive citizen engagement in Africa seems to create the potential for civil society influence, we find that there are large knowledge gaps regarding what works, where, and how. Some rigorous evaluations find significant impacts of civil society involvement on development outcomes, but these studies typically pay insufficient attention to the mechanisms. For example, are impacts due to overcoming government failure or to changing private household behavior, leaving the wasteful allocation of public resources untouched? We conclude that donor support to civil society should take an approach of learning by doing through ongoing experimentation backed by rigorous, data-based evaluations of the mechanisms of impact.",,,,,,,,,,,80,11,16,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

This investigation is performed by estimating a random coefficient stochastic distance frontier model in the spirit of Tsionas (2002) and Greene (2005,2008). The primary advantage of this model is that its coefficients can vary across banks, thereby allowing for unobserved technology heterogeneity among large banks in the US We find that failure to consider unobserved technology heterogeneity results in a misleading ranking of banks and mismeasured returns to scale. Our results show that the majority of large banks in the US exhibit constant returns to scale. In addition, our results suggest that banks of the same size can have different levels of returns to scale and there is no clear pattern among large banks in the US concerning the relationship between asset size and returns to scale, due to the presence of technology heterogeneity.

When directors experience an exogenous increase in a directorship's relative ranking, their board attendance rate increases and subsequent firm performance improves. Also, directors are less willing to relinquish their relatively more prestigious directorships, even when firm performance declines. Finally, forced Chief Executive Officer departure sensitivity to poor performance rises when a larger fraction of independent directors view the board as relatively more prestigious.

We show that the 11 swaps Indonesia has signed with its bilateral creditors since 2002 have performed rather erratically across four criteria: an increase in resources at the debtor country or government budget level or both; an increase in resources for intended sector purposes; whether, taken together, these swaps ease debt burdens; and the extent of their alignment with government policy and systems. We find little evidence of learning on the Indonesian side. We believe that Indonesia can take a more proactive stance in negotiating the economic terms underlying its debt swaps, and we suggest concrete ways for it to do so.

Kriteria pertama adalah peningkatan kapasitas negara debitur atau anggaran pemerintah; kedua, peningkatan kapasitas sektor-sektor tertuju; ketiga, apakah penghapusan tersebut memberikan keringanan utang jika dilakukan secara bersamaan; dan keempat, sejauh mana penghapusan tersebut sejalan dengan kebijakan dan sistem yang berlaku di pemerintah.

The research method adopted allows evaluation of the impact of suppliers' credit on bank debt accounting for the strength (duration) of bank-firm relationships. Our main finding is that trade credit seems to have an information content for banks, especially when the latter do not dispose of adequate (soft) information on firms, which is likely the case at the beginning stages of bank-firm relationships. An implication of our results is that the availability of suppliers credit might be crucial to foster access to institutional funding for new firms entering the market. Our evidence also suggests that banks seem to consider suppliers a reliable source of information on firms' financial conditions even after several years of lending relationships.","[Agostino, Mariarosaria; Trivieri, Francesco] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy",University of Calabria,"Trivieri, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, Cubo 1C, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy.",francesco.trivieri@unical.it,"Trivieri, Francesco/H-3818-2019",,,,,,115,54,59,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

DR shelters are used to provide private and secure places for people to live who have left or lost their usual accommodations as a result of some form of disaster. DR shelters not only provide immediate and short-term shelter for the victims of a disaster, but they also help them to recover from the trauma of a disaster as well as provide a base to start the process of rehabilitation. A review of the literature, case studies, guidance, and reports relating to the design of DR shelters indicates that their provision and performance are not currently as effective as they could be. A lack of adequate consideration with regard to climatic conditions, locally available materials and skills, cultural and social issues, delays, cost constraints, and poor location selection for DR shelters have each been identified as sources of poor performance contributing to an unacceptable standard of living. Moreover, there seems to be a lack of sufficient consideration with regard to the design of DR shelters for future storage and re-use. The principal aim of this research is to examine the extent to which environmental, economic, technical, and sociocultural criteria affect the provision and performance of DR shelters, and how such factors might be taken into account in the decision-making and design processes of such shelters.

Within this stated objective relevant factors and business relationships between entrepreneurs and socio-economic system were analyzed. It was evaluated how entrepreneurs perceive their environment (state, company, banks, universities, etc.). The data was collected through questionnaire. The whole research was conducted in the Zlin region (Czech Republic) on a sample of 180 SMEs and in the region of Trencin (Slovakia) on a sample of 105 SMEs. On the basis of the results of our research we can conclude that the most important motive for starting a business in Slovakia was money. In the Czech Republic, it was found out that the most important motive for starting a business was an attempt to have a job. Entrepreneurs in both countries as the most important characteristic feature of the businessman stated a quality of not to be afraid of risk. In the Czech Republic two other characteristics followed: perseverance and expertise. In Slovakia, the following qualities were mentioned: expertise and responsibility. Our research confirmed that higher education does not represent significant advantage in business and entrepreneurs evaluate the level of higher education rather primly. Entrepreneurs in both countries greatly felt that the society perceives them wrongly. In their opinion, the state has failed to fulfill its role in promoting entrepreneurship. The largest number of entrepreneurs in both countries said that their country just bullied them and creates unnecessary obstacles. Major obstacle in business is also the high level of corruption in both countries. Entrepreneurs indicated that commercial banks access to finance for SMEs during the crisis worsened and banks behaved in a disproportionate manner. This trend is caused by growth of credit risk in the SME sector. Among the most important determinants of growth of credit risk can be classified decrease of performance and profitability of Czech and Slovak SMEs.","[Belas, Jaroslav; Bartos, Premysl; Hlawiczka, Roman] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Habanik, Jozef] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Trencin, Slovakia",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,,belas111@gmail.com; bartos@fame.utb.cz; jozef.habanik@tnuni.sk; hlawiczka@fame.utb.cz,"Belas, Jaroslav/AGS-6813-2022","Belas, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5900-997X",,,,,31,2,2,1,15,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,42,+,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200003,0

We first offer evidence that there is no dominating momentum strategy among the revenue, earnings, and price momentums, suggesting that revenue surprises, earnings surprises, and prior returns each carry some exclusive unpriced information content. We next show that the profits of momentum driven by firm fundamental performance information (revenue or earnings) depend upon the accompanying firm market performance information (price), and vice versa. The robust monotonicity in multivariate momentum returns is consistent with the argument that the market does not only underestimate the individual information but also the joint implications of multiple information on firm performance, particularly when they point in the same direction. A three-way combined momentum strategy may offer monthly return as high as 1.44%. The information conveyed by revenue surprises and earnings surprises combined account for about 19% of price momentum effects, which finding adds to the large literature on tracing the sources of price momentum.

Although the financial side occupies an important position in such operations, the connection that is established between the power relationships is not negligible in such situations. The possibility of job loss or wage decrease can cause a state of dissatisfaction among employees, willing to block the activity of the enterprise in order to achieve their goals. Therefore through this paper we analyze the impact of the financial crisis on both the financial side of the restructuring operations made by the enterprises from GEE countries and also its impact on the power relationships within the enterprises.

Unfortunately, in the case of Australia, there is evidence to suggest that disaster risk reduction and climate-change policy is highly fragmented and politicised (von Meding et al., 2013). The main focus of this paper is, therefore, to develop a deep understanding of the underpinning factors of local, regional and national policies in Australia. In terms of policy and multilevel integration of policies, we will particularly focus on the risk of failure to adapt to climate change in Australia. The national and local Australian context will be analysed in terms of its recent past experiences in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation policies, stressing on the changes through the years, investigating key terminology, frameworks and goals. These will be described and critically analysed in a multilevel context, beginning with national government objectives and working through to the local dimension of these policies. A clear and comprehensive analysis of the evolution of local, regional and national policy in Australia, as well as a critique on the past and current effectiveness of implementation, will pave the way for further research to take place towards DRR and CCA action.

This study uses panel data from the Census Bureau's 1996 Survey of Income and Program Participation to investigate the acquisition of a savings account as a gateway to asset diversification and accumulation for young adults. Two avenues were considered: The first emphasized ownership of a diverse portfolio of financial products, and the second emphasized the accumulated value of liquid assets. Almost half of the surveyed young adults owned a savings account (43 percent) and approximately 3 percent acquired a savings account over the course of the panel. (Older, nonwhite, or unemployed participants were significantly less likely to acquire an account.) Those who owned or acquired a savings account also had more diverse asset portfolios. Evidence suggests that young adults who acquire a savings account and diversify their asset portfolios may also accumulate more liquid assets over time, which can be leveraged in the future to strengthen their balance sheets.","[Hughes, Robert] Univ Kansas, Dept Sociol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,,,,,,,,,77,13,14,0,10,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Variations were observed between boys, and girls in the EI levels, and CPB. Fluctuation of EI levels indicated the volatility of the reasoning ability of university students in competitive emotional encounters.

This paper examines the impact of culture on international advertising from an ad content perspective by interpreting advertising messages and transcribing the embedded values on advertisements. Quantitative content analysis is used to infer a pattern of advertising practices for MNCs. Specifically the ads aired in the UK are compared to those in Malaysia in terms of creative strategy and execution and with locally produced ads in automotive, fast moving consumer goods and banks. Subsequently, the difference of the cultural values embedded in Malaysian ads against UK ads was evaluated. Findings indicate either a partial adaptation or full localisation strategy is necessary for advertising in the Malaysian market. When compared with a local competitor, the results showed a mixed outcome. For some MNCs, creative strategies applied were similar while some were different to those of local companies. Interestingly, the executional elements applied were different from locally produced ads for all MNCs. Findings suggest that more cultural cues were visible in MNC ads in Malaysia as compared to MNC ads which support the idea that culture does have an impact towards international advertising.","[Harun, Mior Harris Mior; Teo, Carol Boon Chui] Univ Teknol MARA, Arshad Ayub Grad Busines Sch, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia; [Hussin, Mohd Hazman Fitri; Nasir, Shahrin] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA,,miorharris@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Hussin, Mohd.

In this paper we analyze the importance of a different mechanism, namely, social ties between academic entrepreneurs and university researchers, for enabling and facilitating the access to academic knowledge and resources, and therefore for the location of academic startups. We employ unique data on academic startups from regions with more than one university and find that only the parent university influences academic entrepreneurs' decisions to stay in the region while other universities in the same region play no role. Our findings suggest that the mere local availability of a university may not per se guarantee access to knowledge and resources; social ties are additionally required. The importance of social ties implies that academic knowledge and resources are not necessarily local public good.

The empirical analysis is based upon a survey of land rental and land purchase contracts concluded in Schleswig-Holstein between 2005 and 2011. Regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of plot attributes, farm characteristics, regional and macroeconomic factors on arable land purchase prices and rental rates. The simultaneous transfer of payment entitlements enters the models as an additional explanatory variable. The observation period is sub-divided into two phases to account for the potentially differential impact of payment entitlements before (until 2009) and during the gliding phase (2010 and after). The sample comprises 135 land purchase contracts and 213 land rental agreements. The results show that rental rates for arable land in Schleswig-Holstein, besides being influenced by other factors, are significantly higher when a payment entitlement is traded with the land. The price-increasing effect is estimated to be on average 30-35 % of the payment entitlements' nominal value at the time of contract conclusion. The analysis does not reveal a statistically significant impact of payment entitlements on the purchase price of arable land.","[Hennig, Solveigh; Breustedt, Gunnar; Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Kiel, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Hennig, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Agrarokonomie Christian Albrechts, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",shennig@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de,,"Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe/0000-0002-9936-2460",,,,,33,8,8,0,8,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The original microeconomic model of consumer's decision making (Frank, 2006) measures leisure time against consumption specified by the wage rate. Many quantifiable and non-quantifiable coefficients have some effect on both of these variables. This article concentrates on the key factor concerning disposable income and its influence on decision making regarding the choice between consumption and having leisure time. The Czech Republic has undergone various changes during the last 15 years which are also visible in the tertiary education sector. College students were thus the target group of respondents of the primary research. This social group has been getting larger in the last few years which is not declared by the European statistics only. Although the reasons for entering the tertiary education sector are various, there is always a particular type of consumer from economic perspective. A significant impact of disposable income on the consumer's choice between consumption and having leisure time was found out through the statistical verification. This quantifier also shows differentiation regarding consumer expenses in connection with the basic classes of consumer basket. Students with a lower disposable income spend the highest amount on the items of consumer basket Food and non-alcoholic beverages whereas students with a higher disposable income on the items Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels.","Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Horáková, M (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Nam TG Masaryka 5555, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",mhorakova@fame.utb.cz,,"Horakova, Monika/0000-0002-3390-9478",,,,,12,0,0,1,12,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,2070,2080,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300210,0

Given this changing environment, the cost of a product or service may be changing over time and deterministic models for costing systems may be inappropriate. Thus, this paper proposes a model for calculating costs which considers the variability of endogenous and exogenous variables. It uses the logic of Activity Based Costing and Monte Carlo Simulation. The proposed model may allow to some extent to predict the risk associated with the variability in costs and support the necessary steps which should be taken to better manage such risk, whether from the point of view of processes rationalization and of cost management.","[Jimenez, Victor; Afonso, Paulo] Univ Minho, Dept Prod & Syst, Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Jiménez, V (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, P-4800058 Braga, Portugal.",victor.jimenez@dps.uminho.pt,"Afonso, Paulo S/B-6037-2009","Afonso, Paulo S/0000-0003-3882-2491",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,UNIV MINHO,GUIMARAES,"CAMPUS AZUREM, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL",2183-3974,,978-989-97050-3-6,ICOPEV INT C PROJ EC,,,2014,,,,,,,43,50,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI3DS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410764700002,0

We use the particle filter to overcome the non-optimality of the Kalman filter that arises as a consequence of the nonlinear dynamics for the time evolution of monetary shocks. This estimating procedure allows us to estimate all the parameters involved in the monetary policy, providing an alternative way to calibration. We present empirical evidence for the US, the UK and the EMU to show the potential applicability of our estimation method. Our findings show that the evidence of a regime change in US monetary policy making from 1997 to 2001 is weak. However, September eleven and the recession that started in the second quarter of 2001 emerge as events that probably led to regime shifts in US monetary policy making. Also the mortgage subprime crisis is another key event affecting the central bank's decisions worldwide. We show that the use of a Taylor rule with time-varying responses in accordance with a Markov-switching setting leads to empirical findings consistent with those obtained with the particle filter.

Intellectual capital has been emerged in the economic literature as knowledge capital which is embodied in knowledge-based organizations, driven them through multiple learning organizational processes. From a wholly accounting approach, it has been scanned and reported as intangible assets, source in itself of sometimes abnormal expected future returns. The identification of its multiple dimensions can be attained through two complementary orientations of thought: through a strategic approach, related to the creation and use of knowledge and its articulation with the dynamic value creation and, complimentarily, through the construction of new information systems and performance measures which are beyond the traditional financial approaches and measures. It is an approach that embodies the importance and the need to spread the unseen side of organizations. Its main aim is to translate and disseminate the companies' real value, its own and invisible drivers, and identify the origin of their multiple inflows and returns. The company under analysis is the largest agriculture, cattle and forest farmstead in Portugal, covering several marshlands. The diversity of activities currently developed (Forest exploration; Hunting; Agriculture; Wines and olive oil production; and Tourism) requires an integrated research towards the construction and disclosure of its intellectual capital drivers. Through an experimental and interpretative case study approach, we seek for an integrated intellectual capital scorecard towards the organizational development and sustainability. In the first step of this research, it was possible to identify several sustainability drivers, namely forest management certification, commercial brands and awards, strategic alliances and networks, and biodiversity reputation.","ISCTE Univ Inst Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Lopes, IT (通讯作者)，ISCTE Univ Inst Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.",ilidio.tomas.lopes@iscte.pt,"LOPES, ILÍDIO/AAB-1800-2020; TOMAS LOPES, ILIDIO/N-5094-2015","TOMAS LOPES, ILIDIO/0000-0002-0612-8801",,,,,21,3,3,1,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,91,98,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000012,0

There are numerous advantages of electronic commerce: a huge selection of products, time availability, lower product prices due to high competition, shopping convenience. However, electronic commerce has its disadvantages such as cultural differences in business between different countries, legislation, the inadequacy of some products for this form of shopping, doubts about the security of payment... Electronic retail or B2C (business to customer) is a computer store in which the entity aims at the ultimate consumer, whereat they notice a wide range of products and businesses engaged in trade new possibilities and advantages of this way of doing business. With the increasing number of Internet users in Croatia, the question is whether they use the electronic shopping and to what extent? A survey on the use of e-commerce in Croatia was conducted in three counties for the purposes of this paper: Zagreb, Vukovar-Srijem and Sibenik-Knin county for belonging to different regions, different levels of economic development as well as because of the different structure of their population. The study was conducted on 150 examinees, by means of a questionnaire with structured questions. The examined sample of thisstudy will show the extent to which residents of the Republic of Croatia as the ultimate consumers of non-business consumption use electronic shopping, the reason why is not used, if they believe in the security of payment over the Internet, who the users of e-commerce according to demographic characteristics are, as well as differences in regional affiliation with regard to the use of electronic commerce, etc.","[Madarac, Sandra Mrvica] Polytech Lavoslav Ruzicka, Vukovar, Croatia; [Kukic, Igor] Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Opatija, Croatia; [Galic, Matej] Belje Inc, Darda, Croatia",University of Rijeka,,smrvica@vevu.hr; igor.kukic@gmail.com; matej.galic@belje.hr,,,,,,,6,0,0,1,7,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,85,92,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000008,0

Unlike the private sector, the military has formal standards for identifying ideal recruits and uses a formal screening process to determine those within risky populations who are most likely to succeed. (Recruits who make it through the screening process are issued a waiver.) The military's establishment of waiver categories and its tracking of waiver status provide us with a case study for determining whether such risk-identification strategies work. Using FY99-FY08 service-level waiver and personnel data, we evaluate whether the military recruiting strategy has been successful and whether firms should consider adopting similar screening mechanisms. We estimate the effect of waiver status on attrition and promotion, our primary performance indicators, after controlling for other quality indicators. We find that waivered recruits, on the whole, are not particularly poor performers, although their inherent riskiness does vary by service and by waiver type.

But it can be accepted the idea that monetary stability is a contributor to the achievement of price stability, financial stability and macroeconomic stability, as well as to avoiding imbalances in the economy. In addition, the analysis of the causes of the crisis has shown that the direction of causal links between monetary and financial stability is in both ways: monetary stability affects financial stability and financial stability influences monetary stability. In these conditions, the high costs of the financial crises seem to indicate as necessary the involvement of central banks to a greater extent in the prevention of these crises, and implicitly in ensuring financial stability. In the article, the author argues the need for the central banks to involve in monitoring of the financial markets trends, as well as the opportunity of including financial stability among the objectives of central banks.

Thus, identifying and analyzing those factors that influence financial performance of entities is of great relevance both to practice and academia. While it is logical (but not undisputed) to suppose that the managerial abilities of the board of directors would have a significant impact on the entity's financial performance, it is however not clear-cut whether the board's composition would significantly influence the entity's performance. Within this study we investigated using econometric regression models the impact of 9 corporate governance characteristics regarding board composition on the contemporaneous and next year's performance (measured as ROA) using a sample comprised of the constituents of FTSE100 between 2010 and 2011. Through this research we intend to contribute to the academic literature on the unsettled issue concerning the relationship between corporate governance and corporate performance. As hypothesized and in accordance with some previous researches we found that board independence and the proportion of foreign directors in the total number of directors (as characteristics of corporate board composition) have a significant strong positive impact on firm performance (both contemporaneous and subsequent).

Special attention is paid to assess the mediating role of intrinsic motivation in the relationship. In doing so, a survey is administered to 132 employees (editorial staffs) working in mass media industry in the Indonesian context. The findings show that the support from co-workers is influential to promote the creativity of the employees. Surprisingly, the supports from supervisor and family provide no significant impact on the creativity. The study also reveals that intrinsic motivation partially influences the relationship between the support from co-workers and the creativity. It unearths that intrinsic motivation the employees have may signify the impact of the support from co-workers on their creativity.

The main findings were consistent to the economic theory and highlighted that the main stimulating factor upon economic growth is labour productivity.","Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Popescu, ME (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",madalina.andreica@gmail.com,"Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/AAK-8233-2020; Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/F-8696-2011","Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/0000-0002-0589-4010;",,,,,17,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,193,200,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300016,0

In addition, the set of infrastructure and human capital quality indices reflecting the country's potential to attract firms to establish and conduct competitive high-tech business is suggested to examine competiveness from the firm-level perspective. Internally homogenous clusters of EU countries with similar competitiveness characteristics are identified using the Ward agglomerative method in the analysis. Also, the dynamics and convergence processes of the EU core, periphery and CEE countries are examined using the measure of average distances within clusters. The results of countries' competitiveness evaluation show differences using both alternative approaches. Whereas the division between core, periphery and CEE countries is obvious using traditional cost-base productivity measures, unstable disparate clustering structures were identified using the firm-level approach. The results also show slow and steady convergence of CEE towards the core countries from the perspective of infrastructure and human capital quality dimension.

Producers may react to a significant increase in the price of a variable input, such as feed costs, by reducing production. This study evaluates the impact of feed costs on the supply of eggs in South Africa from 1970 to 2009 by estimating simultaneous equations for the demand and supply of eggs, since the decisions of suppliers interact simultaneously with the decisions of consumers. It was found that fluctuations in supply of eggs were not primarily due to changes in feed costs. Since eggs have few close substitutes and their demand is price inelastic, higher prices of eggs did not significantly influence the demand and supply of eggs. However, the supply of eggs in South Africa in the period 1970 to 2009 was heavily driven by the increasing demand for eggs rather than feed costs. Population growth and rising levels of disposable income resulting from improved job opportunities associated with economic growth, factors such as affirmative action and employment equity policies, created an ever increasing demand for eggs that led to the increase in supply of eggs in South Africa during the period 1970 to 2009.","[Sharaunga, S.; Darroch, M.

Thus, procurement for processing companies becomes more complex and the competition for local producers is increased. Local processors need to find adequate supplies at the lowest price whereas producers need to deliver at the best price. In order for processing companies to ensure sufficient quality and quantity, a good procurement strategy such as contract marketing is required. However, the characteristics of producers willing to adopt contract marketing must be identified. In order to do so, characteristics of contract producers in the Eastern Free State who used two different governance structures (contract and spot-market) were interviewed. A questionnaire was used and data were analysed with a Principal Component Regression combined with a Logit model. Out of 26 possible characteristics, nine were identified as significant (P<0.1 or P<0.5). The characteristics included less marketing cost, market information, only channel, less quality penalties, transport, price certainty, negotiation period, number of contacts, and less risk. Processing companies wanting to establish marketing strategies, target producers, and improve current contracts can use the nine characteristics. The characteristics can also be used to negotiate long-term contracts with producers.","[Strydom, D. B.; Willemse, B.

We use daily series on five-year banking, insurance, and financial services sector CDS indexes at the sector level from January 2004 to December 2011.

Further, the paper contributes to the White House Task Force's appeal on comprehensive research that target both consumers and producers. It extends the literature to assess evidence if food supplier decisions have been affected. This review suggests that there is an emerging best practice in applying choice architecture and nudging in school lunchroom that improves food choice. However, this information does not appear to have been utilized extensively in food supplier decisions. There is a need for research to include food supplier decisions in promoting healthy food choice.","[Thapa, Janani R.; Lyford, Conrad P.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Lyford, CP (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Box 42132, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",conrad.lyford@ttu.edu; janani.thapa@ttu.edu,,", Janani/0000-0002-0468-0387",,,,,72,17,18,2,75,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Main goal of the paper is to discuss the monetary policy implementation problems during 1930s based on Real-bills and Riefler-Burgess doctrine. First part of the paper reveals possible conflict between FED's monetary tools and targets arising from gold exchange standard. Expansionary monetary policy during banking crisis was potentially strongly limited by conflict among U.S. financial stability and sustainability of the gold standard. The second part describes monetary policy implementation during 1920s. The third part discusses FED's open market operations during the banking crisis and the fourth part explains the behavior of the interest rates. Finally, the work concludes that FED managed liquidity of U.S. banking system inappropriately and caused many bank deposit suspensions. FED considered monetary condition to be easy and sufficient to cover needs of production. Money interest rates responded very moderately to shortage of banking system's liquidity. We can find the origin of quantitative easing in 1932 when FED first bought large quantities of government securities. This policy was insufficient because of short term duration and the gold outflow neutralizations.","Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Titze, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",xtitm02@vse.cz,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,12,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Entrepreneurship is a multifaceted phenomenon, being analysed as a process, a resource or a state-of-being. According to the Schumpeterian view, the entrepreneurial process constitutes one of the key factors in the economic development of a country/region. However, researchers have expressed different views about the relationship between the stages of economic development and entrepreneurship during the time. The aims of the paper are to examine in brief the concepts of economic development and entrepreneurship, and to emphasize the role of entrepreneurship in economic development. The methodological approach is literature review. Our paper provides a theoretical model that highlights some of the main factors involved in the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development.

Our paper finds that stock returns respond significantly to surprise monetary shocks based on the informative FOMC statements; there is little evidence to show that stock returns respond to surprise monetary shocks based on uninformative statements. We ask how these impacts respond to the relative ability of firms to obtain external finance. Our results indicate that the stock returns of firms that are financially constrained still respond significantly more to monetary policy shocks than less constrained ones based on the informative statements. By comparing firms with medium and low capacities for external finance based on the informative statements, it is found that firms with low capacity for external finance are more significantly affected by the impacts of a surprise monetary policy action than firms with medium capacity for external finance. However, when controlling the capacity for external finance, a monetary surprise has no significant impact on stock returns based on the uninformative statements. We also find that the response of stock returns to a negative target surprise is significant. However, the response to a positive target surprise is insignificant, which implies that market investors respond more rationally to good news (negative target surprises) than to bad news (positive target surprises). For a good news monetary shock, informative statements have larger impacts on stock returns than uninformative statements. However, for a bad news monetary shock, neither informative nor uninformative statements have significant impacts on stock returns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, nowadays the role of SMEs is not sufficient to promote the economic growth and to increase society income. It is difficult toSMEs to grow becoming larger business next stage or persist in sustainable productivity. This problem is considered related to the decreasing of SMEs competitiveness. This study aims to develop model of competitiveness for SMEs especially among the creative industry in Bandung. As a means to address its issue, it uses depth interview method using semi-structured interview. The data collection had three phases: preliminary phase, first phase, and second phase. Preliminary phase is conducted to test the questions. The first phase interview is conducted to some sub-sectors of creative industry in Bandung that are included the SMEs criteria. Then, the data would be analyzed using grounded theory analysis in order to generate initial codes, sub-concepts, concepts, and categories. The second phase is conducted to validate the results of first phase and generate the final sub-concepts, concepts, categories, and finally build the theory. Competitiveness is viewed as a comprehensive concept. It can be accessed from the influences up to the results achieved. Three dimensions that are included in competitiveness concept are potential dimension, process dimension, and performance dimension. Potential dimension consist factors that are needed to develop the business, started from owner characteristics and company's characteristics that are influenced by internal capability and external environment. The second dimension named process dimension, which is consist effective operation strategy and implementation and effective growth strategy and implementation. The third dimension is performance dimension which is divided into financial performance and non-financial performance. The hypotheses related to model can be developed. Finally the recommendation based on previous analysis can be given to some entities such as business owner, government, and mediator in order to develop the SMEs. (C) 2013 The Authors.

When assessing the seismic vulnerability of buildings it is essential to first establish the project objectives, before subsequently choosing the most appropriate strategy and tools necessary for building assessment and fulfillment of these objectives. It is also extremely important to understand the difference between the detailed approaches used for individual building assessment and those methods most efficient for larger scale analysis, pursued for city center assessment.

It led to clashes and mutual influence of different cultures during amount of migration flows. Jewish, Hungarians, Roma people, Germans, Croatians, Serbians and other nationalities gradually come to our area. These groups interacted with one another and together created what is now called Slovak culture. Of course, migration to our country continues and they create so called new minorities. (1) However, we can not say with certainty how many foreigners/migrants are in our country. Police has only a number of foreigners/migrants who either applied for any type of residence or they were stopped as illegal immigrants. 68 405 foreigners/migrants with legal residence were in Slovakia till 30 June 2013, of who 42 876 (62,7%) were citizens from E. U. countries. (2) We can say that appopriate 0,5% from all citizens are residents who do not have our citizenship. (3) 19,3 % of our country population has another nationality as Slovak. (4) Next part of our presentation is concered on a description of study opportunities at universities in Slovakia and there also is the number of foreign students studing at these schools.

The penalty is between 1-13%, depending on personal characteristics. Results of auxiliary regressions suggest that behind the negative effect is loss of human capital caused by maternity and parental leave as well as lower work effort of mothers at work and self-selection of mothers into more mother-friendly jobs. We have found a significant motherhood wage penalty in the private sector. However, in the public sector mothers receive a 1% wage premium. In contrast with theory, results show that low educated women yield a 4% premium for motherhood.

We test and compare it against the standard Relative Price Difference and the Nenova (2003) measure using 19982008 data from Italy, a country where dividend privileges are relevant. Results show that when dividend privileges are considered, the average voting right equals +35.63%, while its estimated value corresponds to a significantly lower + 20.35% and + 1.29% with the Relative Price Difference and the Nenova (2003) measure, respectively. Negative values of voting rights drop significantly with our methodology. Results become even more clear-cut when we clean the sample of possible measurement errors.

A principal-supervisor-agent model,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,EU; Bureaucratic corruption; Principal-supervisor-agent; OLAF; Commission,EUROPEAN-UNION; FIGHT; FRAUD,"Why does bureaucratic corruption occur in the EU system? Several examples suggest that bureaucratic corruption exists and that the Commission's anti-fraud agency, OLAF, is not a fully independent authority. We thus develop a novel interpretation of the principal-supervisor-agent model to cope with non-independent anti-fraud units. This model shows that corruption is likely to occur when the expected value to the client from bribing the agent is larger than the expected value to the principal of truth-telling by the supervisor. Overall, this analysis points to the risks of flawed incentives and the lack of institutional independence among principal, agent, supervisor and client. Our main policy recommendations as a result of these findings are that OLAF should be placed outside the Commission, and that whistleblowers should receive adequate protection.","[Brandt, Urs Steiner] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Esbjerg, Denmark; [Svendsen, Gert Tinggaard] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Govt, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; Aarhus University,"Svendsen, GT (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Govt, Aarhus, Denmark.",usb@sam.sdu.dk; gts@ps.au.dk,"Svendsen, Gert Tinggaard/AAQ-1877-2021; brandt, urs steiner/GZL-6844-2022","Svendsen, Gert Tinggaard/0000-0003-1463-5421;",,,,,39,8,10,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2013,157.0,3-4,,,SI,,585,599,,10.1007/s11127-013-0095-5,0.0,,,15,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,269AT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328213100011,0

This analysis decomposes cumulated lending and borrowing over the past decade into sector-level contributions and compares them with the euro area average. It shows strong borrowing by households and non-financial corporations with government further increasing net borrowing in Greece and Portugal. Financial corporations act in this context as intermediaries between foreign savings and domestic borrowers. The sector-level contributions to an economy's foreign net liabilities vary significantly by country, which implies a need for different adjustment paths. In a currency union, given the absence of a mechanism for transfer payments between member states, there is a heightened risk that large foreign liabilities will become unsustainable. Thus, member states must contain external imbalances, which often reflect a loss of competitiveness and internal imbalances, to prevent the reoccurrence of current vulnerabilities.","Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Ebner, A (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",andre.ebner@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,30,0,1,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Our study is based on a real-time database of EC, OECD and national governments' public deficit forecasts for 15 European countries over the period 1999-2007 and four vintages of projections per forecasted year. Against this background, independent national fiscal institutions might be a natural option, to the extent that they may have better access to inside national information than international organizations.

Evidence from a Statewide Randomized Experiment",JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTS; INCOME FAMILIES; INCENTIVES; NONRESPONSE; COLLEGE,"This study examines the impacts of Child Development Accounts (CDAs) on account holding, saving, and asset accumulation for children, using data from the SEED for Oklahoma Kids experiment (SEED OK). SEED OK, a policy test of universal and progressive CDAs, provides a 529 college savings plan account to every infant in the treatment group with automatic account opening and an initial deposit. SEED OK also encourages treatment participants to open their own 529 accounts with an account opening incentive and a savings match. Using a sample of infants randomly selected from birth records (N = 2,670) and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, this study runs probit and ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. Analyses show significant differences between treatment and control groups in all outcome measures in the targeted accounts. Nearly 100 percent of the treatment group accepted the automatically opened state-owned account. Compared to 1 percent of the control group, 16 percent of the treatment group hold a participant-owned account. On average, the treatment group has saved significantly larger amounts in participant-owned accounts, although a difference in savings amount is modest between the two groups ($47 vs. $13). A difference in total 529 assets of $1,040 is estimated between the treatment and control groups. These early findings from SEED OK suggest that CDAs have positive effects on savings and asset accumulation for children's future development. Further research is required to test long-term cost effectiveness of CDAs.","[Nam, Yunju] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Social Work, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Kim, Youngmi] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Social Work, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Clancy, Margaret; Zager, Robert; Sherraden, Michael] Washington Univ, Ctr Social Dev, George Warren Brown Sch Social Work, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; Virginia Commonwealth University; Washington University (WUSTL),"Nam, Y (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Sch Social Work, 685 Baldy Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",,,"Nam, Yunju/0000-0001-8280-8414",,,,,49,65,72,0,104,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

The value-added of the article is not to suggest that our classification is the end in itself, but - more modestly - to demonstrate that more work on taxonomies is required in light of the weakness of classifications based solely on income and the changing distribution of global poverty.","[Tezanos Vazquez, Sergio] Univ Cantabria, Iberoamer Res Off Int Dev & Cooperat, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Sumner, Andy] Kings Coll London, Kings Int Dev Inst, London WC2R 2LS, England",Universidad de Cantabria; University of London; King's College London,"Vázquez, ST (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Iberoamer Res Off Int Dev & Cooperat, Fac CC EE & Empresariales, Avda Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",tezanoss@unican.es,"Tezanos-Vazquez, Sergio/P-3040-2016","Tezanos-Vazquez, Sergio/0000-0002-7202-5472; Sumner, Andy/0000-0002-8995-7065",,,,,35,33,39,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

It is a beer producer, i.e. a good which is controversial in the opinion of society. In order to change the attitude of the public toward the Capital Group and show concern for ecological aspects, the company has made attempts to create and implement CSR strategy in formal terms. It should be emphasized that major shareholder (Heineken company) has already been following the strategy of sustainable development referred to as Brewing a Better Future (Social Report, 2013). However, the period during which the aforementioned actions were taken arouses a number of doubts, e. g. if the enterprise is able to continue its activity having achieved a certain level of liquidity. In times of great financial crisis, which started at the turn of 2007 and 2008, maintaining adequate liquidity was the main problem. It was then that enterprises ought to pay special attention to this aspect (Gorczynska, 2011; Raport, 2010). Having the above in mind, the paper discusses issues relating to financial liquidity of the Capital Group Zywiec plc. in times of economic crisis and at the initial stage of CSR strategy implementation. Case study is the main method employed to verify the hypothesis formulated at the beginning of the article. Selected financial ratios are used in order to compare the liquidity of the Capital Group with the liquidity of the entire sector.","Univ Szczecin, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Gasior, A (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland.",olag@wneiz.pl,"Gąsior, Aleksandra/HTQ-3948-2023","Gąsior, Aleksandra/0000-0003-3959-6094",,,,,51,1,1,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2013,15.0,,,,7,,784,801,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,268IU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328164400017,0

From a methodological point of view how one integrates conceptualization of forms of heterogeneity with recognition of their axis of influence; themselves dependent upon attributes of field-level situations is crucial for analysis of collective action.

For these same stocks, a month's fourth-Friday weekly returns underperform modestly. We suggest the following two avenues are likely partial contributors towards understanding these return patterns: (1) delta-hedge rebalancing by option market makers, with a reduction in short-stock hedge positions over the OE week, and (2) declining risk perceptions over the OE week, as measured by option-derived implied volatilities.

The central argument is that the race riots were not an inevitable outcome at the end of the Civil War, but instead occurred because of the absence of effective rules to raise the cost of engaging in violence. We offer a general framework of 'rule stickiness' to analyze the process of rule reform. This framework offers insight into the conditions influencing the enforcement costs of formal rules, as well as the likelihood of third-party enforcers effectively monitoring and punishing rule breakers.

Two primary approaches in price regulation have been the rate of return and price cap regulation schemes, with the latter assumed to possess important incentive properties. The results establish that firms regulated via rate of return or other hybrid regulatory approaches have paid significantly lower wages. These wages have been, on average, 5-10% lower than what firms regulated via price cap regulation have paid their employees. These results signify the importance of regulations possessing requisite incentive properties and of appropriate regulatory mechanism design in enhancing employees' real wages in regulated firms.","Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Majumdar, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",majumdar@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,119,4,4,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We define social integration as blending into the host country's society, and economic assimilation as acquisition of human capital that is specific to the host country's labor market. We show that a non-integrated migrant finds it optimal to acquire a relatively limited quantity of human capital; with fellow migrants constituting his only comparison group, a non-integrated migrant does not have a relative-deprivation-based incentive to close the income gap with the natives. However, when a migrant is made to integrate, his social proximity to the natives exposes him to relative deprivation, which in turn prompts him to form more destination-specific human capital in order to increase his earnings and narrow the income gap with the natives. In this way, social integration becomes a catalyst for economic assimilation.

Failure to meet promised targets, however, does not imply that Kyoto has been pointless. Whether Kyoto has made a difference relative to the counterfactual of No Kyoto is an empirical question that requires an instrumental variables strategy. We argue that countries' ratification of the statutes governing the International Criminal Court is a valid instrument for ratification of Kyoto commitments. In our panel fixed effects estimations, the instrument easily passes weak identification and overidentification tests. It can be plausibly excluded from our second-stage equations and does not cause CO2 emissions. Our estimates suggest that Kyoto ratification has a quantitatively large (about 10 percent) and robust, though only moderately statistically significant, negative effect on CO2 emissions. We also show that higher fuel prices and a different energy mix in Kyoto countries support this result.","[Aichele, Rahel] Univ Munich, IFO Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Felbermayr, Gabriel] Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Aichele, R (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, IFO Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",,,"Felbermayr, Gabriel/0000-0003-4984-9745",,,,,38,47,54,1,107,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

We assume that central bankers have to choose between a policy that preemptively raises short-term real interest rates in the boom phase to prevent the build-up of a financial market crisis scenario and the cleaning-up strategy that ignores its impact on the likelihood of a future crisis. We find that the more independent central bankers are, the more likely it is that they refrain from implementing preemptive monetary tightening to maintain financial stability. These results stand in sharp contrast with the seemingly predominant view that central bank independence fosters financial stability. The intuition underlying these results is that a preemptive interest rate hike gives rise to, among other things, a lower inflation rate in the boom period. Whether this disinflation creates additional costs or benefits depends on the degree of central bank independence. It can benefit dependent central bankers who otherwise would suffer from a higher inflation bias; however, for independent central bankers, this disinflation leads to an undesirable undershooting of their inflation target.

Whilst forward prices emerge as the expectation of spot plus, or minus, an ex ante premium for risk, the manifestation and empirical analysis must focus upon realised ex post premiums. This presents modelling requirements to control for shocks to the spot expectation as well as the endogeneity of ex post premia with spot price outcomes. In addition, because electricity is a derived commodity in the sense that market prices are often set by technologies that convert gas or coal into power, it is an open question whether much of the premia in power may actually be a pass-through of the premia in gas (or coal). Using a four dimensional VAR model we are able to distinguish fundamental and behavioural aspects of price formation in both the daily and monthly forward premia from the British market. We present new evidence on daily and seasonal sign reversals, associated with demand cycles, the greater importance of behavioural adaptations in the risk premia than fundamental or spot market risk measures, and the substantial fuel risk pass-through. We also show the value of a nonlinear specification in this context. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze the effects of media proliferation on electoral outcomes assuming voters may choose news that is too partisan, from an informational perspective, i.e., engage in partisan selective exposure. We find that if voters who prefer highly partisan news-either because they are truly ideologically extreme, or due to a tendency towards excessive selective exposure-are politically important, then proliferation is socially beneficial, as it makes these voters more likely to obtain informative news. Otherwise, proliferation still protects against very poor electoral outcomes that can occur when the number of outlets is small and the only media options are highly partisan. Our model's overall implication is thus that, surprisingly, proliferation is socially beneficial regardless of the degree of selective exposure.","[Chan, Jimmy] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Stone, Daniel F.] Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Oregon State University,"Stone, DF (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 303 Ballard Hall Ext, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",jimmy.hing.chan@gmail.com; dan.stone@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,41,8,10,2,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2013,156.0,3-4,,,,,467,490,,10.1007/s11127-012-9928-x,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,184NK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321897600005,0

The need for a capacity market stems from several market failures. One particularly notorious problem of electricity markets is low demand flexibility. Most customers are unaware of the real time prices of electricity, have no reason to respond to them, or cannot respond quickly to them, leading to highly price-inelastic demand. This contributes to blackouts in times of scarcity and to the inability of the market to determine the market-clearing prices needed to attract an efficient level and mix of generation capacity Moreover; the problems caused by this market failure can result in considerable price volatility and market power that would be insignificant if the demand-side of the market were fully functional. Capacity markets are a means to ensure resource adequacy while mitigating other problems caused by the demand side flaws.

It also shows that, irrespective of where government spending falls, there appears to be no significant short run boost to overall output and hence employment a priori, although empirically actual impact would depend on the elasticities of tradable and non-tradable output with respect to the real exchange rate.

The analysis presented in this paper contributes to the debate by studying the impact of US antidumping (AD) and countervailing (CV) duties on domestic producers' price-cost margins (PCM). To this end, the study takes advantage of a long panel of 4-digit industries in the United States covering 26 years of AD/CV activity, including the periods before and after the changes to AD/CV laws introduced following the Uruguay Round (UR). It finds evidence of a positive effect of AD/CV duties on PCM for the period prior to the UR, but the effect seems to disappear in the years following the UR.

First, we show that CEO-employee pay ratios depend on the balance of power between the CEO (relative to the board) and ordinary employees (relative to management). Second, our results suggest that employees do not perceive higher pay ratios as an inequitable outcome to be redressed via costly behaviors that lower productivity. We do not find a negative relation between relative pay and employee productivity, either in our full sample or in subsamples where employees are well-informed about executive pay and are protected against career retributions. Rather, we find that productivity increases with relative pay when the firm has fewer employees who are well-informed, and when promotion decisions are predominantly merit-based. We also find that firm value and operating performance both increase with relative pay. We conclude that ordinary employees appear to perceive an opportunity in higher pay ratios but the extent to which such perception incentivizes them depends on the likelihood of success in a series of sequential promotion tournaments.

J,"Nehru, V",,,,"Nehru, Vikram",,,Survey of recent developments,BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INDONESIA,"The process for Indonesia's 2014 parliamentary and presidential elections is underway. A few discernible patterns have emerged, yet the political situation at this early stage remains fluid and both races are open. Recent events have shown, however, that Indonesian democracy itself is still relatively young and evolving, the balance of power between key institutions is still unsettled, and constitutional checks and balances are still being tested. Macroeconomic developments over the last few months have been mixed. Economic growth stayed above 6%, despite a difficult external environment, and inflation, which climbed in the first quarter, began to ease in April and May. At the same time, slower investment growth, deficits in the current and capital accounts of the balance of payments, downward pressure on the rupiah, and the risk of further increases in interest and exchange rates cast a shadow over near-term growth prospects. The recent rise in global interest rates triggered a capital outflow that contributed to a stock-market correction and placed the rupiah under new pressure. Bank Indonesia responded by raising the overnight rate, which helped to calm markets. But given relatively large non-resident holdings of Indonesian stocks and bonds and continued upward pressure on global interest rates, Indonesia's balance of payments and capital market will likely remain under strain for the foreseeable future. Policy developments were also mixed. The appointment of a technocrat as finance minister sent a reassuring signal to markets and investors. And parliament finally approved a revised budget based on more realistic assumptions and included a much delayed across-the-board increase in fuel prices, together with compensatory programs for the poor. This achievement should help boost investor confidence and generate public resources for urgent infrastructure and social-assistance programs. At the same time, however, recent measures to restrict imports of horticultural products attracted the ire of trading partners and domestic consumers, leading to their partial reversal. These measures, together with draft trade and industry laws awaiting parliamentary approval, represent a new economic nationalism that seeks to protect domestic producers against what is seen as unfair international competition The fuel-price increase, rising income inequality and an ambitious target of reducing the poverty rate to 8%-10% in 2014 - the last year of President Yudhoyono's final term - brings into focus the efficacy of Indonesia's social-assistance programs. It also adds fresh urgency to government efforts to improve the coverage, financing, targeting, and institutional arrangements underpinning these programs. The challenge has always been, and remains, that without central monitoring and oversight, local political pressures tend to dilute program benefits for the intended beneficiaries.","Carnegie Endowment Int Peace, Washington, DC 20037 USA",,"Nehru, V (通讯作者)，Carnegie Endowment Int Peace, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",,,,,,,,30,13,13,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

A review of GHG reduction policies reveals fragmented approaches with political stalemates at the national level. Closely integrated North American energy markets are potentially changing in different directions. While Canada is contemplating more diversification of energy trade, the United States is increasingly relying on domestic supply of energy and will soon be a net exporter of energy. The paper argues that carbon pricing needs to be harmonized in conjunction with trade flows and elaborates on how current, fragmented carbon pricing initiatives could be turned into a more harmonized carbon pricing system. It provides arguments in support of a binding absolute emissions cap with limited safety valves and price floors in a North American emissions-trading program. It also discusses lessons learned from the EU GHG emissions-trading system and their implications for the design of North American cap-and-trade regimes.","Carleton Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Schott, S (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",,"Schott, Stephan/GZH-1166-2022","Schott, Stephan/0000-0003-1298-7036",,,,,30,6,6,0,43,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We find the GCC-wide sector returns have asynchronous responses to global and regional shocks. Although the effects of these shocks differ in magnitude across individual GCC-wide sector returns, there is evidence that the GCC-wide sector equity markets are mostly driven by their own volatilities. For the basic materials, telecom and utility sectors, the effects of regional and global shocks are lower in magnitude in comparison to the rest of the GCC-wide sector indices. Applying a time-varying spillover model, we also indicate that the effect of global shocks on the volatility of GCC sector returns has been decreasing, whereas regional shocks have been affecting the sector indices with a positive and significant trend. We also document that portfolios diversified across GCC-wide sectors perform better than portfolios diversified across GCC national equity markets. To some extent, portfolios diversified with a mix of GCC-wide sector and national equities produce higher returns than portfolios made up of pure GCC national equity indices or GCC-wide sector indices.

This creates price pressure for stocks held mostly by short-horizon investors, which, as a consequence, experience larger price drops, and subsequent reversals, than stocks held mostly by long-horizon investors. These findings, obtained after controlling for the withdrawals experienced by the investors, are not driven by other institutional investors' and firms' characteristics. Overall, the evidence indicates that investors with short horizons amplify the effects of market-wide negative shocks by demanding liquidity at times when other potential buyers'capital is scarce.","[Cella, Cristina; Giannetti, Mariassunta] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Ellul, Andrew] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Stockholm School of Economics; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Ellul, A (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",anellul@indiana.edu,"Giannetti, Mariassunta/C-1511-2017","Giannetti, Mariassunta/0000-0003-1568-8939",,,,,48,139,155,2,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We examine two main questions. First, we evaluate the effects of certain property rights and institutional quality measures on performance and efficiency. We find that property rights and contracting rights protections contribute to stronger post-privatization performance. Second, we ask whether sectors undergoing changes from state to private ownership exhibit better or worse performance than sectors remaining public. We find an insignificant effect of privatization in ordinary least squares estimates and a negative short-term effect after correcting for endogeneity of privatization decisions that disappears in the long run, consistent with recently privatized enterprises facing short-run costs of restructuring and the challenges of mitigating agency and expropriation concerns.

Using structural equation modeling and a 2009 survey of residents of Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire, this study estimated how the availability of built amenities, natural amenities, weather and attitudes toward travel explain actual and unserved travel demand and subsequently quality of life. The presence of unserved travel demand significantly decreased quality of life, while the predicted number of trips taken had no impact. With regard to quality of life in northern rural climates, future mobility initiatives would have more impact by addressing trips not taken as measured by unserved travel demand, instead of number of trips or vehicle miles traveled.

One difference with earlier findings is that the biases seem to be hidden and are worse than looking at the averages across administrations.

The results show that the yield gap forecasts positive excess market returns, both at short and long forecasting horizons, and for both value- and equal-weighted stock indexes, and it also outperforms competing predictors commonly used in the literature. These findings go in line with the predictions from a present-value decomposition. The absence of predictive power for dividend growth, dividend payout ratios, earnings growth, and future one-period interest rates, actually strengthens the return predictability associated with the yield gap at very long horizons. By performing an out-of-sample analysis, the results show that the yield gap has reasonable out-of-sample predictability for the equity premium when the comparison is made against a simple historical average, especially when one imposes a restriction of positive equity premia. Furthermore, the yield gap proxies generally show greater out-of-sample forecasting power than the alternative state variables. An investment strategy based on the forecasting ability of the yield gap produces significant gains in Sharpe ratios.","Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki, Finland",Hanken School of Economics,"Maio, P (通讯作者)，Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki, Finland.",,"Maio, Paulo/E-5124-2013",,,,,,65,41,42,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Based on models of price dispersion, we consider that search costs are likely lower for the elderly, who are repeat purchasers. Expected benefits from search are likely higher for low-income households, who lack insurance. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that for communities with a large percentage of elderly and poor population, search effort is greater for pharmaceutical drugs, causing lower price dispersion. By understanding the characteristics of who searches for low drug prices, we begin to identify the motives of consumers that might also lead to search for the lowest cost healthcare provider or lowest cost insurance. The results suggest that the Medicare legislation that attempts to close the pharmaceutical doughnut hole may reduce search by the elderly, increase price dispersion, and potentially increase the average price of prescription drugs.

By exploiting dynamic panel data modeling approaches, the heterogeneity in banks' lending response to changes in policy interest rates is analyzed. Given the changes in the policy stance and developments in the financial system following the 2000-01 crisis, the analysis is further conducted for the two sub-periods, 1988-2001 and 2002-2009, to examine whether there is a change in the functioning of the credit channel. Empirical evidence suggests cross-sectional heterogeneity in banks' response to monetary policy changes during 1988-2009. Regarding the results of pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, it is found that an operative bank lending channel existed in 1988-2001, however its impact became much stronger thereafter. The results also show significant differences in distributional effects of monetary policy due to bank-specific characteristics between two sub-periods.","[Ozsuca, Ekin Ayse; Akbostanci, Elif] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Özsuca, EA (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",aysozs@yahoo.com; elifa@metu.edu.tr,"ozsuca, ayse/AAI-9233-2020; Akbostanci, Elif/HDO-4192-2022","Akbostanci, Elif/0000-0003-2654-5925",,,,,23,1,1,0,12,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

However, there would remain problems arising from the incompatibility of the laws governing cross-border bank insolvencies.

Surprisingly, despite this large body of work, virtually no research has investigated the contribution of advertising investments to information asymmetry. This omission is particularly glaring since: (a) advertising investments constitute a significant fraction of many firms' ongoing expenditures, and (b) the received literature provides strong theoretical arguments relating advertising investments and information asymmetry. Accordingly, the primary objective in this study is to empirically address this gap. Using advertising and insider transaction data at over 12,000 firms from 1986 to 2011, we find that insider gains are significantly greater at firms characterized by advertising investments. Specifically, a zero cost portfolio that is long on firms with net insider purchases and advertising investments, and short on firms with net insider purchases and devoid of advertising investments, garners annual abnormal returns of 5.5%. In addition, we find that investors' reaction to news of insider purchasing is significantly more pronounced at firms characterized by advertising investments - investors rationally recognize the greater information content associated with insider purchases at these firms.

This result holds after controlling for state-level unemployment rate, gross domestic product, population growth, legislative political ideology, partisan control of the executive and legislative branches, and gubernatorial election year across multiple specifications, including fixed-effects and dynamic panel estimators. We propose a theory of moderate coupling as the causal mechanism, whereby UI program benefits and financing are directly related but are not as tightly linked as in other social insurance programs, such as Medicaid. The findings have important policy implications for the funding of states' UI systems. As a consequence of moderate coupling, the countercyclicality of the UI program is dampened.

However, marketing scholars have remained reluctant to adopt the techniques of neuroscience and there is still uncertainty about the capacity of neuroimaging data to provide useful findings about consumer psychology and behaviour. In order to clarify the current scope and contribution of consumer neuroscience, we first develop a semantic cluster analysis of the boundaries of the field, followed by a comprehensive empirical review from 34 selected studies. We propose a novel approach to classify findings and facilitate the assessment of evidence around the topics of decision-making, rewards, memory and emotions. Finally, we discuss the possible role of several brain mechanisms in the processing of marketing stimuli as well as obstacles to the integration of these findings with classical consumer behaviour theories. We conclude that the contribution of neuroimaging remains too limited to replace existing consumer research techniques and provide recommendations for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Overall, our findings suggest that board size is negatively and non-linearly associated with the possibility of operational risk events. For the event types of Clients, Products, and Business Practices, and Internal Fraud and External Fraud, firms with a higher proportion of independent directors are less likely to suffer from fraud or failure to comply with professional obligations to clients. Our results on age and tenure heterogeneity also indicate that having a more diverse board can have an adverse impact on the board monitoring function.

We consider the effects of policy design by varying the standard above which satisfactory teachers are expected to perform. We simulate recently adopted policies that remove teachers based on consecutive unsatisfactory performance and compare these to policies that remove teachers based on poor performance on average over a multiyear period. We also consider the precision of the performance measure and the underlying variation in teacher quality on policy effects. Finally, the simulation makes a step forward by incorporating recent empirical findings of a relationship between teacher quality and natural attrition from the profession. Our results indicate that deselection policies based on value-added measures have the potential to improve teacher quality, although understanding the role of policy design, self-selected exits, and the underlying variation in teacher quality is essential for determining policy effects.

The empirical results show that the relationship between the trade balance and the fundamentals is rather nonlinear, changing over time and across countries depending on the lagged real interest rate differential during the different regimes. Moreover, China's bilateral trade balance responds significantly to the changes in relative real income differentials, real oil prices, and import-weighted distance. If the Federal Reserve adopts an expansionary monetary policy in the near future, China would still accumulate higher bilateral trade surpluses from most of the G7 countries, as long as the following situations exist: an increase in China's relative real per capita income, a slow increase in real oil price, and a stable RMB (the Chinese currency) exchange rate system.

In the wake of the jobless recovery from the Great Recession, economists have sought to explain the coexistence of a high unemployment rate and increasing job openings as a mismatch phenomenon. This article reviews five studies that have contributed to the development of mismatch indexes and computes the corresponding indexes over the period May 2005 May 2012 using job vacancy data from the Conference Board Help Wanted OnLine (R) (HWOL) Data Series. For most of the indexes, mismatch increased during the Great Recession, although the indexes exhibit a range of behaviors. According to an index developed in Jackman and Roper (1987), mismatch can account for at most 2.72 percentage points of the 5.30-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate from the beginning of the recession to the unemployment rate peak.","[Canon, Maria E.; Chen, Mingyu; Marifian, Elise A.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Canon, ME (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,,,,,,,29,9,10,0,5,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

We address this issue by arguing that the positive effect of SIPs on the development of the domestic market may have limitations, especially when the domestic market is not well developed and cannot absorb rapid and large-scale SIP activities. To maintain domestic market order, it may be optimal to carry out SIP in overseas markets. Furthermore, by listing shares in developed overseas markets, SOEs from the less developed countries could leverage on the overseas markets' better accounting, governance, and legal standards. By examining a sample of 92 Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong and the relevant control samples of purely domestically listed Chinese firms during the period of 1993-2006, we find supporting evidence for both arguments.

During this downturn, the number of real estate foreclosures has risen drastically. Recent studies have empirically demonstrated a reduction in real estate values due to neighboring foreclosures, termed the foreclosure contagion effect. The foreclosure contagion effect impacts healthy neighboring properties that surround the foreclosed property as a function of both time and distance. We mathematically specify a precise equation that identifies the foreclosure contagion threshold, that is, the boundary that separates surviving markets from those that crash. Using a new technique to our field known as Latin Hypercube Sampling, we presents the results of a large scale sensitivity analysis to find that beyond the foreclosure discount and disposition time variables, the percentage of adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) and the foreclosure distance discount weight are the two secondary most contributing causes to a market collapse.","[Gangel, Marshall; Collins, Andrew J.] Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Seiler, Michael J.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",Old Dominion University; William & Mary,"Seiler, MJ (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",Michael.Seiler@mason.wm.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474; Collins, Andrew/0000-0002-8012-2272",,,,,21,5,5,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

A transaction's economic substance manifests itself in characteristics of the transaction, and an accounting rule is a mapping from transaction characteristics to an accounting report. Managers who have stakes in the accounting report are able to influence transaction characteristics. Such earnings management is ex post rational for managers but ex ante inefficient. To safeguard against such ex post opportunism, the optimal ex ante accounting rule is conservative in the sense that it requires more verification of the transaction characteristics favorable to managers. Thus, this rationale for conservatism is as general as the managers' ability and incentive to inflate transaction characteristics. By opening the black box of accounting measurement, the two-step representation also formalizes some classic accounting concepts, such as relevance, reliability, verifiability, verification, and accounting-motivated transactions.

In particular, the unique process by which the PRO port system went from one gateway port to two ports and the undergoing regionalization with specialization is examined. The network strategy is stressed in shaping the port system structure. With the advantage of a hinterland regionalization, Shenzhen, among the gateway ports in PRD, has acquired the market share from Hong Kong. Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports move from the hinterland-dominated regionalization to a more balanced regionalization based on an established inland transport network, whereas Hong Kong undergoes a foreland regionalization. If the hinterland connection remains relatively weak, the gateway function of the port in Hong Kong will further decline, but its transhipment role will further dominate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in policy-based analyses, where the research is often driven by understanding how different individuals react to different or similar scenarios, a preferred approach would be to analyze preferences of homogenous population subgroups. We accomplish this by developing a split-sample RP/SP analysis that examines whether homogenous subgroups of the population, based on individual health and behavioral characteristics, respond differently to health-risk information and new food safety technology. The ongoing efforts by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce illness and death associated with consuming raw Gulf of Mexico oysters provide an ideal platform for the analysis as the health risks only relate to a very specific consumer subgroup. Results from split-sample demand models indicate that educational information treatments cause vulnerable at-risk consumers to reduce their oyster demand, implying that a more structured approach to disseminating the brochures to the at-risk population could have the desired result of reducing annual illness levels. Also, findings across all subgroups provide strong empirical evidence that the new FDA policy requiring processing technology to be used in oyster production will have a detrimental effect on the oyster industry.","[Morgan, O.

In Chinese society, guanxi' (interpersonal relationships) are involved in everyday social interactions. Studies of collective action, such as social movements, cannot ignore the role that guanxi' play. This paper argues that collective action in Taiwan is strongly influenced by social practices, such as guanxi'. The early part of the paper discusses social movement theories of social network, and briefly reviews guanxi' theory and its relationship with the concept of social capital'. The later part examines the function of guanxi' in two recent social movements: the antiNo. 6/8 Naphtha Cracking Project (A6/8NCP) movement at Taixi and the antileather factory movement at Gouzao. These two social movements provide excellent case studies for rethinking how collective action functions in Taiwan.","[Wang, Chi-Mao; Woods, Michael] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, Wales",Aberystwyth University,"Wang, CM (通讯作者)，Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Geog & Earth Sci, Llandinam Bldg,Penglais Campus, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, Wales.",chw11@aber.ac.uk; m.woods@aber.ac.uk,"Wang, Chi-Mao/ABC-2062-2020; Woods, Michael/N-4352-2016","Wang, Chi-Mao/0000-0002-5125-230X; Woods, Michael/0000-0003-3813-4138",,,,,54,13,17,0,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The article breaks down the annual growth rate of total exports along different margins and details choices made by multi-product, multi-destination firms regarding their export portfolio. In addition, the article looks at similar features for the subsample of new exporters. We find that both the firm-level extensive and intensive margins are important in driving the year-to-year variation in aggregate exports. However, variation over time in the sales of continuing exporters is mainly driven by their sales in continuing destinations. In addition, a product's export tenure within a firm varies largely across currently exported products in the context of an intense activity of product and destination switching. Moreover, the higher the importance of a product, the more its sales are concentrated in the firm's top destination. Finally, the article finds that, while continuing exporters enter new markets mainly by selling old products, new exporters access new destinations mainly by exporting new products.","[Amador, Joao] Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Amador, Joao; Opromolla, Luca David] Cent Bank Portugal, Res Dept, P-1100 Lisbon, Portugal; [Opromolla, Luca David] Univ Tecn Lisboa, UECE, Res Unit Complex & Econ, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Opromolla, LD (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Portugal, Res Dept, R Ouro 27, P-1100 Lisbon, Portugal.",jamador@bportugal.pt; luca.opromolla@nyu.edu,,"Amador, Joao/0000-0002-8966-8036",,,,,32,23,25,3,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The presence of a redistributive welfare state in all major immigrant host countries creates a margin on which immigration affects native welfare. The primary focus of the paper is whether a large intake of immigrants reduces welfare state effort. It is usually argued that steady increases in immigration lead to public pressure for lower levels of publicly-funded social expenditures. In contrastz to the earlier empirical literature on this topic, we find little evidence in favour of this hypothesis. While immigration does have a relatively modest effect on the welfare state, if anything there is some support for the view that a greater influx of immigrants has lead policy-makers to increase welfare state spending.

The Role of Measurement Error,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; TIME; PARTICIPATION; EARNINGS; MONEY,"Government policies sometimes cause unintended consequences for other potentially desirable behaviors. One such policy is the charitable tax deduction, which encourages charitable giving by allowing individuals to deduct giving from taxable income. Whether charitable giving and other desirable behaviors are complements or substitutes affect the welfare benefit of the deductioncomplements increase the benefit, while substitutes decrease the benefit. This paper focuses on the effect of the deduction on one behavior in particular: religious attendance. Using data from the Independent Sector Survey of Giving and Volunteering, I estimate a tax price elasticity for religious attendance of 0.4, which implies that charitable giving and religious attendance are complements. I resolve the difference between my estimate and a recent estimate by W. S. Gruber (2004) that implies charitable giving and religious attendance are substitutes. While Gruber imputes itemization status, an important factor in calculating tax incentives, I use survey-reported itemization status. This imputation creates a large amount of non-classical measurement error. I show that the measurement error is responsible for the disparate results: If I also impute itemization status, I obtain similar results as Gruber.","Univ St Thomas, Dept Econ, St Paul, MN 55105 USA",University of St Thomas Minnesota,"Kim, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Thomas, Dept Econ, 2115 Summit Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",,,,,,,,40,8,8,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

A quantile regression is applied to show that the rate varies little in the conditional distribution of earnings, which stands in stark contrast to findings from some developed countries. In addition, the rate of return in self-employment is estimated to be lower than that in paid employment for person- and sector-specific reasons. In addition to monetary returns to education, happiness returns to education are considered.

Focusing on India's informal labor markets leads to three findings of interest. First, gender wage discrimination is larger in informal than in formal labor markets, resulting in losses that are larger than receipts from one of the country's most important safety-net programs. Second, economic growth will not make gender discrimination in wage labor markets disappear. Finally, contrary to what is found for gender, the hypothesis of no significant wage discrimination based on caste cannot be rejected.","[Deininger, Klaus] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Jin, Songqing] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Nagarajan, Hari] Natl Council Appl Econ Res, New Delhi 110002, India",The World Bank; Michigan State University,"Jin, SQ (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Agr Hall,446 W Circle Dr,Room 211F, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kdeininger@worldbank.org; jins@msu.edu; hknagarajan@ncaer.org,"Jin, Songqing/W-4340-2019","Jin, Songqing/0000-0001-8514-7930; Deininger, Klaus/0000-0003-3198-0083",,,,,43,19,23,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

A larger leverage gap (i.e., a bigger difference between these two ratios) leads to more investment distortions. Managers with more debt-like compensation components tend to under-invest, whereas managers with larger equity-based compensation engage more in over-investment. Furthermore, investment distortion is likely to increase the equity (debt) value when compensation leverage is lower (higher) than firm leverage. These findings suggest that managers can deviate from an optimal investment policy to increase the value of their portfolio, and that a lower leverage gap can reduce agency costs.

We refer to this as the entrepreneurship returns puzzle. We run post hoc analyses to explore a number of potential explanations of this puzzle. Indirectly, our analysis indicates that the higher returns to formal education for entrepreneurs might be due to the fewer organizational constraints they face, leading to more personal control over how to use their human capital, compared to employees.","[Van Praag, Mirjam] Univ Amsterdam, ACE, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Witteloostuijn, Arjen] Tilburg Univ, Sch Econ & Management, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van der Sluis, Justin] Rabobank, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Tilburg University,"Van Praag, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, ACE, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.m.vanpraag@uva.nl,,"van Witteloostuijn, A./0000-0002-0287-5965",,,,,60,57,72,0,71,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

However, there is still uncertainty about whether technology parks are achieving their goals or not and exactly what their impact is on their tenants. This paper attempts to contribute in understanding this issue by focusing specifically on the impact of technology park services on high technology industries. A case study on one of well established technology parks in Malaysia that is Kulim Hi-Tech Park (KHTP) has been conducted. After a series of interviews with the administrator and review on literature, nine evaluation criteria were identified and used to observe the impact of technology park services on the industrial tenants of the technology park. From a survey on the industrial tenants in KHTP it is found that the technology park has all the nine evaluated criteria. However, these criteria have different categories of impact on the tenants. It can be concluded that the there are still more room to improve in ensuring the competitiveness of the technology park.

The results indicate that successful change management strategies consists of three stages: preparing to change, implementation of change, and evaluating the impact on employee. In the preparing to change phase, organizational leadership should prepare to change the organization culture and structure through watching individuals, organization and culture. Then, in the implementation of changing phase, organizations must apply the following factors: project leadership/team effectiveness factors, end-user communication factor, culture factor, end- user training/involvement factors and development factor. Finally, in measuring the impact on user phase, organizations must measure the impact of change strategy factors on the end-user. Also, organizations should pay attention to feedback in the previous three phases to modify mistakes and develop change strategy.","[Al-Otaibi, Mutlag M.] King Faisal Univ, Dept Food & Nutr Sci, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia; [Altamony, Hamzah] King Faisal Univ, Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia",King Faisal University; King Faisal University,"Al-Otaibi, MM (通讯作者)，King Faisal Univ, Dept Food & Nutr Sci, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia.",mutlag1@hotmail.com; altamony_maa@hotmail.com,,"Al-Otaibi, Mutlag/0000-0002-3986-0898",,,,,81,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,927,+,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200090,0

The expenditure of public universities building facilities maintenance are based on fund allocation from the government operating expenditure and thus, the effective way of achieving cost reduction and optimization, became necessary. Life cycle cost (LCC) approach was suggested by several government bodies in producing a better cost management in public asset management. The components of building facilities have variation of life cycle which leads to the complication of LCC. Therefore, one of the shortcomings in implementing LCC on building facilities is lack of common process and activities. The conceptual framework of activity-based life cycle cost (ABLCC) of building facilities maintenance in public universities is proposed to effectively manage the cost management of building facilities maintenance. ABLCC approach can signify the activities cost components which explain the cost of building facilities activities. As building facilities is considered as at facilities level of activity based costing (ABC), the determination of the cost activities and cost drivers is important in order to formulate the process model of ABLCC. The establishment of the process model of ABLCC can reduce the complexity of implementing LCC for effective building facilities maintenance planning.","[Ali, Hishamuddin Mohd; Thanaraju, Puvaneswary; Sipan, Ibrahim; Abdullah, Shahabudin; Sapri, Maimunah; Kamarudin, Norhaya; Baba, Maizan] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Ctr Real Estate Studies, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,,hishamuddin@utm.my; puvavaneswary.thanaraju@gmail.com; ibrahimsipan@utm.my,"Mohd Ali, Hishamuddin/C-6923-2015; Abdullah, Shahabudin/K-5669-2012","Abdullah, Shahabudin/0000-0002-6224-5754; Thanaraju, Puvaneswary/0000-0002-9881-9780",,,,,39,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1189,1202,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100128,0

We then interpret the literature on PES programs to see the extent to which transaction costs vary as predicted across the type of service and to assess the performance of PES programs. As predicted, we find that transaction costs are the least for club goods like water and greatest for pure public goods like carbon reduction.

We show that gross capital flows are very large and volatile, especially relative to net capital flows. When foreigners invest in a country, domestic agents invest abroad, and vice versa. Gross capital flows are also pro-cyclical. During expansions, foreigners invest more domestically and domestic agents invest more abroad. During crises, total gross flows collapse and there is a retrenchment in both inflows by foreigners and outflows by domestic agents. These patterns hold for different types of capital flows and crises. This evidence sheds light on the sources of fluctuations driving capital flows and helps discriminate among existing theories. Our findings seem consistent with crises affecting domestic and foreign agents asymmetrically, as would be the case under the presence of sovereign risk or asymmetric information.

The Romanian territory shelters habitats and species of national, European and world interest.The common concern of the EU member states, which is to conserve and make use of the biological diversity in a sustainable way, is to be found on two different levels. Firstly, in the environmental policies adopted at European level, in accordance with the international commitments taken on during the UN Convention on biological diversity. At the same time, this concern is visible in the national legislation and strategies adopted by each member state. Up to now, Romania has developed two strategies on the conservation of biodiversity: the first in 1996 and the second in 2000. Nevertheless, not all set objectives and targets have been reached, the decline and fading of the ecological diversity being a problem not only for Romania, but for most states. The current Romanian Strategy for the conservation of biodiversity refers to the period 2013 - 2020. It was developed within the UNDP/GEF project: Support for the confirmation of the National Strategy and Action Plan for the Conservation of Biodiversity with CBD and the realization of the Clearing House Mechanism - CHM and it is meant to be a technical and legal tool which at the same time ensures that the action plan for the conservation of biodiversity is put into practice. The proposal for the new Romanian strategy, which is currently in the stage of public debating, is of major significance, because it starts with the description of biodiversity and the importance of its conservation, the identification and analysis of direct threats on biodiversity in Romania. It also establishes the strategic objectives, and the national action plan intended to lead to the conservation of biodiversity. Last but not least, it establishes the authorities responsible for implementing it, the financial resources required and the reporting indicators.

We replicate PSE's central result and also estimate a related model that allows for the possibility of non-monotonicity in the relationship between district magnitude and representatives' deviance from referendum median voters. Our results indicate that representatives elected in low-magnitude multi-member districts deviate from canton-level majorities less than either MPs from single-member districts or those from high-magnitude multi-member districts.","[Carey, John M.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Hix, Simon] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",Dartmouth College; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Carey, JM (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",john.carey@dartmouth.edu; S.Hix@lse.ac.uk,,"Hix, Simon/0000-0002-3116-5292",,,,,28,14,15,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2013,154.0,1-2,,,,,139,148,,10.1007/s11127-012-0023-0,0.0,,,10,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,055SU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312438600008,0

This paper is focusing on innovation in controlling that is the less visible part each company's operations. Three types of innovation in the area of controlling have been defined: redefinition of controller's role, development of information technology and new approaches in planning and budgeting. Firstly the role of controller and financial professionals in general is shifting from analytical and reporting role into roles of business advisors that support the company's business. Secondly Information technology has shifted all aspects of human activity in the last decades. Controllers benefit from this development as well. Controllers are able to Enterprise resource planning system (ERP) that store big amounts of data. The innovation in this area is in linking ERP with business intelligence tools. Last area of innovation is coming from different concepts to planning and budgeting. Rigid yearly planning that does not provide efficient allocation of resources is being replaced by rolling budgeting that enables companies to be more reactive in decision making.","[Cermak, Karel] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Business Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,karel.cermak@loreal.com,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,17,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,271,278,,,,,,8,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100028,0

The North has a financial advantage to raise capital, but the South has the advantage of low wages. If the expected outsourcing cost is lower than the in-house production cost, some outsourcing to a Southern firm is optimal. However, outsourcing to an FDI firm is superior to outsourcing to a Southern firm as well as in-house production. This finding is consistent with the rising foreign direct investment in China by Northern firms. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Choi, E.

Many Third World governments maintain that colonialism established a national economic order that has ensured that development of the rural areas is directly dependent on prior development of the urban centres or metropolis. This has tended to lead to urban bias with the expectation that the benefits of the development of the urban centres will trickle down to the rural communities. Thus, development of local communities must be preceded by the development of towns and cities. In this view, development is a condition which has to be brought to and for some, by others who are presumably more enlightened than the recipients hence development professionals prescribe development interventions which are not designed and owned by local people In South Africa underdevelopment is not only colonial and historical but its also because of poor governance by the Corrupt Black Ruling Class(CBRC) after independence from the apartheid regime.This class,the CBRC, has not changed any administrative structures it inherited from the colonial past but instead it perpetuates the existence of these structures without even changing the values and norms from the colonial ones to the globally- democratic ones. There is a need to change the local government values of development as postulated by the New Greater Local Government Philosophy(NGLGP).Third World governments also took cognizant of the fact that post-independence development emphasis,was on the provision of infrastructure perhaps because its provision represented the most visible form of development but also because it was expected to stimulate growth in other sectors of the economy. Current emphasis is shifting away from providing infrastructure towards productive activities. The paper uses Botswana and South Africa to substantiate its arguments.","[Dipholo, Kenneth B.] Univ Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana; [Gumede, Nyawo] TUT South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Botswana,,dipholok@mopipi.ub.bw; gumedenb@tut.ac.za,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1668,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500166,0
