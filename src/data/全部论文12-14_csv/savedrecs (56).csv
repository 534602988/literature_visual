The effects of bank size on SME lending are also examined. The behavior of cutting lending during the recession is referred to as furling the umbrella on rainy days. The behavior is found for FOBs during the last recession (covering the subprime crisis) but not for GOBs and POBs. On the contrary, GOBs even significantly increased SME lending during the crisis period. Finally, large banks make more SME loans than do small banks in both tranquil and crisis times in this study.","[Shen, Chung-Hua] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chu, Haumin] Natl Chengchi Univ, Coll Commerce, Dept Money & Banking, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Chengchi University,"Shen, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan.",chshen01@ntu.edu.tw; hmchu@nccu.edu.tw; allan.ycwang@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,11,11,0,44,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The ever increasing number of sector-specific standards developed by businesses, in particular in the food market, may have significant implications for developing countries in terms of market access. Some countries see private food standards as a particular form of non-tariff barriers. The World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with non-tariff barriers in the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) and in the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). This paper examines to what extent these agreements cover private standards, as they were originally intended to regulate standard-setting by public authorities. We find that there is an important difference between the SPS Agreement and the TBT Agreement in that the drafters of the latter realized the importance of the private sector in standard-setting. Finally, we discuss whether a 'Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards', similar to that under the TBT Agreement, could be adopted under the SPS Agreement.","[Wouters, Jan; Geraets, Dylan] Leuven Univ, Leuven Ctr Global Governance Studies, Louvain, Belgium; [Wouters, Jan; Geraets, Dylan] Leuven Univ, Inst Int Law, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Wouters, J (通讯作者)，Leuven Univ, Leuven Ctr Global Governance Studies, Louvain, Belgium.",jan.wouters@law.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,31,25,27,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2012,11.0,3,,,,,479,489,,10.1017/S1474745612000237,0.0,,,11,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,984TR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307215500009,0

Despite such difficulties, there were only few attempts to effectively employ such actions and several legal arrangements to refine the rules for third country AD actions.

This study explored attitudes of visitor segments towards visitor and environmental management in the Gesaeuse National Park, Austria. The segmentation was based on the degree of visitor affinity to the national park. On-site, face-to-face interviews of 405 visitors were conducted in the national park during the summer and autumn of 2008. Three segments were formed based on their national-park affinity. Two-thirds of the visitors had a low affinity. The proportion of visitors with a low national-park affinity was comparable to other European national parks. The respondents with a low affinity had more negative attitudes towards nature conservation, natural processes, visitor management and the regional economic impact of the Gesaeuse National Park The study results support national park management in the development of tourism marketing strategies and public awareness campaigns targeted on visitor segments.

Comparative analysis of health service cost for patients prescribed antipsychotic polypharmacy versus antipsychotic monotherapy. Resource utilisation and costs were described using central Danish registers for a 2 year period (2007-2008). We included patients attached to one of two Danish psychiatric referral centres in 1 January 2008 and/or 1 January 2009. Their prescribed treatment with either antipsychotic polypharmacy or monotherapy at the two cross-sectional dates was recorded and used as proxy of polypharmacy exposure during the preceding year. A multivariate generalised linear model was fitted with total costs of primary and secondary health service use as dependent variable, and antipsychotic polypharmacy, diagnosis, age, gender, disease duration, psychiatric inpatient admissions, and treatment site as covariates. The sample consisted of 736 outpatients with a diagnosis in the schizophrenia spectrum. Antipsychotic polypharmacy was associated with significantly higher total health service costs compared with monotherapy (2007: 25% higher costs; 2008: 17% higher costs) when adjusting for potential confounders and risk factors. A subgroup analysis suggested that the excessive costs associated with antipsychotic polypharmacy were partly accounted for by the functional level of the patients. The results demonstrate that antipsychotic co-prescribing is associated with increased use of health care services, even though no causal relations can be inferred from an observational study.","[Baandrup, Lone; Lublin, Henrik; Glenthoj, Birte] Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Ctr Neuropsychiat Schizophrenia Res, Mental Hlth Serv Capital Reg Denmark, DK-2600 Glostrup, Denmark; [Sorensen, Jan] Univ So Denmark, Ctr Appl Hlth Serv Res & Technol Assessment, Odense, Denmark; [Nordentoft, Merete] Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Mental Hlth Serv Capital Reg Denmark, Copenhagen NV, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Southern Denmark; University of Copenhagen,"Baandrup, L (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Ctr Neuropsychiat Schizophrenia Res, Mental Hlth Serv Capital Reg Denmark, Nordre Ringvej 29-67, DK-2600 Glostrup, Denmark.",lone.baandrup@regionh.dk,"Glenthøj, Birte Y/G-3391-2012; Sorensen, Jan/AAN-3738-2020; Baandrup, Lone/D-6578-2015; Nordentoft, Merete/AAH-3253-2019","Sorensen, Jan/0000-0003-0857-9267; Baandrup, Lone/0000-0003-1662-2720; Glenthoj, Birte/0000-0003-3056-7262; Nordentoft, Merete/0000-0003-4895-7023",,,,,35,27,27,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Futures studies often deal with great societal or strategic business issues, and thus the validity and reliability of the results is of great interest to stakeholders. Existing literature contains discussions of such important issues as ethics of futures studies, the nature of knowledge about the future, and futures methodology, which together contribute to the quality, validity and credibility of futures studies, but discussion on the evaluation of futures studies is more scant. Thus, the main research question that guides our study is: how should we evaluate futures studies to ensure the reliability and credibility of the results? We answer the question by deriving a systemic framework for evaluation following the input-process-output schema to ensure that the whole chain from the data to reporting and implementation contributes to the quality and impact of the study. The main contribution is the systemic evaluation framework. The framework will contribute to the evaluation of existing and ongoing studies by offering guidelines for evaluation, and as a net effect, we propose, it will increase the impact of futures studies by making the practices more transparent and thus generating more confidence in the results.

Envisioning is seen as a powerful tool in the delivery of education for sustainable development, for it seeks to engage people in imagining and creating a better future. However, drawing on work undertaken with undergraduate students at the University of Glamorgan, South Wales, we argue that envisioning relies upon 'absent fear': it works to suppress, or make absent, fear as a valid response to present and future development. The presence of 'absent fear', we suggest, poses a barrier to fully engaging with the challenges and opportunities of a sustainable future, for it is difficult to conceive of a positive vision without first acknowledging and confronting our fears. It is in articulating fear, we observe, that people are more able to respond to the challenges of the future in hopeful and creative ways. Utilising work undertaken with our students this paper revisits envisioning and suggests the need to understand envisioning as a broader process of reflection and action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

DU is controversial, both due to the conditions through which it is justified and due to its consequences for climate policies, where the discounting of future utility gains from present abatement efforts makes it harder for such measures to justify their present costs. In this paper, we propose sustainable discounted utilitarianism (SDU) as an alternative principle for evaluation of climate policy. Unlike undiscounted utilitarianism, which always assigns zero relative weight to present utility, SDU is an axiomatically based criterion, which departs from DU by assigning zero weight to present utility if and only if the present is better off than the future. Using the DICE integrated assessment model to run risk analysis, we show that it is possible for the future to be worse off than the present along a 'business as usual' development path. Consequently SDU and DU differ, and willingness to pay for emissions reductions is (sometimes significantly) higher under SDU than under DU. Under SDU, stringent schedules of emissions reductions increase social welfare, even for a relatively high utility discount rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

From the astrologers of antiquity to the climate specialists of today, all have attempted to make predictions about future events. These attempts include assessments of whether or not these outcomes are probable or possible, desirable or undesirable. This paper concentrates on describing a methodology for the development and analysis of scenarios by refining and expanding existing methods. The approach is called Backcasting and was conceptually developed to support sustainable decisions in the energy sector. Backcasting works backwards from the envisioned future goals to the present, setting milestones to achieve the desired objective. These milestones are small interim scenarios along the way between the future scenario, usually 20-50 years ahead, and the present situation. Our Backcasting methodology is implemented in a modelling environment based on Geoinformation-System (GIS-based) using the scripting language Python. The methodology is demonstrated for an example of urban sprawl in rural areas, which often results in high infrastructure costs, large commuting distances and long travel times. To act against environmental degradation of rural areas, sustainable planning has to be the overarching goal [5], and will be supported with the developed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The following theories and associated theoretical frameworks are discussed in the article: (1) Environmental Scanning Model, (2) Nonaka's Knowledge Management Theory, (3) Gammelgaard's and Ritter's Knowledge Retrieval Matrix, (4) Boisot's Information Space Model and (5) Vejlgaard's Diamond Shaped Trend Model. These various and nevertheless complementary perspectives are important for the further development of weak signal analysis, knowledge management theory and knowledge management practices in modern organisations as well as for anticipation and decision-making in policy-making arenas. There are still many theoretical and empirical challenges in these fields of scientific knowledge. A general conclusion is that all these frameworks provide interesting new perspectives for modern futures studies as such. Another conclusion is that there are various knowledge management (KM) and scanning frameworks available for implementing weak signal analysis. However, this paper, its observations and conclusions also imply that a more generalised approach to weak signal analysis needs to be developed and that modern KM theories should be used when developing new futures studies/foresight methodologies.

Methods A Markov decision-tree model was constructed from clinical trials results. Patients starting etanercept, adalimumab, or non-systemic therapy moved through the model's 10-years horizon. Model input parameters included clinical response rates. Outcome measures included direct and indirect costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results The incremental total (direct and indirect) costs per QALY were 1,559,939 kr ((sic)165,354) for adalimumab 40 mg every other week, compared with intermittent once-weekly Enbrel 50 mg, and 93,629 kr ((sic)9,925) for once-weekly intermittent etanercept 50 mg compared with non-systemic standard of care. Conclusions This analysis showed that, with a 470,000 kr ((sic)50,000) per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, once-weekly etanercept 50 mg, used intermittently, is a cost-effective treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis compared with adalimumab and non-systemic standard of care.","[Knight, Christopher] RTI Hlth Solut, Veloc House Business & Conf Ctr, Sheffield S1 4DE, S Yorkshire, England; [Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Ekelund, Mats] Pfizer Inc, Solna, Sweden; [Singh, Amitabh; Yang, Shiyi; Boggs, Robert] Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA",Research Triangle Institute; Research Triangle Institute; Pfizer; Pfizer,"Knight, C (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, Veloc House Business & Conf Ctr, 3 Solly St, Sheffield S1 4DE, S Yorkshire, England.",cknight@rti.org,,"Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548; Knight, Christopher/0000-0001-6428-0505",,,,,43,15,15,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The purpose of this paper is to study whether income motivation exists regarding the use of laboratory services in general practice, and if so, the degree of income motivation among general practitioners (GPs) in Norway. We argue that the degree of income motivation is stronger when the physicians are uncertain about the utility of the laboratory service in question. We have panel data from actual physician-patient encounters in general practices in the years 2001-2004 and use discrete choice analysis and random effects models. Estimation results show that an increase in the fees will lead to a small but significant increase in use. The reform led to minor changes in the use of laboratory analyses in GPs' offices, and we argue that financial incentives were diluted because they were in conflict with medical recommendations and existing medical practice. The patient's age has the most influence and the results support the hypothesis that the impact of income increases with increasing uncertainty about diagnosis and treatment. The policy implication of our results is that financial incentives alone are not an effective tool for influencing the use of laboratory services in GPs' offices.","Norwegian Med Assoc, NOKLUS, HERO, N-0107 Oslo, Norway",,"Munkerud, SF (通讯作者)，Norwegian Med Assoc, NOKLUS, HERO, POB 1152, N-0107 Oslo, Norway.",siri.munkerud@legeforeningen.no,,,,,,,42,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Since Long 113], the conventional wisdom has been that ownership risk induces a firm to overuse the stock of a resource. However, the empirical evidence is mixed. In particular, Bohn and Deacon [I] find that weak property rights have an ambiguous effect on present extraction. We provide a theoretical model supporting these mixed observations in a common-pool resource environment. We show that if ownership risk includes a risk of expropriation in which the identities of the excluded firms are unknown ex ante, then the present extraction of all firms may decrease along with a higher risk of expropriation. The elasticity of demand for the resource is key in explaining the effect of ownership risk on present extraction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate whether these tuition fees influence the mobility of university applicants. Based on administrative data of applicants for medical schools in Germany, we estimate the effect of tuition fees on the probability of applying for a university in the home state. We find a small but significant reaction: The probability of applying for a university in the home state falls by 2 percentage points (baseline: 69%) for high-school graduates who come from a state with tuition fees. Moreover, we find that students with better high-school grades react more strongly to tuition fees. This might have important effects on the composition of students across states.

Organisational support involves the provision of valued financial benefits along with employees' perceptions of support from supervisors and co-workers, and procedural fairness in decision-making. We found strong evidence that high levels of organisational support lead to employee reciprocity via increased affective commitment and job satisfaction and reduced turnover intentions. We also found evidence, albeit weaker, of a positive relationship between economic exchange and continuance commitment, where employees may be dissatisfied but stay because they have too much invested in firm specific knowledge and skills. The firm provided above average compensation and benefits and with limited alternative job opportunities in the formal economy in Sri Lanka the costs of leaving the organisation are likely to have outweighed the costs of staying.","[O'Donnell, Michael] Univ New S Wales, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Jayawardana, Ananda K.

I concentrate on the assistance given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries and use a post Keynesian approach to explain that, despite the rhetoric, industries and firms will not move offshore under a carbon price and industry assistance is unnecessary. When assistance is given, profits are protected and could increase in certain industries, which occurred in the comparable European emissions trading scheme. In orthodox economic theory, despite this negligible impact on profits, any method of pricing carbon causes a reduction in emissions because firms seek to adjust technology and factor inputs at the margin and abate until marginal abatement costs equal the carbon price. However, from a post Keynesian perspective, the government's prediction of a transformed economy and clean energy future will not occur unless the carbon pricing policy reduces the corporate profits of emitting firms. Thus, complementary policies are required to take the burden of reducing emissions off the more symbolic carbon market established. I further argue that a carbon tax without any industry assistance is a preferred approach and that where plant shutdown does occur, carbon emissions around the world will fall and workers could be compensated at afar smaller cost than the adjustment assistance given to industries in the policy's current form.","Univ Western Sydney, Sch Econ & Finance, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Perry, N (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Sch Econ & Finance, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia.",neil.perry@uws.edu.au,,"Perry, Neil/0000-0001-7964-333X",,,,,34,3,3,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The market performance of Romanian companies follows their financial performance and was also fluctuating, no company being able to offer investors constantly good risk-adjusted returns.

To this end, drawing on institutional theory and the institutionalist arguments of the comparative capitalism literature, we identify the mechanism by which national institutional arrangements influence CSR. We do this by (a) separating CSR from corporate governance, and identifying corporate governance as the missing link between the broader institutional arrangements that govern finance and labour and CSR, and (b) using the concept of institutional complementarity (a process of mutual reinforcement that enhances the value of both institutions) to specify the nature of the relationship between corporate governance and CSR. We refer to three models of capitalism-liberal market economies (LMEs, e. g. the USA and the UK), coordinated market economies (CMEs, e. g. Germany and Japan) and state-led market economies (SLMEs, e. g. France and South Korea)-as empirical sites for exploration of these ideas. We argue that CSR complements corporate governance systems by a logic of similarity (a link based on similar properties) and that, as change in the broader institutional arrangements and corporate governance occurs, CSR reflects and facilities this change.","[Kang, Nahee] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Moon, Jeremy] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Int Ctr Corp Social Responsibil, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Manchester; University of Nottingham,"Kang, N (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Manchester, Lancs, England.",nahee.kang@manchester.ac.uk,,"Moon, Jeremy/0000-0002-0848-6274; Kang, Nahee/0000-0003-3325-2741",,,,,96,148,158,4,125,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

From a theoretical viewpoint, corruption that is, paying bribes to corrupt government bureaucrats to get favors such as permits, investment licenses, tax assessments, and police protection is generally viewed as an additional cost of doing business or a tax on profits. As a result, corruption can be expected to decrease the expected profitability of investment projects. Investors will therefore take the level of corruption in a host country into account in making decisions to invest abroad. The empirical literature on the effects of the host country's corruption level on FDI inflows, however, has not found the commonly expected effects. Some empirical studies provide evidence of a negative link between corruption and FDI inflows, while others fail to find any significant relationship. The main objective of this paper is determining the relationship between FDI inflows and a country's level of corruption using the FDI inflows of the 20 least-corrupt and the 20 most-corrupt countries.","[Raluca, Danciu Aniela; Alecsandru, Strat Vasile] Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,anielaco@hotmail.com; strat_vasile@yahoo.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,745,753,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549800072,0

In positive psychology Csikszentmihalyi has found out that a large part of happiness is achieved by voluntary activities - half of which is determined by flow. Csikszentmihalyi studied people's inner states while pursuing activities that appear to contain intrinsic rewards such as dance, sports, chess, and music. He highlighted a common experience of flow state which is merging action and awareness of joy through total immersion in an activity that is challenging yet closely matched to one's skills. Games are considered as the best inducers of flow. While such a mental state is highly correlated with subjective well-being, it also enhances concentration, perception, learning capacity and self-esteem of players (1991). Prior empirical research and literature, have employed various theoretical frameworks including state of flow; however, they have often demonstrated the negative consequences such as addiction of such games through flow or employed experiential sampling. I have looked into a few examples from commercial online games of an emergent economy as an exploratory research with the help of senior advertising students. As representatives of generation Y, students are more interested in online games including advergames as well as social media; therefore, using convenience and snowball sampling is adequate for choosing the online advergames. Comparing these games with respect to the criteria of the Flow Model is sufficient in explaining the main aspects; however, experimental research with control groups might be more appropriate to understand the nature flow in future studies.","[Yuksel, Muberra] Kadir Has Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Kadir Has University,,muberray@khas.edu.tr,,,,,,,29,0,0,22,63,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,1907,1915,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801070,0

Since the effects of mergers have not been systematically evaluated, the purpose of this article is to contribute to this area of knowledge by assessing potential economies of scale to explore and compare these results with realized cost savings after mergers. Considering the period 2003-2009, we estimate the translog cost function to examine economies of scale in the years preceding restructuring. Additionally, we use the difference-in-differences approach to evaluate hospital centres (HC) that occurred between 2004 and 2007, comparing the years after and before mergers. Our findings suggest that economies of scale are present in the pre-merger configuration with an optimum hospital size of around 230 beds. However, the mergers between two or more hospitals led to statistically significant post-merger cost increases, of about 8 %. This result indicates that some HC become too large to explore economies of scale and suggests the difficulty of achieving efficiencies through combining operations and service specialization.","[Azevedo, Helda; Mateus, Ceu] Univ Nova Lisboa, Escola Nacl Saude Publ, P-1600560 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Azevedo, H (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Escola Nacl Saude Publ, Ave Padre Cruz, P-1600560 Lisbon, Portugal.",h.azevedo@ensp.unl.pt,"Mateus, Ceu/AAC-8146-2021; Mateus, Ceu/J-2554-2012","Mateus, Ceu/0000-0001-6219-219X; Mateus, Ceu/0000-0001-6219-219X",,,,,45,22,27,1,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Scenarios for Catalan self-determination,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Secession; Independence; National identity; Spain; Catalonia; Europe,,"Historically, the political structure of Spain has been a source of conflict: peripheral regions as Catalonia and the Basque country have questioned the centralized power of the state and have claimed a higher level of decentralization in view of their distinct history, cultural identity and language. Recently, political and social discontent has escalated in Catalonia, leading to the unilateral announcement of a Catalan self-determination referendum for November 2014. Regardless of political or ethical preferences, it will be necessary to foresee the consequences of this process for Catalonia, Spain and elsewhere. A scenario approach focuses on possible outcomes of the current debate rather than on the arguments put forward in the controversy. Those in favour of Catalan independence have depicted a future for their country with a booming economy that will situate it at currently unattainable levels of prosperity. Opponents of secession argue that Catalonia will become a failed state. These future visions of an independent Catalonia can be described as scenarios, the underlying assumptions and plausibility of which can be analysed. EU membership and the effect of borders on international trade are identified as key variables. The alternative scenarios will also be crucial to evaluate the broader impact of a new state in Europe.

This is statistically confirmed by the following determinants analysis of governance efficiency at the second stage.

We use a unique panel data set from Texas that allows us to examine in detail the paths that students take toward a bachelor's degree and estimate how enrollment in multiple institutions is related to both degree completion and subsequent earnings. We show that the paths to a bachelor's degree are diverse and that earnings and BA receipt vary systematically with these paths.

Since the onset of the great recession and the Eurozone crisis, social pacts have been conspicuous by their absence. Why have unions not been invited into government buildings to negotiate paths of economic adjustment in the countries hardest hit by the crisis? Drawing on empirical experiences from Ireland and Italy-two cases on which much of the social pact literature concentrated-this article attributes the exclusion of unions to their declining legitimacy. Unions in the new European periphery have lost the capacity either to threaten governments with the stick of protest or to seduce policymakers with the carrot of problem-solving.

The STAR-induced tax rate increases offset about one third of the initial STAR tax savings and boosted property taxes for business property.

While relatively easy to develop and solve, problems based on quadratic cost functions are too simple to address a number of important issues, such as the use of second-order conditions and the short-run shutdown condition. Problems based on cubic cost functions are mathematically richer but often involve messy arithmetic; furthermore, many are not plausible representations of a firm's costs. Finding cubic functions that do not suffer from these drawbacks can be a time-consuming process. The author addresses this issue by providing a procedure to generate profit maximization problems that are theoretically interesting, economically plausible, and computationally simple.","Union Coll, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",Union College,"Davis, L (通讯作者)，Union Coll, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA.",davisl@union.edu,,,,,,,8,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

We investigate how decisions about the export product mix are associated with aggregate export dynamics and productivity of firms. We use detailed data on product and export market levels for the full population of Estonia's firms. Decomposition analysis of trade flows shows that both the relative importance of firms' beginning to export products and the role of product-level churning (firms' adding and dropping of products) in total Estonian export growth increases significantly after accession to the European Union in 2004. We show that concentration on core competence products has a rather different association with productivity of firms in different-size groups. Large firms with a large number of different types of export products gain, on average, in terms of productivity from concentrating their export sales on their core export products. There is no such general regularity in the case of small firms.","[Masso, Jaan; Vahter, Priit] Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Masso, J (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tartu, Estonia.",jaan.masso@mtk.ut.ee; priit.vahter@ut.ee,,"Masso, Jaan/0000-0002-0466-4942",,,,,30,7,7,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We simulate treatment costs from the payer's perspective, hospitalization, the probability to be prescribed co-medication, and treatment discontinuation over a 2-year time horizon. Model inputs were derived from 935 patients hospitalized with schizophrenia between 2005 and 2008 who received either LAI-RIS or LAI-FLX for at least 1 month. After 2 years, 89.4 % (95.8 %) of patients who were initiated on LAI-RIS (LAI-FLX) discontinued the initial regimen. The number of days spent in hospital per month and patient was slightly lower with LAI-RIS (1.08 vs. 1.28 days, p < 0.001). The proportion of patients receiving side-effect co-medication was lower with LAI-RIS (8.3 vs. 15.0 % per month, p < 0.001). Mean total costs of treatment per patient and month were 1,015 a,not sign under LAI-RIS and 395 a,not sign under LAI-FLX, resulting in an ICER of 3,088 a,not sign (95 % CI [-913 a,not sign; 3,551 a,not sign]) for an avoided hospital day per patient and month in the base case scenario with a 15.1 % probability of LAI-FLX being the dominant treatment strategy. Cost differences were mainly attributable to the higher drug costs of LAI-RIS. The effectiveness of LAI-RIS in preventing hospital days appears to be similar to LAI-FLX, with a slight superiority in side-effect and switching rates. This comes at the cost of substantially higher treatment expenses. From a decision-maker's point of view, the use of health insurance data as a source of input for decision models appears to be a reasonable alternative to models driven by clinical data only.","[Frey, Simon; Stargardt, Tom] Univ Hamburg, HCHE, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Linder, Roland] Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care WINEG, Hamburg, Germany; [Juckel, Georg] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Prevent Med, Bochum, Germany",University of Hamburg; Ruhr University Bochum,"Frey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, HCHE, Esplande 36, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",simon.frey@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,"Frey, Simon/0000-0002-0807-4683",,,,,78,9,10,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We then use a unique dataset of fisheries from three countries to examine empirically how differences in property rights affect market outcomes.

The model is parameterized with US data and includes key externalities in the energy/transportation sectors and possible underinvestment in energy efficiency due to misperceptions over energy savings. Even with large misperceptions, the extra welfare gains from complementing efficient pricing policies with energy efficiency standards are zero for reducing gasoline and 5 percent for reducing electricity. And when viewed as substitutes, these standards forgo 60 percent or more of the potential welfare gains from corresponding pricing policies. A combination of energy efficiency and emissions standards is more than three times as costly as carbon pricing when there is no misperception over energy savings, and even with large misperceptions, combining carbon pricing with gasoline/electricity taxes is better than combining it with energy efficiency standards.

It is also on a steep path of ecological unsustainability. These issues can at least partly be attributed to a fundamentally flawed model of development, its flaws having been accentuated in the last two decades of economic globalisation. At the same time, however, peoples' initiatives at sustainable and equitable well-being in various sectors are growing, and some policy shifts have also taken place in this direction. Building on this, an alternative framework of well-being, here called Radical Ecological Democracy, can be envisaged. This involves a new political governance with decentralised decision-making embedded within larger, ecologically and culturally defined landscapes, a new economics that respects ecological limits and democratises both production and consumption, and a new cultural and knowledge-based society that values diversity, collective synergism, and public innovation. The combination of peoples' resistance to destructive development and alternative, solution-based initiatives, with support from other sections of society, can lead India to be firmly on the path of such a framework by 2100.

The future of Indian IT-BP industry depends on three key factors - availability of quality manpower, capability of Indian industry to move up the value chain from customized development and maintenance services to innovation, R&D and product development, and the growth in domestic IT consumption in order to reduce dependence on export markets.

The two above-mentioned components, as well as the political and social spheres - integral parts of the notion - are to be found in the curriculum a Geography graduate has to explore. But how do we manage to establish the valences of the notion?! Should we conceptualize it according to a geographical perspective?! Should we prioritize the view that it constitutes a positive character in the equation of environment degradation?! An introspective approach to the most important applications of the notion, according to a geographical perspective that focuses on the interaction among geospheres may indicate whether intergenerational equity is real and whether thinking globally and acting locally is the best solution for the preservation of both environment and human race.

We use a rich and detailed data set of firm characteristics to identify a positive relationship between liquidity and stock returns. This contradicts the negative correlation typically found in stock returns in developed markets. Our results support the proposition that when a market is not fully integrated with the global economy, a lack of liquidity will be a less important risk factor.

This paper analyses the main factors behind in-work poverty in Romania, between 2007 and 2011, aiming to identify some possible measure that need to be taken so that in-work poverty decreases. The results highlight that working poverty din Romania, ismainly determinedby employment vulnerability and precarity. The existence of an inefficient employment structure, characterised by high employment in agriculture, high share of self-employment (aespecially own-account workers and contributing family workers), low labour productivity, low level of the employed population with tertiary education, contributes to an increase in employment vulnerability in Romania, with a negative impact on working poverty. Moreover, low wages generated by an extremely reduced labour productivity; represent an important channel of in-work poverty in Romania. Nevertheless, the results confirm those personal characteristics, job characteristics and the household context determine the extent to which the population is affected by in-work poverty. Therefore, adopting some active policies is required in order to make the transition of employment from poverty to welfare. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Most studies build upon the theoretical framework proposed by Becker (1965) by using a combination of revealed and stated preference data to estimate a value of time which is uniform in all activities and under all circumstances. This restriction is relaxed by DeSerpa's (1971) model which allows the value of saving time to be activity-specific. We present the first analysis which uses actual driving choices between open access and toll roads to estimate a VTT specific for recreation trips, thereby providing a value which conforms to both Becker's and DeSerpa's theoretical models. Using these findings we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to identify generalizable results for subsequent valuation studies. Our results indicate that 3/4 of the wage rate provides a reasonable approximation of the average VTT for recreation trips, while the commonly implemented assumption of 1/3 of the wage rate generates downward biased results.

The authors developed two types of questionnaires, one for teachers and the other for students in order to investigate the perception about creativity at the University. Namely, the idea that higher education has key role in development of knowledge-based society and economy, has been in the very heart of Bologna process implementing at the University of Mostar since 2005. Today's society is characterised by rapid and complex change processes encompassing all spheres of life. Creativity has been identified both as a key factor for adequate addressing the challenges caused by these changes as well as a major driving force towards knowledge creation and social and economic advancement through the development of a knowledge society. But, the complex questions of knowledge-based society and economy could not be solved without creative, forward-looking individuals and groups who are not afraid to question established ideas and who are able to cope with the insecurity and uncertainty this entails. If today's universities, including University of Mostar, would not succeed in strengthening creativity of teaching process and education of their teachers and students, development of knowledge society could be at stake.

However, one of its limitations is in the measurement and evaluation of prioritization of the SWOT elements. The purpose of this paper is to present a quantified SWOT analytical methodology to evaluate multiple alternatives simultaneously, in which a converted SWOT hierarchy is first used to provide the basic frame to perform analyses of decision situations. Next, a multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method with nonhomogeneous preference information is developed to assist in carrying out SWOT more analytically and in elaborating the results of the analyses. Finally, the derived decision results are holistically compared and analyzed in SWOT matrix. In this MCGDM method, the priorities of SWOT elements are derived from nonhomogeneous preference information (NPI), such as preference ordering, utility function, multiplicative preference relations, and fuzzy preference relations. The uniform and aggregation of the nonhomogeneous preference information as well as the derivation of the priorities are investigated. Finally, an example is shown to highlight the procedure of the proposed method at the end of this paper.","[Peng, Ding-Hong; Wang, Tie-Dan] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Qual Dev, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Gao, Chang-Yuan] Harbin Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Harbin, Peoples R China",Kunming University of Science & Technology; Harbin University of Science & Technology,"Peng, DH (通讯作者)，Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Qual Dev, Kunming, Peoples R China.",pengdinghong2009@163.com; wangtd2000@163.com; Gaocy2000@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Funds of China [61364016]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M550473]; scientific Research Fund Project of Educational Commission of Yunnan Province, China [2013Y336]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Yunnan Province, China [2013SY12]","National Natural Science Funds of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); scientific Research Fund Project of Educational Commission of Yunnan Province, China; Science and Technology Planning Project of Yunnan Province, China","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Funds of China (no. 61364016), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (no. 2014M550473), the scientific Research Fund Project of Educational Commission of Yunnan Province, China (no. 2013Y336), and the Science and Technology Planning Project of Yunnan Province, China (no. 2013SY12).",,30,2,2,0,27,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Globally, there is a favorable attitude of their expansion, manifested by supporting innovation in ICTs, but also stimulating consumption, due to the favorable economic impact. They have clearly contributed to both economic evolutions of developed countries and to obtain significant performance, often unexpected, in emerging ones. In terms of the environment, ICTs are both friends and enemies. Concerns in this direction led national and international organizations to promote the concept of green ICTs. This aims to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of ICTs by minimizing or eliminating their negative effects on the environment.

By empirically tracing an insurance applicant's risk trajectory, it analyses how calculative devices perform insurance underwriting through acting on insurance risk decisions. This allows one to document what calculative devices exactly do, and to point out the political effects of what they do. First, it highlights the fact that, contrary to thinking in terms of 'the insurance logic', there are multiple ways of calcuting life insurance risks. Second, it underscores the crucial role of calculative devices in that process by demonstrating how they align considerations as divergent as economics and medicine to perform a life insurance market. It then demonstrates the political effects of these calculative devices by making explicit how the latter contribute to the production of inequalities in calculative power in life insurance. In this way, the article links up insights from the performativity approach in the sociology of markets with the broader question of governing economic life. Such an approach, it is argued, provides the opportunity to open up the organization of economic markets and to put classic questions of justice and power struggles in economic markets on the agenda again.","[Van Hoyweghen, Ine] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Sociol Res CeSO, Pk Str 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Van Hoyweghen, I (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Sociol Res CeSO, Pk Str 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",ine.vanhoyweghen@soc.kuleuven.be,"Van Hoyweghen, Ine/ABC-8853-2020","Van Hoyweghen, Ine/0000-0002-9402-2918",Dutch Science Foundation (NWO); CSG Centre for Society and the Life Sciences,Dutch Science Foundation (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); CSG Centre for Society and the Life Sciences,"I am grateful to Michel Callon, Klasien Horstman, Turo-Kimmo Lehtonen, Liz Mcfall, Martha Poon and Gerard de Vries for their insightful feedback on previous drafts of this manuscript.

Many diverse actions have been proposed in the context of degrowth. To the outsider the debate might seem somewhat unfocussed. This article reveals the links and complementarities between emblematic degrowth proposals, and provides a toolkit for developing a more coherent picture on how overdeveloped societies may make a transition to more frugal and convivial futures. We use the method of Causal Loop Diagramming in a collaborative setting involving researchers and activists engaged with degrowth issues. First we derive collaboratively the dominant feedback processes in the current social, ecological and economic systems and we identify leverage points for systemic interventions to facilitate degrowth. By explicitly representing the main causal chains of effects it is possible to reveal insights on the consequences of a given proposal and explore what-if? questions and future pathways. In addition we construct a compatibility matrix to identify the possible synergies between emblematic degrowth proposals. The results from these two exercises are integrated to provide plausible pathways for the implementation of degrowth policies, with a systemic identification of risks, uncertainties and leverage points of intervention. Participatory systems thinking tools have much to offer in envisioning contractional, macro-pathways towards sustainability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Many results from these experiments oppose the notion that letter recognition occurs independently from visual analysis. It is believed that, in skilled readers, letter identification is an automatic process that does not require feature analysis. However, most of the research in the priming effect and abstract representations of letters has been conducted with adults and native speakers. This means that the variations of representations of the letter have already established; therefore, visual information of letterforms may not be required in letter identification. For young children or second language learners, whose abstract representations of letters has not been fully developed, readers may still need visual information as a reference in learning other alphabets. Moreover, the complexity of type forms may be another cause that prevents readers from reaching an abstract level of recognition. One of the explanations is that the difficulty of letterforms in some languages may interrupt the recognition process; therefore, skilled readers still rely on letter shape.","Univ Huddersfield Queensgate, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England",University of Huddersfield,"Virunhaphol, F (通讯作者)，Univ Huddersfield Queensgate, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.",u1272467@hud.ac.uk,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-9311-1,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2014,31.0,,,,,,132,135,,,,,,4,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC8FB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000355588400024,0

The group decision makers are partitioned into three sets: the officials from government, the experts in water resource management, the users of water resources. There exists a prioritization relationship over the different sets of decision makers. In order to aggregate a collective preference based on the aggregation of different individual preferences, we suggest that prioritization between decision makers can modeled by making the weights associated with a decision maker dependent upon the satisfaction of the higher priority decision maker. Then, a so-called prioritized weighted aggregation operator based on ordered weighted averaging (OWA) is utilized to aggregate the preference values provided by different decision makers. Finally, an application in water resource management is provided to illustrate the usefulness and how the prioritized aggregation works in practice.","[Wang, Huimin; Xu, Yejun] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Merigo, Joso M.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Business Adm, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",Hohai University; University of Barcelona,"Xu, YJ (通讯作者)，Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hmwang@hhu.edu.cn; xuyejohn@163.com; jmerigo@ub.edu,"wang, huimin/HDM-8421-2022; WANG, HUIYUAN/IXX-2427-2023; Merigó, José M./K-1500-2019; wang, hui/GRS-4730-2022","Merigó, José M./0000-0002-4672-6961; Xu, Yejun/0000-0003-3213-3484",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71101043],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grants 71101043.,,26,9,9,0,24,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

If 50-100 years ago horses were mainly kept in rural farms and used for transportation, agriculture and forestry, and the main product of the equine sector was the horse itself, then, currently the equine sector has changed to become a sector that provides mostly services - trail rides, riding lessons, horse boarding, and recreation. The horse, which traditionally has been a core product, remains only as one component of the equine sector. Contemporary, challenges related with animal welfare, environmental issues, horse and service quality, safety issues, economic performance, and financial support available for equine businesses as well as new trends in customer needs require equine entrepreneurs both the ability to adapt to rapid changes and innovative solutions. These issues were investigated during the INNTEREG IV project Equine Industries Promoting Economically Competitive and Innovative Regions (INNOEQUINE) from 2011 to 2013. This article highlights the current structure of the equine sector, presents statistical data analysis and the results of three focus group discussions regarding the challenges and possible solutions for advancement of the equine sector and its performance in Latvia. The authors conclude that, even though, the number of horses is decreasing, the equine sector shows a development potential for the future that should be promoted with an innovative and entrepreneurial approach for developing and marketing new services within the sector.","[Zeverte-Rivza, Sandija; Paula, Liga] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,,"Paula, Liga/AAS-1803-2020; Zeverte-Rivza, Sandija/GLV-3922-2022","Paula, Liga/0000-0002-1718-4446; Zeverte-Rivza, Sandija/0000-0002-1973-6128",,,,,10,3,3,0,4,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-2-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,35,,,,,246,254,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347133500027,0

It evaluates whether the current regulatory framework in the four countries facilitates or impedes the operation of a CSW and concludes that the diverse electronic signature laws and regulations in the four countries do, in fact, impede the CSW's implementation.

Although education and health promotion are complementary functions of schools, they do compete for finite school resources. We compare the effects of a traditional program that provided only information about anemia and subsidies to an otherwise identical program that included performance incentives for school principals based on school-level anemia prevalence. By the end of the trial, exam scores among students who were anemic at baseline improved under both versions of the program, but scores among students in the incentive group who were healthy at baseline fell relative to healthy students in the control group. Results suggest that performance incentives to improve student health increase the impact of school-based programs on student health outcomes, but may also lead to reallocation of school resources.

It innovates by explicitly taking delays in educational attainment into account, by identifying the moments at which the pure ethnic gaps arise, by disentangling the decision to continue schooling at the end of a school year from the achievement within a particular grade, and by integrating the language spoken at home among observed family endowments. The pure ethnic gap in educational attainment is found to be small if delays are neglected, but substantial if not and for school-to-work transitions. It is shown that more than 20% of the pure ethnic gap in graduating from secondary school without delay originates in tenth grade.

In contrast, gold-based banking systems tend to be more intuitive because of the physical nature of gold. By simulating interactions among a goldsmith, a depositor, a merchant, and a borrower in a gold-based system, students gain a deeper understanding of reserves and money creation.

To bridge this gap, we exploit exogenous variation in ethanol prices at Brazil's pumps and uncover substantial consumer heterogeneity in the choice between long-established gasoline and an alternative that is similarly available and usable: sugarcane ethanol. We observe roughly 20% of flexible-fuel motorists choosing gasoline when gasoline is priced 20% above ethanol in energy-adjusted terms ($/mile) and, similarly, 20% of motorists choosing ethanol when ethanol is priced 20% above gasoline. We use transaction-level data to explore non-price characteristics which differentiate the two goods in the minds of different groups of consumers. Our findings suggest and a counterfactual illustrates that switching away from gasoline en masse, should this be desired, would require considerable price discounts to boost voluntary adoption, in the US and elsewhere.

This article examines the strategies adopted by unions to counteract this trend. It uses Weil's strategic choice framework' to assess the attempts of the Trades Union Congress to encourage affiliates to adopt innovative ways of reaching precarious workers and examines the extent to which these strategies have been implemented. Unfavourable external shifts have placed greater pressure on unions to develop appropriate internal strategies and structures to strengthen their capacity for reaching precarious workers. The Trades Union Congress has encouraged unions to use community unionism strategies to organise precarious workers outside of the workplace and sustainable sourcing strategies to regulate their conditions through procurement mechanisms. These strategies are relatively effective means of reaching precarious workers in the context of legal constraints on unions and changes in the organisation of work and production. The internal governance structures of the British union movement need to be reformed if these strategies are to be adopted more widely.,"[Wright, Chris F.] Macquarie Univ, Ctr Workforce Futures, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Wright, CF (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Ctr Workforce Futures, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",chris.wright@mq.edu.au,"Wright, Chris F/I-6873-2016","Wright, Chris F/0000-0003-0984-6208",,,,,46,17,18,0,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The decline in U.S. aquaculture has been attributed in part to increasing volumes of imports and high feed prices. However, there is increasing concern that the U.S. regulatory environment, as compared to that of international competitors, may also have contributed to this decline. More than 1,300 laws apply to U.S. aquaculture and even though the majority has been issued by individual states and apply only to specific types of aquaculture businesses in that state, the cumulative regulatory burden has increased over time. Major compliance categories include: 1) environmental management; 2) food safety; 3) legal and labor standards; 4) interstate transport of aquatic products; 5) fish health; and 6) culture of commercially harvested species. A substantial portion of the regulatory burden is the managerial and labor time spent on compliance in addition to the direct cost increases. The streamlined one-stop process adopted in Norway appears to have allowed growth of aquaculture within a comprehensive regulatory framework, yet the lack of such a streamlined approach in the United States appears to have contributed to the decline of existing industries and to serve as a deterrent to investment in newly emerging technologies. Favorable regulatory environments in countries that export to the U.S. contrast sharply with the increasingly inefficient, cumbersome and/or restrictive U.S. environment. Such disparities have created competitive disadvantages for U.S. producers. Attention is needed by policy makers to search for streamlining mechanisms and by the scientific community to address the growing competitive disadvantage to U.S. aquaculture to respond to increased global demand for farmed seafood.","[Engle, Carole R.; Stone, Nathan M.] Univ Arkansas, Aquaculture Fisheries Ctr, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Engle, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Aquaculture Fisheries Ctr, Mail Slot 4912,1200 N Univ Dr, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA.",cengle8523@gmail.com,,,,,,,97,69,75,1,65,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Hedgers are unwillingly exposed to risks; speculators take them over hoping for profit. This concept ignores the changing notions and practices of speculation and especially hedging since the nineteenth century. Originally, hedging meant that merchants buy time in ongoing transactions. The concept later pointed to securing projected transactions by producers and processors. In todays risk economy, the term can label at best the intent to decrease exposure to a specific market risk, as part of a constant process of readjusting principally speculative market positions by all market participants. Futures markets ultimately increased the average exposure to risk, but they also made the exposure potentially manageable; this entails that the economic process is increasingly developed by expressing expectations about the future through taking market positions, that is, by creating risk.","Univ Gottingen, Inst Econ & Social Hist, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Engel, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Inst Econ & Social Hist, Gottingen, Germany.",AEngel@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,"Engel, Alexander/0000-0002-8592-3124",,,,,46,13,14,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

An encompassing quantitative and qualitative text analysis that applies new methods demonstrates that in general, the financial crisis is described in a few sporadically added lines or is dealt with in boxes, separate sections, or specific isolated chapters. This is no great surprise, as it would be a monumental task to change textbooks significantly in the short run. Yet the analysis also indicates small, innovative changes already being made that could inspire future editions. Against this background, the author discusses how any introductory textbook could integrate the financial crisis more adequately into the general presentation, thereby enhancing students' interest.","[Madsen, Poul Thois] Aalborg Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Madsen, PT (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aalborg, Denmark.",pmadsen@dps.aau.dk,,"Madsen, Poul Thoeis/0000-0002-4968-2255",,,,,40,12,12,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

The study draws on data from a field survey administered to 200 small-scale fish farmers in three major fish farming districts in Central Uganda: Mukono, Mpigi and Wakiso. The districts were part of a large aquaculture development project funded by the United States Agency for International Development-Aquaculture and Fisheries Collaborative Research Support Program. Productive efficiency was analyzed using stochastic frontier analysis with a translog production function while assuming a truncated-normal distribution for the inefficiency term. The output variable was total quantity of fish produced, while input variables were quantity or value of inputs used in the production process, namely labor, pond size, stocking density, capital and feeds. The estimated index of resource-use efficiency revealed that small-scale farmers were inefficient in resource allocation by over-utilizing labor with an estimated allocative efficiency index of -0.94 and grossly under-utilized pond size, feeds and fingerlings with allocative efficient indices of 1.15, 1.64, 3.71, respectively. The results suggest that there is considerable scope to expand output and also productivity by increasing production efficiency at the relatively inefficient farms and sustaining the efficiency of those operating at or closer to the frontier.","[Bukenya, James O.] Alabama A&M Univ, Dept Finance Agribusiness & Econ, Normal, AL 35762 USA; [Hyuha, Theodora S.; Twinamasiko, Julius] Makerere Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Dept Agribusiness & Nat Resource Econ, Kampala, Uganda; [Molnar, Joseph] Auburn Univ, Off Int Agr, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Alabama A&M University; Makerere University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Bukenya, JO (通讯作者)，Alabama A&M Univ, Dept Finance Agribusiness & Econ, POB 1042, Normal, AL 35762 USA.",Jajja13@gmail.com,,"Molnar, Joseph John/0000-0003-2407-3872","USAID-Aqua Fish CRSP, Investigation [09MER01AU]","USAID-Aqua Fish CRSP, Investigation(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","This project was funded by the USAID-Aqua Fish CRSP, Investigation #09MER01AU.

As a result, the margins applied to the products in this dispute remained unchanged because they had been calculated prior to the policy change. The United States did not contest Korea's claims. The Panel confirmed that zeroing was used and, following the long line of Panel and Appellate Body rulings, found the practice inconsistent with the Anti-Dumping Agreement. After the Panel Report was adopted, the United States recalculated the margins without zeroing. It, however, refused to refund unliquidated cash deposits that were based on zeroing, highlighting the United States's continued lukewarm compliance with WTO rulings on zeroing. This dispute offers an opportunity to ponder on weaknesses of the WTO Dispute Settlement and the ability of one Member to take advantage of it. Since the facts and their legal assessment were undisputed, why was litigation necessary? Can compliance with WTO law be improved with broader findings and more incisive remedies?","[Prusa, Thomas J.] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Prusa, Thomas J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rubini, Luca] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Birmingham,"Prusa, TJ (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",prusa@econ.rutgers.edu; l.rubini@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,15,15,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2013,12.0,2,,,SI,,409,425,,10.1017/S1474745612000614,0.0,,,17,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,126CZ,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317590600013,0
J,"Lichtenberg, FR",,,,"Lichtenberg, Frank R.",,,"The impact of new (orphan) drug approvals on premature mortality from rare diseases in the United States and France, 1999-2007",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Orphan drugs; Orphan diseases; Rare diseases; Mortality; Innovation,,"This paper investigates the impact of the introduction of new orphan drugs on premature mortality from rare diseases using longitudinal, disease-level data obtained from a number of major databases. The analysis is performed using data from two countries: the United States (during the period 1999-2006) and France (during the period 2000-2007). For both countries, we estimate models using two alternative definitions of premature mortality, several alternative criteria for inclusion in the set of rare diseases, and several values of the potential lag between new drug approvals and premature mortality reduction. Both the United States and French estimates indicate that, overall, premature mortality from rare diseases is unrelated to the cumulative number of drugs approved 0-2 years earlier but is significantly inversely related to the cumulative number of drugs approved 3-4 years earlier. This delay is not surprising, since most patients probably do not have access to a drug until several years after it has been launched. Although the estimates for the two countries are qualitatively similar, the estimated magnitudes of the US coefficients are about four times as large as the magnitudes of the French coefficients. This may be partly due to greater errors in measuring dates of drug introduction in France. Also, access to new drugs may be more restricted in France than it is in the United States. Our estimates indicate that, in the United States, potential years of life lost to rare diseases before age 65 (PYLL65) declined at an average annual rate of 3.3% and that, in the absence of lagged new drug approvals, PYLL65 would have increased at a rate of 0.9%. Since the US population aged 0-64 was increasing at the rate of 1.0% per year, this means that PYLL65 per person under 65 would have remained approximately constant. The reduction in the US growth rate of PYLL65 attributable to lagged new drug approvals was 4.2%. In France, PYLL65 declined at an average annual rate of 1.8%. The estimates imply that, in the absence of lagged new drug approvals, it would have declined at a rate of 0.6%. The reduction in the French growth rate of PYLL65 attributable to lagged new drug approvals was 1.1%. Earlier access to orphan drugs could result in earlier reductions in premature mortality from rare diseases.","[Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA.",frank.lichtenberg@columbia.edu,,,,,,,13,18,19,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This also holds for older workers, suggesting that firm-provided training may be an important instrument to retain older workers at work. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By conceptualizing the structure of illegal markets based on general coordination problems, which are also cornerstones in the study of legal markets, we can locate the systematic differences in the functioning of markets that operate illegally.

There are several reasons of ineffective development of the agricultural sector. The main reason is insufficient cooperation of local agricultural subjects and municipal self-government organs. Another one is financial aid from the state and European Union through grants. Big disutility for the agriculture in micro-region is absence of the relation to soil and subsequently absolute lack of interest for the work in this industry. Estates, which are not settled up or are crushed, are another problem. Agriculture is in this area typical for weak, almost none ability to compete, what is another obstacle in region development, and many others. The work is primarily focused on Cedron micro-region. The aim of this work is to evaluate the task of agriculture in the micro-region Cedron through local agricultural subjects, chosen by the author, and possibilities of micro-region development through agricultural sector.

Standard deviation represents a largely used method of measuring risk; but in the last years it was partially put under question because it does not consider the investor behavior and his expectations. The downside risk better answer to the real investment process, including investor expectation and the non-normal distributed return rates. We highlighted the differences between the methods of measuring risk in the post-modern and modern portfolio theory, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. The PMPT method generates better empirical results sustained by the theoretical approach presented in the paper. Using PMPT for quantifting risk, the investor can distinguish between the real risk of obtaining returns lower than his expectation and the premium of obtaining higher returns than expected paying for his courage of performing the investment.","[Geambasu, Cristina; Sova, Robert; Jianu, Iulia; Geambasu, Liviu] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Geambasu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cristinageambasu@cig.ase.ro,"Jianu, Iulia/B-2975-2015; Sova, Robert A/P-3822-2016","Jianu, Iulia/0000-0003-1053-9141;",CNCSIS-UEFISCSU [PN II-RU 326/2010],CNCSIS-UEFISCSU(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)),This work was supported by CNCSIS-UEFISCSU project number PN II-RU 326/2010 The development and implementation at the level of economic entities from Romania of an evaluation model based on physical capital maintenance concept.,,32,8,14,0,22,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In-vitro screening of the methanolic and ethyl-acetate extracts of U. barbata were evaluated to determine their antimicrobial activity against thirteen different Staphylococcus species. The selected organisms were isolated from raw bovine milk by several biochemical tests and identified with an API staph kit (bioMerieux, France). The antimicrobial activity of the extracts were evaluated using both the agar well diffusion method and the broth micro-dilution technique to determine the mean zone of inhibition and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), respectively. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of the extracts were also evaluated. Both the methanolic and ethyl-acetate extract showed variable antimicrobial activity against the Staphylococcus species with mean zones of inhibition ranging from 0 -34 mm in diameter. Susceptibility by the Staphylococcus species tested in the methanol and the ethyl-acetate extract was 92.31% and 53.85% respectively. The MIC result for the methanol extract ranged from 0.0390 to10 mg/ml, while that of the ethylacetate extract ranged from 0.15625 to 5 mg/ml. The MBC's were in the range of 40 to > 160 mg/ml and 80 to > 160 mg/ml for the methanol and the ethyl-acetate extracts, respectively. Results from this study revealed the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Usnea barbata lichen and therefore validate the use of the plant in traditional medicine.","[Idamokoro, E.

And since the main sector of an economy that is saving is the household one, adopting financial policies that stimulate saving in this sector is crucial for the anti-crisis and economic recovery governmental programmes. The base of these policies requires knowledge about the saving/investment behaviour of households in Romania. After 1989 the important transformations that take place in the economic and social spheres also influence the saving behaviour. The ratio between consumption and saving becomes floating, the balance leaning in favour of consumption, while saving rates even become negative during 2003 and 2008. Moreover, the lack of an investment culture in Romania determined by half a century of centrally planned economy, as well as the lack of precise, correct and complete information regarding the alternatives for placing savings available currently on the financial market in Romania, led to a concentration of population savings only in bank deposits or keeping them in cash. The main purpose of this paper is the analysis of the financial/investment behaviour of households and the identification of its predictors. Based on the data resulted from the database of the Household Budget Survey with the experimental questionnaire Financial placements of households obtained from the recordings in May 2010 by the National Institute of Statistics, an ordinal regression model was built with the view to identify the economic, social and demographic variables that have a significant influence on the financial placements of the population.","Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Niculescu-Aron, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",gabriela_aron@yahoo.com,"Niculescu-Aron, Ileana Gabriela/J-1483-2016","Niculescu-Aron, Ileana Gabriela/0000-0003-2902-1641",European Social Fund through the Development of Human Resources Operational Programme [POSDRU/89/1.5/S/61755],European Social Fund through the Development of Human Resources Operational Programme,"This work was supported by the project Post-Doctoral Studies in Economics: training program for elite researchers - SPODE co-funded from the European Social Fund through the Development of Human Resources Operational Programme 2007-2013, contract no.

We add to this literature and examine children's secondary school track choice in Germany where tracking occurs at age ten and has a strong binding character. Using risk indicators for different domains, we mainly find evidence of an inverse relation between parental risk aversion and children's secondary school track, with some heterogeneity depending on whether parents' risk willingness is modeled separately or jointly, by child gender, or by the risk measure used.

The recent WTO ruling in China-Raw Materials has only solidified the latter extreme. This article seeks to expose the irrationality of the current regime, especially the problems created by the rigid obligations of the several acceding Members. It contends that such obligations deprive these Members of their ownership right to claim a larger share of their natural resources for domestic use and of an effective tool for managing environmental externalities associated with the resource products exported. The virtual immutability of such obligations is at odds with the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources. To rectify these problems, this article proposes integrating all stand-alone export concessions into General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GAIT) schedules, which would provide the acceding Members with the policy space and flexibility available under the GATT It is also submitted that the key to gaining support from developing countries for the establishment of a system-wide discipline lies in the recognition of legitimate functions of export duties. Rather than pushing for their elimination, the WTO should aim to regulate export duties in the same manner as its regulation of import duties.","Wayne State Univ, Sch Law, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Wayne State University,"Ya Qin, J (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Sch Law, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",ya.qin@wayne.edu,,,,,,,79,15,15,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Based on a threshold of two-thirds of median hourly wages, it finds that a high overall proportion of urban employees are low-paid. While incidence remained relatively stable among locals between 1995 and 2008, it declined for migrants from 2002 to 2007, though the latter were still much more likely to be in low-paid jobs. After investigating the determinants and welfare implications of low pay, the authors conclude with an argument for subsidized training, stricter minimum wage enforcement and firm-level wage bargaining.","[Deng, Quheng; Li, Shi] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Deng, QH (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",qhdeng@hotmail.com; lishi@bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,19,6,6,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

Including multiple, independent parties greatly reduces the welfare advantage of an emissions tax over emissions (permit) trading in handling abatement-cost uncertainties, from that shown by existing, single-party literature. But a previously ignored and much bigger advantage of a tax, from better handling uncertainties in business-as-usual emissions, greatly boosts the overall tax-versus-trading advantage. Yet the degree to which each mechanism is used to raise and recycle revenue efficiently by lowering distortionary taxes - rather than recycle revenue as lump sums, or not raise revenue by giving tax thresholds or free permits - may in turn dominate any tax-versus-trading advantage. Choosing the best greenhouse abatement mechanism should thus consider the issues of tax-versus-trading and efficient revenue recycling together. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It uses a household dataset from India with a rich set of household covariates and student performance data on reading, writing, and mathematics. For both rural and urban India the results from regression analyses indicate that private school students perform better on tests controlling for covariates. In both contexts, however, the private school benefit becomes largely, statistically, insignificant after conducting multivariate analysis on data balanced using the propensity score matching technique. The paper also makes an initial attempt to identify 'low-fee' private schools: within the regression framework it finds that children in such schools may perform no better than their public school counterparts. The data and methods used in this paper are not without limitations; however these analyses call into question the claim that private school effect may be unequivocally positive and highlights the potential heterogeneity in private school performance in the Indian context.

Previous studies on the impact of the RPS have not considered the potentially differential effect of using generic alternatives for individuals with a different socioeconomic background. However, patients' characteristics might determine their overall knowledge of the existence of the system and thus of the financial burden to which they may be confronted. The association between patients' characteristics and the use of generic drugs versus brand name drugs was analyzed for ten highly prescribed pharmaceutical molecules included in the Belgian generic reference price system. Prescriptions were obtained from a 10% sample of all general practitioners in 2008 (corresponding to 120,670 adult patients and 368,101 prescriptions). For each pharmaceutical molecule, logistic regression models were performed, with independent variables for patient socioeconomic background at the individual level (work status, having a guaranteed income and being entitled to increased reimbursement of co-payments) and at the level of the neighborhood (education). The percentage of generic prescriptions ranged from 24.7 to 76.4%, and the mean reference supplement in 2008 ranged from a,not sign4.3 to a,not sign37.8. For seven molecules, higher use of a generic alternative was associated with either having a guaranteed income, with receiving increased reimbursement of co-payments or with living in areas with the lowest levels of education. Globally, results provided evidence that the generic RPS in Belgium does not lead to a higher financial burden on individuals from a low socioeconomic background.","[Farfan-Portet, Maria-Isabel; Van de Voorde, Carine; Vrijens, France] Belgian Hlth Care Knowledge Ctr KCE, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Vander Stichele, Robert] Univ Ghent, Sch Med, Heymans Inst Pharmacol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Farfan-Portet, MI (通讯作者)，Belgian Hlth Care Knowledge Ctr KCE, Blvd Jardin Bot 55, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",maria.farfan@kce.fgov.be,"Stichele, Robert Vander/K-7203-2015","Stichele, Robert Vander/0000-0001-9118-9651; Vrijens, France/0000-0002-8744-6499",,,,,40,8,11,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

J,"Jorgensen, U",,,,"Jorgensen, Ulrik",,,Design junctions: Spaces and situations that frame weak signals - the example of hygiene and hospital planning,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SYSTEMS,"This article discusses the question: Are weak signals independent of framing and interactions with the environment? The response proposed here is that many of the developments identified by efforts to detect and interpret weak signals are the result of designed interventions that define the repertoire of actions and frames. Very often, as Ansoff argued, actors use a variety of models and filters for seeking and using weak signals. Thus weak signals are not only dependent on the interpretative equipment applied by actors, but from a constructivist perspective the identification of and meaning given to weak signals are strongly influenced by design choices made at the outset. In this sense design is a constitutive element of both the environment and signal detection/use. An example of how design is constitutive of both context and understanding can be found in the history of hospital hygiene. This case study illustrates how dominant regimes of practice, established through the conception of pathogen bacteria and antibacterial treatments and disinfection, are now creating signals that call into question fundamental design of hygiene practices. By examining the epistemic assumptions of scientific disciplines and the designed repertoire of practical responses it becomes clear how contexts and frames of interpretation are constituted and how such contexts and frames then define what is recognised as a weak signal.

One of these services is avalanche protection of forests. A monetary valuation of this service would be helpful to provide efficient and effective protection to the local population. We present the results of a case study from the Swiss Alps, where we determined the willingness to pay for avalanche protection based on a choice experiment combined with virtual reality visualizations. Furthermore, we compare these results with the costs of alternative technical measures for natural hazard mitigation as well as with the results of a risk-based evaluation. We conclude that the willingness to pay for avalanche protection of forests is about the same range as the collective risk related to a 300-years avalanche event and within a range similar to the per-household costs of alternative measures. However, willingness to pay is substantially higher than the costs of silvicultural measures to maintain protection forest. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Lessons from Global and Regional Integration of Ukraine,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Multilateral and regional trade integration has become quite complex these days, very often involving states that pursue simultaneous economic arrangements, envisaging different liberalization and integration agendas. With such integration being so much intertwined, an obvious question arises whether concurrent participation of one state in several regional trade frameworks is legally and technically possible and which criteria should be met in this case. This article examines a particular example of Ukraine a World Trade Organization (WTO) member in its ongoing regional integration processes both to the West (free trade agreement (PTA) with the European Union (EU)) and to the East (Customs Union (CU) with Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia) through the prism of mutual compatibilities and WTO rules on regional trade integration. An assessment of the compatibility issue arising from various forms of economic integration has proved to be critical for the accurate analysis of any country's compliance with the WTO commitments. This article concludes that regional integration of Ukraine to the East requires careful considerations and structural redesigns. The recently discussed mode of integration into the CU would invoke legal and procedural difficulties for Ukraine in aligning it with the WTO rules as well as with its integration to the West. To this end, this article presents some practical observations concerning compatibility between Ukraine's different integration agendas and provides possible solutions to overcome legal problems arising thereof The lessons derived from this article can be applied mutatis mutandis to other regional frameworks.","[Pogoretskyy, Vitaliy] Univ Dundee, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",University of Dundee,"Pogoretskyy, V (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",v.pogoretskyy@dundee.ac.uk; sbeketov@vbb.com,"Pogoretskyy, Vitaliy/V-4840-2019","Pogoretskyy, Vitaliy/0000-0001-9090-1504",,,,,48,3,3,0,14,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In terms of the causal layered analysis developed by Sohail Inayatullah, it is an investigation on the levels of worldviews and archetypes. Ideas of human nature describe a trajectory from supranature (theological and mystical) via nature (philosophical and mechanical) to subnature (digital). With the development of psychological science about a century ago, so called psycho-utopian visions of a better society arose, based on the transformation of the human mind. Such visions seem today to have been replaced by digital utopias, based on the development of superfast computers and the enhancement of brain capacity through neural implants. The latter is a prominent feature of so called transhumanism. The transhumanist ideas of Ray Kurzweil are briefly presented and contrasted with traditional religious and spiritual ideas. Of special interest in this context is Rudolf Steiner's philosophical-spiritual understanding of human being and development, which underpins Steiner Waldorf education. There is an existential choice confronting us today: whether to see humans as essentially spiritual beings, or as highly complex bio-computers. This choice has obvious ramifications for education as well as for the future of human being in general. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we concentrate on an important dimension of every health care system, namely the convergence/divergence of health care financing (HCF). Based on data from 22 OECD countries in the time period 1970-2005, we use the public financing ratio (public financing in % of total HCF) and per capita public HCF as indicators for convergence. By applying different concepts of convergence, we find that HCF is converging. This conclusion also holds when we look at smaller subgroups of countries and shorter time periods. However, we find evidence that countries do not move towards a common mean and that the rate of convergence is decreasing over time.","[Leiter, Andrea M.; Theurl, Engelbert] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ & Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Leiter, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ & Stat, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Andrea.Leiter@uibk.ac.at; engelbert.theurl@uibk.ac.at,,"Leiter, Andrea/0000-0002-8628-5072",,,,,49,11,12,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Most of the developed models have achieved good prediction results, but they have used a paired sample of failed and non-failed firms, which is not representative of the population from which it is chosen. This paper focuses on the development of both failure prediction models on a paired sample and a random sample of firms with head offices located in the region of Castilla y Leon (Spain), in order to prove if the predictive power of the models is affected by the sampling method. To estimate both models, we apply a logistic regression analysis where we consider a set of financial ratios as independent variables, which is first reduced through the application of a principal components analysis. The results show there are differences both in the significant variables and in the classification results, which are not so high in the random sample as in the paired one, especially with regard to failed firms.","[Garcia-Gallego, Ana; Mures-Quintana, Maria-Jesus] Univ Leon, Dept Econ & Stat, E-24071 Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Garcia-Gallego, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leon, Dept Econ & Stat, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",ana.ggallego@unileon.es; mj.mures@unileon.es,"Garcia-Gallego, Ana/F-5779-2016","Garcia-Gallego, Ana/0000-0002-3611-4953",,,,,24,0,1,0,15,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The empirical results show that, first, there is a negative relationship between entrepreneurial teams' financial capital and firm technological innovation, and this relationship is statistically significant; second, entrepreneurial teams' financial capital has positive effects on firm management innoyation, but these effects are not statistically significant; third, when the innovation factor, which is deduced from technical innovation and management innovation, is introduced into research models, no significant effects exist. But when firm nature is considered, a significantly negative effect appears between entrepreneurial teams' financial capital and firm innovation performance, and this relationship is stronger in privately owned firms. These results indicate that although entrepreneurial teams' financial capital can solve the firm's financial problems, they have no benefit on firm innovation. The main reason is that financial institutions will keep an eye on the use of the funds they provide, and in order to avoid the useless use of the funds, they prefer riskless activities to innovation activities since innovation always comes with high risk and uncertainty.

This transformation is linked to modifications in the land ownership, machining processes or economy focus in the respective areas. These modifications are mostly manifested by means of changes in land use and ecological stability. One of the possible ways to improve the ecological stability is through building an territorial system of ecological stability framework (MUSES) at a local level. In order to set up the suitable and sustainable management of countryside, we have to build it based on its potential and refrain from exceeding its limitations. The aim of this paper is to observe and evaluate the changes in land use of land surrounding watercourses, as one of the key elements for assessing the ecological stability in rural areas, by using the tools in GIS. The outcome of this paper can be used as the entry data for evaluation of the connection of bio corridors and modelling programmes for the proposals of new elements of MUSES. The model area is the land surrounding the Malina watercourse (in the cadastral area of Kuchyna) and the Rohoznicky potok watercourse (in the cadastral area of Rohoznik) in the district of Malacky. These watercourses have their sources in the Male Karpaty Mountains, they then run through a forest massive and enter the contact foothill area. The contact foothill area consists mainly of rural agricultural land and the tracking of the changes in this area is of a crucial importance. Raster maps, historical aerial photographs and current orto-photomaps of the land were used as the entry data. The land use in the distance of 200metres from both shores of the main flow for 1892, 1958, 1991 and 2011 was evaluated.

Using data from the 2003 and 2007 Tajikistan Living Standards Surveys (TLSS), the findings support previous evidence that a woman's use of prenatal and delivery care depends on her education, household income, and proximity to services. However, previous models have not specified who makes the decision to use maternal healthcare services. This study finds that in Tajikistan a woman shares decision making with her spouse and the eldest woman in the household. There is limited evidence that traditional proxies for bargaining power, such as relative earnings level, affect outcomes. The authors conclude that where women's exit options are limited, surveys evaluating the value of women's assets and their services in the home, as well as questions about decision making, will allow more refined measures of women's bargaining power.","[Meurs, Mieke] American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Giddings, Lisa A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA",American University; University of Wisconsin System,"Meurs, M (通讯作者)，American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",mmeurs@american.edu; giddings.lisa@uwlax.edu,,"Meurs, Mieke/0000-0003-1327-4206",,,,,53,4,5,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is considered best feasible strategy for forest conservation in biodiversity rich areas. This paper examines the heterogeneity of NTFPs use by tribal communities in northeast India, a global hot spot by examining diversity of NTFPs at-large, its consumption pattern, and contribution to rural income and forest revenue. A total of 343 NTFPs recorded used for diverse purposes by tribal communities. When species choice grouped as per use category, utilization for medicinal (163 species), edible fruits (75 species) and vegetables (65 species) purposes was reasonably high. Community dependence on forest resources was 100% for firewood and house construction material. 76 plant species were sold in three major local markets while an additional 22 species traded at commercial scale mainly outside the state. NTFPs contributed 19-32% of total household income for different tribal communities, which was significant. Illicium griffithii, Rubio cordifolia, Oroxylum indicum, Swertia chirayita, Litsea sebifera, Taxus wallichiana, Valeriana jatamansii, Thalictrum foliolosum, Picrorhiza kurrooa, Everniastrum cirrhatum, Cordyceps sinensis, Aconitum fletcherianum, Nardostachys jatamansi, Picrorhiza kurrooa, Gymnadenia orchidis, Calamus, Quercus and Pinus roxbughii were important commercial species. NTFPs also generated substantial revenue to the State government, though it is falling year after year, which is alarming. To meet community livelihoods, income and forest revenue from NTFPs, it desires a thorough management plan and policy guidelines for these resources from all line departments. The knowledge on diversity, its consumption pattern, and contribution to rural income and forest revenue may enable planners to accurately plan sustainable management of NTFP resources and community development in near future.

Ability to process and use information globally and instantly increased exponentially in recent years due to a combination of scientific progress in computing and distributed computing, exacerbation of competition, innovation in all its forms and cuts of operating costs in global communication networks. As barriers to access knowledge regarding a process, product or market are gradually decreasing (distance, geographical features, and costs), knowledge and skills are becoming increasingly a key to competitiveness, both locally and globally. This paper, based on a survey of 551 Romanian companies, address a sensitive issue of both business and academic fields perception of knowledge based economy in Romanian companies.

Although the effects on hatchability are known they have not been examined on a large scale even though sophisticated equipments are widely available on the market to monitor mechanical effects during transport. Transporting hatching eggs from Hungary and incubating them abroad revealed lower hatchability compared to when the eggs were incubated in Hungary. Following transport, there were higher embryo losses and, notably, more malformed embryos. The aim of these initial trials was to determine if a testing device (Crazy Fit Massage machine - CFM machine) was able to replicate and model the mechanical impacts experienced during transport and reproduce the reduction in hatchability and increase the level of malformed embryos as have been observed in commercial practice. Tinytag (R) high sensitivity shock and vibration loggers were used to monitor the impacts under field and trial conditions. Applying single 10 minute treatments on the CFM machine using the same frequency (10-30 Hz) as the eggs experience under field conditions induced the negative effect of transport and lower hatching results were experienced. Three trials were conducted. Treated eggs in Trial No. 1 and 2 received automatically and periodical changing vibration in a range between 10-30 Hz for 10 minutes while in Trial 3 two different level of impact were applied at 20 and 30 Hz, respectively. Hatchability decreased due the treatment although in only Trial No. 3 was the difference significant, also the difference in early dead levels in Trials 2 and 3 and occurrences of malformation in Trial 1 and 3. All these results are in accordance the field experience. Thus, the trials examined the equipment was able to produce mechanical impacts that were repeatable in order to set up statistically reliable trials on hatching eggs.","[Torma, T.] Aviagen Kft, H-9028 Gyor, Hungary; [Kovacsne, K.

However, deeply influenced by the worsening debt crisis in Europe and the implementation of China's financial deflation policy, SMEs' high-cost financing difficulties have become more serious. As a systemic issue, the SMEs' financing problem has to be solved with efforts from all sides in our society. This paper attempts to make a detailed analysis of SMEs' financing problem based on system theory, taking developed countries' experiences and China's national conditions into full consideration. We hold that, to solve this problem, we should optimize the financing mechanism, win banking support, and innovate the financing market and loan guarantee system. More importantly, we should establish an efficient financial support system with Chinese characteristics by taking the following measures: improving SMEs' financial mechanism and system, strengthening SMEs' financial ecological environment, optimizing and innovating SMEs' financial products, strengthening regulations guiding non-governmental financing, and expanding SMEs' equity financing teams. Since there is an imbalance between the present financing structure system and potential economic growth structure, this will restrict China's economic growth. Therefore, in constructing an efficient financial support system for SMEs, all measures mentioned above need the government's full support. Through emphasizing the government's role, increasing financial support to SMEs, and guiding the flow of bank loans and investment funds, we are surely able to improve and perfect the financial support system with Chinese characteristics for SMEs.","[Zhang, Benzhao; Shi, Yue] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Danyan] Anhui Univ Finance Econ, Sch Finance, Bengbu, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology; Anhui University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, BZ (通讯作者)，Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Hefei, Peoples R China.",ahzbz@126.com; 932969688@qq.com; 455435278@qq.com,"qi, li/JFE-7167-2023; SUN, Ye/KBC-8159-2024",,,,,,4,2,3,0,4,AMER SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9845209-9-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,280,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEZ14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318819700041,0

We attempt to reviewing the literature pertaining to the measurement of innovation management at the level of the firm. Originality/value - We first develop a synthesized framework of the innovation management process consisting of seven categories: inputs management, knowledge management, innovation strategy, organizational culture and structure, portfolio management, project management and commercialization. Second, we populate each category of the framework with factors empirically demonstrated to be significant in the innovation process, and illustrative measures to map the territory of innovation management measurement. Findings - The concluded that it takes the difficult to provide a framework against which managers can evaluate their own innovation activity, explore the extent to which their organization is nominally innovative or whether or not innovation is embedded throughout their organization, and identify areas for improvement.","[Zhuparova, Aziza] al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",Al-Farabi Kazakh National University,,aziza_z@mail.ru,"Zhuparova, Aziza/JNF-0699-2023",,,,,,4,0,0,0,7,T RYSKULOV KAZAKH ECONOMIC UNIV,ALMATY,"55, ZHANDOSOV ST, ALMATY, 050035, KAZAKHSTAN",,,978-601-225-435-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,815,827,,,,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEL80,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317270100048,0

To assess the cost-utility of ranolazine versus placebo as an add-on therapy for the symptomatic treatment of patients with chronic angina pectoris in Spain. A decision tree model with 1-year time horizon was designed. Transition probabilities and utility values for different angina frequencies were obtained from the literature. Costs were obtained from Spanish official DRGs for patients with chronic angina pectoris. We calculated the incremental cost-utility ratio of using ranolazine compared with a placebo. Sensitivity analyses, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, were performed. Acceptability curves and expected value of perfect information were calculated. The incremental cost-utility ratio was a,not sign8,455 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) per patient in Spain. Sensitivity analyses showed that if the decision makers' willingness to pay is a,not sign15,000 per QALY, the treatment with ranolazine will be cost effective at a 95 % level of confidence. The incremental cost-utility ratio is particularly sensitive to changes in utility values of those non-hospitalized patients with mild or moderate angina frequency.

A cross-country endogenous growth analysis shows that direct measures of patriarchal institutions dominate a variety of religious affiliation variables and model specifications in explaining country growth rates, and that using religious affiliation, particularly Islam, as a control for culture produces misleading conclusions. This result is robust to the inclusion of measures of gender inequality in education and income, indicating that establishing and maintaining patriarchal institutions (a process this study calls patriarchal rent-seeking) exact economic growth costs over and above those measured by standard gender inequality variables.

Because the future of many Africans has been shaped by both resource extraction and agriculture and will continue to do so, there is an ongoing demand for a more nuanced understanding of their mutual dynamics. This paper analyzes some of the dynamics between these critical forms of economic activity. Based on ethnographic material from Sierra Leone, Ghana and, to a lesser extent, South Africa, the relationship between mining and agriculture will be analyzed from three perspectives: livelihoods, land and value attribution. Moreover, by discussing these three levels of intertwinement, the paper generates insights, such as the importance of developing structures to facilitate processes of alternation between mining and farming, that are central to policy, as well as highlights areas of research where more focus and understanding is needed.

We document that the impact of foreigners' trades is concentrated in large companies. Most importantly, when the market is in the up state, the returns of stocks of large companies that were positively affected by foreign investors in the previous six-month period continue to increase in the subsequent six-month period. As a result, the subsequent six-month return on a past winner stock portfolio is significantly higher than that on a past loser stock portfolio.

It demonstrates that the gender wealth gap is concentrated in particular types of assets, and differences in the composition of wealth, especially in high net worth households, are an important feature of the wealth gap in Australia. Using decomposition techniques within a quantile regression framework, the study explores the effects of individual characteristics of single male and female households on their wealth and finds that individual factors play a relatively small role in accounting for the large gender wealth gap at the top of the wealth distribution. Therefore, differences in the composition of men and women's wealth portfolios contribute to the gender wealth gap, and future research must account for these differences.","[Austen, Siobhan; Ong, Rachel] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Jefferson, Therese] Curtin Univ, Grad Sch Business, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University; Curtin University,"Austen, S (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",S.Austen@curtin.edu.au; T.Jefferson@curtin.edu.au; rachel.ong@cbs.curtin.edu.au,"Ong ViforJ, Rachel/C-1097-2008","Ong ViforJ, Rachel/0000-0001-8557-8802; austen, siobhan/0000-0002-2367-0889; Jefferson, Therese/0000-0001-7393-7046",,,,,46,25,28,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

A discrete choice experiment was used to investigate preferences for the attributes practice type, number of GPs in general practice, collaboration with other practices, change in weekly working hours (administrative versus patient related), and change in yearly surplus. In May 2011, all doctors actively engaged in the family medicine program in Denmark were invited to participate in a web-based survey. A total of 485 GPs in training responded to the questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 56 %. A mixed logit model showed that GPs in training prefer to work in smaller shared practices (2 GPs). This stands in contrast to the preferences of current GPs. Hence, a generational change in the GP population is likely to introduce more productive practice forms, and problems with GP shortages are likely to be mitigated over the coming years. Results further showed that a majority of the respondents are willing to work in larger shared practices (with 3-4 GPs) if they receive an increase in surplus (approximately 50,000 DKK/6,719 EUR per year) and that they may be willing to take in more patient-related work if the increase in surplus is sufficient (approximately 200,000 DKK/26,875 EUR per year for 5 extra hours per week). Monetary incentives may therefore be an effective tool for further improving productivity.","[Pedersen, Line Bjornskov; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Ctr Hlth Econ Res COHERE, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Pedersen, Line Bjornskov] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, Res Unit Gen Practice, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ Queensland, Australian Ctr Econ Res Hlth, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; University of Queensland,"Pedersen, LB (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Ctr Hlth Econ Res COHERE, JB Winslowsvej 9B, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark.",lib@sam.sdu.dk,"Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/A-3161-2011","Pedersen, Line Bjornskov/0000-0001-6804-2045; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/0000-0003-1137-2304",,,,,33,11,11,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Poorly performing students tend to leave because staying is not worthwhile rather than because they are at risk of failing out of school. Poor performance substantially decreases the enjoyability of school and substantially influences beliefs about postcollege earnings.","[Stinebrickner, Ralph] Berea Coll, Berea, KY 40404 USA; [Stinebrickner, Ralph; Stinebrickner, Todd] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Stinebrickner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",trstineb@uwo.ca,,"Stinebrickner, Todd/0009-0000-7886-072X",,,,,41,85,117,2,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

Based on fieldwork in Malaysia's Penang state, this article presents some of the difficulties associated with recording women's informal work. It contributes to theorization on the under-reporting of women's remunerative activities in official surveys by arguing that while women's work is often devalued, under-reporting may also be the result of women making strategic and pragmatic choices. By reporting themselves as housewives, for example, they may avoid questioning their society's gendered norms while securing their own interests in work outside the home.","[Franck, Anja Karlsson] Gothenburg Univ, Sch Global Studies, S-41124 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Olsson, Jerry] Gothenburg Univ, Dept Econ & Soc, S-41124 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg,"Franck, AK (通讯作者)，Gothenburg Univ, Sch Global Studies, S-41124 Gothenburg, Sweden.",anja.franck@globalstudies.gu.se; jerry.olsson@geography.gu.se,,,,,,,42,7,7,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

In order to facilitate productivity cost inclusion, it has been suggested to estimate productivity costs indirectly using quality of life data. This study aimed to derive and validate an algorithm for predicting productivity losses on the basis of quality-of-life data using the EQ-5D-3L. A large representative sample of the Dutch general public (n = 1,100) was asked in a web-based questionnaire to state their expected level of productivity in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism for multiple EQ-5D health states. Based on these data, two generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were constructed: (1) a model predicting levels of absenteeism and (2) a model predicting presenteeism. The models were validated by comparing model predictions with conventionally measured productivity within a group of low back pain patients. Predicted absenteeism levels based on EQ-5D health state closely resembled conventionally measured absenteeism levels. Productivity losses related to presenteeism seemed somewhat overestimated by our prediction model. Measured and predicted productivity were moderately but highly significantly correlated. Overall, it appears possible to make reasonable productivity predictions based on EQ-5D data. Further exploration and validation of prediction algorithms remains necessary, however, especially for presenteeism.","[Krol, Marieke; Stolk, Elly; Brouwer, Werner] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Krol, Marieke; Stolk, Elly; Brouwer, Werner] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Krol, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",krol@bmg.eur.nl,"Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023; Krol, Marieke/HGA-7950-2022","Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397; Krol, Marieke/0000-0002-6153-0828",,,,,29,14,15,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond 1997 and 2003 follow-ups are used to estimate a fully parametric, selection-corrected wage equation for nonteachers, which is then used to predict the wages that teachers would have received in a nonteaching career. The difference between actual teacher salaries and this prediction can be considered the opportunity cost of teaching. Moving up one standard deviation in math SAT score increases the opportunity cost of teaching by $1,500 to $2,000 four years after college, rising to $3,000 to $3,800 ten years after college. Moving up one standard deviation in verbal SAT score increases the opportunity cost by $300 four years after college, and by $1,300 ten years after college.

Objectives To analyse the relationship between EQ-5D, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) in psoriasis. To transform DLQI scores, and key clinical, demographic and health service utilisation variables into utilities. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 200 consecutive adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis was carried out in two Hungarian university clinics. The relationship between the outcome measures were analysed with correlations and with the known-groups method. Bivariate and multivariate regression algorithms on EQ-5D scores were formulated. Results The mean age of respondents was 51 years (SD = 12.9), 68.5 % were male, and 51.5 % received biological therapy. Median EQ-5D, DLQI, and PASI scores were 0.73, 3.0, and 3.45, respectively. EQ-5D showed a moderate correlation with the DLQI and with the PASI (r(s) = -0.48 and -0.43, p < 0.05). Strong correlation was found between DLQI and PASI (r(s) = 0.81, p < 0.05). DLQI and PASI discriminated better among groups categorised by the localisation of the lesions than EQ-5D. Presence of psoriasis on the neck and/or de ' colletage was associated with the greatest health related quality of life (HRQOL) impairment. Ten variables were incorporated in a multivariate algorithm that accounted for 48.8 % of EQ-5D variance (ANOVA p < 0.001). Conclusions This study provided the first evidence that patients with visible psoriatic lesions have significantly worse HRQOL compared to those with non-visible lesions, measured not only with DLQI but also with EQ-5D. In addition to demographic and clinical variables, our model included health service utilisation variables related to psoriasis, and explained higher proportion of EQ-5D variance than any previous findings in the literature.","[Heredi, Emese; Remenyik, Eva; Szegedi, Andrea] Univ Debrecen, Dept Dermatol, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Heredi, Emese; Remenyik, Eva; Szegedi, Andrea] Univ Debrecen, Dept Dermatol Allergol, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Rencz, Fanni; Balogh, Orsolya; Gulacsi, Laszlo; Pentek, Marta; Brodszky, Valentin] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Rencz, Fanni] Semmelweis Univ, Doctoral Sch Clin Med, H-1085 Budapest, Hungary; [Herszenyi, Krisztina; Hollo, Peter; Jokai, Hajnalka; Karpati, Sarolta] Semmelweis Univ, Dept Dermatol Venereol & Dermatooncol, H-1085 Budapest, Hungary",University of Debrecen; University of Debrecen; Corvinus University Budapest; Semmelweis University; Semmelweis University,"Brodszky, V (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",valentin.brodszky@uni-corvinus.hu,"Brodszky, Valentin/AFN-4112-2022; Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023; Péntek, Márta/HTQ-3097-2023; Holló, Peter/Q-6505-2018; Karpati, Sarolta/E-5786-2018","Brodszky, Valentin/0000-0002-6095-2295; Péntek, Márta/0000-0001-9636-6012; Karpati, Sarolta/0000-0002-8472-0712; Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746",,,,,31,59,59,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Using a novel definition of Markov-switching impulse response functions, we find that the response of each country's output growth to commodity price shocks is time dependent, size dependent, and sign dependent. The major evidence of asymmetries in output growth responses occurs when commodity price shocks lead to regime shifts. Thus, we conclude that the design of optimal countercyclical stabilization policies should consider that the reactions of economic activity vary considerably across business cycle regimes.","[Camacho, Maximo] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Murcia, Spain; [Perez-Quiros, Gabriel] Banco Espana, Macroecon Studies Unit, Div Res, Madrid, Spain; [Perez-Quiros, Gabriel] Ctr Econ Policy & Res, Madrid, Spain",University of Murcia; Banco de Espana,"Camacho, M (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Murcia, Spain.",mcamacho@um.es; gabriel.perez@bde.es,"Perez Quiros, Gabriel/HSH-5350-2023; Camacho, Maximo/G-1644-2015","Camacho, Maximo/0000-0003-3158-5614",,,,,32,20,24,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The motivating example is that of an international climate agreement given private information about the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for emissions abatement. Due to multilateral externalities the principal uses her own emissions besides subsidies to incentivize the agent and to assure his participation. Optimal contracts equalize marginal abatement costs and, thus, can be implemented by a system of competitive permit trading. Moreover, optimal contracts can include a boundary part (i.e., the endogenous, type dependent participation constraint is binding), which is not a copy of the outside option of no contract. Compared to this outside option, a contract can increase emissions of the principal for types with a low WTP, and reduce her payoff for high types. Subsidies can be constant or even decreasing in emission reductions, and turn negative so that the agent reduces emissions and pays the principal. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

These data were processed in spreadsheets, prepared with the intention of reconciling the financial statements for regulatory purposes with the information for corporate purposes. It was observed that the existing regulatory norms for the case studied did not fit to update the Brazilian corporate law, the present amendments to Law 6.404/76, the Pronouncements, Interpretations and Technical Guidance Statements. Thus, it not necessarily represent a barrier to corporate changes, lack of regulation or unsuitability or asymmetry could bring little clarity to the financial statements for regulatory purposes, and possible impacts on the values established for the review of the tariffs charged to society.","[Cavalcanti, Luiz; Rodrigues, Raimundo; Araujo, Juliana] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Cavalcanti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.",luiz.cavalcanti@gmail.com; rnrodrigues13@yahoo.com.br; rodrigo_vprazeres@hotmail.com; juhliana.araujo@gmail.com,"Prazeres, Rodrigo/L-5010-2016","Prazeres, Rodrigo/0000-0002-9888-1330",,,,,21,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,14,35,,,,,,22,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000002,0

In Dutch healthcare, a recent policy change is forcing health organizations to deal more efficiently with their real estate, and this increases the need for real estate strategies that are more flexible. In order to support managers in incorporating flexibility in their decision-making over the design of new healthcare facilities, we have developed a method that combines scenario planning and real options. Scenario planning enhances sensemaking over the consequences of future uncertainties, and real options should help in addressing flexibility in decisionmaking through weighing the pros and cons of flexibility measures. We illustrate the sensemaking process by applying the method to a hospital, to a forensic clinic and to a care organization for vulnerable citizens. Data collection took place through interviews and workshops. We found that the identity and characteristics of the workshop participants influenced the sensemaking process. The method proved a useful means of making sense of abstract uncertainties that influence an organization, aspects that are normally outside the scope of real estate managers. The real options approach offered a more structured way of balancing the costs and benefits of strategies in dealing with future uncertainties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
