We show that the larger the bribe a firm offers to a tax collector, the larger the tax rebate it gets. More particularly, we show that the negotiation over bribe and tax payments hinges on four other factors: firms' official liabilities, detection, firms' negotiation power and red tape costs imposed on firms. Some of the predictions from the theoretical model are tested using firm-level data from Uganda. We find that bribe and tax payments are inversely related, thereby supporting the hypothesis of a negotiation taking place between firms and tax collectors. In particular, a 1% point increase in average bribe payments per employee is associated with a 7% point reduction in average amount of tax payments per employee. Results are robust to various instruments dealing with the endogenous relationship between bribes and taxes.","[Gauthier, Bernard] HEC Montreal, Inst Appl Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Goyette, Jonathan] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Econ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Goyette, Jonathan] GREDI, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of Sherbrooke,"Goyette, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Econ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",jonathan.goyette@usherbrooke.ca,,,,,,,38,23,23,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A sample selection approach based on Sartori (2003) is adopted to allow for the potential selection problem which may arise if poor households choose not to seek health care due to concerns regarding its affordability. The results suggest that poor households are less likely to seek health care as compared to non-poor households and that a negative relationship between poverty and experiencing catastrophic health expenditure remains even after allowing for such selection bias. Our findings, which may assist policy-makers concerned with health care system reforms, also highlight factors such as insurance coverage, which may protect households from the risk of incurring catastrophic health expenditure.

There are two possible explanations for these increases: dramatic increases in financial firms' position in the oil futures market and recent increases in oil prices from changes in economic fundamentals. This paper examines the causal relationship between the net financial position and the crude oil price by using three types of Granger non-causality tests: the classical Granger non-causality test, a robust Granger non-causality test and a Granger non-causality test in quantiles. The empirical results provide some evidence of causality from the net financial position to the spot price of crude oil.

Optimal indexation of long-term government debt is studied under two monetary policy regimes: inflation targeting (IT) and price-level targeting (PT). Under IT, full indexation is optimal because long run inflation risk is substantial due to base-level drift, making indexed bonds a better store of value than nominal bonds. Under PT, where long run inflation risk is largely eliminated, optimal indexation is substantially lower because nominal bonds become a relatively better store of value. These results are robust to the PT target horizon, imperfect credibility of PT and model calibration, but the assumption that indexation is lagged is crucial. A key finding from a policy perspective is that indexation has implications for welfare comparisons of IT and PT. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We isolate the role of credit supply factors using the variation in capital growth associated with the bank-specific historical exposure to real estate development and its interaction with the change in house prices in the provinces where the banks operate. We control for the quality of borrowers by using region and industry fixed effects. A 1 % increase in capital growth increases business lending to non-real estate firms by between 0.7 and 0.8 %-a limited magnitude when set against the literature.

A case study of Japan,JAPAN AND THE WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Threshold vector autoregression; Fiscal policy; Demand enhancing effect; Financial stress; Non-Keynesian effect,NUISANCE PARAMETER; GROWTH; MODEL,"In the past two decades, the Japanese government has spent a considerable amount of money to counteract the severe recessions that have recurred since the early 1990s. Numerous studies have pointed out that the effects of these expenditures have diminished since around the 1990s. However, none of these studies has statistically explored the reasons for this diminution, which they implicitly or explicitly mention. The purpose of this study is to statistically investigate these reasons, using a threshold vector autoregression (VAR) in which the causes pointed out in the literature are adopted as the threshold. If the null hypothesis that the estimated parameters are equal under each regime is rejected, we can conclude that a given cause does affect the macroeconomic structure and, in turn, the fiscal policy effects. We then estimate the impulse response functions in both sample periods, as constructed on the basis of threshold estimates, and compare the effects of fiscal policy in each period. The following are the main results of the study. First, we found that the diffusion index of the attitudes of financial institutions toward lending and the yearly change in the annual average of the quarterly ratios of the structural primary budget balance to potential GDP significantly reject the null hypothesis; therefore, we concluded that these variables have a definite impact on fiscal expansion effects. Second, the resulting impulse response functions show that the effects are traditional, although there are some notable differences. In particular, when banks' attitude toward lending is tight and the financial condition of the government is bad, the demand-enhancing effects of government expenditure should be considered weak. In this regard, the traditional accelerator effects of private investment, the existence of liquidity-constrained households, and non-Keynesian effects are key operative concepts.

This change would reduce unfunded accrued liabilities by over half, and would lower the annual contribution increases required to target full funding in 30 years by 44%. Alternative measures that have similar effects on costs include increasing employee contributions by 10.3% of pay while keeping benefits unchanged; or giving employees a collective DC plan with an employer contribution of 10% of pay for future service. If there is a minimum guarantee that benefits cannot fall below their initial levels, the impact of introducing variable annuities is substantially smaller.

The main findings are: the first monthly predictions are best combined by way of the first principal component of the predictions available; the best second monthly prediction is obtained by calculating the median prediction and is more accurate than the first one.","[Poncela, Pilar; Rodriguez, Julio; Sanchez-Mangas, Rocio] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Guerrero, Victor M.] ITAM, Acad Dept Stat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Islas, Alejandro] ITAM, Dept Stat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Autonomous University of Madrid; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Poncela, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",pilar.poncela@uam.es; guerrero@itam.mx; aislas@itam.mx; jr.puerta@uam.es; rocio.sanchez@uam.es,"Sanchez-Mangas, Rocio/H-4740-2015; Guerrero, Victor M./G-1986-2019; Puerta, Julio Rodriguez/D-7196-2012; Poncela, Pilar/AAB-1726-2019","Poncela, Pilar/0000-0002-0848-3997",,,,,20,0,0,0,8,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2014,,113,,,,,75,87,,,,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AU9BM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345886800005,0

Homeowners and renters differ in their mobility costs, renters having lower mobility costs. This paper analyses how the presence of those different types of households affects income sorting and tax differences between local jurisdictions. To this aim, we analyze a model of local income redistribution with mobile (renter) and immobile (homeowner) households. Linear income taxes finance a lump sum transfer. Policies are determined endogenously through voting. In such a framework, if there are no or only few homeowners, no income-sorting equilibrium exists. Above a certain threshold for the homeownership rate we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between tax differences and homeownership rates, such that tax differences between jurisdictions are highest for intermediate homeownership rates.","[Roehrs, Sigrid] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Money & Macroecon, Off 3 42, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Stadelmann, David] Univ Bayreuth, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Bayreuth,"Röhrs, S (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Money & Macroecon, Off 3 42, Grueneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",Sigrid.Roehrs@hof.uni-frankfurt.de,"Stadelmann, David/I-1116-2019","Stadelmann, David/0000-0002-1211-9936",,,,,63,2,2,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We consider two types of mismatch, overqualification and skills mismatches. By differentiating between quantiles, we discriminate between groups of workers with different unobservable earnings conditions. We find that the detrimental effects of skill mismatches on wages are larger than those of overqualification in most segments of the earnings distribution. Moreover, we find that the pay penalty of educational mismatch tends to be higher among workers with higher unconditional wages. This finding suggests that the mismatch phenomenon entails wage losses over and above those attributable to unobservable earnings determinants, including ability and skills possessed by workers.","[Budria, Santiago] Univ Madeira, Dept Econ, P-9000390 Funchal, Portugal; [Moro-Egido, Ana] Univ Granada, Dept Econ Theory & Hist, E-18001 Granada, Spain",Universidade da Madeira; University of Granada,"Budría, S (通讯作者)，Univ Madeira, Dept Econ, P-9000390 Funchal, Portugal.",sbudria@uma.pt,"MORO-EGIDO, ANA I./O-3432-2014; Budria, Santiago/F-4542-2011","MORO-EGIDO, ANA I./0000-0002-5992-1408; Budria, Santiago/0000-0001-5537-4059",,,,,55,14,17,5,58,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In infant industries, a great share of new market opportunities is depleted by firms that spinoff from incumbents. A model emphasizing the relation between incumbents' evolving corporate cultures and the generation of spinoffs explains this regularity in industry evolution. By doing so, we capture different patterns in firm development that finally will help explain the evolutionary paths that industries may follow. We show that organizations reach a critical size that entails the collapse of a cooperative culture and triggers the exodus of personnel founding own firms. Thereby, organizations with a cooperative culture active in a dynamic business environment provide ideal training grounds for potential founders. Moreover, we argue that cooperative firm cultures and processes of entrepreneurial imprinting are important sources of spinoffs' superior capabilities concerning their later market performance.

With only two positions, this condition requires that the click-through rate of the second position is sufficiently smaller than that of the first. When an efficient equilibrium exists, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the auction revenue to decrease as click-through rates increase. Interestingly, under optimal reserve prices, revenue increases with the click-through rates of all positions. Further, we prove that no inefficient equilibrium of the GSP can be symmetric.

Using patent information and data on technological alliances drawn from the CATI-MERIT database, we compare the evidence concerning the so-called triad regions, i.e. United States, Europe and Japan.

(2007) to an interactive setting, and we show that there is a Borel surjective function, mapping each conditional belief hierarchy to its epistemically equivalent lexicographic belief hierarchy. Then, using our equivalence result we construct a terminal type space model for lexicographic belief hierarchies. Finally, we show that whenever we restrict attention to full-support beliefs, epistemic equivalence between a lexicographic belief hierarchy and a conditional belief hierarchy implies that an arbitrary Borel event is commonly assumed under the lexicographic belief hierarchy if and only if it is commonly strongly believed under the conditional belief hierarchy. This is the first result in the literature directly linking common assumption in rationality (Brandenburger et al., 2008) with common strong belief in rationality (Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2002).

First, we specify elasticities of wage share and real exchange rate to the money wage relative to labor productivity, in order to precisely describe the distributive pass-through from money wages to the labor share and the real exchange rate. Second, we analyze the demand effects of an increase in the money wage for given labor productivity (a redistribution towards labor) in both Home and Foreign country, as well as globally. We derive closed form results for two identical countries. These results indicate that redistribution towards labor at Home: (i) always increases growth globally if Home is wage-led, but can lead to lower growth at Home relative to Foreign; and (ii) will always imply lower growth at Home relative to Foreign if Home is profit-led, but can still be growth-enhancing at Home. Thus, to the extent that countries are concerned with their relative economic performance, a fallacy of composition can emerge. Numerical simulations suggest that these fallacies could indeed occur. As a consequence, returns to coordination' over international labor policies might be substantial.","[von Arnim, Rudiger] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Tavani, Daniele] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Carvalho, Laura] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Colorado State University; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"von Arnim, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",rudiger.vonarnim@economics.utah.edu; Daniele.Tavani@colostate.edu; laura.carvalho@fgv.br,"Tavani, Daniele/HSE-9182-2023","Tavani, Daniele/0000-0002-2757-0439",,,,,36,22,23,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,JUL,2014,65.0,3,,,,,430,459,,10.1111/meca.12047,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AH9XA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336497300003,0

Nevertheless, long-term Japanese government bonds' (JGBs) nominal yields initially declined, and have since stayed remarkably low and stable. This is contrary to the received wisdom which holds that higher government deficits and indebtedness will exert upward pressures on nominal yields. This paper examines the relationship between JGBs' nominal yields and short-term interest rates, as well as other factors, such as low inflation, persistent deflationary pressures, and tepid growth. We also argue that Japan has monetary sovereignty, which gives the Japanese government the ability to service its debt, and enables the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to keep JGBs' nominal yields low by ensuring that short-term interest rates are low, and by using various other tools of monetary policy. The argument that short-term interest rates and monetary policy are the primarily drivers of long-term interest rates follows John Maynard Keynes's (1930) insights.","[Akram, Tanweer] ING Investment Management, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Das, Anupam] Mt Royal Univ, Calgary, AB, Canada",Mount Royal University,"Akram, T (通讯作者)，ING Investment Management, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.",,"Akram, Tanweer/AAB-9416-2021","Akram, Tanweer/0000-0002-6646-0902; Das, Anupam/0000-0002-4910-6290",,,,,21,18,18,0,11,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

But while the Lewis model contains a powerful and compelling macro narrative, its details have proved somewhat elusive to scholars and students who have followed, and its policy implications are unclear. This paper identifies several key insights of the Lewis model, discusses several different interpretations of the model, and then reviews modern evidence for the central propositions of the model.

It opens with a rejection of Say's law, then works its way through the determinants and effects of consumption, investment, government spending, and trade. In addition, a great deal of time is spent discussing financial markets (domestic and international) and the balance that must be found between the need to provide liquidity and the instability created by a large number of ignorant individuals. What is not as clear, however, is the nature of what Keynes discussed in chapter 22 of the General Theory: the trade cycle. That said, the ideal tool for addressing this already exists in the book. This article shows that by not ignoring the demand curve in Davidson's capital market model, a much more interesting story can be told. When entrepreneurs' expectations about the growth in demand for the products produced by capital are considered, the logical result is that, as gross investment falls over the expansion, so those expectations are bound to be disappointed. This sets the stage for possibly catastrophic collapses and offers a far more dynamic and Keynes-like story.","Texas Christian Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA",Texas Christian University,"Harvey, JT (通讯作者)，Texas Christian Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,6,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Most existing techniques of estimating the markup are a variant on the Hall (1988) framework that involves manipulating the Solow Residual. However, this paper argues that this notion is based on the unreasonable assumption that labor can be costlessly adjusted at a fixed wage rate. By relaxing this assumption we are able to derive a generalized markup index, which, when estimated using manufacturing data, is highly countercyclical and decreasing in trend since the 1960s. When we then seek to explain what causes the manufacturing markup to behave in this way, the most important determinant is the share of imported goods in the industry. Thus, increasing foreign competition in manufacturing has led to a decline in the industry's markup over time.","[Mazumder, Sandeep] Wake Forest Univ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",Wake Forest University,"Mazumder, S (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Carswell Hall,Box 7505, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",mazumds@wfu.edu,,,,,,,25,10,12,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Based on reform data for six policy areas compiled from various sources during the period 1994-2006 for over 100 countries, we compute composite indicators of reform level and complementarity. We provide qualitative justification for the existence of pair-wise complementarities among policy areas. We then use cross-section and panel data estimates to test the effect of reform level and complementarity on GDP per capita growth. We found reforms to be positively related and their dispersion (or the inverse of complementarity) negatively related to growth, controlling for initial conditions, monetary stability and other structural and institutional variables, as well as endogeneity of reform level and complementarity. We show that the effect of policy complementarity is a stronger condition for sustainable growth in developing than in advanced countries, to conclude that complementary reforms are not a 'luxury' for developing countries.

The ESI assesses the individual-level occurrence of substantial year-to-year declines in available household resources, accounting for fluctuations not only in income but also in out-of-pocket medical expenses. It also assesses whether those experiencing such declines have sufficient liquid financial wealth to buffer against these shocks. We find that insecuritythe share of individuals experiencing substantial resource declines without adequate financial buffershas risen steadily since the mid-1980s for virtually all subgroups of Americans, albeit with cyclical fluctuation.

Exploring subjective, backward- and forward-looking measures of economic insecurity, the paper focuses on: (1) the perceptions of past affordability of primary commodities; and (2) worries about their consumption in the future. We find that low affordability of primary commodities and big worries about their future consumption are experienced by rural residents, people with poor health, and households headed by females, less-educated, and unemployed persons. In addition, low affordability is reported by people with low incomes and non-Russian ethnic minorities, while high affordability is reported by people for whom remittances are the main source of income. Worries about primary commodities are more prevalent among younger households, big-city dwellers and people receiving moderate amounts of remittances. People who have experienced lower affordability of primary commodities in the recent past report higher worries about their consumption in the future.","[Ivlevs, Artjoms] Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Ivlevs, Artjoms] Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of West England; University of Nottingham,"Ivlevs, A (通讯作者)，Univ W England, Bristol Business Sch, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",a.ivlevs@uwe.ac.uk,,"Ivlevs, Artjoms/0000-0002-5398-7705",,,,,40,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Making use of the theorem of Dvoretzky, Wald and Wolfowitz [27] from the statistical decision theory, we obtain new results on stationary Markov perfect equilibria for the aforementioned games, with a general state space, satisfying rather mild continuity and compactness conditions. A novel feature of our approach is the fact that we consider risk averse generations in the sense that they aggregate partial utilities using an exponential function. As a byproduct, we also provide a new existence theorem for intergenerational stochastic game within the standard framework where the aggregator is linear. Our assumptions imposed on the transition probability and utility functions allow to embrace a pretty large class of intergenerational stochastic games analysed recently in macroeconomics. Finally, we formulate a set of assumptions under which the stochastic process induced by the stationary Markov perfect equilibrium possesses an invariant distribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This potentially gives teachers a perverse incentive to teach less during school to increase demand for their tutoring. Through this mechanism, the market for tutoring can adversely affect student learning, especially for students who do not participate in tutoring. I model and present empirical evidence on these effects, using survey and test score data from Nepal. The evidence suggests that when schools offer for-profit tutoring, teachers teach less during the regular school day. As a consequence, performance on the national secondary-school exam appears to suffer among students with a low propensity to enroll in tutoring. An implication is that discouraging teachers from tutoring their own students or reducing entry barriers for third-party tutors could increase student achievement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Binding credit market constraints and incomplete insurance can limit investment in activities with high expected profits. We conducted several experiments in northern Ghana in which farmers were randomly assigned to receive cash grants, grants of or opportunities to purchase rainfall index insurance, or a combination of the two. Demand for index insurance is strong, and insurance leads to significantly larger agricultural investment and riskier production choices in agriculture. The binding constraint to farmer investment is uninsured risk: when provided with insurance against the primary catastrophic risk they face, farmers are able to find resources to increase expenditure on their farms. Demand for insurance in subsequent years is strongly increasing with the farmer's own receipt of insurance payouts, with the receipt of payouts by others in the farmer's social network and with recent poor rain in the village. Both investment patterns and the demand for index insurance are consistent with the presence of important basis risk associated with the index insurance, imperfect trust that promised payouts will be delivered and overweighting recent events.","[Karlan, Dean] Yale Univ, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Karlan, Dean] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Ghana, Legon, Ghana; Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Ghana; Yale University,"Karlan, D (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",christopher.udry@yale.edu,"Osei, Robert Darko/K-3822-2019","Udry, Christopher/0000-0002-1605-1916; karlan, dean/0000-0003-0164-1398",,,,,30,447,540,31,220,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The univariate co-integration tests indicate that the no co-integration hypothesis cannot be rejected in Northern-Kanto, Hokuriku and Kyusyu. Because the univariate co-integration approach might suffer from low power we employed a panel version of the co-integration test recently developed by Westerlund (2006) that also considers the possibility of multiple structural breaks in the level of individual co-integrating equations. The test results lend support for an overwhelmingly long-run relationship between the two variables across regions. Accordingly, this finding is not in line with the unemployment invariance hypothesis. As a result a nationally orientated employment policy aimed at improving the unemployment and labor force participation rates might be preferred over a region-specific employment policy in Japan.

We introduce explicitly into the model the agents' expectations of inflation which create the indeterminacy and show that there are two types of policies-a term structure rule or a forward guidance rule for the short rate-which lead to determinacy. The first consists in fixing the interest rates on a family of bonds of different maturities as function of realized inflation; the second consists in fixing the short-term interest rate and the expected values of the short-term interest rate for a sequence of periods into the future as a function of realized inflation. If the monetary authority chooses an inflation process that satisfies conditions derived in the paper and applies one of these rules, it anchors agents' expectations to this process, in the sense that it is the unique inflation process compatible with equilibrium when the interest rates or expected future values of the short rate are those specified by the term structure or forward guidance rule.","[Magill, Michael] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Quinzii, Martine] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Quinzii, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",magill@usc.edu; mmquinzii@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,33,9,9,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

I compare the welfare implications of these contracts and show that dual-self decision-makers strictly prefer to use carrots instead of either sticks or binding commitments. This is for several reasons: sticks are highly vulnerable to trembles (while carrots are not), sticks and binding commitments create a temptation to cancel them (while carrots do not), and finally carrots allow easy tradeoffs between commitment and flexibility (while sticks and binding commitments do not).

Our field data confirms lab findings for the three-stage design (wage, effort, bonus). Tipping is motivated by reciprocity, but also by reputation concerns among frequent users. Moreover, researchers seem to adjust their effort based on the user's previous tipping behaviour. An efficient sorting takes place when sufficient tip history is available. In addition, we analyse how tipping is adopted when the behavioural default is not to tip and suggest estimates for reciprocal and selfish (strategic and myopic) user types. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The focus of the analysis is on the compensation for earnings lost due to unemployment which is channeled through the welfare systems to this group of people who are clearly vulnerable to the recession's adverse effects. In order to assess the impact of unemployment on household income, counterfactual scenarios are simulated by using EUROMOD, the EU-wide microsimulation model, integrated with information from the EU-LFS data. This paper provides evidence on the differing degrees of relative and absolute resilience of the household incomes of the new unemployed. These arise from the variations in the protection offered by the national tax-benefit systems and from the personal and household circumstances of those most recently at risk of unemployment in the countries considered.","[Salgado, Marina Fernandez] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Salgado, Marina Fernandez] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Figari, Francesco] Univ Insubria, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Figari, Francesco; Sutherland, Holly; Tumino, Alberto] Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex; University of Bath; University of Insubria; University of Essex,"Figari, F (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",francesco.figari@uninsubria.it,"Fernández-Salgado, Mariña/AAB-4698-2019","Fernández-Salgado, Mariña/0000-0003-0294-7719; FIGARI, FRANCESCO/0000-0003-0735-1076",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,33,34,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

As a result, its share of world energy consumption rose to 17.3% in 2009 from 7.9% in 1978. Somewhat surprisingly, through 2000 its rate of energy consumption was about half its rate of economic growth. This trend changed after 2001 as energy consumption rose about 1.3 times more rapidly than did gross domestic product through 2005. Through heavy governmental influence, energy intensity subsequently reduced through 2007, but just marginally. This paper uses the structural decomposition approach to understand key drivers behind changes in China's energy intensity and its energy consumption from 1987 to 2007. In our model, energy intensity change was decomposed into five factors: changes in energy efficiency, changes in share of value added, changes in input structure, changes in consumption structure, and changes in consumption volume. This paper provides insights into how changes in China's economic structure, technology, urbanization, and lifestyle affect energy intensity and energy consumption.","[Zhang, Haiyan; Lahr, Michael L.] Rutgers State Univ, Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Zhang, HY (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",yanzizhy@gmail.com,"Zhang, Haiyan/GMW-7284-2022; Lahr, Michael/R-2510-2019; Lahr, Michael/HSD-9061-2023","Lahr, Michael/0000-0002-2602-2465;",,,,,55,25,27,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Using a decomposition method based on RIF regression, we analyse the increase in happiness inequality observed in Germany between 1992 and 2007, using the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) database, deriving the following findings. First, trends in happiness inequality are mainly driven by composition effects, while coefficient effects are negligible. Second, among composition effects, education has an inequality-reducing impact, while the increase in unemployment contributes to the rise in happiness inequality. Third, increase in average income is associated to a decrease in happiness inequality, while the rise in income inequality cannot be considered as a driver of happiness inequality trends. A clear-cut policy implication is that policies enhancing education and economic performance contribute to reduce happiness inequality and the potential social tensions arising from it.","[Becchetti, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy; [Massari, Riccardo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy; [Naticchioni, Paolo] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy; [Naticchioni, Paolo] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Rome Tor Vergata; Sapienza University Rome; University of Cassino; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Becchetti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy.",p.naticchioni@gmail.com,,"BECCHETTI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-7629-0716",,,,,51,38,38,3,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We formulate conditions on payoffs and network structure such that, starting from an initial seed group, imitative learning results in the overall adoption of cooperation efficient contagion. Key to this result is the pattern of interaction among players who are at the same distance from the initial seed group. We find that the more these agents interact among themselves rather than with players who are closer to or further away from the initial seed group, the easier it is for efficient contagion to take place. We highlight the importance of cycles for efficient contagion, and show that the presence of critical edges prevents it. We also find that networks organized as dense clusters sparsely connected to one another tend to resist efficient contagion. Finally, we find that the likelihood of efficient contagion in a network increases when information neighborhoods extend beyond interaction neighborhoods. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the forecasts based on oil-sensitive stock price indices are able to outperform significantly the no-change forecasts. For example, using the NYSE Arca (AMEX) oil index as a predictor, the 1-month-ahead forecasts for nominal crude oil prices reduce the mean squared prediction error by between 22% (for the West Texas Intermediate oil price) and 28% (for the Dubai oil price). Moreover, we find that the directional forecast based on the AMEX oil index is significantly better than a 50:50 coin toss.

We perform the analysis under alternative pricing assumptions-producer or local currency pricing, along with nominal wage stickiness; under arbitrary degrees of asset market completeness and for general stochastic sequences of devaluations. There are two types of fiscal policies equivalent to an exchange rate devaluation-one, a uniform increase in import tariff and export subsidy, and two, a value-added tax increase and a uniform payroll tax reduction. When the devaluations are anticipated, these policies need to be supplemented with a consumption tax reduction and an income tax increase. These policies are revenue neutral.

Economic growth is viewed as the outcome autocatalytic co-evolution of energy use and the application of new knowledge associated with energy use. It is argued that models of economic growth should be built from innovation diffusion processes, unfolding in history, rather than from a timeless aggregate production function. A simple 'evolutionary macroeconomic' model of economic growth is developed and tested using almost two centuries of British data. The empirical findings strongly support the hypothesis that growth has been due to the presence of a 'super-radical innovation diffusion process' following the industrial deployment of fossil fuels on a large scale in the 19th Century. Also, the evidence suggests that large and sustained movements in energy prices have had a very significant long term role to play.","Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Foster, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",j.foster@uq.edu.au,"CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022","Foster, John/0000-0002-2601-1539",,,,,61,10,11,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In terms of performance, some marginal categories (women and young people) suffer not only from the negative effects of the crisis but also from the deeper structural weakness of the Italian economic system.","[Lucarelli, Carlo] ISTAT, Dipartimento Stat Sociali & Ambientali, I-00144 Rome, Italy; [Mussida, Chiara] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Sociali, Piacenza 29122, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Mussida, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Sociali, Via Emilia Parmense 84, Piacenza 29122, Italy.",chiara.mussida@unicatt.it; calucare@istat.it,,,,,,,56,5,5,0,10,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The tax authority is able to trade-off audit probability against audit effectiveness, but takes the fine rate as fixed in the short run.

For both genders, we find evidence that membership increases the likelihood of graduating on time and graduate school aspirations. For males, however, there appears to be a small, negative impact on grades. For both genders, we find that Greek membership increases the frequency of alcohol and cigarette consumption and decreases religious convictions and religious service attendance. Lastly, Greek organization members are more likely to participate in student government, perform volunteer work, and begin their careers immediately following graduation.

Remittances can be consumed or invested by the recipient. As an investment, funds can be used for farming or to finance other nonfarm productions. In this article, we use a large and nationally representative survey to estimate the effect that remittances have on the probability of producing income from nonfarm activities (diversification) by using a bivariate probit model. Our evidence shows that remittances increase the probability that a rural family engages in nonfarm activities, at least in some regions of Bolivia. We also find evidence that the sender's decision to remit and the recipient's decision to diversify may be jointly determined. As such, this suggests that remittances may serve as a mechanism to overcome localized failures in Bolivia's capital markets.","[Alcala, Naneida Regina Lazarte] Off Planning Res & Stat, Oklahoma Dept Human Serv, Oklahoma City, OK 73105 USA; [Adkins, Lee C.; Lahiri, Bidisha] Oklahoma State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Savvides, Andreas] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Commerce Finance & Shipping, Lemesos, Cyprus",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Cyprus University of Technology,"Adkins, LC (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",lee.adkins@okstate.edu,"Savvides, Andreas/JDM-2201-2023; Lahiri, BIdisha/AAA-6584-2020","Savvides, Andreas/0000-0002-0759-1275; Lahiri, Bidisha/0000-0003-1884-0537",,,,,34,7,8,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, an agent typically cannot save perks; for example, a CEO who owns the right to use a private jet for personal use cannot bank the unused airplane hours. Thus, the principal may oversupply the agent perks to avoid the hidden saving problem. When the agent can both exert lower effort and save wage income, i.e., in the presence of the double deviation problem, we show that the principal supplies more perks than the agent would have purchased on his own (i.e., excessive perks).","[Chien, Yili] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Song, Joon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Song, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",joonsong.econ@gmail.com,"Chien, Yili/I-5741-2016","Chien, Yili/0000-0002-6820-1197",,,,,30,2,2,1,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Focusing on Europe, we trace the differences between advanced economies and emerging markets, as well as the particular case of the Central and Eastern European new member states of the European Union. In addition to variables that have been considered by previous studies, we propose a number of other indicators that capture international financial linkages and which are potentially relevant given the European experience. Our cross-country analysis-which separates the experiences of the EU new member states, emerging Europe, and the other countries-reveals pronounced differences within Europe. Our results suggest that the composition of capital inflows and external debt prior to the crisis are relevant in explaining those differences, both regarding the crisis impact as well as the recovery phase.","[Fraga, Vera; Rocha, Manuel Duarte] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Rocha, Manuel Duarte] CEF UP, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Fraga, V (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",,"Rocha, Manuel Duarte/ABD-6454-2021; Rocha, Manuel Duarte/ABD-6468-2021","Rocha, Manuel Duarte/0000-0003-4765-2981;",,,,,15,5,5,0,7,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

In our first model, signals are almost-perfect if and when they do arrive, that is, each player either observes an almost-perfect signal of period-t play with some lag or else never sees a signal of period-t play. The second model has the same lag structure, but the information structure corresponds to a lagged form of imperfect public monitoring, and players are allowed to communicate via cheap-talk messages at the end of each period. In each case, we construct equilibria in delayed-response strategies, which ensure that players wait long enough to respond to signals that with high probability all relevant signals are received before players respond. To do so, we extend past work on private monitoring to obtain folk theorems despite the small residual amount of private information. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To do so. I determine how closely the impulse responses to a monetary policy shock obtained from country-specific vector-autoregressive (VAR) models and a non-standard panel VAR model match. In the country-specific VAR models, the impulse responses vary across countries in an unrestricted fashion. In the panel VAR model, the impulse responses also vary across countries, but only to the extent that countries differ regarding their financial structure, labor market rigidities and industry mix. For a sample of 20 industrialized countries over the time period from 1995 to 2009, I find that up to 70% (50%) of the cross-country asymmetries in the responses of output (prices) to a monetary policy shock can be replicated by accounting for cross-country differences in financial structure, labor market rigidities and industry mix. Moreover, while in the short run asymmetries in the output responses arise mainly due to cross-country differences in industry mix, in the medium run differences in financial structure and labor market rigidities are more important. Finally, cross-country differences in industry mix appear to be of rather minor importance for cross-country asymmetries in the transmission of monetary policy to prices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Empirical studies have evidenced extensively the existence of co-movement of asset prices or cross-correlation in market returns among these markets, especially in global event. However, there is no theoretical model in literature that can provide economically plausible justifications for these stylized facts. This research intends to fill up such a gap with a simplest possible nonlinear dynamic model. Based on the classical market-maker framework of Day and Huang (1990), a two-market HAM model is developed, which does not only prove in theory the existence of price co-movement but also replicate in simulation this typical characteristic, along with other well known stylized facts characterizing individual financial market. Moreover, theoretical analysis suggests meaningful implications for market opening policy. In particular, in terms of financial stability, a relatively small market may not benefit from market linkage and market opening is essentially a double-edged sword. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The idiosyncratic productivity is not directly observable, but can be learned over time. This setup gives rise to a learning effect and a creative-destruction effect, under which labor flows from plants with low idiosyncratic productivity to those with high idiosyncratic productivity and from old vintages to new vintages.

An analysis as above needs to consider the implications of capital flows in those economies, especially in terms of the 'impossibility' of adopting monetary policies which benefit growth in the national economy. There is also a need to recognise the role of uncertainty and the related changes in market expectations in the (precautionary) accumulations of the large official reserves as are held by these countries. The consequences are found to affect the fabric of growth and distribution in these economies. Recent experiences of China and India, with their deregulated financial sectors, bear this out. Financial integration and free capital mobility, which are supposed to generate growth with stability in terms of the 'efficient markets' hypothesis, have failed, and not only in the advanced economies but also in the high-growth developing economies like India and China. Deregulated finance has led these countries to a state of compliance, where domestic goals of stability and development are sacrificed to make way for the globally sanctioned norms relating to free capital flows. With the global financial crisis and the spectre of recession haunting most advanced economies, issues as above in the high-growth economies in Asia have drawn much less attention than they deserve. This oversight leaves the analysis incomplete by ignoring the structural changes that result in these developing economies which are of much relevance to the pattern of financialisation and turbulence in the global economy as a whole.","Jamia Millia Cent Univ, New Delhi, India",Jamia Millia Islamia,"Sen, S (通讯作者)，Jamia Millia Cent Univ, New Delhi, India.",,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,7,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

This constraint seems to come from traditional economic structure which demands more temporary workers than permanent ones.","Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Sonoda, T (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",sonoda@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23580299, 23243048] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,19,1,1,0,12,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The panel data model and time series region model with/without adaptation are applied at the same time to assess the effectiveness of a common production function. To capture the effects of weather variables we employ a random coefficients model where the production elasticities are the logarithmic function on temperature and rainfall. A Cobb-Douglas production function with additional interaction between inputs and climate variables is applied. We find that the economic impacts of climate change are mixed, that is, some regions are winners and others are losers, and the effect is crop-specific, not general. With adaptation, the economic impacts of warming on grain production are always positive; less precipitation will benefit rice production, but will harm wheat and maize production. Most of the central, western and northern China, which have already been adapted, are less sensitive to climate variables, but some eastern provinces, such as Shandong and Hebei, are very vulnerable. However, this study finds that the adaptation by irrigation is not sensitive to climate change. In summary, the analysis indicates that policymakers should recognize that the climate change would change the productivity of factors, so a regional and crop-specific total-factor-adaptation model is recommended.

We study the corporate tax structure in a small open economy with heterogeneous firms, in a setting where it is optimal to subsidize capital inputs by granting a tax allowance in excess of the true costs of capital. Economic integration reduces the optimal capital subsidy and drives low-productivity firms from the small country's home market, replacing them with high-productivity exporters from abroad. This endogenous policy response creates a selection effect that increases the average productivity of home firms when trade barriers fall, in addition to the well-known direct effects.

When contractors have private information about their costs, the procurer finds it optimal to set damages above expectation damages. There is a lock-in effect, or status quo bias; the agent that has won the award will complete the project even in situations when it would be efficient to abandon it. If the cost types of all agents are above a threshold, the optimal bidding procedure assigns the project by lottery. The optimal mechanism cannot be implemented by standard auction formats. However, the larger the number of agents bidding for the project, the closer auctions with a liquidated damage clause approximate the optimal mechanism.","[Chillemi, Ottorino] Univ Padua, Dept Econ, Padua, Italy; [Mezzetti, Claudio] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Padua; University of Melbourne,"Mezzetti, C (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",cmez@unimelb.edu.au,,"Mezzetti, Claudio/0000-0002-6132-2623",,,,,22,13,14,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Many of these newly independent countries are small both in terms of population and geography, and several are islands. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of island status and country size on institutional quality, and to determine if these institutional effects can explain the relatively strong economic performance of islands and small countries. I distinguish between political institutions (Democracy) and economic institutions (Rule of Law). One of the main findings of this paper is that the relationship between island status and institutional quality is significantly positive, and that these results are robust to the inclusion of a number of control variables. Further, I find that country size is negatively related to institutional quality, which is in keeping with previous results. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that institutions account for these countries' relatively better economic performance. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (1) (2014) 34-60.

In our paper we demonstrate that, if a firm employs at least two workers, it may further benefit from combining worker compensation via a bonus-pool contract and relative performance evaluation. Such combination leads to saved rents under a wide class of luck distributions. In addition, if the employer is wealth-constrained, complementing individual bonus contracts by the possibility of pooling bonuses can increase the set of implementable effort levels. All our results hold even though workers' outputs are technically and stochastically independent so that, in view of Holmstrom's informativeness principle, individual bonus contracts would be expected to dominate bonus-pool contracts.

The modeling framework is a Mankiw-Romer-Weil (MRW) conditional convergence model with path dependence and augmented by measures of the opportunities for RSA, namely indices for the extent of democracy and corruption control. The empirical analysis suggests that, for this group of countries, RSA retards economic growth, in that (i) democratic institutions which are inimical to RSA, are growth enhancing and (ii) reduction in the extent of corruption is growth-enhancing if supported by well-developed democratic institutions. We find also that health is more relevant than educational participation as a measure of human capital development, that path dependence is absent where democracy is weak, and that the MRW model characterizes the growth process more successfully in the stronger democracies.

Pension reform in the Czech Republic has gained new pace. The panel of consultants and experts on pension reform recommended mandatory saving in funds. The Constitutional Court ruled that citizens with higher incomes during their professional careers should receive higher pensions. The government responded by a minor amendment to the Pension Insurance Act and also prepared a major pension reform, which has introduced an opt-out, albeit on a fairly modest scale. The political risks of the current pension reform are considerable. The Czech government is introducing an opt-out in times when the neighbouring countries are slowly abandoning this approach. People are quite sensitive to the problems which are associated with the reform in Central Europe. They have the feeling that government is forcing on them something that does not work elsewhere. A genuine reform should be fiscally neutral, i.e. it should not generate any new fiscal deficits - whether explicit or implicit. Therefore it should be gradually modifying the parameters of the PAYG system. At present, increasing the age of retirement and decreasing the average pension/wage ratio seem to be options.","Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Louzek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",louzek@post.cz,,,,,,,25,3,3,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JAN 2,2014,26.0,1,,,,,89,102,,10.1080/14631377.2014.874657,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AB5YJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331864300006,0

We find that Malaysian banks have exhibited a higher mean total factor productivity level during the post-merger period. The results from the multivariate regression analysis suggest that income diversification and operating expenses are positively and significantly related to Malaysian banks' total factor productivity, while credit risk and inflation exhibit a negative relationship.

A contribution of the present paper is to solve for the housing market equilibrium in the presence of aggregate (interest rate) uncertainty with a realistic mortgage contract. In addition, households also face idiosyncratic uncertainty resulting from stochastic changes over the lifecycle in tastes (or needs) for housing. In this environment, profit-maximizing banks offer fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) contracts to homebuyers. As seems plausible, each housing market transaction is subject to a fixed cost, which gives rise to S-s policy rules for housing transactions: existing homeowners change the size of their houses only if there is a sufficiently large change in the state of the economy (i.e., in interest rates, in their taste for housing, etc.). A plausibly calibrated version of the model is consistent with three empirically documented features of the housing market: (i) highly volatile housing prices and transaction volume, (ii) a strong positive correlation between transaction volume and housing prices, and (iii) a significant negative relationship between interest rates and housing prices, which can rationalize a large part of the recent boom in housing prices in the US and around the world.","Cent Bank Republ Turkey, TR-06100 Ulus Ankara, Turkey",,"Arslan, Y (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ulus Ankara, Turkey.",yavuz.arslan@tcmb.gov.tr,"arslan, yavuz/JOJ-4564-2023","arslan, yavuz/0000-0002-7664-3999",,,,,20,6,6,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We depart from the existing literature on the subject along two dimensions. First, we focus on a model in which the relevant threshold variable describes the state of economic activity rather than credit market conditions. Second, in contrast to the existing TVAR literature, which concentrates exclusively on single-threshold models, we allow for the presence of a second threshold, which is overwhelmingly supported by all relevant statistical tests. Our results indicate that the dynamics of the interactions among credit market conditions, monetary policy and economic activity change considerably as the economy moves from one phase of the business cycle to another and that single-threshold TVAR models are too restrictive to fully capture the nonlinear nature of those interactions. The impact of most shocks tends to be largest during periods of subpar economic activity and smallest during times of moderate economic growth. By contrast, credit risk shocks have the largest impact when output growth is considerably above its long-term trend.","[Avdjiev, Stefan] Bank Int Settlements, Monetary & Econ Dept, Basel, Switzerland; [Zeng, Zheng] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA",Bank for International Settlements (BIS); University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University,"Zeng, Z (通讯作者)，Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",zzeng@bgsu.edu,,,,,,,43,13,13,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Because of this fact, some politicians and policy-makers have argued that society might actually be better off promoting smoking rather than discouraging it. We consider this argument in a general-equilibrium model where health expenditures are paid for by a single-payer health-care system financed by taxes. Because the percentage increase in the tax. base is larger than the percentage increase in health-care expenditures, the elimination of smoking actually decreases the budget-balancing health-care tax rate.

Aggregated measures of social fragmentation may thus conceal the differential effects of its component measures, and obscure important information that may affect the design of public policies.","[Balasubramaniam, Divya] St Josephs Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA; [Chatterjee, Santanu; Mustard, David B.] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",Saint Joseph's University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Balasubramaniam, D (通讯作者)，St Josephs Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA.",,,,,,,,31,6,8,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2014,81.0,321,,,,,140,160,,10.1111/ecca.12056,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,260MT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000327599700007,0

We argue that although there is clear evidence that history matters and has long-term effects, there are not enough data to help us distinguish between the two views. Faced with this uncertainty, what is a social scientist to do? We argue that given the possibility that policy decisions indeed make a difference, it makes sense to assume they do and to try to improve policy making.","[Banerjee, Abhijit V.; Duflo, Esther] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Banerjee, AV (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",eduflo@mit.edu,,,,,,,65,10,10,1,24,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The current exploration shows that most works on the topic of customer engagement into value creation have been performed in the case of services. Their analysis reveals that up till now no complex research has been done that would analyse reasons for engagement into value creation of customers of services and all possible intermediate variables of relations between customer engagement into value creation and loyalty. The aim of this article is to substantiate the integrated approach towards customer engagement into value creation identifying its determining factors and relations with loyalty in the case of health care services. The compiled theoretical framework reflects the integrated approach towards service customer engagement into value creation and encompasses two groups of relations between the research constructs. The results of the empirical research show that patients' engagement into value creation is strongly influenced by communication of a clinic's doctors, and the other three factors have an average influence. It has been revealed that the influence of patients' engagement into value creation on attitude loyalty is stronger not in the case of direct impact of patients' engagement into value creation on loyalty but through intermediate variables. This is based on the research results, which confirm the influence of patients' engagement into value creation on their satisfaction, trust, and relationship strength of a clinic's doctors. All the mentioned variables influence patients' attitude loyalty, and the strongest influence is identified in the case of trust. The influence of patient's engagement into value creation on behaviour loyalty has not been identified.","[Banyte, Jurate; Tarute, Asta; Taujanskyte, Inga] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Banyte, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurate.banyte@ktu.lt; asta.tarute@ktu.lt; inga.taujanskyte@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,21,27,9,101,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The model is specified with traditional gravity variables for gross domestic product and distance, and the variables of specific interest for outward FDI and related characteristics of countries and country pairs. We find that outward FDI reduces merchandise exports as there is a direct, negative outward FDI effect on the increase in bilateral merchandise exports. Internationalization of enterprises and economies through outward FDI serves as the merchandise exports substitutes likely causing home country regional production and employment.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia; [Ferto, Imre] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Inst Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",University of Primorska; Corvinus University Budapest; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@siol.net; imre.ferto@uni-corvinus.hu,"Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372;",,,,,32,4,4,0,19,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

However, evidence that tobacco taxes reduce adult smoking is relatively sparse. In this paper, we extend the literature in two ways: using data from the Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplements we focus on recent, large tax changes, which provide the best opportunity to empirically observe a response in cigarette consumption, and employ a novel paired difference-in-differences technique to estimate the association between tax increases and cigarette consumption. Estimates indicate that, for adults, the association between cigarette taxes and either smoking participation or smoking intensity is negative, small, and not usually statistically significant. Our evidence suggests that increases in cigarette taxes are associated with small decreases in cigarette consumption and that it will take sizable tax increases, on the order of 100%, to decrease smoking by as much as 5%.","[Callison, Kevin] Grand Valley State Univ, Seidman Coll Business, Dept Econ, Grand Rapids, MI 49504 USA; [Kaestner, Robert] Univ Illinois, Inst Govt & Publ Affairs, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",Grand Valley State University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Callison, K (通讯作者)，Grand Valley State Univ, Seidman Coll Business, Dept Econ, Grand Rapids, MI 49504 USA.",kcalli2@uic.edu; kaestner@uic.edu,,,,,,,21,54,56,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Most find that the adoption of a coherent system of new HRM practices such as flexible job definitions, cross-training and work teams, along with extensive reliance on incentive pay, results in substantially higher levels of productivity than more traditional HRM practices. Studies have found that there is a correlation between HRM systems and labour productivity. We find that greatest contributor to labour productivity is the employee's wage is congruent with the literature. The literature to date has shown that HRM practices in isolation may increase productivity or may reduce productivity because they have an inefficient side to them. Our study shows that when aggregated, HRM practices reduce productivity in Canada. Somewhat surprisingly, when combined with benefits, they increase productivity substantially. The main message from the aggregate productivity regressions is that: HRM by itself reduces productivity while HRM with BENEFIT increases productivity. Training by itself increases productivity and training with HRM also increases productivity. Wages clearly have the greatest impact on voluntary quits. HRM is not found to be statistically significant in the reduction of voluntary quits.","[Cozzarin, B. P.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Management Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Jeffrey, S.

A wide variety of social protection systems exist within the EU. Some are of Beveridgean inspiration (with universal and more or less flat benefits), while others are mainly Bismarcldan (with benefits related to past contributions). Concerns about the sustainability of the most generous and redistributive (Beveridgean) insurance systems are often based on the assumption of (near) perfect and costless mobility. In reality, labor mobility remains limited. Such low levels of migration rates could, mistakenly, lead to the conclusion that migration would currently not be affecting the redistributive social insurance systems. We address this issue in a two-country setting, where mobility is costly and where individuals differ in mobility cost (attachment to their native country). A Bismarckian insurance system is not affected by migration while a Beveridgean one is. Our results suggest that the race-to-the-bottom affecting tax rates may be more important under Beveridge-Beveridge competition than under Beveridge-Bismarck competition. Finally, we study the strategic choice of the type of social protection. We show that Bismarckian governments may find it beneficial to adopt a Beveridgen insurance system.","[Cremer, Helmuth; Goulao, Catarina] Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Cremer, Helmuth] Toulouse Sch Econ, IDEI, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Cremer, Helmuth] Toulouse Sch Econ, Inst Univ France, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Goulao, Catarina] Toulouse Sch Econ, INRA, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Institut Universitaire de France; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE,"Goulao, C (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France.",helmuth.cremer@tse-fr.eu; Catarina.Goulao@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,20,1,1,1,15,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

India being an agriculture dependent country, global warming would mean monsoon instability and consequent food scarcity, natural disasters and economic concerns. However with proper policy interventions, CO2 emissions can be controlled. Input-output analysis has been used to estimate direct and indirect CO2 emissions by households for 1993-94, 1998-99, 2003-04 and 2006-07. Complete decomposition analysis of the changes in CO2 emissions between 1993-94 and 2006-07 has been done to identify the causes into pollution, energy intensity, structure, activity and population effects according to broad household consumption categories. Results indicate that activity, structure and population effects are the main causes of increase in CO2 emission from household fuel consumption. To identify the causes at the sectoral level a second decomposition has been done for changes between 2003-04 and 2006-07 to identify the causes in the next stage. Finally alternative energy policy options have been examined for each consumption category to reduce emissions. Combined strategies of technology upgradation, fuel switching and market management in order to reduce CO2 emissions for sectors like Batteries, Other non-electrical machinery, Construction and Electronic equipments (including Television), for which all the effects are positive, need to be adopted.

We propose a model where a group of agents commit to give preference to their members when making job offers. This endogamic behavior is advantageous because members enjoy preferential job offers, but they incur in link costs and potential efficiency losses. Unlike the standard approach to favoritism, agents in our model make strategic joining decisions and as a result of the counterbalancing effects of favoritism, an optimal clique size appears in equilibrium. We show that favoritism is not compatible with large inefficiency losses and that there exists a non-monotonic relation between the unemployment level and favoritism practices. Societies with multiple equilibria are also found.","[Duran, Miguel A.] Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias Econ, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Morales, Antonio J.] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Universidad de Malaga,"Duran, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias Econ, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",maduran@uma.es; amorales@uma.es,"Morales, Antonio J/A-4426-2013; Duran, Miguel A./K-7896-2014","Morales, Antonio J/0000-0002-2843-8245; Duran, Miguel A./0000-0002-2004-5586",,,,,23,0,2,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Optimists, who expect high house price growth, buy in anticipation of capital gains; pessimists, who expect capital losses, prefer to rent. Because of short-selling constraints on housing, pessimistic expectations are not incorporated in the price of owned houses and the equilibrium price is higher and more volatile relative to the benchmark case of common information.

The existence of working poverty proves that even if employment growth still represents the best way to avoid poverty risk it is not always enough, actions being needed to create not only more jobs, but also better jobs. The aim of this paper is to highlight the main causes and mechanism of working poverty in the EU countries, in the recent economic crisis and recovery period (2007-2012), in order to identify some possible measures that need to be taken so that in-work poverty reduces. The comparative analysis shows that the phenomenon of working poverty has been growing in sixteen EU countries and the prevalence of in-work poverty varies significantly across these countries. The correlation and regression analysis results suggest that gaps in the national human and economic development can be explained by disparities in working poverty rate. Vulnerable and precarious employment represents an important factor behind the high level of working poverty from the EU countries in the analysed period. By taking into consideration the cumulative influence of multiple socio-economic variables, for the (2007-2012) period, results of principal components analysis and cluster analysis highlight that there are common features and differences between the EU Member States according to their working poverty, employment performances, efficiency of welfare state system and the level of human and economic development. The findings of this study can be useful for policy makers in order to reduce the phenomenon of working poverty.","Petru Maior Univ Tirgu Mures, Targu Mures 540088, Mures Cty, Romania","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures","Herman, E (通讯作者)，Petru Maior Univ Tirgu Mures, Nicolae Iorga Str 1, Targu Mures 540088, Mures Cty, Romania.",emilia.herman@ea.upm.ro,"Herman, Emilia/GQB-3206-2022; Herman, Emilia/K-7284-2014; Herman, Emilia/S-8210-2019","Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585; Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585; Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585",,,,,48,15,16,4,53,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

While the new growth theory holds that international trade may spur economic growth by facilitating the adoption of new technology and specialization, the evidence of this study suggests that, to take full advantage of the technology transfer induced by international trade, countries need to develop their financial systems, especially their stock markets. The empirical results indicate that in countries with higher stock market development more trade openness enhances economic growth, while in countries with less stock market development the ability of trade to facilitate growth is feeble.","[Huang, Liang-Chou] Aletheia Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Chang, Shu-Hwa] Shih Hsin Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",Aletheia University; Shih Hsin University,"Huang, LC (通讯作者)，Aletheia Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",liangchou@mail.au.edu.tw,,,,,,,60,19,22,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

It has appeared that including resilience measures in the modelling approach, which may mute the losses considerably, is a challenging task. At the same time it is necessary because it prevents the modeller from generating overestimates. This study presents two directions to improve the modelling of (economic) resilience for which the state-of-the art with respect to dynamic inoperability input-output modelling is taken as a starting point. Firstly, the new model allows for a different recovery path than the traditionally assumed 'concave up decreasing curve' describes for a disrupted infrastructure or economic sector in the aftermath of a disaster. In this paper, we explain how the recovery path may depend on the type of disaster. Secondly, the model refines the aspect of 'inventory' as a resilience measure. Inventory is interpreted in a broad sense here: it can be any resilience measures which enable an infrastructure or economic sector to continue its supply despite being disrupted. The model is applied to both a simple two-sector illustrative example and a severe winter storm scenario in Europe using economic data from the World Input-Output Database to show its practical usefulness.","[Jonkeren, Olaf; Giannopoulos, Georgios] Inst Protect & Secur Citizen, Joint Res Ctr JRC, European Commiss, Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Jonkeren, O (通讯作者)，PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands.",olaf.jonkeren@pbl.nl,"Giannopoulos, Georgios/AAU-5110-2020","Giannopoulos, Georgios/0000-0001-5443-7011",,,,,23,42,49,4,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Contract enforcement makes trade possible but requires an aggregate investment of capital that is no longer available for production. In such an economy, more dispersion in ex-ante marginal products makes it optimal to invest more resources in enforcement. Furthermore, implementing the optimal allocation requires a specific distribution of the cost for enforcement across agents that is not monotonic and results in a redistribution of endowments. At the efficient solution, agents at the bottom of the endowment distribution benefit the most from investment in enforcement and these investments lead to a reduction in consumption and income inequality.","[Koeppl, Thorsten] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 2B5, Canada; [Monnet, Cyril] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland; [Monnet, Cyril] Study Ctr Gerzensee, CH-3115 Gerzensee, Switzerland; [Quintin, Erwan] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Queens University - Canada; University of Bern; Study Center Gerzensee; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Koeppl, T (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 2B5, Canada.",thor@econ.queensu.ca; cyril.monnet@vwi.unibe.ch; equintin@bus.wisc.edu,,"Monnet, Cyril/0000-0001-6376-4129",,,,,21,16,16,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Acquired data reflect the personal views of managers from the monitored enterprises and are expressed in nine variables detailing the internal environment and eight variables detailing the external environment. In our study, the significant influence on competitiveness was found only for the two variables from the internal environment - the ability to flexibly adapt to their customers and the innovation activity of enterprises, though in different time periods. The first one was found to be influential in 2007, at the time of economic growth. The results reflect the fact that managers of enterprises from the first two groups (with higher and average Return on Assets) are homogenous in their opinions with regard to the influence over competitiveness in the capabilities to adapt flexibly to customers, while managers of financially inefficient enterprises held different opinion regarding this issue.

This method assumes that a car is a bundle of objectively and subjectively measurable attributes (i.e. functional features) provided to users. The car's technical value is thus a measure of the overall benefit it delivers to users, while the car's technical efficiency measures a relative benefit the users gain when they utilize a particular car model charged by certain ownership and usage costs. Technical efficiency is calculated by implementing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). As an example, the method is implemented to conduct a retrospective benchmarking study in the Italian domestic passenger car market in the years 1970s-1990s. Results show that cars differed remarkably due to their technical efficiency, but only 35 car models in the sample have been classified by DEA as 100 % efficient. Car models sold in the 1980s resulted not so competitive in terms of technical efficiency as models sold in the 1970s and 1990s. The results also revealed that the technical value increases with the purchasing cost, but it diminishes with the usage cost. As additional value to literature and practice, the method suggests insights about how: a) to compare cars in a multi-dimension features space; b) to analyze technological trends in the car industry; c) to study the car market structure and identify the emergence of market niches still unexploited by automotive manufacturers.","Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, I-80125 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"lo Storto, C (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Piazzale Tecchio 80, I-80125 Naples, Italy.",corrado.lostorto@unina.it,"Storto, Corrado lo/C-9779-2018",,,,,,50,4,4,0,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In the 2000s, domestic reforms expanded the effective labor force, restrained wages, shifted income toward profits and increased corporate saving. As a result, the Chinese and German current account surpluses widened, and that of Germany has proven more persistent, with subdued domestic investment. China is an early-stage creditor, holding a short equity position and a long position in safe debt. Germany 's balanced net debt and equity claims mark it as a mature creditor that provides insurance to the rest of the world. China pays to lay off equity risk, while Germany, by contrast, harvests a moderate yield on its net claims. In both economies, the shortfall of the net international investment position from cumulated current account surpluses arises from exchange rate changes, asymmetric valuation gains, and, in Germany's case, credit losses.","[Ma, Guonan] Bank Int Settlements, Representat Off Asia & Pacific, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [McCauley, Robert N.] Bank Int Settlements, Monetary & Econ Dept, Basel, Switzerland",Bank for International Settlements (BIS); Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Ma, GN (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Representat Off Asia & Pacific, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",guonan.ma@bis.org; mccauley@bis.org,,,,,,,54,8,8,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2014,22.0,1,,,,,1,29,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12050.x,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AJ0RS,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337364000001,0

I build a heterogeneous agent life cycle model which features uninsurable income and expense shocks. Moreover, households can borrow and save simultaneously. When a borrower defaults on her debt by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, she can keep her assets up to the wealth exemption level. Wealth exemption levels are important for two reasons. First, they explain the extensive and intensive margin of the credit card debt puzzle. Around thirty percent of borrowers, both in the model and in the data, who borrow at high interest rates simultaneously save at low interest rates. However, these borrowers borrow and save only relatively small amounts, a few thousand U.S. Dollars. Second, ignoring the exemption level biases results because it overstates the costs of defaulting. The welfare gains from Chapter 7 compared to the European system, where debt is not discharged, are twice as high when exemption levels are positive compared to when they are ignored. At the same time, wealth exemption levels are unimportant in the sense that they have an impact only at low exemption levels. The effects of increases in the exemption level fade out very quickly. There is no strong positive relationship between exemption levels, which vary across U.S. states, and default rates in the model. This is in contrast to the previous literature, but consistent with the data. The reason is that those borrowers who might default do not own much wealth. Therefore, only very few households are affected by increases in the exemption level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

When this feature is properly taken into account, the modeled real business cycle small open economy, calibrated for Spanish data, is able to explain several distinct stylized facts for this economy. In particular, it explains the larger than standard volatility of private consumption, and the different cyclical properties of inflation for non-tradable and tradable goods.

A catastrophic event of this magnitude would have surely created some long-run effects to the regional economy as well as to the surrounding regions. Additionally, the recovery and reconstruction activities would have affected the economic structure of the region and interdependence between regions in a potentially different way from the original growth trend before the event. While these long-run economic effects may have become sizable, few studies have been conducted to empirically measure or evaluate such effects, due to the significant noises in economic data muddled with macroeconomic influences from the outside. This paper presents an empirical investigation of long-run economic effects of the Kobe Earthquake, using structural decomposition methods. The results indicate significant changes in economic structure of the Kobe economy, and the changes are quite different across sectors and among factors. An additional investigation using shift-share analysis yielded the regional-specific changes; the corresponding decomposed factors of structural analysis with shift-share results appear complicated, and changes in regional final demand were found to be most influential to the changes in output for many sectors.","Univ Kitakyushu, Grad Sch Social Syst Studies, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan",University of Kitakyushu,"Okuyama, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Kitakyushu, Grad Sch Social Syst Studies, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan.",okuyama@kitakyu-u.ac.jp,,"Okuyama, Yasuhide/0000-0003-1602-996X",,,,,34,9,11,2,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

In recent years, developing countries like Malaysia have increasingly emphasised the need to reduce the gender gap in society in their strive for development. The Sixth Malaysia Plan(19911995) identified gender differences in education and this was seen as a constraint to the participation of women in the labour market. After two decades, Malaysia has succeeded in closing the gender gap in education but gender imbalances in the labour market still prevail, i.e. there is a disconnect between the level of education Malaysian women have received and their achievements in the economy. As such the issue of gender inequality in the labour market remains a problem that has to be grappled by Malaysia. The discussion in this paper focuses on the gender disparity in Malaysia in various aspects of the labour market such as labour force participation rate, unemployment rate, employment status occupational distribution (particularly in terms of female representation in high ranking positions) and earnings. It is acknowledged that the government plays an important role in addressing the issue of gender disparity. As such this paper analyses the policies and strategies that have been introduced to tackle gender disparities in Malaysia and makes recommendations of other policy measures that can be taken to enhance gender equality in the Malaysian labor market.","[Qi, Cheong Jia; Fernandez, Jacqueline Liza] Univ Sains Malaysia, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Qi, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, George Town, Malaysia.",jiaqi1121@hotmail.my; lfjacq@usm.my,"Jia Qi, Cheong/GMX-0170-2022; Fernandez, Jacqueline/JTV-0750-2023; , Cheong Jia Qi/AIA-5718-2022","Jia Qi, Cheong/0000-0002-2633-3458;",,,,,14,1,1,0,4,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-206-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,63,70,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0OB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366474600009,0

The aim of this research is to analyze the existing patterns affecting knowledge spillovers from technical universities in the selected CEE countries. The latter couldn't be achieved without using qualitative methods of research. Therefore the major method of this research is the qualitative survey research based on interviews with Heads of R&D departments at selected technical universities in the CEE countries. The research findings indicate the importance of interaction and complementarity between local and distant sources of knowledge. Furthermore, the role of local knowledge sourcing (home universities and other R& D institutions within the region) seems to be determined by the type of knowledge itself and may vary from one scientific field to another. For example, the local sourcing of knowledge in the fields such as IT and chemistry is particularly important for space engineering research; electronics, telecommunications, computer hardware and software for communication research or biochemistry, pharmacology, agriculture and IT for biotechnology research.","Kozminski Univ, TIGER Res Ctr, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Runiewicz-Wardyn, M (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, TIGER Res Ctr, Jagiellonska 59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland.",mruniewi@tiger.edu.pl,"Runiewicz-Wardyn, Malgorzata/AAB-9667-2020","Runiewicz-Wardyn, Malgorzata/0000-0002-0468-3705",,,,,29,4,4,0,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Song (2014) recently developed a local asymptotic minimax estimation theory for a parameter that is a nondifferentiable transform of a regular parameter, where the transform is a composite map of a continuous piecewise linear map with a single kink point and a translation-scale equivariant map. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, this paper extends the local asymptotic minimax theory to nondifferentiable transforms that are a composite map of a Lipschitz continuous map having a finite set of nondifferentiability points and a translation-scale equivariant map. Second, this paper investigates the discontinuity of the local asymptotic minimax risk in the true probability and shows that the proposed estimator remains to be optimal even when the risk is locally robustified not only over the scores at the true probability, but also over the true probability itself. However, the local robustification does not resolve the issue of discontinuity in the local asymptotic minimax risk.","Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Song, K (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0731-9053,,978-1-78441-182-4; 978-1-78441-183-1,ADV ECONOMETRICS,,,2014,33.0,,,,,,557,585,,10.1108/S0731-905320140000033015,0.0,,,29,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360559300016,0

Existing literature defines several typical factors (patterns) which influence this key decision every household has to Make. In our analysis we propose one more factor which might be of interest. Based on the data covering last phase of the rent deregulation process in the Czech Republic (CR) in 2005 2011 we assess to what extent rent deregulation in the CR has influenced the tenure choice patterns. Our analysis using logit model did prove that regulated rents were an important factor affecting tenure choice. After deregulation households living in apartments with regulated rent preferred to buy house rather than stay in rental sector. The results show that also in the CR was tenure choice influenced by household income, education, marital status. By contrast, gender, age, number of children or retired persons in the household turned out to be insignificant.","[Spalkova, Dagmar; Spalek, Jiri] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Spalková, D (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",dasa@econ.muni.cz; spalek@econ.muni.cz,"Špalková, Dagmar/JWO-4070-2024; Špalek, Jiří/J-9210-2012; Špalková, Dagmar/H-6423-2013","Špalek, Jiří/0000-0001-5832-4946; Špalková, Dagmar/0000-0001-6977-1426",,,,,26,4,4,0,21,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Existing studies have been criticized for their reliance on unit root tests which are deemed to suffer from certain weaknesses such as the size distortion bias arising from heteroskedasticity. In this paper, we provide new evidence on PPP based on a new methodology that overcomes this problem. We use the widely accepted KSS (Kapetanios et al., 2003) non-linear unit root tests which we, however, wild bootstrapped. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that the wild-bootstrapped KSS is robust to heteroskedasticity-induced size distortion problem. We apply this method to test PPP across 61 countries over the period 1994 to 2012 a period characterized by a number of crises such as the Asian Financial Crisis, Russian Crisis, dotcom crisis, Global Financial Crises, among others, and therefore, intense heteroskedasticity. Our results provide strong evidence against PPP. This paper contributes to both the international financial economics and econometrics literatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the continuing overreactions result in a short-term momentum and a long-term reversal.

A national home price index and mortgage rate are used to measure national impacts on the local markets. A mix of socio-economic variables estimates local impacts. We find no results indicating that national trends lack relevance in local markets; however, we find wide support for the additional inclusion of local socio-economic factors in all markets.

Importantly, the reduced separation rates are due mainly to reductions in layoffs, occur in the first six months of a job and are present for unskilled workers of all ages. Thus, jobs in higher minimum wage regimes are more stable but harder to get.

The generalized idea in the literature that cyclical crises are normally caused by a decline in the profit rate is confronted; the cyclical decline in the profit rate is a plausible cause of six out of ten postwar U.S. cyclical crises, but it is doubtful that this can be postulated as the case in the remaining four. Of these six crises, most of them can be related to the offensive rising strength of the labor variant of crisis. Finally, it is argued that analysis of the profit rate short-term dynamics is insufficient to provide a specific characterization of the neoliberal crises in opposition to the crises of the Keynesian period in the U.S. economy.","Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Dept Econ, Mexico City 13, DF, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"Izquierdo, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Dept Econ, Mexico City 13, DF, Mexico.",scamara@correo.azc.uam.mx,"Izquierdo, Sergio Cámara/I-2265-2017",,,,,,13,7,9,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Previous literature has focused on the relatively straightforward case of a proportional income tax or the top MTR only. The paper examines revenue responses at both the individual and aggregate levels, and it is shown that for individual MTRs within a multi-rate regime, simple expressions for tax revenue responsiveness can be derived that nevertheless capture the various behavioural and structural responses to income tax reforms involving changes to multiple rates and thresholds. Illustrations are provided using changes to the New Zealand income tax structure in the 2010 budget.

However, the state of public finances has often necessitated higher borrowing to finance widening fiscal deficits. Indeed, recent austerity packages around the globe have crystalized the importance of fiscal consolidation against the backdrop of rising public debt. To shed light on recent debates regarding fiscal multipliers, the article estimates variation in these multipliers with the method of financing, using annual data for a sample of industrial countries. There is a large variation in the effects of expansionary and contractinary government spending shocks on economic variables within and across countries. The significant effects of negative government spending shocks (fiscal contraction) appear more prevalent than those of expansionary shocks on real output growth, price inflation and nominal wage inflation. Consistent with theory's predictions, the fiscal multiplier is more likely to be negative when government spending is financed by issuing debt and less likely in the case of monetization. The evidence confirms concerns about the negative effect of higher debt and more expensive financing on private activity, countering the effectiveness of fiscal policy.","Egyptian Ctr Econ Studies, Cairo 11221, Egypt",,"Kandil, ME (通讯作者)，Egyptian Ctr Econ Studies, Cairo 11221, Egypt.",mKandil@eces.org.eg,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The research was focused on the relationship of small organizations to crisis prevention. The purpose is to find out the attitude of small organizations to crises from strategic point of view in order to ensure not only their survival but also their competiveness. The goal is to identify what strategies, if any, small organizations use for crises prevention. The factor analysis identified two crisis prevention strategies. One strategy is focused on creating and updating a crisis plan and crisis team. The other is based on appropriate behaviour to employees and surroundings so that the organization builds up their loyalty. Preparation for crises is mostly complicated by the financing gap which could be expected in small organizations and managers also declared they were too busy to deal with crisis prevention. Based on the statistically processed data obtained from empirical research the author came to the conclusion that, although many small organizations know their weaknesses and external threats and try to take precautionary measures, the preparation for a potential crisis has still not become a normal part of managerial work and it is not appreciated as a feature of competitiveness. Statistical tools of correlation analysis and factor analysis were used in the research.","Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Mikusová, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",marie.mikusova@vsb.cz,"Mikusova, Marie/H-2967-2018","Mikusova, Marie/0000-0003-0183-806X",,,,,21,14,14,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We test for policy complementarities between these reforms and demand-side efforts to deter age discrimination, specifically studying whether stronger state-level age discrimination protections enhanced the impact of the 1983 Social Security reforms that increased the full retirement age (FRA) and reduced benefits. The evidence indicates that, for older individuals for whom early retirement benefits fell and the FRA increased, stronger state age discrimination protections were associated with delayed benefit claiming and increases in employment, with benefit claiming pushed from 65 to the new FRA, and increased employment after age 62 and age 65 that is then curtailed at the new FRA.

Such investigations, however, remain substantially circumscribed to private sectors, while the role of these factors in public sector performance has been largely disregarded. In this paper we aim at filling this gap in empirical literature by combining different data-sources and constructing a panel of comparable data about output quality, input costs, ICI investments, skills and organizational changes in public administrations of 16 European countries. We propose an index-based approach to the measurement of PA performance relying on the adoption of public e-services as a proxy of revealed output quality, and provide an econometric analysis of how the co-evolution of ICT, skills and organizational factors affects government effectiveness.

In the context of a bivariate VARMA, GARCH-in-mean, asymmetric BEKK model, we show that increased Divisia money growth volatility (irrespective of the level of aggregation and the method of calculation) is associated with a lower average growth rate of real economic activity. However, there are no effects of simple-sum money growth volatility on real economic activity, except with the Sum M1 and perhaps Sum M2M aggregates.

We use two difference-in-differences comparisons over the study period 1988-1999, first comparing single mothers to single childless women, and then comparing single mothers with two or more children to single mothers with exactly one child. In both cases we find that the EITC expansions are associated with a relative decline in the unsecured debt of affected households of single mothers.

We assess this element of leadership in a game in which it emerges spontaneously since people have a non-obvious possibility to take the initiative. We can show that leadership in this game correlates with real life activities associated with taking the initiative. Combining this game with other experimental games and with questionnaires, we investigate the personality characteristics that entail leadership. We find efficiency concerns and generosity to be important determinants of leadership. Leaders have an internal locus of control and are more patient than non-leaders, but they are not different from the non-leaders with respect to risk attitude.

J,"Ge, FL; Fan, Y",,,,"Ge, Fenglong; Fan, Ying",,,Quantifying the risk to crude oil imports in China: An improved portfolio approach,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Risk to crude oil imports; Correlation coefficient; Portfolio theory,ENERGY; SECURITY,"China's rapid economic development caused a sharp increase in crude oil demand. In 2011, China imported 254 million tons of crude oil in total, with its dependence on imported oil reaching 56.5%. This paper carries out a quantitative study on the risk of China's crude oil imports by establishing an assessment model which has two primary characteristics. First, the model not only uses portfolio theory to assess the risk to China's crude oil imports, taking into consideration the effect of the diversified sources of imports, but also introduces a correlation coefficient which considers the risks associated with importing oil from oversea sources. Second, the correlation between import prices and global oil prices is analyzed with respect to each exporting country. The Ease of Doing Business Index grading system is introduced in order to represent the risk weight for each exporting country. Because of these improvements, the model provides operable methods for studying how global oil prices, import volumes, the diversification index, and the political and economic situation of the exporting countries affects China's crude oil import risks as well as offers a method for implementing optimal crude oil import strategies. It is concluded that China's crude oil import risks associated with the Middle East are not as precarious as researchers traditionally reported. Among countries in the Middle East, there exist obvious disparities and differences affecting the kinds and types of risks involved. Therefore, these risks should be treated piecemeal when performing an overall assessment of crude oil import risks in China. It should also be noted that with respect to the Middle East there is still room for China to optimize the mix of source countries in order to reduce risks. China should raise the volume of imports coming from low risk countries as well as add new low risk exporting countries to its importing portfolio. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using a large sample of public school teachers from the year 2007, the results of this study suggest that teachers who work in districts that use a merit pay system are no less satisfied with their jobs than are other teachers; these results are consistent for both an ordered probit model and a two-stage analysis. Although the effect of merit pay on overall job satisfaction was insignificant, teachers in merit pay districts were less enthusiastic, did not think teaching was important, and were more likely to leave for better pay. However, in examining a sample of teachers who worked only in merit pay districts, it was found that teachers who received merit pay were more satisfied overall with their jobs than were teachers who did not receive merit pay.","Quinnipiac Univ, Dept Econ, Hamden, CT 06518 USA",Quinnipiac University,"Gius, M (通讯作者)，Quinnipiac Univ, Dept Econ, Hamden, CT 06518 USA.",Mark.gius@quinnipiac.edu,,,,,,,28,9,26,5,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

J,"Gliksberg, B",,,,"Gliksberg, Baruch",,,Monetary policy and fiscal limits with no-default,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fiscal limits; Fiscal theory of prices; Monetary fiscal regimes; Open market operations; Debt devaluation,,"This paper discusses monetary and fiscal policy interactions that stabilize government debt. Two distortions prevail in the model economy: income taxes and liquidity constraints. Possible obstructions to fiscal policy include a ceiling on the equilibrium debt-to-GDP ratio, zero or negative elasticity of tax revenues, and a political intolerance of raising tax rates. At the fiscal limit two mechanisms restore solvency: fiscal inflation, which reduces the real value of nominal debt, and open market operations, which diminish the size of government debt held by the private sector. Three regimes achieve this goal. In all regimes monetary policy is passive. In all regimes a muted tax response to government debt is consistent with equilibrium. The propensity of a fiscal authority to smooth output is found to determine what is an acceptable response (in the form of tax rate changes) to the level of government debt, while monetary policy determines the timing and magnitude of fiscal inflation.

We take up this issue here and show the effects of trade liberalization on the final goods and/or the intermediate goods, where the domestic firm pays unionized wage and imports intermediate goods. We show that trade liberalization on the intermediate goods (final goods) increases (decreases) the unionized wage, labor union's utility and domestic profit. Trade liberalization on both the final goods and intermediate goods may either increase or decrease the domestic unionized wage, labor union's utility and domestic profit depending on the input coefficients and the initial tariff levels. Our qualitative results are robust with respect to the intermediate goods market structure, the pricing strategy of the intermediate goods producers and the union's objective function.","[Mukherjee, Arijit] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Liu, Yao] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Int Econ & Trade, Dalian, Peoples R China",Loughborough University; Dongbei University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Int Econ & Trade, Dalian, Peoples R China.",A.Mukherjee@lboro.ac.uk,"MUKHERJEE, Arijit/J-9398-2019; MUKHERJEE, Arijit/JJC-1751-2023",,,,,,21,3,3,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The software SIMB-E, in which a cash flow model applied to biodiesel production is implemented, was used during simulations. Economic indexes related to biodiesel production features, as well as the competitiveness between selling prices of biodiesel and petrodiesel were considered. It was found that all of the 8 simulated scenarios were potentially profitable, but only 2 of them presented competitive biodiesel selling prices, being considered as worthwhile projects. These were seed-oil plants with alkaline transesterification. Results also indicated that the success of biodiesel production still requires additional revenues beyond that derived from biodiesel itself, including income from the feedstock coproducts and glycerol. Macauba showed to be a potential crop to be used in biodiesel production. However, the domestication and improvement on processing of this species are indispensable to ensure its availability of long-term use. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Theory and evidence from WTO Countries,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROTECTION; LIBERALIZATION; SALE; TARIFFS; CLAUSE,"International trade agreements are an important element of the world economic system, but questions remain as to their purpose. The terms-of-trade hypothesis posits that countries use tariffs in part to improve their terms of trade and that trade agreements cause them to internalize the costs that such terms-of-trade shifts impose on other countries. This article investigates whether the most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs set by World Trade Organization (WTO) members in the Uruguay Round are consistent with the terms-of-trade hypothesis. We present a model of multilateral trade negotiations featuring endogenous participation that leads the resulting tariff schedules to display terms-of-trade effects. Specifically, the model predicts that the level of the importer's tariff resulting from negotiations should be negatively related to the product of two terms: exporter concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (sum of squared export shares), and the importer's market power, as measured by the inverse elasticity of export supply, on a product-by-product basis. We test this hypothesis using data on tariffs, trade, and production across more than 30 WTO countries and find strong support. We estimate that the internalization of terms of trade effects through WTO negotiations has lowered the average tariff of these countries by 22% to 27% compared to its noncooperative level.","[Ludema, Rodney D.] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Ludema, RD (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,45,66,75,1,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

However, as demonstrated in the history of financial instability, the behavior of financial institutions plays an important role. This paper examines how lenders' attitudes affect macroeconomic performance. In our analysis, the economy is composed of multiple borrowers (firms) and one lender (bank). Each borrower is directly connected to the lender through its credit contract. At the same time, each borrower is indirectly connected to all the other borrowers within the credit network. Using this model, we execute computer simulations to examine the economic consequences of lending attitudes. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the bank's lending attitude functions as a financial accelerator; that is, it significantly affects the dynamics of the economic system through the credit network. Consequently, the same level of exogenous shock generates completely different outcomes depending on the different lending attitudes. The results also show that there exists an optimal lending attitude that leads to high economic growth and a stable growth path.","Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Management & Econ, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan",Tohoku University,"Asanuma, D (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Management & Econ, Aoba Ku, 27-1 Kawauchi, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan.",b1ek1006@student.econ.tohoku.ac.jp,,,,,,,31,7,8,1,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Despite its centrality to other areas of investigation, such as currency crises, the role of the credibility of the peg has hitherto been ignored. Fluctuations in perceived devaluation probabilities will move domestic interest rates, given foreign interest rates, even if countries have no genuine monetary independence. Using data for 126 countries from 1990, it is shown that countries on credible pegs without capital controls follow foreign interest rates closely, and that the hypothesis of complete lack of monetary independence cannot be rejected in this case. Our findings are robust to alternative measures of credibility (inflation differentials; types of peg), and to different ways of classifying exchange rate regimes and identifying capital controls.","[Bleaney, Michael] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Lloyd, Timothy] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Bleaney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",michael.bleaney@nottingham.ac.uk,"Lee, Hock-Ann/AAJ-1941-2021","Lee, Hock-Ann/0000-0001-5435-9164",,,,,17,8,9,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Existing studies provide detailed analyses on the age dynamics of job creation and destruction, assuming that workers of all ages search for jobs in the same market. This paper examines a related environment that has drawn less attention, where the labor market is exogenously segmented by age. The paper finds sufficient conditions for the model to yield unambiguous predictions on the age profiles of key variables, and compares them with the corresponding conditions in models with a single market. The paper further examines the age profiles of these key variables in the efficient allocation. In particular, with no persistence in idiosyncratic match productivity, the efficient allocation is found to exhibit monotonic age profiles for the job finding and separation rates.

The advantage of the HM analysis is that it indicates when structural breaks occur in history.","[Brakman, Steven; Inklaar, Robert] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Van Marrewijk, Charles] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ, NL-3584 EC Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Utrecht University,"Van Marrewijk, C (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ, Kriekenpitpl 21-22, NL-3584 EC Utrecht, Netherlands.",J.G.M.vanMarrewijk@uu.nl,"Inklaar, Robert/G-8253-2011","Inklaar, Robert/0000-0003-3852-067X; van Marrewijk, Charles/0000-0001-9016-5914",,,,,24,4,5,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Especially the emergence and intensive utilization of information and communication technologies (ICTs), which spawned the beginning of the digital economy two decades ago, heavily affected the opportunities and efficiency of how firms produce and provide goods and services. We provide an overview of the empirical literature on ICT and productivity and highlight the main results and methodological differences. The majority of studies indicates that the productivity effect of ICT is indeed positive and significant. However, methodological approaches of how to appropriately estimate the ICT effect matter. While aggregate and sectoral growth accounting exercises suggest stronger differences of the ICT effect between US and Europe, firm-level analyses suggest no significant country differences. Moreover, we shed light on the notion of ICT being a General Propose Technology (GPT) enabling further innovations. Most of the GPT evidence on ICT is found for the US, while evidence for European countries is harder to come by. However, more theoretical and empirical research is needed to better understand spillovers and externalities of ICT and how these technologies transform our economies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted behavioral experiments and surveys among 426 randomly selected individuals more than a decade after the end of the Tajik civil war.

The effect is strongest where infighting was most severe and where political polarization is high.

One, Social Funds gets deployed in the context of a larger Third Worldist discourse of poverty management, which in turn helps deepen the logic of capitalist development. Two, generating a class-focused understanding of Social Funds (via the concept of social surplus), we argue that class processes and need processes constitute one another and through this conduit emerges a relation between global capital and the poverty alleviation programme of Social Funds. Lastly, interrogating the management approach underlying Social Funds leads us to question claims of decentralisation and participation. Our analysis exposes an underlying process of subjectification by way of a control mechanism exercised through the code of conduct encapsulated in that managerial approach.","[Chakrabarti, Anjan] Univ Calcutta, Kolkata 700050, W Bengal, India; [Dhar, Anup] Dr BR Ambedkar Univ, Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India",University of Calcutta,"Chakrabarti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, 56 A,BT Rd, Kolkata 700050, W Bengal, India.",chakanjana@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,49,7,7,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

More informed buyers have better differentiated private valuations and extract higher rents from trade. When sellers cannot commit to sale mechanisms, information provision is higher under competition than under monopoly. In contrast, when sellers commit to both information provision and sale mechanisms, I identify simple conditions under which sellers post auctions and provide full information in every equilibrium, ensuring that all equilibrium outcomes are constrained efficient. Sellers capture the efficiency gains from increased information and compete only over non-distortionary rents offered to buyers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Their returns however are generally not abnormal when timing is considered in an augmented unconditional Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), while the standard version erroneously considers them to be so, possibly explaining why momentum studies have so far rejected the Neoclassical Theory.","Audencia Nantes Sch Management, PRES LUNAM, Ctr Financial & Risk Management, Nantes, France",Audencia,"Galariotis, E (通讯作者)，Audencia Nantes Sch Management, PRES LUNAM, Ctr Financial & Risk Management, Nantes, France.",egalariotis@audencia.com,"Galariotis, Emilios/B-7849-2018","Galariotis, Emilios/0000-0002-8575-894X",,,,,24,4,4,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Experimental evidence for pure lie aversion,EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Communication; Honesty; Guilt aversion; Lie aversion; Norms,SOCIAL DISTANCE; COMMUNICATION; PROMISES; PREFERENCES; DECEPTION; GAMES,"A recent experimental literature shows that truth-telling is not always motivated by pecuniary motives, and several alternative motivations have been proposed. However, their relative importance in any given context is still not totally clear. This paper investigates the relevance of pure lie aversion, that is, a dislike for lies independent of their consequences. We propose a very simple design where other motives considered in the literature predict zero truth-telling, whereas pure lie aversion predicts a non-zero rate. Thus we interpret the finding that more than a third of the subjects tell the truth as evidence for pure lie aversion. Our design also prevents confounds with another motivation (a desire to act as others expect us to act) not frequently considered but consistent with much existing evidence. We also observe that subjects who tell the truth are more likely to believe that others will tell the truth as well.","[Lopez-Perez, Raul] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Spiegelman, Eli] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Spiegelman, Eli] Vanier Coll, Dept Econ & Polit Sci, St Laurent, PQ, Canada",Autonomous University of Madrid; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Spiegelman, E (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",raul.lopez@uam.es; spiegele@vaniercollege.qc.ca,,"LOPEZ PEREZ, RAUL/0000-0002-8952-8914",,,,,27,59,64,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Three cyclical components with differing amplitude and frequency are identified. The trend and cyclical components of inflation are found to be a good approximation of core inflation, the inertial part of inflation. These core measures are compared with other candidate core measures based on the properties of a good core inflation measure. Generally, the SSA measures outperform commonly used measures of core inflation based on both in-and out-of-sample performance.","[Ruch, Franz] South African Reserve Bank, Res Dept, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",,"Ruch, F (通讯作者)，South African Reserve Bank, Res Dept, POB 3070, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",Franz.Ruch@resbank.co.za,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

In monopolistic insurance markets, in constrast, we find that overconfidence may be observationally equivalent to variations in the risk composition of the economy. Our analysis provides a number of novel testable implications on (i) price heterogeneity within and across risk classes, (ii) the relationship between ex-post risk and insurance coverage, (iii) the fact that a significant fraction of agents chooses to be uninsured, and (iv) the relationship between underinsurance and age.

Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations (employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled labor.

In this paper, we address these issues along two related perspectives. First, we explore the statistical properties of the International Financial Network (IFN), defined as a weighted-directed graph where nodes are countries and links represent debtor-creditor relationships in equities and short/long-run debt. We investigate whether the 2008 financial crisis has resulted in a significant change in the topological properties of the IFN. Our findings suggest that the crisis caused not only a reduction in the amount of securities traded, but also induced changes in the topology of the network and in the time evolution of its statistical properties. This has happened, however, without changing the disassortative, core-periphery structure of the IFN architecture. Second, we perform an econometric study to examine the ability of network-based measures to explain cross-country differences in crisis intensity. We investigate whether the conclusion of previous studies showing that international connectedness is not a relevant predictor of crisis intensity may be reversed, once one explicitly accounts for the position of each country within the IFN. We show that higher interconnectedness reduces the severity of the crisis, as it allows adverse shocks to dissipate quicker. However, being central in the network may make countries that are not members of a rich club more vulnerable in times of crisis. Finally, we find strong evidence of nonlinear effects, once the high degree of heterogeneity that characterizes the IFN is taken into account. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For example, the empirical data during 1985-2004 show that, compared with India, China's economy has exhibited (i) considerably higher rates of physical capital formation; (ii) much higher ratios of measured physical to human capital; and (iii) a more physical-capital-friendly public policy. Motivated by these empirical observations, we study the accumulation of both physical and human capital in a one-sector growth model with a CES production function. After deriving some qualitative implications from the model, we estimate the key technological parameters of the normalized CES production function using the panel data at the provincial level for China and at the state level for India. Our estimation results suggest that our model implications match broadly with the above stylized development patterns regarding China and India.

The probability to preference discontinuity increases with young age, female gender, higher income, non-coastal residence, and having filled out the questionnaire in a hurry. The performance of Error Component Multinomial Logit model improves when accounting for information on preference discontinuity either by introducing a scale parameter in the model or by eliminating attributes perceived less important by respondents. The Scale Model suggests equal variances of choices between respondent groups having continuous and discontinuous preferences. The elimination approach increases the efficiency of WTP estimates for attributes. The effect of more informed analysis on magnitudes of WTP estimates remains small. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Within the framework of the close equals groups the choice of bandwidth, which determines the intervals of close equal income units, is fundamental. Following the existing literature on the redistributive effect decomposition, we propose a new criterion for the identification of the optimal bandwidth: in this article the identification of close equals groups is mainly oriented to the estimation of horizontal inequity. Our criterion intends to be a contribution to empirical work that focuses on comparing the effects of different tax systems on a particular population of taxpayers. In order to test the robustness of the new criterion, different tax systems, characterised by different degrees of tax progressivity, are applied to Italian and Polish personal income tax data. Our results suggest the bandwidths, chosen according to our methodology, are more stable than those obtained by maximising potential vertical effects.","[Mazurek, Edyta] Fac Management Informat Syst & Finance, Inst Applicat & Matemat, Dept Stat, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Pellegrino, Simone] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Sci Econom Sociali & Matemat Stat, I-10134 Turin, Italy; [Vernizzi, Achille] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Econ Management & Metodi Quantitat, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Turin; University of Milan,"Mazurek, E (通讯作者)，Fac Management Informat Syst & Finance, Inst Applicat & Matemat, Dept Stat, Komandosrska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",edyta.mazurek@ue.wroc.pl; simone.pelle-grino@unito.it; achille.vernizzi@unimi.it,"Mazurek, Edyta/R-1376-2018; vernizzi, achille/K-4518-2017","Mazurek, Edyta/0000-0001-7410-1638; vernizzi, achille/0000-0002-1641-5003",,,,,15,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

To address this question, we consider a large public-sector company that is privatized. Using personnel records, we find employment contract liberalization to generate relative wage losses for older, high-tenure, low-skilled, part-time workers, permanent residents, and women. Employment reductions mostly affect the same groups experiencing a wage decline. Overall, wage liberalization leads to an increase in wage inequality of between 6% and 9%, which-if applied to the whole public sector-would lead to a 52% to 76% closure of the  inequality gap between the private and public sectors in Europe. Our results suggest that differences between public-and private-sector wage structures found in descriptive studies are to a large extent causal rather than the result of selection into these sectors and that public sector employment and career path regulations limit a firm's ability to maintain a competitive workforce.","[Melly, Blaise] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Puhani, Patrick A.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Puhani, Patrick A.] Univ St Gallen, SEW, St Gallen, Switzerland",Brown University; Leibniz University Hannover; University of St Gallen,"Melly, B (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",blaise_melly@brown.edu; puhani@aoek.uni-hannover.de,"Melly, Blaise S/A-9225-2010","Melly, Blaise/0000-0001-9592-8749",,,,,27,8,8,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We exploit a reform that introduced in 1990 costs for dismissals unmotivated by a 'fair cause' or justified motive' in firms below 15 employees and left firing costs unchanged for bigger firms. We use this quasi-experimental setup to study the hypothesis that increased EPL reduces future job insecurity and positively affects a female worker's proneness to take childbearing decisions. We use a difference in difference (OLS-DID) model to control for possible period-invariant sorting bias and an instrumental variable (IV-DID) model to account for time-varying endogeneity of the treatment status. We find that reduced economic insecurity following a strengthening of the EPL regime has a positive and sizable effect on fertility decisions of Italian working women. This result is robust to a number of checks regarding possible interactions with other policy reforms occurring around 1990, changes in the sample of workers and firms, and use of an alternative set of exclusion restrictions.

Three typical career patterns are taken into consideration, according to whether the individual wage growth is equal to, higher than, or lower than average wage growth.

We examine what makes the decision to trust a stranger different from the decision to trust a member of a given social network (a friend), by comparing the determinants of these two decisions for the same individual. We implement a binary trust game with hidden action in a lab-in-the-field experiment with residents of an informal housing area in Cairo. Our results show that trust is higher among friends than among strangers and that higher trust among friends is related to the principal's belief of trustworthiness. However, on average a principal underestimates her friend's trustworthiness leading to inefficient outcomes.

In addition to estimating a standard individual fixed effect model, a random trend fixed effect model which allows for both unobserved individual-specific time invariant and variant factors is estimated. The results of the random trend model point to a significant and negative effect of functional food consumption on depression among the elderly. However, an insignificant effect is predicted by the standard fixed effect model. In addition to functional food consumption, living arrangement with children and engagement in the social activities of the elderly also significantly decrease the likelihood of the elderly becoming depressed.

Using detailed data on lending conditions and standards, we analyse - along several key dimensions of heterogeneity - how financial fragility has affected the transmission mechanism of the single eurozone monetary policy. The analysis shows that the monetary transmission mechanism is time-varying and influenced by the financial fragility of the sovereigns, banks, firms and households. The impact of monetary policy on aggregate output is stronger during the financial crisis, especially in countries facing increased sovereign financial distress. This amplification mechanism, moreover, operates through the credit channel, both the bank lending and the non-financial borrower balance-sheet channels. Our results suggest that the bank-lending channel has been to a large extent neutralized by the ECB non-standard monetary policy interventions, but the policy framework until the end of 2011 was insufficient to overcome credit availability problems stemming from deteriorated firm net worth and risk conditions, especially for small firms in countries under stress.

We use simple two-period overlapping generations models with heterogeneous agents under six policy regimes: a model calibrated to the U.S. economy (benchmark), two early redistribution (lump sum) regimes, two (targeted) late redistribution regimes, and finally a model without taxes and redistribution. Redistribution programs are financed by a labor tax on the young generation and a capital tax on the old generation. We argue that if the programs are small in size, late redistribution can dominate early redistribution in terms of welfare but not in terms of real output. Better targeting of low income households cannot completely offset savings distortions.

The results show that overall, mothers earned considerably less than childless women; additionally, the wage penalties for motherhood went up substantially from the gradualist reform period (199096) to the radical reform period (19992005). The results also show that that although motherhood does not appear to have a significant wage effect for the state sector, it imposes substantial wage losses for mothers in the non-state sector. These findings suggest that the economic transition has shifted part of the cost of childbearing and -rearing from the state and employers back to women, in the form of lower earnings for working mothers.","[Dong, Xiao-Yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",University of Winnipeg,"Dong, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Winnipeg, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.",x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca,,,,,,,38,40,47,8,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We show that such mechanisms are harmful for some environments. While signals transmit previously unavailable information, they also facilitate information asymmetry that leads to coordination failures. In particular, we consider a two-sided matching game of incomplete information between firms and workers. Each worker has either the same typical known preferences with probability close to one or atypical idiosyncratic preferences with the complementary probability close to zero. Firms have known preferences over workers. We show that under some technical condition if at least three firms are responsive to some worker's signal, the introduction of signaling strictly decreases the expected number of matches.

Thus, the availability of accurate predictive model for small samples is vital for solving these problems. This research makes an early investigation on the small sample-oriented case-based kernel predictive method (SSOCBKPM) by integrating support vector machine in case reuse of case-based reasoning, and conducts an early application of SSOCBKPM in binary economic forecasting under the n-splits-k-times hold-out method. After business cases consisting of small samples are represented, the most similar cases from small samples to the current problem are retrieved from small case base. The most similar cases retrieved from small samples are then mapped into a higher dimensional space by kernel function to be candidate support vectors, in which dimension a hyper-plane of support vector machine is constructed by reusing the most similar cases. Two datasets for firm failure prediction and one dataset for loan failure prediction were used to test performance of SSOCBKPM. 100 times' random selection of each of the 20%, 35%, 50%, 65%, and 80% of the total samples are respectively used in training to simulate the availability of samples. The results indicate that SSOCBKPM improves accuracy, stability and sensitivity of the classical CBR significantly; and improves performance of SVM significantly when the volume of the training samples becomes smaller. The SSOCBKPM is more useful in economic forecasting than case-based reasoning and support vector machine since the proportion of available samples is commonly small and less than 50% of the population.

Specifically, I assume that people feel guilty if they breach an agreement and that the guilt increases according to the degree of the harm inflicted on the other. A central insight is that it is easier to sustain efficient informal agreements if actions are strategic complements than if they are strategic substitutes. I complement this general insight by studying two specific cases where negotiators face uncertainty about the breach of the agreement. I show that while the optimal agreement in a game with strategic substitutes must compromise on surplus-maximization and efficiency, the optimal agreement in a game with sufficiently strong strategic complements tends to maximize both the surplus and the probability of compliance especially if the game is symmetric.

Its results are widely disseminated, and the information it generates is different from that conveyed by a simple test-based ranking of schools (which turns out to approximate a ranking based on socioeconomic status). We use a sharp regression discontinuity to estimate the effect that being identified as a SNED winner has on schools' enrollment, tuition levels, and socioeconomic composition. Through five applications of the program, we find no consistent evidence that winning a SNED award affects these outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Although given an identical task, we experimentally manipulated how the task was framed. Subjects in the meaningful treatment were told that they were labeling tumor cells in order to assist medical researchers, subjects in the zero-context condition (the control group) were not told the purpose of the task, and, in stark contrast, subjects in the shredded treatment were not given context and were additionally told that their work would be discarded. We found that when a task was framed more meaningfully, workers were more likely to participate. We also found that the meaningful treatment increased the quantity of output (with an insignificant change in quality) while the shredded treatment decreased the quality of output (with no change in quantity).

We extend that model by introducing a composite consumer good and fossil fuel that are produced and consumed in each country and traded on world markets. When signatory countries act as a Stackelberg leader and emissions are positive, the size of stable IEAs may be significantly larger in our model with international trade. This would be good news if larger self-enforcing IEAs would lead to stronger reductions of total emissions. Unfortunately, in the presence of self-enforcing IEAs total emissions turn out to be only slightly less than in the business as usual scenario, independent of the number of signatories. We also investigate the role of international trade by comparing our free-trade results with the outcome in the regime of autarky. Our autarky model turns out to be coincident with the basic model of the literature alluded to above.

There are two main results. First, wavelet exploratory analysis provides a useful complementary approach to standard confirmatory statistical analysis. Specifically, using energy and time scale decomposition analyses, we find that the long-run is the dominant scale of variation for both aggregate investment and measured Tobin's q, and that for most of the sample there is a stable in-phase relationship between the smooth components of investment rate and q, with q slightly leading investments. Moreover, the analysis of the shift of the phase relationship of the long-term components reveals a pure smooth break occurring in the late 1970s, and a spurious smooth break in the early 1990s when the two smooth components resume their normal in-phase relationship. Second, when we combine the results from wavelet exploratory analysis and the multiple structural breaks test approach, we find that, contrary to the conventional literature, Tobin's q is an important determinant of aggregate investment, and its estimated coefficient can provide a plausible value for the implied adjustment cost of investment. Most importantly, we discover that the relationship depends on time scale; long time scales are more important than short. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find that Mexico's actual mobile and fixed-line prices are below the predicted prices based on similar countries' prices. Mexican consumers are paying lower prices than what one would expect based on comparisons of comparable countries. We calculate that in 2011 Mexican consumers received at least $4-$5 billion (USD) in consumer surplus from these lower mobile prices and in 2010 they received over $1 billion (USD) in consumer surplus from these lower fixed-line prices. These findings are in contrast to the general perception that concentrated telecommunications markets in Mexico are resulting in high prices and harming consumers.,"[Hausman, Jerry A.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hausman, Jerry A.] MIT, Telecommun Econ Res Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ros, Agustin J.] NERA Econ Consulting, Boston, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Ros, AJ (通讯作者)，NERA Econ Consulting, Boston, MA USA.",jhausman@mit.edu; agustin.ros@nera.com,,,,,,,25,19,22,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Broad-based improvements in Timorese living standards require increased agricultural output. This article discusses what determines agricultural development in Timor-Leste and how such development can be achieved. The Main causes or low agricultural output are found to be scarcity of land and capital, poor technology and education, and lack of government support, such as extension services and provision of infrastructure. We construct a model of an agricultural household to examine how increased market incentives will affect agricultural output and incomes. The effects of different price changes on household production, consumption, sales, income, and leisure are investigated We find that the objective of increasing the living standard of Timorese farmers may in part be achieved via increased earning opportunities outside agriculture.","[Lundahl, Mats] Stockholm Sch Econ, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sjoholm, Fredrik] Lund Univ, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Sjoholm, Fredrik] Res Inst Ind Econ, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics; Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Lundahl, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Box 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",Mats.Lundahl@hhs.se; Fredrik.Sjoholm@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,30,9,9,1,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

However, they are usually implemented without considering the capabilities and cost of transmission infrastructure. We use single-and multi-stage planning approaches to find cost-effective transmission and generation investments to meet single and multi-year RPS goals, respectively. Using a six-node network and assuming a linearized DC power flow, we examine how the lumpy nature of network reinforcements and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law can affect the performance of RPSs. First, we show how simplified planning approaches that ignore transmission constraints, transmission lumpiness, or Kirchhoff's voltage law yield distorted estimates of the type and location of infrastructure, as well as inaccurate compliance costs to meet the renewable goals. Second, we illustrate how lumpy transmission investments and Kirchhoff's voltage law result in compliance costs that are nonconvex with respect to the RPS targets, in the sense that the marginal costs of meeting the RPS may decrease rather than increase as the target is raised. Thus, the value of renewable energy certificates (RECs) also depends on the network topology, as does the amount of noncompliance with the RPS, if noncompliance is penalized but not prohibited. Finally, we use a multi-stage planning model to determine the optimal generation and transmission infrastructure for RPS designs that set multiyear goals. We find that the optimal infrastructure to meet RPS policies that are enforced year-by-year differ from the optimal infrastructure if banking and borrowing is allowed in the REC market.","[Munoz, Francisco D.; Hobbs, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Whiting Sch Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Sauma, Enzo E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Santiago, Chile",Johns Hopkins University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Munoz, FD (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Whiting Sch Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",francisco.munoz@jhu.edu; esauma@ing.puc.cl; bhobbs@jhu.edu,"Sauma, Enzo E/N-7013-2013; Hobbs, Benjamin F/A-3291-2010; Muñoz, Francisco/AHD-1365-2022","Sauma, Enzo E/0000-0002-8555-9123;",Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities; Directorate For Engineering [0835879] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),,,40,64,73,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

This observation evokes a well-known narrative in which nominal downward wage rigidity is at the center of the current unemployment problem. We embed downward nominal wage rigidity into a small open economy with tradable and nontradable goods and a fixed exchange-rate regime. In this model, negative external shocks cause involuntary unemployment. We analyze a number of national and supranational policy options for alleviating the unemployment problem caused by the combination of downward nominal wage rigidity and a fixed exchange-rate regime. We argue that, in spite of the existence of a battery of domestic policies that could be effective in solving the unemployment problem, it is unlikely that a solution will come from within national borders. This leaves supranational monetary stimulus as the most compelling avenue out of the crisis. Our model predicts that full employment in peripheral Europe could be restored by raising the euro area annual rate of inflation to about 4 percent for the next five years.","[Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie; Uribe, Martin] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England; [Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie; Uribe, Martin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Schmitt-Grohé, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA.",stephanie.schmittgrohe@columbia.edu; martin.uribe@columbia.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1061711] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,22,33,39,0,12,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

It does so by using firm-level panel data from India along with an objective measure of judicial efficiency at the state level. The results suggest that for a 10 percentage point decline in input tariffs, firms in the state at the 75th percentile of judicial efficiency gain an additional 3.6 percentage points in productivity when compared to firms in the state with the median level of judicial efficiency. The results also indicate that the complementarities are strongest for firms in industries that are contract intensive and imported-capital intensive. These results are robust to using a matching estimator to address the self-selection of firms into states with high judicial efficiency and an IV approach to instrument input tariffs. In addition, the results are also robust to the addition of state-year interaction fixed effects to control for time-varying, unobservable state characteristics. Thus, the results indicate that rapid contract enforcement is necessary to maximize the productivity benefits from input tariff liberalization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

When Does it Matter?,METROECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper explains the Bureau of Economic Analysis methodology for computing historical cost and replacement cost measures of the net stock of capital in the US economy. It is demonstrated that there exists a threshold rate of inflation in the price of capital goods that keeps the percentage difference between the two capital stock measures constant. Hence, over periods when average inflation in the price index for capital goods is equal to the threshold value, historical cost and replacement cost profit rates would show equal percentage changes; an example of such a period for the US economy is 19462010.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Basu, D (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 1012 Thompson Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",dbasu@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,8,7,9,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2013,64.0,2,,,,,293,318,,10.1111/meca.12008,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,117RB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316969700003,0

This setting generates key differences in terms of modelling setup, modelling predictions and welfare implications with respect to the existing literature on trade and firm heterogeneity. In terms of modelling setup our approach allows us to explore interaction between potentially large heterogeneous firms, in contrast to recent trade literature with heterogeneity and atomistic firms. As a result variables like market price and total sales vary endogenously as different firms enter the market. We offer a solution for the integer problem inherent in small group models, based on stochastic dominance. The model generates testable predictions deviating from the benchmark firm heterogeneity model of Melitz (2003) in terms of the effect of trade liberalisation on markups, market shares, the market price. We also derive predictions on the effect of distance and market size on the probability of zero trade flows and export prices. Our model features the possibility that welfare declines as a result of trade liberalisation. The result in Brander and Krugman (1983), the benchmark model for trade under oligopoly, that welfare unambiguously rises with free entry and might decline without free entry due to increased cross-hauling is reversed. In a setting with heterogeneous instead of homogeneous firms, welfare might decline with free entry. A negative welfare effect without free entry can be ruled out if the firm size distribution is sufficiently dispersed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Several results are remarkable. First, the spillovers have increased dramatically, but fluctuate periodically. The upward trend of spillovers is consistent with a continuous increase in financial market integration. Second, the return and volatility spillovers show large variability over time and are positively associated with extreme economic episodes, such as the Asian crisis of 1997, the dollar crisis of 2005, the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, and the ongoing European debt crisis. Third, the time-varying patterns of the return and volatility spillovers are very different across exchange rates. For example, the Korean won has been experienced the most dramatic increase in the return spillover from others, and the Singapore dollar is the most dominant net transmitter of return spillover, hence playing the role of a leader. These results have important implications for exchange rate forecast, risk management, central bank interventions and international trade.","Pukyong Natl Univ, Div Econ, Pusan, South Korea",Pukyong National University,"Chang, BK (通讯作者)，Pukyong Natl Univ, Div Econ, Pusan, South Korea.",bkchang@pknu.ac.kr,,,,,,,25,3,3,1,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

This implies that the optimal contract should include stock options. This is because the private benefit of shirking is increasing in firm value and the manager's utility is concave. Therefore, in contrast to the previous literature that takes stock options in the incentive contract exogenously, we rationalize the optimality of their use endogenously. Moreover, we show that the optimal amount of stock options (restricted stocks) increases with agency cost and the executive's reservation utility, decreases with the degree of risk aversion of the manager, and increases (decreases) with the firm size.","[Dong, Baomin] Henan Univ, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; [Guo, Guixia; Wang, Frank Yong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Henan University; University of International Business & Economics,"Wang, FY (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",wangyong9110@gmail.com,"Dong, Baomin/AAV-7741-2021","Dong, Baomin/0000-0002-4787-021X",,,,,20,2,2,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

While subsequent research countered such claims, the foreign exchange market, which underpins all cross-border transactions, continued to be characterized largely as operating outside the governance frontier of states. At one level, the qualities of the market lent themselves to such conclusions. Yet, through an analysis of the historical trajectory of two legal instruments, the Treasury Amendment and master netting agreements, the central importance of binding state-enforced explicit and implicit codes, or law, in the foreign exchange market is revealed. Far from operating beyond the reach of states, even this most globalized market is legally constructed. Joumal of Comparative Economics 41 (2) (2013) 343-354.

Exploring this difference, the present paper evaluates the empirical relevance of the two growth models for the G-7 countries. The underlying shocks are identified by an application of a dynamic factor model. Results show that a transitory shock to investment share permanently increases per-capita output in four countries, offering support to the endogenous growth model. This shock also contributes considerably to accounting for the long-run variability of per-capita output. Overall, the endogenous model is found to be empirically more plausible than previous time series studies suggest. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluate ODA effectiveness in relation to the growth rate of an 'inequality-adjusted GDP per capita' in order to precisely define the desired impact of aid in a region with high levels of inequality. The estimation produces three main results: aid is effective, in aggregated terms, once we deal with the effect of income inequalities; the impact of concessional loans seems to be greater than the impact of grants; and, aid may be more effective in less corrupt countries.","[Tezanos, Sergio; Guijarro, Marta] Univ Cantabria, Fac CC EE & Empresariales, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Quinones, Ainoa] Univ Cantabria, ETS Ingn Caminos Canales & Puertos, Dept Adm Empresas, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; Universidad de Cantabria,"Tezanos, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Fac CC EE & Empresariales, Dept Econ, Ave Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",tezanoss@unican.es; quinonesa@unican.es; guijarrom@unican.es,"Tezanos-Vazquez, Sergio/P-3040-2016","Tezanos-Vazquez, Sergio/0000-0002-7202-5472",,,,,60,12,12,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

We find that secondary vocational schools have met government benchmarks for teacher qualification and training, student opportunities for practical training and adequate facilities. Furthermore, poor students access schools of similar quality to non-poor students, even though 34 percent of poor students do not receive financial aid. We conclude that recent policies are successfully ensuring secondary vocational school quality and equity of access to school quality between poor and non-poor students. However, financial aid policies should be re-examined, such that poor students receive sufficient coverage.

About 1000 inhabitants of Zurich take part in a trust experiment, in which first movers can condition their investments on the residential districts of second movers. First movers differentiate their investments systematically depending on where in Zurich the second mover lives. The observed discrimination pattern is robust as indicated by additional data collected in a newspaper study and a laboratory experiment. Economic status seems to be key for a district's reputation: first movers invest more if second movers live in high-income districts. Investments into districts are positively correlated with the corresponding willingness to repay, which indicates that first movers correctly anticipate the relative trustworthiness of inhabitants of different districts. Furthermore, we find that people trust strangers from their own district significantly more than strangers from other districts. This in-group effect is, at least partly, driven by more accurate beliefs about the trustworthiness of in-group members. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The conventional wisdom is that institutions and policies vary in the extent to which they promote competition and how quickly and completely they bring individuals' plans into closer coordination with one another. Kirzner has provided the most fully elaborated statement on the use of coordination as a positive analytical device for explaining market dynamics and as a normative criterion for evaluating economic policies. We identify the core propositions in his analysis that elucidate how economic coordination depends upon that most fundamental of market institutions - the system of private property rights. We also probe into Kirzner's claims about inherent limitations in our ability to compare the coordinative potential of alternative property rights systems. We unpack the consequences of these core propositions using the economic theory of property rights. We also examine Kirzner's assertion that dynamic competition - including Schumpeterian innovation - is necessarily coordinative in its market effects. We find that his argument rests on the implicit assumption that property rights remain constant during the process of market adjustment. We provide a case study of the advent of commercial aviation as a potential counterexample to his claims. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study is to examine how innovation diffusion is changed by different influence relationship structures existing among individuals. We introduce an extended version of the regular digraph that can represent various influence relationships among influentials and followers. We focus on three key features of influence relationships (i.e. monopolization, localization, and diversification of opinions) and examine how they are associated with certain macroscopic behavioral regularities by employing agent-based simulation. The simulation results show that market becomes locked-in to a single product when influences are monopolized by few influentials. We also find that when influence relationship becomes complex as influentials and followers increase, market cannot be categorized by a single typology, but becomes random and unpredictable. Our model demonstrates successfully an underlying principle of collective behavior that uniformity of behavior is promoted under monopolization of opinions and random, unpredictable behavioral patterns emerge from diversification of opinions.","[Kim, Jeehong] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn Seoul, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Hur, Wonchang] Inha Univ, Coll Business Adm, 253 Yonghyun Dong, Inchon 402751, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Inha University,"Hur, W (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Coll Business Adm, 253 Yonghyun Dong, Inchon 402751, South Korea.",wchur@inha.ac.kr,,,,,,,37,3,4,1,48,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

This article identifies and quantifies the three mechanisms through which credit constraints affect trade: the selection of heterogeneous firms into domestic production, the selection of domestic manufacturers into exporting, and the level of firm exports. I incorporate financial frictions into a heterogeneous-firm model and apply it to aggregate trade data for a large panel of countries. I establish causality by exploiting the variation in financial development across countries and the variation in financial vulnerability across sectors. About 20%-25% of the impact of credit constraints on trade is driven by reductions in total output. Of the additional, trade-specific effect, one-third reflects limited firm entry into exporting, while two-thirds are due to contractions in exporters' sales. Financially developed economies export more in financially vulnerable sectors because they enter more markets, ship more products to each destination, and sell more of each product. These results have important policy implications for less developed nations that rely on exports for economic growth but suffer from weak financial institutions.","[Manova, Kalina] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Manova, Kalina] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Manova, K (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,58,491,578,33,276,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Such an asset market interpretation emphasizes the importance of the interest rate used to value future distortions, especially in the presence of uncertainty.

The variations in the interest rate are caused by amplified responses of consumption to exogenous shocks as a result of capital taxation.

The active role of inside money stems from its unique role in allowing payment for at least some consumption goods; shocks to the production of inside money may therefore have real effects. A calibrated version of the model is shown to generate small, but nonnegligible effects of inside money shocks on output and inflation. Moreover, the presence of inside money in the model leads to a slight attenuation of the effect of technology and monetary policy shocks. Finally, it is found that it is optimal for monetary policy to react to inside money shocks, but reacting to inflation alone does not result in a significant loss of household welfare.","European Cent Bank, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Stracca, L (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",livio.stracca@ecb.int,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

These trends were more pronounced in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 as the net contribution of oil has intensified after a burst during the crisis.

This article seeks to explain the observed differences in wealth through an examination of the respective saving behaviour of immigrants and natives. Quantile regression and semiparametric decomposition methods are used to identify the saving differential and to isolate the factors that contribute to it. The basic finding is that household income is the key to the differential saving pattern. Moreover, decomposition analysis suggests that immigrants have a tendency to save more than natives when compared with Australian-born households with similar characteristics.

Such poor diets can lead to nutritional problems, such as iron-deficiency anemia, that can adversely affect attention and learning in school. Large scale policies in Northwestern China have attempted to tackle these nutritional problems using eggs. The overall goal of this paper is to assess the impact of the government's egg distribution program by comparing the effect on anemia rates of an intervention that gives students an egg per day versus an intervention that gives students a chewable vitamin per day. We will also assess whether either intervention leads to improved educational performance among students in poor areas of rural China. To meet this goal, we report on the results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving over 2600 fourth grade students from 70 randomly-chosen elementary schools in 5 of the poorest counties in Gansu Province in China's poor Northwest region. The design called for random assignment of schools to one of two intervention groups, or a control group with no intervention. One intervention provided a daily chewable vitamin, including 5 mg of iron. The other mimicked the government policy by providing a daily egg. According to the findings of the paper, in the schools that received the chewable vitamins, hemoglobin (Hb) levels rose by more than 2 g/L (over 0.2 standard deviations). The standardized math test scores of students in these schools also improved significantly. In schools that received eggs, there was no significant effect on Hb levels or math test scores. Overall, these results should encourage China's Ministry of Education (MOE) to look beyond eggs when tackling nutritional problems related to anemia in an education setting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Not all existing global MRIO frameworks feature continuous time series, margins and tax sheets, and information on reliability and uncertainty. Despite these potential limitations, constructing a large MRIO requires significant manual labour and many years of time. This paper describes the results from a project aimed at creating an MRIO account that represents all countries at a detailed sectoral level, allows continuous updating, provides information on data reliability, contains table sheets expressed in basic prices as well as all margins and taxes, and contains a historical time series.

There are two main objectives. First, we theoretically predict the dynamic model of bank lending channels under the Basel I regulatory constraint. Second, we empirically analyze the situation in Malaysia by using panel data on 23 commercial banks in the period of 1999 to 2007 by using General Method of Moments. The empirical results show that market rates on loans and policy rates are important influences on average rates of banks' loans. This has an implication that Malaysian banks have the power to set their own prices on loans as they are influenced by the change in the market rate and policy rate. We also have proven that the previous period of spread risk weighted loans and securities is statistically significant and correlated with the average loan rate, whereas risk weighted securities is also statistically significant and correlated with the average time deposit rate in both periods. This shows that the role of risk-weighted assets under the Basel I is important in influencing the optimal rates on loans and time deposits. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We identify unique characteristics of such models not inherent to other approaches. We then present evidence from the UK showing that a policy process around consumption-based accounting for greenhouse gas emissions and resource use has evolved that is based on results from EE-MRIO modelling. This suggests that specific, policy-relevant information that would be impossible to obtain otherwise can be generated with the help of EE-MRIO models.

While many writers link resource scarcity, the resulting competition and state institutional failure as common drivers for conflict among multiple resource users in the semi-arid pastoral areas, the causes for violent conflict and the failure of local level negotiations between groups need to be explained in the framework of geopolitical context and the rent earned from perpetrating violence. This study reveals how economic incentives from livestock raids and the unrestricted access to conflict technology reinforce each other and jointly undermine the success of negotiations in producing favorable outcomes. The undesirable outcomes from negotiation failure can be expressed in terms of rent dissipation, rangeland resource degradation, increased instability and the potential for increased vulnerability and deterioration of agropastoral welfare.

Pairwise stability holds in some theoretical models of simultaneous ascending auctions under intimidatory collusion and demand reduction. Pairwise stability results in a matching game approach to estimation. We find that a system of four large regional licenses would raise the allocative efficiency of the C block outcome by 48 percent.

We show that it is very likely for majority voting to lead to the adoption of a regressive income tax schedule, depending on the per capita government revenue requirement and the mean productivity of the population, which is in sharp contrast with the result derived from the traditional benevolent social planner approach to income taxation; and that given the adoption of a regressive income tax schedule, the income tax schedule would become less regressive as the ratio of the per capita government revenue requirement over the mean productivity of the population increases.

Using a consistently defined ATR series for the years 1979-2003, this study finds that the 1980s reduced ATRs for all taxpayers except those in the bottom quintile whose ATRs rose. The reforms of the early 1990s generally had the effect of raising ATRs at the top of the income distribution and lowering those at the bottom, although the magnitude of the effects was smaller than the reforms of the 1980s. Reforms of the late 1990s and early 2000s significantly reduced ATRs virtually across the board. The only exception occurred in the bottom quintile where the effects of the various tax acts have been mixed. The tax acts of 2001 and 2003 reduced ATRs significantly in the top and middle quintiles, although the size of the ATR reduction in both cases was greater in the middle quintile than in the top quintile.

In particular, we apply Multivariate Vector Autoregressive (VAR) tools to test the interaction between conventional and Islamic financial products, and implement the Granger causality test to specify the dependence orientation of feedback between Islamic and conventional stock prices. Our article differs from previous work on the topic in that it develops portfolio simulations to determine whether Islamic finance can supplant conventional finance by generating investment and diversification opportunities during periods of crisis. In addition, we develop optimal portfolio strategies and investment proportions for conventional and Islamic funds to ensure the best resource allocation. Our main findings are: (i) the impact of the current crisis on the Islamic finance industry is less marked than on conventional finance, (ii) investment in Islamic products generates high returns, (iii) portfolios that include Islamic products reduce systemic risk and generate significant diversification benefits, (iv) the US crisis has led to significant changes in resource allocation through changes in investment choices.","[Jawadi, F.] Univ Evry Val dEssonne, Amiens Sch Management, F-91025 Evry, France; [Arouri, M.

Nevertheless, real convergence to the US is found only for three Latin American countries: Chile, Costa Rica and Trinidad and Tobago, with these countries also presenting evidence of stochastic and beta-convergence.","[Ayala, Astrid] Univ Francisco Marroquin, Sch Business, Guatemala City 01010, Guatemala; [Cunado, Juncal; Alberiko Gil-Alana, Luis] Univ Navarra, Sch Econ & Business Adm, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain",University of Navarra,"Ayala, A (通讯作者)，Univ Francisco Marroquin, Sch Business, Edificio Escuela Negocios,6 Calle Final,Zona 10, Guatemala City 01010, Guatemala.",aayala@ufm.edu,"Cunado, Juncal/K-7303-2017","Cunado, Juncal/0000-0002-1597-9755",,,,,52,10,11,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Professional service providers and clients prevailing attitude in business relationship is interdependence or dependence. According to service providers, in relationship with clients they indicate interdependence and dependence, clients indicate more dependence. Professional service providers' dependence on clients more often gains market and economical dimensions; clients' dependence on providers is gaining legal and knowledge dimensions. Both groups respondents' evaluation is similar, in business relationship engaging and aligning stages maintains cognition-based trust, and differs in assessing trust type in deepening stage: professional service providers in this stage indicate knowledge-based trust; clients indicate not only competence-based but also process trust.

The new learning in the natural sciences supplies material to update and enrich the microfoundations of institutional economicsuspecifically, the instincthabit psychology. The framing of social reality with evolutionary concepts is, however, misguided in important respects. Metaphorical modelling is the transfer of concepts developed for the understanding of one domain to another, ontological distinct domain. The argument is made that the generalisation of Darwinian principles to the phenomena of institutional persistence and change is theorising by metaphor, because there are crucial ontological differences separating the natural and social domains. Social reality has the property of transmutabilityumeaning the social environment, unlike the natural domain, is changeable by human agency. This article endeavours to explain how the generalisation of the natural selection principle evokes a fallacious conception of institutional reality. The idea that ofitness' in the social/economic sphere is a matter of purposive adaptation by agents to exogenous conditions is misleading, because real success in business or politics is transformative and is achieved by catalysing and maintaining advantageous shifts of widely prevalent habits of thought and behaviour.","Arkansas State Univ, State Univ, AR 72467 USA",Arkansas State University,"Brown, C (通讯作者)，Arkansas State Univ, POB 729, State Univ, AR 72467 USA.",crbrown@astate.edu,"Kim, Soohyun/N-6460-2014",,,,,,58,10,10,0,118,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In both countries, the means-tested social benefits exerted an over-proportionate influence on the vertical effect, suggesting a strong impact of the welfare state on income position of their residents, but also induced a large amount of horizontal inequity. In Slovenia, the non-means-tested benefits slightly increased income inequality.","[Cok, Mitja; Verbic, Miroslav] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia; [Urban, Ivica] Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; Institute of Public Finance,"Cok, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",mitja.cok@ef.uni-lj.si; ivica.urban@ijf.hr,"Urban, Ivica/J-5821-2012","Urban, Ivica/0000-0001-6734-2791; Verbic, Miroslav/0000-0001-5506-0973",,,,,37,14,16,0,15,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,5,,,,,667,686,,10.2298/PAN1305667C,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,226SD,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325055400006,0

To further address endogeneity concerns, we exploit changes in oil reserves due to randomness in the success of oil explorations.

When trade costs and knowledge dispersion are high (low), the asset wealthy (poor) region has a larger market and greater shares of innovation and manufacturing. For low to intermediate levels of trade costs, innovation and manufacturing offshoring flows toward the larger region, but when trade costs and knowledge dispersion are high, offshoring flows from the larger asset wealthy region to the smaller asset poor region.

The paper presents data on the other MSS used in organizations registered to the ISO 14001 standard, the order of their implementation, and which ones are combined in an integrated management system (IMS). The use of existing sustainability guidelines, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), is also investigated. Future research should focus on obtaining larger sample sizes and conducting follow-up interviews to probe the responses given in the questionnaires.

The optimal tariff internalizes a mark-up distortion, an entry distortion, and a terms-of-trade externality. It is larger when the dispersion of firm-level productivities is higher, and the country's relative size or relative average productivity is bigger. Furthermore, in the two-country Nash equilibrium, tariffs turn out to be strategic substitutes. Small or poor economies set lower Nash tariffs than large or rich ones. Lower transportation costs or smaller fixed market entry costs induce higher equilibrium tariffs and larger welfare losses relative to the case of zero tariffs. Similarly, cross-country productivity or size convergence, and higher firm-level productivity dispersion increase the global welfare loss due to non-cooperative tariff policies. These results suggest that post WWII trends have increased the relative merits of the WTO. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, not many papers analyze the effect of sustainability in the elements involving intellectual capital. This paper seeks to highlight the key role played by corporate sustainability on corporate reputation as one of the key components of relational capital based on the knowledge-based theory. Authors develop a structural equation model to test the hypothesis. The study was tested using data collected from a sample of 400 Spanish consumers. The structural equation model shows that sustainability plays a vital role as antecedent of corporate reputation and relational capital. Findings suggest that economic, social and environmental domains of sustainability have a positive direct effect on corporate reputation. Additionally, this study shows that economic sustainability is considered to be the most important dimension to enhance corporate reputation. The complicated economic environment currently experienced worldwide may affect the perceptions of Spanish consumers and their ratings. The crosscutting nature of this research inhibits an understanding of the variations in the perceptions of the customers surveyed over time, suggesting that this research could be expanded by a longitudinal study. Secondly, the current study has been conducted with consumers of hotel companies in Spain and it is not clear in how far the findings can be generalized to other industries, stakeholders or countries. This research allows managers to identify the activities in which companies can devote resources to in order to increase firm's reputation. By knowing these specific economic, social and environmental activities, companies can understand, analyze and make decisions in a better way about its sector and about the stakeholders that assess these initiatives.","[Garcia de Leaniz, Patricia Martinez; del Bosque, Ignacio Rodriguez] Univ Cantabria, Fac Econ, Santander, Cantabria, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"de Leaniz, PMG (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Fac Econ, Santander, Cantabria, Spain.",martinezrp@unican.es; rbosquei@unican.es,"de Leaniz, Patricia Martínez García/A-9952-2019","de Leaniz, Patricia Martínez García/0000-0002-9527-0307",,,,,53,0,0,0,11,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,539,547,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000062,0

The first approach refers to a fixed effects model, the second to dynamic panel data and Arellano-Bond GMM, while the third approach concerns a binary Logit model with fixed effects. The current study's fixed effects results show that there is no evidence of EKC hypothesis for the air pollutants examined. On the contrary, there is a strong evidence of EKC hypothesis for the air pollutants examined based on Arellano-Bond GMM and logit model's results with fixed effects and all the types of household income indicating that EKC hypothesis holds. Furthermore, regarding personal income, using the Arellano-Bond GMM methodology, the EKC hypothesis does not hold. This indicates that air pollution and income might be based on communitarian arrangements instead of on individualistic actions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model was later extended to include Control as a key ingredient to measure and leverage intellectual capital. This research expands on this model to include two additional dimensions, creativity and culture. It explores the relationship between intellectual capital and these five critical variables: Competence, Commitment, Control, Creativity, and Culture. These variables, and the inter-relationships between them, can help firms to define and describe their intellectual capital assets. By systematically measuring these five factors, service organizations can identify their strengths and weaknesses in capitalizing their intellectual prowess and resources. In addition, looking at intellectual capital through this lens can help organizations determine where they should invest in their human capital. It can form the basis of developing training programs for employees and lay the foundation for becoming a true learning organization. The purpose of this paper is to expound on the two additional dimensions and outline the benefits of assessing IC within the five dimensions as a means to gain a deeper understanding of the competitive positioning of an organization within its industry.

Concept of CSR is defined by the European Commission (2002, p. 5) and remembered by Steurer et al. (2005), CSR as a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis. Many authors have debated the different possibilities of simultaneously incorporating social, environmental and economic concerns into management thinking and practice (Aguilera et al. (2007) in organizational behavior; Buysse and Verbeke (2003); Starkey and Crane (2003); Barin-Cruz et al. (2006) in strategic management; Hall and Martin (2005) in technological innovations). All those scholars have been developing concept of CSR from different point of view. This paper work concerns value creation through CSR only as economical category. But therefore in order to indicate areas of possible value creation, various all above mentioned aspects of CSR concept are analyzed. The review of theoretical and empiric researches showed that value created through CSR for the company might emerge as a part of any of the following benefits: financial benefits, better quality, marketing benefits, better organizational culture, effectiveness doing business globally. This paperwork suggests a framework of value creation through CSR, considering CSR implementation might help to create shared value for few beneficiaries. The framework consists of all four types of responsibilities described by Carroll (1999), three major groups of beneficiaries (company, society, stakeholders) and areas of possible value creation. But, as theoretical research shows, this framework first should be adopted for value creation chain (VCC) before analyzing value creation through CSR possibilities in whole VCC. Considering specifics of CSR implementation in VCC the framework of evaluating value creation is suggested The framework consists of seven stages which should be used as guidelines for program of empiric research. Further studies should concentrate attention on shared value creation through CSR in VCC where in every stage company is one of the beneficiaries. Measuring such value might be extremely difficult, because value received by stakeholders and society appear as use value quite often.","[Juscius, Vytautas; Jonikas, Donatas] Klaipeda Univ, LT-93185 Klaipeda, Lithuania",Klaipeda University,"Juscius, V (通讯作者)，Klaipeda Univ, Minijos St 153, LT-93185 Klaipeda, Lithuania.",ek.smf@ku.lt; donatas.jonikas@gmail.com,"Juscius, Vytautas/AAN-5982-2020",,,,,,53,22,26,5,110,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In the absence of mainstream views on the assessment of competitiveness, there is sample room for the presentation of individual approaches to its evaluation. The basic aim of the contribution is due to the method of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and aggregation of individual priorities to define the position of NUTS 2 regions in closed programming period of 2000 - 2006 years. The sense of applying the method will be setting the order of NUTS 2 regions reflecting their competitiveness reached for the year, based on selected criteria, which are employment rate, gross domestic product, gross domestic expenditures on research and development, gross fixed capital formation, knowledge intensive services, net disposable income and patents Indicators. We can obtain the idea of mutual competitive position of these regions by applying the method. The analytic hierarchy process is a concrete method for multicriteria decision making which uses pair-wise comparison matrices to calculate weights (priorities) of given objects (criteria or alternatives to be evaluated). These individually determined priorities will be aggregated into group priority vector which will serve as basis for further computations of our problem. The macro-regional indicators are chosen based on expert estimation regarding to accessibility of relevant statistic data. Based on the application of the method we can gain detailed view on regional competitiveness of regions by way of quantitative characteristics which can lead to more precise definition of reached competitiveness of NUTS 2 regional units in the European Union.","Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,kiszova@opf.slu.cz; nevima@opf.slu.cz,"Nevima, Jan/AAC-5530-2021","Nevima, Jan/0000-0002-4788-9009",,,,,11,3,3,0,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,278,286,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300029,0

It combines the methodologies of Development Accounting (Caselli, F. 2005. Accounting for Cross-Country Income Differences.

The exercise sheds light on the extent and evolution of factor market distortions between 1996 and 2009. The main result of the paper is that capital and labor market distortions do not explain income differences across the two country groups, but are important to understand income differences within groups. In addition, observed labor and capital taxes are related to the measured wedges, but significant unexplained components remain. Reducing labor and capital market distortions would lead to significant output gains in all countries.","[Konya, Istvan] Magyar Nemzeti Bank, H-1054 Budapest, Hungary; [Konya, Istvan] Cent European Univ, H-1054 Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Konya, I (通讯作者)，Magyar Nemzeti Bank, Szabadsag Ter 8-9, H-1054 Budapest, Hungary.",konyai@mnb.hu,,,,,,,31,2,2,2,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The transformed GPD is treated as a classical Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression and the generalized M-fluctuation test (Zeileis, 2005, 2006) is applied because it is a unified approach based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) scores (Andrews and Ploberger, 1994), F-statistics (1989, 1992), and OLS residuals (Ploberger and Kramer, 1992). The outcomes indicate that there are multiple SBs not only in all of the three exchange return series considered (UK Pound, Japanese Yen and New Taiwan Dollar, all versus US Dollar) but also GPD parameter estimation at extreme quantile levels.

While the traditional role of the stock exchange should evolve by enforcing competitive advantage, as the heart of modern capital markets, stock exchanges give rise to both capital demand outflows and capital supply inflows, and both of these have to be taken into consideration. What is it that makes some stock markets more attractive than others from the viewpoint of firms as well as from the viewpoint of investors? This paper focuses on the stock exchanges' performance from an international perspective by combining both the listing competition and trading competition aspects using data for the world's 45 largest stock exchanges.

It employs a Sato production function specification which has unique properties that enable the estimation of capital-labour substitution elasticity and changing marginal productivities through time. These estimates reveal that the substitution elasticity and labour productivity in Australia rose significantly from the mid-1960s and remained elevated during the economic reform period. A novel contribution of this article is the depiction of Australia's production isoquants to convey how combining labour and capital to produce real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has changed over recent decades.","[Makin, Anthony J.] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Strong, Sam] Griffith Univ, Dept Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Griffith University,"Makin, AJ (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Business 3 Bldg,Parklands Dr, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",t.makin@griffith.edu.au,"Makin, Anthony/C-6738-2017","Makin, Anthony/0000-0002-5556-9590",,,,,38,6,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

J,"Mishra, A; Mishra, D",,,,"Mishra, Alok; Mishra, Deepti",,,Applications of Stakeholder Theory in Information Systems and Technology,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,stakeholder theory; stakeholder model; stakeholder; information systems; management,CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; E-GOVERNMENT; MANAGEMENT; IDENTIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; BARRIERS; ETHICS; LIFE,"Stakeholder theory has its origins in management literature. Preston (1999) traces the notion of stakeholders back to the great depression in the United States (1929-1941), when the General Electric company defined four major stakeholder groups - shareholders, employees, customers, and the general public. Stakeholder management has become an important tool to transfer ethics to management practice and strategy. Few management topics have generated more debate in recent decades than the underlying notion, the model and the theories surrounding stakeholders (Donaldson and Preston, 1995; Gibson, 2000; Wolfe and Putler, 2002; Friedman and Miles, 2006). The visual power of the stakeholder model and its high simplicity are seen as contributors to the success of the stakeholder concept (Fassin, 2008). An increasing interrelation is observed between the concepts of stakeholder theory, corporate responsibility, and business ethics (Valor, 2005; Garriga et al., 2004). The stakeholder approach in the organization integrates stakeholder relationships within a company's resource base, industry setting, and socio-political arena into a single analytical framework (Susniene & Sargunas, 2009). Mumford (1979) is one of the early researchers in supporting the involvement of end-users as a component of effective information systems development and implementation, using essentially the stakeholder concept in this domain. It has been proved that end-users and managers are very important towards successful system implementation. As more interorganizational information systems are developed which usually involve strategic decisions, a yet wider range of stakeholders needs to be involved (Pouloudi, 1999). In these systems the attention may switch from end-users and focus on those parties that are external to the organization, but who can also be associated in decision making at a managerial or strategic level (Pouloudi & Whitely, 1997). One of the most thorough investigations of the stakeholder concept in information systems research that relates information systems stakeholders with implementation failure was made as an early work by Lyytinen and Hirschheim (1987, 1988). They argue that failure is conditional on the capability of information system to meet the expectations of different stakeholders - i.e. to say an information system may be considered successful by some stakeholder but a failure by others. The concept of stakeholder represents a progression from developer - and user - centered problems to organization-wide and inter organizational information system problems. This is a sign of maturity of information systems research to show how holistic representation of the parties involved in the more complex systems currently developed (Pouloudi, 1999). Stakeholder theory proposes an ethical use of stakeholder concept in Information systems as ethical considerations and professional conduct is a significant issue in information system. The stakeholder theory is extensively used in management in investigating organizational ambiance, strategic management, ethical concerns, business planning process, e-government, project management, environment management, etc. Recently stakeholders are also seen as means to more successful information and communication technologies and information system development and implementation issues. The paper presents stakeholder theory, its origin and applications in Information Systems (IS) field in the literature. The main objective of this research is to build up the knowledge body of stakeholder applications in information systems and technology areas.","[Mishra, Alok; Mishra, Deepti] Atilim Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Atilim University,"Mishra, A (通讯作者)，Atilim Univ, U21 Global, Ankara, Turkey.",alok@atilim.edu.tr; deepti@atilim.edu.tr,"Mishra, Deepti/AAZ-1322-2020; Mishra, Alok/AAE-2673-2019","Mishra, Deepti/0000-0001-5144-3811; Mishra, Alok/0000-0003-1275-2050",,,,,70,27,49,5,80,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We surveyed researchers who have published manuscripts on SP methods in the last 10 years. Researchers were presented with hypothetical SP studies with different attributes. They were first asked which study they would recommend to use to inform policy decisions, and then asked which study has better-quality. Our results show that good-practice SP methods vary among study features and among researchers with different amounts and kinds of research experience. Although health researchers had specific preferences on which study features were better, their quality judgements were not very consistent with their judgements about the acceptability of studies for policy analysis. On the other hand, environmental researchers had similar preferences over the study attributes for the two types of questions.","[Oezdemir, Semra] Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Chapel Hill, NC 27517 USA; [Johnson, F.

There are clear differences in academic outcomes between those students who are never reclassified and those who are R-FEP English Proficient.

This paper presents lessons derived from the crisis, not only for the region it self, but also for other developing countries that might seek economic growth in the context of greater integration to the international capital markets. Some of the lessons are not new but have been reinforced by the crisis, such as Latin America's imperative need for export diversification (not only in products but in partners). Other lessons break with longstanding myths about the region, such as its inability to undertake counter-cyclical policies at - least on the monetary side. Yet other lessons reflect new developments in the current growth paradigm, such as a renewed assessment of (1) the relative roles of foreign and domestic banks in shielding the financial system against external shocks and (2) the potential costs of adopting blanket international financial regulations that do not account for a country's degree of development. Taken together, the lessons in this paper bring a new sense of optimism for growth in Latin America.",,,,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,6,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

The concept of entrepreneurship and innovation are other critical concepts that are important in our literature review. The study analyzes the work already done and presents a summary of the results achieved. We verified that the research concludes that innovation is positively related with intellectual capital. The literature shows that behind is an enterprising entrepreneur (human capital) that provides internal and external connections, enhancing thus the dynamic growth of intellectual capital and business entrepreneurship. The entrepreneur (human capital) is the one who stands out as a promoter of the company, managing the company focused mainly on innovation and adaptability.","[Santos-Rodrigues, Helena] Inst Politecn Viana do Castelo, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal; [Santos-Rodrigues, Helena] Univ Algarve, CIEO Ctr Spatial Res & Org, Faro, Portugal",Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo; Universidade do Algarve,"Santos-Rodrigues, H (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Viana do Castelo, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal.",hsantos@estg.ipvc.pt; lialves@estg.ipvc.pt,"Alves, Liliana/AAN-9160-2020; santos-rodrigues, helena/M-7073-2019; Santos-Rodrigues, Helena/A-8147-2012","Alves, Liliana/0000-0003-2453-769X; santos-rodrigues, helena/0000-0002-0442-4447; Santos-Rodrigues, Helena/0000-0002-0442-4447",,,,,20,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,597,599,,,,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000069,0

As a result some terms emerge and other terms are rejected. However, to what extent the development of the language signify the difference between old and new terms? The question concerning just relabeling or repackaging of old things is relevant in the scientific literature. A debate about changing the terminology from, personnel management to human resource management attracted huge attention among scientists (Guest, 1987; Sisson, 1990; Clark, 1993; Legge, 1995; Henry & Pettigrew, 1990, Torrington, 1989; Armstrong, 2000; Cakar, Bititci & MacBryde, 2003; Boselie, Brewster & Paauwe, 2009; Freitas, Jabbour & Santos, 2011) underlying the rhetoric of human resource academics and the reality in the organizations. The paper starts with the development of human resource management concept, emphasizing that the 1980s and 1990s are the time of the significant change in the context and content of the way in which people were managed. Drawing to the prior research, the paper identifies three main stages in the process of human resource management formation. Acknowledging that human resource management concept is controversial (Storey, 1995), the paper presents two approaches as regards personnel management (PM) and human resource management (HRM): some scientists highlight the revolutionary nature of HRM (Legge, 1989, 1995; Keenoy, 1990; Storey, 1993; Guest, 1987, 1990; Hope-Hailey et al., 1997), meanwhile others (Torrington, 1989; Armstrong, 2000) deny the relevant difference in the concepts of PM and HRM. Seeking to provide the answer to the question - does HRM differ from PM? - the paper attempts to provide the definitions of HRM, however states that a widely acknowledged definition of HRM does not exit, although the definitions of HRM disclose four HRM dimensions: high commitment, high quality, flexibility and strategic integration. To reveal better the nature of HRM, the paper provides some insights on the similarities of PM and HRM highlighting that some of similarities are viewed in the literature as differences also. Finally assessing that the differences between PM and HRM can be seen as a matter of emphasis (Armstrong, 2006), the main differences of the concepts are presented in this paper. This brings to conclusion that in the scientific literature the distinction was made between PM and HRM, and the term human resource management is now mainly used as synonyms for personnel management.","[Savaneviciene, Asta; Stankeviciute, Zivile] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Savaneviciene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.savaneviciene@ktu.lt; zivile.stankeviciute@ktu.lt,"Savanevičienė, Asta/I-8581-2019; Stankevičiūtė, Živilė/I-6551-2018","Savanevičienė, Asta/0000-0003-3132-860X; Stankevičiūtė, Živilė/0000-0002-5578-4645",,,,,48,5,6,3,51,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

From economic characteristics of merger success, we have chosen the item of net assets. Statistical testing of the hypothesis proved that mergers do not affect net assets during the period of three years after the merger implementation. A significant dependence of net assets development on mergers was proved after the basic set was stratified based on the size of companies. Mergers have a positive effect on the growth of value for owners in the group of small enterprises in the third year after the merger; the value in the group of medium enterprises also grows, but not significantly.

In all experiments, a single buyer has up to ten bargaining periods to purchase one unit of a good from each of two sellers. Treatments vary based on who makes the first offer (buyer or sellers), timing (consistent buyer-offer/sellers-demand or alternating), and information (buyer's value and sellers' costs are known or come from a uniform distribution). We find that actual bargaining outcomes are virtually identical when offers alternate, regardless of which player makes the first offer. We find that alternating offers reduce bargaining delay slightly compared to treatments in which one side or the other makes repeated take-it-or-leave-it offers.

Since Croatia is a small open country subject to large external shock and growth constraints efficient macroeconomic management framework is fundamental. The lack of data prevents to follow historic economic variables over a longer period of time, which is why CGE models look as possible solution. CGE models use calibration to solve the problem of missing most macroeconomic variables. After developing the model, we use it to run different scenarios for economic policies using a CGE model for Croatia. Results show that CGE model can be an important instrument for policy makers in running macroeconomic policies for small open countries.","[Skare, Marinko; Stjepanovic, Sasa] Univ Jurja Dobrila, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia",,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jurja Dobrila, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",mskare@efpu.hr,"Stjepanović, Saša/AAL-4337-2020; Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Stjepanović, Saša/0000-0003-1938-3681; Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692",,,,,31,1,1,1,9,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Researchers typically do not distinguish among religions, masking important variation across doctrines. Our article adopts a typology of religions based on the construct of salvific merit. Major religious doctrines are ordered based on their linkage between charitable behaviour in this life and condition in the afterlife. Using the Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (COPPS), we exploit variation in household marginal tax rates (a subsidy to charitable giving) to test the influence of major religious doctrines on charitable giving. We find that charitable giving by adherents to high-salvific-merit religions are less sensitive to changes in charitable subsidies. Adherents to low-salvific-merit religions behave more like nonreligious households. Our results suggest that religious households optimize according to specific doctrines rather than a broad notion of religion.","[Thornton, Jeremy Philip; Helms, Sara] Samford Univ, Dept Econ, Birmingham, AL 35229 USA",Samford University,"Thornton, JP (通讯作者)，Samford Univ, Dept Econ, 800 Lakeshore Dr, Birmingham, AL 35229 USA.",jpthornt@samford.edu,,"Thornton, Jeremy/0000-0001-9941-7524",,,,,27,10,10,6,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The unemployment rate differed significantly among the Czech NUTS 3 regions during the period 2005 and 2012. According to previous studies high unemployment is caused by drop in economic performance or by some structural problems in the region. We can see that the development of the Czech national unemployment rate was correlated with the economic cycle. In other words, it means that during economic growth the unemployment rate is decreasing and during economic downturn it is increasing. We used Czech Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs monthly seasonally adjusted data during the observed period between the years 2005 and 2012. We have applied 2005 registered unemployment methodology. In total, we had 96 observations. We also applied the Hodrick-Prescott filter for estimating the natural rate of unemployment This method is often used for estimating the potential output and is possible to use In the case of unemployment Our empirical results show that in most regions the real unemployment rate was lower than the natural rate of unemployment during the pre-crisis period. In other words, it means that the Czech labour market was in positive unemployment gap. However, this gap was not the same In all regions. We found that the positive unemployment gap was lower in the problematic regions like the Ustecky and Moravskoslezsky region. These findings suggest that these regions still have to face some structural problems and the labour market is not so flexible as in the rest of regions. In addition, we also found that the natural rate of unemployment has shifted permanently higher in comparison with the pre-crisis period.","[Tvrdon, Michal; Verner, Tomas] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Econ, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,tvrdon@opf.slu.cz; verner@opf.slu.cz,"Verner, Tomas/GRJ-3425-2022; Tvrdon, Michal/J-4806-2012","Tvrdon, Michal/0000-0001-9029-883X; Verner, Tomas/0000-0003-4011-0549",,,,,19,0,0,1,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,593,600,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300062,0

The results indicate that MFIs reach more clients and are more profitable in countries where access to the traditional financial system is low. This finding is in line with the market-failure hypothesis: MFIs respond to a need that banks do not fulfill and MFIs flourish where the formal financial sector fails. Along the same line, the results demonstrate that MFIs serve poorer people in countries with well-developed financial systems. The results suggest that in countries with well-developed financial systems, the two sectors stand in more direct competition with each other. This competition pushes MFIs down the market and makes mission drift by MFIs less likely.","[Vanroose, Annabel] Univ Piura, Dept Econ, Piura, Peru; [Vanroose, Annabel] Vrije Univ Brussel, APEC, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Vanroose, Annabel; D'Espallier, Bert] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr European Res Microfinance CERMi, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [D'Espallier, Bert] Univ Brussel, Hgsk, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Universidad de Piura; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Vanroose, A (通讯作者)，Univ Piura, Dept Econ, Av Ramon Mugica 131, Piura, Peru.",avroose@vub.ac.be,,"D'Espallier, Bert/0000-0001-7567-2520",,,,,56,96,105,0,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is based on a survey of firms operating in four manufacturing industries: food and beverages, automotive, pharmaceuticals and electronics. The paper takes into account: innovation inputs in enterprises, cooperation among firms in R&D activities, the benefits of cooperation with business partners and innovation effects. Five types of innovation patterns that firms in the NMS introduce to improve competitive advantage were detected using a cluster analysis. They differ in terms of in-house innovation capabilities, their forms, the use of external sources of innovation, spillover absorption and economic performance. Interestingly, most of them are similar to the innovation patterns of firms in the incumbent EU member states. This seems to confirm Shorec and Verspagen's (2008) claim that, in the heterogeneity in firms' innovation behaviour, countries matter only to a certain extent. The paper shows that in the NMS the role of the two types of innovation sources - R&D and cooperation - are complementary rather than consist of the 'make-or-buy decision' (Veugelers, 1997) model. Although external knowledge is important in innovation activities, the benefits of using it are determined by in-house innovation capacities.","[Wziatek-Kubiak, Anna] Acad Business Dabrowa Gornicza, CASE Ctr Social & Econ Res, Dabrowa Gornicza, Poland; [Balcerowicz, Ewa] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Econ, CASE Ctr Social & Econ Res, PL-00901 Warsaw, Poland; [Peczkowski, Marek] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences; University of Warsaw,"Wziatek-Kubiak, A (通讯作者)，Acad Business Dabrowa Gornicza, CASE Ctr Social & Econ Res, Dabrowa Gornicza, Poland.",,,,,,,,77,7,7,0,23,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Using structural path analysis, we compare the experiences of Mozambique and Vietnamtwo countries with similar levels and compositions of economic growth but divergent poverty outcomes. We find that the structure of the Vietnamese economy more naturally lends itself to generating broad-based growth. A given agricultural demand expansion in Mozambique will, ceteris paribus, achieve much less rural income growth than in Vietnam. Inadequate education, trade and transport systems are found to be more severe structural constraints to poverty reduction in Mozambique than in Vietnam.

We argue that the greater role of states cannot be easily explained by changes in Tiebout forces of fiscal competition, such as mobility and voting patterns, and are not accounted for by demographic or income trends. Rather, we demonstrate that much of the growth in state budgets has been driven by changes in intergovernmental interactions. Restricted federal grants to states have increased, and federal policy and. legal constraints have also mandated or heavily incentivized state own-source spending, particularly in the areas of education, health and public welfare. These outside pressures moderate the forces of fiscal competition and must be taken into account when assessing the implications of observed revenue and spending patterns. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using an inflation rate that varies by month and across province of residence as a proxy for economic performance, the results indicate a negative relationship between inflation and suicide, suggesting that suicides are countercyclical. When controlling for month and province fixed effects, however, the inflation coefficient, albeit remaining negative, is no longer significant, except in the female sample. Suicide is more prevalent among younger individuals, while the greatest proportion of suicide is seen among men. Suicides also exhibit a strong seasonal variation, with peaks in spring and summer, with December having the highest suicide prevalence. The overall results indicate a negative but insignificant relationship between economic performance and suicide in South Africa, with socio-economic differences and individual characteristics accounting for most of the variation in suicide.","Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Botha, F (通讯作者)，Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Grahamstown, South Africa.",f.botha@ru.ac.za,,,,,,,101,6,7,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

In order to test whether this difference is due to excessive sectoral aggregation, I exploit disaggregated data and estimate unobserved values to create a dataset with rich industrial sector detail. The bias caused by sectoral aggregation is estimated by calibrating a computable general equilibrium model to this dataset and comparing results with those generated from more aggregated data. A stylized unilateral carbon pricing policy is simulated. Results show that aggregated calibrations overestimate industrial output loss and underestimate the increase in the CO2 embodied in imports. The efficiency of border carbon adjustments at reducing leakage is also underestimated. However, I find that general equilibrium estimates of carbon prices and economy-wide leakage rates are mostly unaffected by the degree of industrial aggregation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Another goal of this study aims at dealing with this paradox.

Markets, however, are undemocratic, inefficient, and incentivize anti-social behavior. These shortcomings are often minimized or accepted as necessary evils because of the belief that there is no alternative to market structures. This belief is mistaken. Sophisticated alternative models of economic organization, such as participatory economics, have been proposed which are substantially more consistent with important social values. We contend that in light of these alternatives, the presumption in favor of markets should be reversed and market proponents should carry the burden of proof of demonstrating why, given their numerous shortcomings, markets should continue to occupy a privileged position as the default mode of economic organization.","[Donnaruma, Colin; Partyka, Nicholas] SUNY Albany, Philosophy Dept, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Partyka, Nicholas] SUNY Albany, Philosoph Assoc, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Donnaruma, C (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Philosophy Dept, HU257, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",cdonnaruma@hotmail.com; np181856@albany.edu,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

SSPs are differentiated by population and economic growth assumptions, while SPAS are differentiated on the level of radiative forcing in the year 2100. Regardless of the scenarios we examined Asia plays a central role in shaping the world's future with nearly half of the world's people and more than half of the world's economic activity and energy consumption. The future of Asia and the world are dramatically different across the various combinations of SSPs and SPAs. High population worlds place significant stress on Asian resources and ecosystems. In high population SSPs the poorest members of the population face high energy and food prices and the more stringent the level of emissions mitigation, the more stress poor populations experience, though the more stringent the emissions mitigation, the larger the area of unmanaged ecosystems that are preserved.

By applying the augmented difference-in-difference framework of Rajan and Zingales (1998) to the cross-country cross-industry data developed by Ciccone and Papaioannou (2009), complemented by the Financial Development and Structure database of Beck et al. (2010), we show that over the 1980-1999 period the banking sector volatility, measured as the standard deviation of the growth of private credit, has a negative impact on the growth of industries that are more externally financially dependent, and this finding is robust to various sensitivity tests. However, the detrimental growth effect of banking sector volatility disappears when the sample is restricted to the relatively placid 1980s. Compared to the 1980s, the 1990s are characterized by a more economically integrated world accompanied by more often unpredicted financial crises that disturb the banking sector. As such, our results imply that in a more economically integrated world, the stability of bank development may be important to long-run growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Since foreign patenting is one of the channels of technology transfer to a country, this study could also show the transfer of foreign technology into Canadian industries measured by foreign patent activity. The paper suggests that the patent activity of foreign countries is the most important factor for receiving foreign patents in Canada. Moreover, imports and foreign direct investments are important vehicles this context. The distance between countries has a negative impact on receiving foreign patents. The impacts of R&D intensity and human capital on receiving foreign patents are mixed and insignificant, but industries with a higher R&D intensity are better recipients of foreign patents.","Ind Canada, Canadian Intellectual Property Off, Gatineau, PQ K1A OC9, Canada",,"Nikzad, R (通讯作者)，Ind Canada, Canadian Intellectual Property Off, 50 Victoria St, Gatineau, PQ K1A OC9, Canada.",rashid.nikzad@ic.gc.ca,,,,,,,26,7,9,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Its particularities have an impact on productivity of scientific enterprise in terms of both research and teaching. Reform of the system of higher education occupies an important place in programs of catch-up modernization. Attempts to replicate Western institutional arrangements and organizational designs in this area have been undertaken in Russia since the very beginning of economic and political reforms of the 1990s. This paper considers a particular transplant, the Higher School of Economics (HSE) established in 1992, and its subsequent evolution. A structural analysis shows its divergence from the organizational patterns that served as a model. The HSE case is compared with several representative Western universities as well as other Russian universities. When explaining divergent patterns between the HSE and the Western counterparts, special attention is paid to the issue of power relationships and their role in the functioning of the scientific organization. The paper aims to contribute to the discussion of cultural entrepreneurs and their motivation.","[Oleinik, Anton] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Sociol, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Oleinik, Anton] Russian Acad Sci, Cent Econ & Math Inst, Moscow 117901, Russia",Memorial University Newfoundland; Russian Academy of Sciences; Central Economics & Mathematics Institute RAS,"Oleinik, A (通讯作者)，Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Sociol, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",,,,,,,,56,6,6,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The present paper extends their framework by examining a possible structural break in current account and real exchange rate dynamics. Using G7 country data for 1980-2007, we find structural changes in two-variable dynamics for all G7 countries during the 1990s. Temporary shocks have not been the main source of fluctuation in the current account since the 1990s.

It provides a content analysis of ObamaCare and 25 lawsuits that challenge the 2010 reform. It shows that the cultural environment determines the strength of features of governance structures and in line with this the strength of their instruments. Following Williamson's TCE model of governance structures, the zero transaction costs criterion is supplanted by the remediableness criterion. Assuming that ObamaCare might be ruled to be constitutional, the regulation of healthcare is found to be a comparative efficient governance structure in addressing adverse selection. However, the TCE analysis also reveals that ObamaCare itself is subject to some flaws in efficiency and effectiveness, namely: unbalanced adaptation mechanisms, unbalanced incentives and weak enforcement devices.","Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ USE, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Spithoven, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ USE, POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.spithoven@uu.nl,"spithoven, antoon/AHD-5838-2022","Spithoven, Antoon/0000-0002-7889-5049",,,,,37,5,5,1,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

Colonial societies used slavery intensively across the Americas, and slavery remained prevalent in most countries after independence from the European powers. We investigate the impact of slavery on long-run development in Colombia. Our identification strategy compares municipalities that had gold mines during the 17th and 18th centuries to neighboring municipalities without gold mines. Gold mining was a major source of demand for slave labor during colonial times, and all colonial gold mines are now depleted. We find that the historical presence of slavery is associated with increased poverty and reduced school enrollment, vaccination coverage and public good provision. We also find that slavery is associated with higher contemporary land inequality. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (4) (2012) 534-564.

The key idea is evolutionary selection among heterogeneous expectation rules, driven by their relative performance. The out-of-sample predictive power of our switching model is higher compared to the rational or other homogeneous expectations benchmarks.

Results are robust to two alternative specifications of an asymmetric error correction model, for which the presence of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity for disturbances is modeled by a GARCH(1,1) process. Evidence indicates that the short-term transmission of wholesale prices to retail prices is quite symmetric for both gasoline and diesel fuel. Nevertheless, in contrast to some of the results provided for an earlier period, we did not find asymmetries in the speed of retail price responses toward long-run equilibrium. our evidence also suggests that the use of weekly (or lower frequency) data is one of the possible explanations for some of the seemingly contradictory results concerning this issue.

This paper finds that regardless of the momentum horizon, the momentum effects are positive under high-performing individual stocks, but they are negative under low-performing individual stocks. While prior literature only finds that this asymmetric phenomenon appears under different market states, and the findings on different horizons are inconsistent. Furthermore, this paper finds that the positive (negative) momentum effect under high (low) firm performance levels is stronger than that under bullish (bearish) markets. This implies that superior (inferior) fundamental business performance and bullish (bearish) markets can cause the stock prices to go up (down); however, the effect of the former is stronger than that of the latter. Moreover, this paper finds that the relation between future returns and past turnover ratios is positively correlated under high-performing stocks, but negatively correlated under low-performing stocks. Based on the above findings, this paper regards past turnover ratios as a leading indicator of stock returns and suggests two profitable investment portfolios which are superior to the average returns of real estate stocks.

However, it is widely accepted that the popular realized volatility (RV) based on high frequency data is a more robust measure of actual volatility than squared return. Due to this motivation, we investigate dynamics of daily volatility of Shanghai fuel oil futures prices employing 5-minute high frequency data. First, using a nonparametric method, we find that RV displays strong long-range dependence and recent financial crisis can cause a lower degree of long-range dependence. Second, we model daily volatility using RV models and GARCH-class models. Our results indicate that RV models for intraday data overwhelmingly outperform GARCH-class models for daily data in forecasting fuel oil price volatility, regardless the proxy of actual volatility. Finally, we investigate the major source of such volatile prices and found that trader activity has major contribution to fierce variations of fuel oil prices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using a class of nonlinear smooth transition models, the author tests for asymmetry with respect to the direction and the magnitude of exchange rate changes. On the one hand, the author finds only 5 out of 12 EA countries showing asymmetric pass-through related to exchange rate appreciations and depreciations. Results are somewhat mixed with no clear evidence about the direction of asymmetry. On the other hand, the author reports strong evidence that ERPT responds asymmetrically to the size of exchange rate changes as a result of presence of menu costs. The degree of ERPT is found to be higher for large exchange rate changes than for small ones in 9 out of 12 EA countries.","[Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine] Univ Rennes 1, F-35065 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Ben Cheikh, N (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CREM, CNRS, UMR 6211, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France.",nidhaleddine.benecheikh@univ-rennes1.fr,"Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine/E-8449-2019","Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine/0000-0003-2550-6721",,,,,21,7,7,0,10,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 26,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201239.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-39,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,091GU,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315038200001,0

Trainers often prepare their own horses for races in addition to having outsiders' horses in their care. Utilizing betting market data to infer the expected performance of a horse, we find that owner-trainer horses outperform outsider-trainer horses, indicating that this principal- agent relationship is characterized by agent shirking. If the owner holds a large proportion of the horses in the trainer's stable, the shirking effect may be mitigated but not eradicated. In a separate result, we find that outsider trainer horses are more inconsistent than their owner trainer peers. As inconsistency is a sign of betting market manipulation, this suggests that the agent in this setting extracts a second, informational rent from the principal.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Brown, A (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",alasdair.brown@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,11,1,1,1,9,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The number of bidding rounds is determined by how frequently the buyer can make an offer. We show that with no limit on the frequency and without discounting, the price path is either kept flat initially with large jumps at the end or increasing steadily over time. Which class of path occurs in equilibrium depends on the buyer's trade-off between committing to a price ceiling versus finely screening the sellers' costs. With discounting, limiting the number of rounds mitigates the delay caused by the reluctance to raise bids in the first class of equilibrium and therefore can benefit the buyer. This result suggests why, in reality, bargaining parties often take measures to make their offers rigid and consequently force themselves to make fewer offers.","Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chen, CH (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,24,12,15,0,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The specification with endogenous separation succeeds along these dimensions. Allowing for on-the-job search enables the model to replicate the Beveridge curve. All specifications, however, fail to generate sufficient volatility of the job finding rate. While adopting the Hagedorn-Manovskii calibration remedies this problem, the volume of job-to-job transitions in the on-the-job search specification becomes essentially zero.

However the vast majority of these articles estimate the NKPC using the labor income share as the proxy for real marginal cost. This article argues that the labor share cannot serve as a proxy for real marginal cost because of its countercyclicality and the lack of labor adjustment costs. Once we account for labor adjustment costs, we are able to derive a new marginal cost proxy that is indeed procyclical; however, we find that the NKPC fails to produce coefficients consistent with its underlying structural parameters when a procyclical marginal cost proxy is used.

Given that only 21.6% answered correctly, they conclude that professional understanding of the concept is dismal. We challenge this critique of the profession. Specifically, we allow for alternative opportunity cost accounting methodologies-one of which is derived from the term's definition as found in Ferraro and Taylor- and rely on the conventional relationship between willingness to pay and substitute goods to demonstrate that every answer to the multiple-choice question is defensible. The Ferraro and Taylor survey question suggests difficulties in framing an opportunity cost accounting question, as well as a lack of coordination in opportunity cost accounting methodology. In scope and logic, we conclude that the survey question does not, however, succeed in measuring professional understanding of opportunity cost.

One explanation for gender inequality stems from the effects of the interaction between competition and two pressure sources, namely, task stereotypes and time constraints. This study uses a laboratory experiment to find that the gender gap in performance under competition and preferences for competition can be partly explained by the differential responses of men and women to the above pressures. In particular, while women underperform the men in a high-pressure math-based tournament, women greatly increase their performance levels and their willingness to compete in a low-pressure verbal environment, such that they actually surpass the men. This effect appears largely due to the fact that extra time in a verbal competition improves the quality of womens work, reducing their mistake share. On the other hand, men use this extra time to increase only the quantity of work, which results in a greater relative number of mistakes. A labor market study suggests that the nature of the job and the stress level are correlated with the gender gap in the labor market in a manner consistent with the results of my experiment.","Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA",Wellesley College,"Shurchkov, O (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA.",oshurchk@wellesley.edu,,,,,,,27,121,135,1,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The players of the game, the proposers and the responders, are randomly matched to play the game. When the responders face low offers from the proposers, their decisions are influenced by not only the monetary payoff but also their feelings. To quantify the responders' feelings, a degree of dissatisfaction is introduced into the game. Asymmetrical replicator dynamics is used to study the evolution of the proportion of players with different strategies. The solutions of the differential equations exhibit complex outcomes mainly depending on the degree of dissatisfaction.

Residential mobility is low, but we find some evidence that those who move in old age tend to reduce housing consumption and investment by going from owning to renting. This 'downsizing' is positively linked to housing capital gains, while the existence of reverse mortgages in a country reduces it.

We then use a stylized growth model to analyze the various channels through which a brain drain affects the sending countries and review the evidence on these channels. The recent empirical literature shows that high-skill emigration need not deplete a country's human capital stock and can generate positive network externalities. Three case studies are also considered: the African medical brain drain, the exodus of European scientists to the United States, and the role of the Indian diaspora in the development of India's information technology sector.

Using data on Indian manufacturing firms, this paper analyzes the relationship between firm's productivity and export market participation during 1991-2004. While it provides evidence of the self-selection hypothesis by showing that more productive firms become exporters, the results do not show that entry into export markets enhances productivity. The paper examines the explanation of self selection hypothesis for total factor productivity differences across 33,510 exporting and non-exporting firms. It uses propensity score matching to test the learning-by-exporting hypothesis. In line with the prediction of recent heterogeneous firm models of international trade, the main finding of the paper is: more productive firms become exporters but it is not the case that learning by exporting is a channel fuelling growth in Indian manufacturing.

Focus has ranged from the effect of particular explanatory variables to improved econometric techniques. However, there appears to be a lack of analyses on large international trade datasets aiming at describing the stylized facts of observed bilateral trade flows. Uncovering them is crucial as any empirical econometric model should reflect the basic properties of the data generating process. On the basis of a large panel dataset this paper finds that bilateral trade, despite being often unbalanced, tends to be reciprocal and persistent, and that the extensive margin of trade must not be disregarded. Moreover, bilateral trade flows are probably best modeled as a mixed panel of stationary and non-stationary processes. The stationary vs non-stationary separation of these flows, although not random, does not appear to be related to any common characteristics of the trading partners.","[Konya, Laszlo] La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; [Harris, Mark N.] Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Econometr & Quantitat Modelling, Perth, WA, Australia; [Matyas, Laszlo] Cent European Univ, Dept Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",La Trobe University; Curtin University; Central European University,"Kónya, L (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",mark.harris@curtin.edu.au; l.konya@latrobe.edu.au; matyas@ceu.hu,"Konya, Laszlo/C-3118-2008; Harris, Mark/O-5084-2015","Harris, Mark/0000-0002-1804-4357; Konya, Laszlo/0000-0001-5613-7258; Laszlo, Matyas/0000-0002-5250-5735",,,,,21,7,8,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The city size distribution under a central place hierarchy exhibits a power law if the distribution of scale economies is regularly varying, which is a general class that encompasses many well-known, commonly used distributions.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Hsu, WT (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, AS2 Level 6,1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",wentai@nus.edu.sg,"Hsu, Wen-Tai/H-6813-2013; Hsu, Wen-Tai/AAL-9782-2020","Hsu, Wen-Tai/0000-0003-0816-1194; Hsu, Wen-Tai/0000-0003-0816-1194",,,,,43,78,82,3,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

Data analysis in the paper is also framed by suggestions for an income-contingent student loan scheme in Latvia, modeled after the Australian example of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. This research models a possible student loan payment pattern in Latvia under an income-contingent student loan plan. Data analysis shows that in the current mortgage-type student loan system, graduates of both genders in all fields of study and income groups have similar student debt levels, on average. At the same time, the largest portion of student debt is held by graduates in lower income groups. In the context of an income-contingent student loan payment scheme, analysis reveals that women and graduates in the field of humanities, pedagogy and psychology would be likely to belong to the low payment group. Consistent with findings in other studies, this research finds that female higher education graduates have lower income than men, on average, while graduates in the field of economics and business management tend to have higher income than graduates in other fields of study.","[Mhamed, Ali Ait Si] Canisius Coll, Dept Adolescent Educ, Buffalo, NY 14228 USA; [Kasa, Rita] Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, LV-1010 Riga, Latvia; [Cunska, Zane] Balt Int Ctr Econ Studies, LV-1010 Riga, Latvia",,"Mhamed, AAS (通讯作者)，Canisius Coll, Dept Adolescent Educ, 2001 Main St, Buffalo, NY 14228 USA.",aitsimha@canisius.edu; rita.kasa@sseriga.edu; zane@biceps.org,"Kim, Moon Jung/D-3519-2014","Kasa, Rita/0000-0002-4479-9315",,,,,35,0,0,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

This pressure to disburse money is termed as the 'Money-Moving Syndrome' (MMS). The theoretical analysis in this paper relies on the principal-agent theory to explore how donor agencies' institutional incentive systems may affect the characteristics of an optimal and efficient incentive contract and thus give rise to the MMS. The basic framework of the principal-agent theory was innovatively adapted to fit the organizational settings of donor agencies. The model concludes that the extent to which a performance measure based on the amount of aid allocated within a specific period of time would lead to the MMS and affect aid effectiveness depends on the level of 'institutional imperatives', the degree of aid agency's accountability for effectiveness, the level of corruption in recipient countries and the degree of difficulty to evaluate development activities.","Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Monkam, NF (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa.",nara.monkam@up.ac.za,"Monkam, Nara/HAL-0188-2022","Monkam, Nara/0000-0003-1859-9077",,,,,46,4,6,0,40,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

The most important result is that there is feedback causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in India which implies that the level of economic activity and energy consumption mutually influence each other; a high level of economic growth leads to a high level of energy consumption and vice versa.

We tested a claim of the Weber-Fechner law as applied to electoral behaviour-specifically, that an expanded public sector leads politicians to make more significant, opportunistic distortions of public expenditures than the distortions observed when the public sector is diminished. We employed a system of simultaneous equations to test this hypothesis for cases observed in more than sixty democracies since 1960. We gave a special focus to the cases of Central and Eastern European countries. Our results confirm the main implications of the Weber-Fechner law. Years in incumbency, running for re-election, higher unemployment and higher inflation rates tend to generate negative moods, feelings and affects in the electorate; thus, these factors tend to approximate the vote share of the most voted party to the remaining vote share of the challenger political forces.","Univ Minho, Econ & Management Sch, P-4700 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Mourao, PJR (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Econ & Management Sch, P-4700 Braga, Portugal.",paulom@eeg.uminho.pt,"Mourao, Paulo/D-9619-2011","Mourao, Paulo/0000-0001-6046-645X",,,,,45,3,3,0,13,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

'Keynesian' means recognizing the crucial role of aggregate demand, grasping the paradox of saving, advocating fiscal stimulus (tax cuts as well as government spending) in a recession despite the temporary increase in debt that it generates, and recognizing that monetary stimulus alone is inadequate in a severe recession. Contrary to the claims of austerity advocates, fiscal stimulus in general (and tax cuts in particular) did not fail during the Great Recession, but on the contrary helped avert a depression. The Keynesian multiplier is much larger in recession than in prosperity, but empirical studies often estimate its value in prosperity instead of recession. Keynesians should support austerity in prosperity and stimulus in recession. Unless a second Keynesian revolution is launched and succeeds in persuading both the economics profession and the public, the next severe recession may become a depression.","Univ Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Seidman, L (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",,,,,,,,16,6,6,1,19,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Income inequality can be reduced by higher income tax in a near steady state, but it cannot be reduced in the early stage of economic development, and (iii) that two government polices rapid economic growth and low income inequality - can be achieved by low income tax in the early stage of economic development, but both cannot be achieved simultaneously in a near steady state.

We show the existence of a separating hypersurface that can be used to provide a dual characterization of efficient allocations. When the separating hypersurface is non-linear, this implies that non-linear pricing is an integral part of economic efficiency.

In this paper, we argue that an individual's reputation along a particular dimension will have a positive effect on the behavior of investors when it is role congruent. In addition, we argue that also scoring favorably on the role-incongruent dimension at the same time-or, in other words, engaging in reputational category spanning-will weaken the positive effect of the role-congruent reputation. Our empirical setting is the film industry where we study the effect of the two main dimensions of reputation in cultural industries, artistic and commercial, of both directors and producers on the size of the investment by distributors. In this study, artistic reputation is based on professional critics' reviews and commercial reputation on box office performance of the films in which individuals were involved in the past. We find that the commercial reputation of a film producer based on past box office performance has a positive effect on the size of the investment by film distributors. In addition, we find that directors who at the same time combine both a favorable commercial as well as an artistic reputation actually receive a lower investment from film distributors.","[Ebbers, Joris J.; Wijnberg, Nachoem M.] Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Ebbers, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.j.ebbers@uva.nl; n.m.wijnberg@uva.nl,"Ebbers, Joris J./AAD-2760-2019","Ebbers, Joris J./0000-0003-1016-6728; Wijnberg, Nachoem/0000-0001-8070-8719",,,,,71,13,13,1,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Despite missing price tags and despite the option to pay nothing at all, we observe that the vast majority of guests makes strictly positive payments. Over the two years covered by our data, average payments decline slightly, converging at a positive level. At the same time, the number of daily guests increases steadily, resulting in a considerable increase in total revenues. We discuss one possible interpretation of the long-term trend in payments in terms of social norms. We further show that short-term fluctuations in average payments are partly explained by exogenous weather changes. We provide evidence that - in line with work in psychology - weather-induced changes in mood affect payments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

It develops a model with credit-constrained firms facing liquidity shocks denominated in tradables while their revenues are both in tradable and nontradables. With frictions in the reallocation between tradables and nontradables, a peg is more growth-enhancing than a float in countries with dollarized debt because it stabilizes firms' cash flows and therefore allows them to face liquidity shock and complete their innovation process. However, this relative advantage diminishes when dollarization decreases. These theoretical predictions are confirmed by an empirical analysis on a panel of 76 countries spanning 1995-2004: the higher the degree of dollarization, the more negative the impact of exchange rate flexibility on growth. The empirical results are robust to various specifications and to the treatment of endogeneity.","Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, UNIL Dorigny, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Benhima, K (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, UNIL Dorigny, Extranef Room 250, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",kenza.benhima@unil.ch,,"Benhima, Kenza/0000-0002-7765-3398",,,,,57,13,15,2,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

High-frequency changes in program scheduling are commonplace in Argentina. This paper uses this variation in program scheduling as an instrumental variable in order to measure the degree of substitution across the programs broadcast by the five network television stations in a large Argentinean market. In line with the results of prior studies, the results of this paper show evidence of substantial business stealing in network television: increases in the ratings of a station primarily decrease the ratings of other stations. However, the estimates also show that the increases in ratings attributable to new viewers entering the market range between 3 and 5 percentage points for each 10-point increase in a channel's viewership.

Two continuous indices are constructed to measure the evolution and intensity of financial reforms: a financial liberalization index and a capital control index. Dynamic panel GMM method is used to estimate firms' financing constraints in an Euler-equation investment model. Based on panel data of listed firms for 1996-2007, we find that large firms face no credit constraints and smaller firms display significant constraints. However, the sensitivity of large firms' investment to their cash holdings is heightened as more financial reforms take place. It appears that reforms that gradually eliminate preferential treatments to large firms, primarily state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China, have subjected these firms' investment decisions to stricter market-based discipline and therefore raised their financing constraints. No significant change in the financing constraint is detected for smaller firms in China. This is interpreted as financial reform in China has not been substantial enough for its benefits to reach smaller firms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Dang, Vinh Q.

First, it develops a north-south model in which the ratio between the income elasticity of exports and imports in the south (which gives the rate of growth compatible with external equilibrium) depends on the Keynesian and Schumpeterian efficiencies of the pattern of specialization, as defined by Dosi et al. (1990). Second, the model is tested by including the technology gap and proxies for the pattern of specialization (Keynesian and Schumpeterian efficiency) in Keynesian growth regressions.

We study beliefs about the benefits of the privatization of water services measured immediately after the 2006 nationalization. Negative opinions about privatization prevail. We find that reality can change beliefs: people who had first-hand experience observing the investments made by the privatized company have a better opinion of water privatization (relative to other privatizations) than people who did not gain access to water. The effect, while statistically significant, seems small adding only 0.8 points on a 1-10 scale. Moreover, the effect of priming subjects with government propaganda against privatization has an effect that almost offsets the effect of gaining water. However, our evidence suggests that the presence of firm investments makes beliefs about the benefits of privatization less susceptible to be affected by propaganda. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For comparative purposes the authors replicate the policy framework and assessment strategy of the well-known 'no-inclusion' model of Bernanke-Gertler (Monetary Policy and Asset Price Volatility, 1999, and Should Central Banks Respond to Movements in Asset Prices? 2001). The performance of five policy rules is assessed. Two are 'traditional' Taylor rules (i.e. with no financial indicators) that differ in the relative weight on the output and inflation gaps. Three are 'financial' Taylor rules, that is, augmented with one financial indicator: the deviation from trend of stock prices, of Tobin's q (the rate of change stock prices relative to capital stock) and of investment. The authors show results that are at variance with Bernanke-Gertler. First, because among the traditional rules the best performing one is output aggressive instead of inflation aggressive. Second, because the financial rule with Tobin's q outperforms the traditional inflation-aggressive one under all dimensions and cases. However, the authors cannot draw a univocal conclusion as regards the comparison between the financial rule with Tobin's q and the traditional but output aggressive rule.","[Tamborini, Roberto] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Tamborini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Trento, Italy.",roberto.tamborini@unitn.it,"Tamborini, Roberto/H-4183-2019",,,,,,34,1,1,0,5,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 4,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201214.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-14,0.0,,,48,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,937QK,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303673000001,0

In a stylized two-country intertemporal general equilibrium model, we derive welfare maximizing emission caps in emerging and industrialized countries, taking account of country differences in technology, environmental preferences and propensity to save. Simultaneous target setting is compared to a sequential one in which the industrialized country commits itself to binding targets first. In the latter case, when the industrialized economy has stronger environmental preferences and a lower relative pollution production share, the industrialized economy can increase its joint economic and environmental welfare by setting a laxer target. On the other hand, when the emerging economy has considerably higher environmental preferences, our results suggest that the industrialized economy will choose a more restrictive target in a sequential setting than in a simultaneous one, contrary to first thought that a first mover is always pursuing a 'symbolic' policy with a lax target.","[Bednar-Friedl, Birgit] Graz Univ, Dept Econ, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Bednar-Friedl, Birgit] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Bednar-Friedl, B (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",birgit.friedl@uni-graz.at,"Bednar-Friedl, Birgit/F-3257-2016","Bednar-Friedl, Birgit/0000-0002-8348-4615",,,,,44,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2012,39.0,2,,,SI,,191,215,,10.1007/s10663-012-9187-6,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309994100003,0

We therefore propose an alternative model of risky and uncertain choice where decision weights-affective or perceived risk-are endogenous. Affective decision making (ADM) is a strategic model of choice under risk and uncertainty where we posit two cognitive processes the rational and the emotional process. The two processes interact in a simultaneous-move intrapersonal potential game, and observed choice is the result of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game. We show that regular ADM potential games have an odd number of locally unique pure strategy Nash equilibria, and demonstrate this finding for affective decision making in insurance markets. We prove that ADM potential games are refutable by axiomatizing the ADM potential maximizers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Trade actions are modeled as individual and trade-action-based option contracts (nonforcing contracts) are explored. The paper introduces the distinction between divided and unified investment and trade actions, and it shows the key role this distinction plays in determining whether efficient investment and trade can be achieved. Under a nonforcing dual-option contract, the party without the trade action is made the residual claimant with regard to the investment action, which induces efficient investment in the divided case. The unified case is more problematic: here, efficiency is typically not attainable, but the dual-option contract is still optimal in a wide class of settings. More generally, the paper shows that, with ex post renegotiation, constraining parties to use forcing contracts implies a strict reduction in the set of implementable value functions.","[Buzard, Kristy; Watson, Joel] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Buzard, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",kbuzard@ucsd.edu; jwatson@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,42,10,11,0,15,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The results of the model also illustrate how, during the recent period of price stability in Peru, both permanent and transitory shocks in inflation show a decrease in volatility.

I jointly estimate a system of differentiated product demand and pricing equations under alternative market structures. Overall, China's banking reforms have achieved mixed results. Although there is a welfare gain from more consumers participating in the deposit market, the existing consumers suffer welfare losses because of declined service quality. The welfare effects are unevenly distributed, with losses skewed toward inland provinces and certain consumer groups. There is no clear evidence that the pricing of banking services has become more competitive after the reform, and such pricing remains subject to government intervention. Encouragingly, the price-cost margins of some state commercial banks have fallen over time. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (2) (2012) 291-313.

A key idea of this paper is to consider nest-monotonic two-stage acts, which share their rankings of states with those of their reduced one-stage acts. Our main theorem shows that the axioms, one of which is restricted to nest-monotonic two-stage acts, and consequentialism are satisfied if and only if the preference is exponential CEU, which is such that the probability capacity is an exponential transformation of a probability measure. This result indicates that within a specified range of decision problems, exponential CEU is the only form of CEU that derives indifference to the timing of information resolution. Furthermore, the relation between first- and second-stage exponential CEU is characterized both by the f*-Bayesian updating rule and by comonotonic dynamic consistency. Conditions to establish the law of iterated expectation for CEU are also discussed.","Iwate Prefectural Univ, Fac Policy Studies, Takizawa, Iwate 0200193, Japan",Iwate Prefectural University,"Koida, N (通讯作者)，Iwate Prefectural Univ, Fac Policy Studies, 152-52 Aza Sugo, Takizawa, Iwate 0200193, Japan.",nobuo@iwate-pu.ac.jp,"Koida, Nobuo/AAJ-6484-2020","Koida, Nobuo/0000-0003-4245-3895",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730168] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,37,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Two approaches to derive policy advice seem to emerge in the literature: The first, most prominent one, is organized in terms of the idea to maximize a hedonic social welfare function. The second focuses on the design of constitutional rules to facilitate the individuals' self-determined pursuit of happiness. We suggest to substantiate what it means to pursue (rather than merely enjoy) happiness in order to provide the constitutional approach to happiness politics with deeper psychological foundations and a more refined policy focus. Specifically, the pursuit of happiness is seen as being constituted not only by the satisfaction of innate needs for self-determination (generating procedural utility), but also by (i) the enjoyable anticipation of hedonically valuable outcomes, and (ii) the use of these outcomes within the context of an overarching process of preference learning. If extended in this direction, a notion of the pursuit of happiness has interesting conceptual and policy implications. The latter are exemplified by suggestions on how to re-focus public decision-making mechanisms.","Max Planck Inst Econ, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Schubert, C (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",schubert@econ.mpg.de,,"Schubert, Christian/0000-0002-2578-0109",,,,,74,28,29,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2012,65.0,2,,,,,245,261,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2012.00537.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,926VU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302860800007,0

Yet, there are significant uncertainties in such formulations whose impact on key model results have been insufficiently examined or considered. This paper reviews the major types of uncertainty in log-linear experience curves and their effect on projected rates of cost reduction. Uncertainties are found not only in the learning rate parameter of a log-linear model, but also in the functional form that determines the shape of an experience curve. Evidence for alternative forms such as an S-shaped curve is reviewed along with case studies that demonstrate the uncertainties associated with cost increases during early commercialization of a technology a phenomena that is widely recognized but rarely quantified or incorporated in learning models. Additional factors discussed include the effects of learning discontinuities, institutional forgetting, and the influence of social, economic and political factors. We then review other models of causality, which aim to improve modelers' ability to explain and predict the influence of other underlying processes that contribute to technology cost reductions in addition to learning. Ignoring other types of underlying mechanisms can create a false sense of precision and overestimate the true contribution of learning. Currently, however, uncertainties in such multi-factor models remain large due to the difficulties of estimating key parameters (such as private-sector R&D investments) and extending models of a specific technology to a broader suite of technologies and cost projections. Pending the development and validation of more robust models of technological change, we suggest ways to significantly improve the characterization and reporting of current learning model uncertainties and their impacts on the results of energy-economic models to help reduce the potential for drawing inappropriate or erroneous policy conclusions.

This conflict arises because older households without children have weaker incentives to support the provision of high quality educational services in a community than younger households with school-age children. We develop an overlapping generations model for households in a system of multiple jurisdictions. This model captures the differences in preferred policies over the life-cycle. We show that the observed inequality in educational policies across communities is not only the outcome of stratification by income, but is also determined by the stratification by age and a political process that is dominated by older voters in many urban communities with low quality of educational services. The mobility of older households creates a positive fiscal externality since it creates a larger tax base per student. This positive tax externality can dominate the negative effects that arise because older households tend to vote for lower educational expenditures. As a consequence sorting by age can reduce the inequality in educational outcomes that is driven by income sorting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Unemployment, if any, will be temporary, unless labor market rigidities prevent the necessary adjustment. By contrast, we argue that trade shocks trigger a process of creative destruction that necessarily causes distortions in the structure of productive capacity and, hence, market disequilibria. Therefore, the structural change that follows trade shocks can no longer be analyzed within an equilibrium framework. The transition following a shock may be characterized by increasing imbalances, and create scope for policy intervention.

Using numerical simulations, this paper shows that if the tax authority is prevented from conditioning tax rates on age, some degree of progressivity is desirable as progressive taxation better imitates optimal age-dependent taxes than an optimal age-independent tax system. This role for progressive taxation emanates from efficiency reasons and does not rely on any insurance nor re-distribution arguments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper the link is extended to the petroleum market with the recognition that recorded stocks of oil comprise a small share of annual demand and that the parallel with storable commodities is the decision to produce the oil in the first place, as opposed to holding it in the ground as reserve. Oil reserves are then a key asset in producing countries, which is arbitraged against financial assets. Thus, when the yield on financial assets falls, retaining oil reserves becomes more attractive to producing countries, which then have less incentive to accommodate demand rises, and so the oil price rises. This perspective on oil pricing is modeled in a dynamic multi-region general equilibrium framework in which regional households manage portfolios of assets that include oil reserves. When the model is calibrated to match observed data over two decades, simulation results indicate that asset arbitrage made a large contribution to the high pre-GFC oil price.

Then even a small amount of hysteresis-even a small shadow cast on future potential output by the cyclical downturn-means, by simple arithmetic, that expansionary fiscal policy is likely to be self-financing. Even if it is not, it is highly likely to pass the sensible benefit-cost test of raising the present value of future potential output. Thus, at the zero bound, where the central bank cannot or will not but in any event does not perform its full role in stabilization policy, fiscal policy has the stabilization policy mission that others have convincingly argued it lacks in normal times. Whereas many economists have assumed that the path of potential output is invariant to even a deep and prolonged downturn, the available evidence raises a strong fear that hysteresis is indeed a factor. Although nothing in our analysis calls into question the importance of sustainable fiscal policies, it strongly suggests the need for caution regarding the pace of fiscal consolidation.","[Delong, J.

It is demonstrated that when platform access (i.e., purchasing a device) takes place in advance of application pricing, a non-trivial unravelling problem exists that rules out selling platform access at a positive price. Consequently, all platform revenues come from sharing application provider revenues. It is demonstrated that several restrictive conditions on application providers, such as most favoured customer clauses, can allow the platform provider to earn more profits and charge a positive access price increasing the likelihood the platform is provided.

Unfortunately, for practical purposes, the concept depends on the determination of potential output, which is an inherently unobservable variable. In this paper, we examine whether the real-time estimates of the output gap as published by the OECD can be improved by referring to measures of physical capital capacity utilization from business tendency surveys. These data relate directly to the stress on the current capacity to produce goods and services and are not revised. Our real-time panel data set comprises 22 countries at annual frequency with data vintages from June 1995 to June 2011 and a subset of 15 countries with quarterly data vintages from December 2003 to June 2011.

We aim to answer the following questions. First, how does the trade policy of a given country (and countries within the same region) affect a nation's domestic growth? Second, should developing economies in South and South-East Asia engage in regional trade agreements (RTA) or move towards broad liberalization? Our results show that openness of either a single country or of its neighbors does not affect a nation's growth and that the impacts of RTA are unclear (if not detrimental to growth in some cases, once endogeneity is accounted for).

In this paper, data for 23 European countries were used over the period of 1995-2009 on the quarterly basis. Two different tests were used to estimate the stationarity of the model variables, which are the Ng and Perron (2001) unit root test procedure and approach proposed by Zivot and Andrews (1992) for unit root test allowing for a structural shift. Then the Kejriwal and Perron (2008, 2010) structural break test was applied to determine the presence of structural breaks in series. In most countries except Belgium and Finland UDmax and WDmax tests rejected the hypothesis of no breaks. To test the cointegration relationships between investment and saving flows of European Union members three different cointegration techniques were applied to the data. Firstly, the Johansen (1988) cointegration approach was used for the case of no cointegration shifts, then the Gregory and Hansen (1996) cointegration test was applied, which allows for one structural shift. Finally, again the Johansen' cointegration approach was used: however, this time with the inclusion of dummy variables related to earlier selected structural break locations. The empirical results provided stronger evidence of cointegration between investment and saving variables in the case of structural break accommodation compared to the case where the presence of structural breaks was ignored. The estimated saving retention coefficient in the presence of structural breaks using the Kejriwal and Perron (2008, 2010) approach appeared relatively low in many cases, illustrating by this the openness of estimated countries. In general, world and European countries with time have a tendency to a higher level of their capital market openness. Estimations of a saving retention coefficient in the presence of structural changes do not support the existence of the Feldstein-Horioka Puzzle in the considered EU countries, except Belgium.

An analysis of household income and expenditure survey data shows that income and consumption are lower during Monga than in other seasons, and that seasonal income greatly influences seasonal consumption. Econometric estimates reject the hypothesis of perfect consumption smoothing. In the northwestern region of greater Rangpur, rural households suffer disproportionately from Monga. Seasonal differences in poverty across regions are due mainly to differences in household-specific seasonality of income and consumption. Income diversification explains the lower incidence of income seasonality observed in non-Rangpur regions. To contain seasonal hunger in greater Rangpur, public policies should promote rural income diversification together with seasonal migration. A flexible microfinance scheme that provides both production and consumption loans on flexible repayment terms could help diversify income and reduce seasonality of income and poverty.

We examine the impact of file-sharing on sales of recorded music and on the demand for live concert performances. We provide evidence suggesting that while file-sharing reduced album sales, it simultaneously increased demand for concerts.

Specifically, technological advance during prehistory was slow because of institutional resistance to change rooted in custom, tradition, myth, superstition, ritual, and belief in the power of dubious deities. Cases examined include early use of fire, flood control, pottery, diet, birthing, and others. In addition, the institution of organized belligerence has been shown by archaeologists to have severely restrained betterment of the human condition. Recent archaeological digs provide indisputable proof that a propensity toward violence has been present among the earliest members of the human species and throughout much of prehistory.

While both effects are found to be significant in non-parametric tests, the former effect, which has been neglected in previous studies, has a stronger impact on total donations, while the latter effect has a greater impact on the probability of donating.

We compare the wages of skilled and unskilled labor between 1994 and 2002 with their respective productivities over this period. Education is considered to be responsible for the skill formation over this period: the change in skilled labor supply is endogenous in the model. Compared to its productivity, skilled labor is underpaid in the initial period and overpaid in the second period. Unskilled labor is underpaid in both periods. A decomposition exercise shows that skilled labor gains from free trade, and stands to lose due to education and domestic competition in the second period. The annualized rate of return to education is between 7 and 10%. The economy operates below its potential in both periods, particularly in the second-due to trade limitations and the failure to capture the return to education.

Because, as long as preferences are randomly selected, there will typically be a single top valuator, it follows that, typically, the equilibrium is unique, with all players but one contributing nothing, hence free riding in the sense of the ordinary English usage of the expression.

J,"Alm, J; McClellan, C",,,,"Alm, James; McClellan, Chandler",,,Tax Morale and Tax Compliance from the Firm's Perspective,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EVASION; ATTITUDES,"Much recent research has investigated whether values, social norms, and attitudes differ across countries and whether these differences have measurable effects on economic behavior. One area in which such studies are particularly relevant is tax compliance, and a factor that has been suggested as a factor in compliance behavior is tax morale, or the intrinsic motivation to pay taxes. However, all of this work on tax morale has focused on individuals, not on firms. In this paper, we use information from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey and also from the World Enterprise Survey for a wide range of countries over several years of data to examine a firm's tax morale and the subsequent impact on firm tax compliance. We use these data first to examine a firm's perception of taxes as an obstacle to doing business. Importantly, once we control for the various factors that affect this perception, what is left is a measure that we believe is a measure of the firm's tax morale, as a driver of the firm's view of the appropriateness of cheating on taxes. With this measure of tax morale, we are then able to examine in a second stage estimation how our estimated firm tax morale affects the compliance decisions of the firm. Ultimately, our results allow us to identify factors that allow the government to improve its efforts to increase firm tax compliance.","[Alm, James] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [McClellan, Chandler] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Tulane University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Alm, J (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 208 Tilton Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",jalm@tulane.edu; chandler.mcclellan@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,56,69,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2012,65.0,1,,,,,1,17,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00524.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,882EA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299543200001,0

In this paper, we employ a global database and novel measures to provide a fresh look at the determinants of firms' influence over regulatory agencies. We find that in addition to traditional industry-level determinants, important country-level institutional and firm-level determinants affect firms' regulatory agency influence. We also find that regulatory process variations affect firms' influence over regulators. With these empirical estimates in hand, we generate a Regulatory Influence Index that ranks influence levels of typical firms that operate in each sample country in the dataset, and then discuss the substantial country-level variation in regulatory agency influence that obtains.","[Macher, Jeffrey T.; Mayo, John W.] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Mayo, JW (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",jtm4@georgetown.edu; mayoj@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,29,11,13,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The selection process for treatment is therefore conditional on having a low probability of employment, making evaluation of its effect intrinsically difficult. We exploit the fact that the benefit increase is only available to individuals aged 55 or older, estimating its impact using a regression discontinuity approach. Our first results indicate a large drop in employment for disabled individuals who receive the increase in the benefit. Testing for the linearity of covariates around the eligibility age threshold reveals that the age at which individuals start claiming DI is not continuous: the benefit increase appears to accelerate the entry rate of individuals aged 55 or over. We obtain new estimates excluding this group of claimants, and find that the policy decreases the employment probability by 8%. We conclude that the observed DI generosity elasticity of 0.22 on labour market participation is mostly due to income effects since benefit receipt is not work contingent in the system studied.

The way of achieving this is to have a steeply rising carbon tax during the initial oil-only phase, a less-steeply rising carbon tax during the intermediate phase where oil and coal are used alongside each other and the following coal-only phase, and a flat carbon tax during the final renewables-only phase. The laissez-faire outcome uses coal forever or starts with oil until it is no longer cost-effective to do so and then switches to coal. We also analyze the effects on the optimal transition times and carbon tax of a carbon-free, albeit expensive backstop (solar or wind energy). Subsidizing renewables to just below the cost of coal does not affect the oil-only phase. The gain in green welfare dominates the welfare cost of the subsidy if the subsidy gap is small and the global warming challenge is acute. Without a carbon tax a prohibitive coal tax leads to less oil left in situ and substantially delays introduction of renewables, but curbs global warming substantially as coal is never used. Finally, we characterize under general conditions what the optimal sequencing oil and coal looks like. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We applied a two-step analysis to Italian provincial data for the years 2003-2005. We implemented a classic panel analysis, followed by a two-step GMM (Generalised Method of Moments) analysis in which we introduced the spatial variable. The analysis shows that the number of civilian disability pensions is not related to disabling disease, but it is related to the unemployment rate in some areas and to the rate of poverty everywhere. These results robustly hold when the spatially lagged dependent variable is introduced among the regressors. The spatial variable allows us to take into account the local dimension and the possible social, historical, and cultural links among provinces that go beyond administrative boundaries. In discussing the results, we stress that the figures reflect the number of civilian disability pensions granted, not those requested. Moreover, the national legislation on the attribution of civilian disability pensions is administered locally; therefore, its application may reflect degrees of discretionary interpretation. We propose that there is room to interpret the use of civilian disability pensions as an antipoverty policy instrument in areas characterised by economic difficulties. However, we suggest that civilian disability pensions are particularly unsuited to play the role of an assistance policy instrument; once granted, they are seldom withdrawn despite possible changes in the financial situation of the recipient.","[Agovino, Massimiliano; Parodi, Giuliana] Univ dAnnunzio Chieti Pescara, Dipartimento Metodi Quantitat & Teoria Econ, I-65127 Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,,agovino.massimo@gmail.com; parodi@unich.it,,,,,,,28,9,9,0,0,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTR 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-916X,,978-3-7908-2772-9; 978-3-7908-2771-2,AIEL SER LABOUR ECON,,,2012,,,,,,,149,167,,10.1007/978-3-7908-2772-9_8,0.0,,,19,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDD90,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312877400008,0

We follow the behavioral equilibrium exchange rate model, where the equilibrium real exchange rate depends on both the balance of payments approach and the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis. The results indicate that although large and persistent overvaluation contributes to a crisis in Turkey, a relatively small overvaluation, contrary to both the Washington Consensus view and the Rodrik view, promotes the growth of Turkish economy.

The argument is that tax distortions increase when production is more easily relocated across countries (the elasticity argument). We question this perception in a model that captures standard mechanisms from trade and open-economy models. Importantly, the retrenchment argument overlooks the fact that the basic effect of integration (i.e., gains from trade) tends to lower the marginal costs of public funds. Moreover, the elasticity argument is not unambiguously supported, and there is no race to the bottom as a result of the perceived terms-of-trade effects of non-cooperative fiscal policies.","[Andersen, Torben M.] Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Sorensen, Allan] Aarhus Univ, DK-8210 Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Andersen, TM (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.",tandersen@econ.au.dk; allans@asb.dk,"Sørensen, Allan/ABC-5928-2021","Sørensen, Allan/0000-0001-8707-3576",,,,,30,1,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Further, using a constructed 'world coincident index of economic indicators' and an associated 'world leading index of economic indicators', this article demonstrates that evidence was available from early in the second half of 2007 that the world was indeed sliding inexorably towards its fourth synchronized world recession since WWII (although, interestingly, already its second of the twenty-first century!).","[Layton, Allan P.] Univ So Queensland, Fac Business, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Banerji, Anirvan; Achuthan, Lakshman] Econ Cycle Res Inst, New York, NY USA",University of Southern Queensland,"Layton, AP (通讯作者)，Univ So Queensland, Fac Business, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",layton@usq.edu.au,,,,,,,8,5,5,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article tests whether households expect these effects and whether they value them. It considers the effect on real estate prices of the surprise breakup of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) into 11 minidistricts in April 2000. We estimate households' reaction to this reform in a difference-in-differences setting that controls for any unobserved spatial effects unaffected by the announcement. We find that households valued this decentralization, with a 2-3 percentage point increase in housing values in the LAUSD area over pre-existing trends, compared with control districts. The effect is highest in wealthier neighborhoods but otherwise homogenous within the LAUSD area. The results suggest that households believe that decentralization would make schools more effective and that they respond to signals about schools' future.","[Banzhaf, H.

In opposition to similar methods MULTIMOORA does not need normalization, being based on dimensionless measures. Importance of an objective can eventually be given by the stakeholders concerned. MULTIMOORA is composed of three approaches: Ratio System, Reference Point and Multiplicative Form Methods, all of the same importance and each controlling each other.

People are distributed according to their preference toward caution, which we model as loss aversion. The first two moments of the distribution across principals and agents along with institutional quality are critical to the process by which trustworthiness and trust are formed. A direct effect suggests that more caution leads to less societal trust. An indirect effect of greater caution, working through trustworthiness, leads to more trust. Paradoxically, the net effect is almost always positive. The results are similar when we use expected utility theory. Different distributional assumptions can influence the results.

Using an Exponential General Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) specification to model the conditional variance, we find that the day-of-the-week effect is present in both return and variance equations. In particular, higher risk-adjusted returns are found on Monday and Friday. However, after adjusting for market risks that vary across the days of the week, only the Monday effect remains. The conditional variance model also finds that the highest volatility of return also occurs on Monday. Thus, the Monday effects on risk-adjusted returns may be a reward for higher volatility on that day. However, after adjusting for transaction costs, the abnormal returns for Monday become negligible.","[Chan, Hing Lin] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Woo, Kai-Yin] Hong Kong Shue Yan Univ, Dept Econ, N Point, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University; Hong Kong Shue Yan University,"Chan, HL (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business, 224 Waterloo Rd, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hlchan@hkbu.edu.hk,,,,,,,30,4,4,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

There has however been little emphasis on the incentives for subgroups of countries to jointly peruse carbon taxes. Yet for large importers of oil such as the US, the EU and China, their incentive is clearly to act together and have their taxes partly or wholly borne by oil exporters given this incentives. This paper discusses the potential for joint OECD (or non-OPEC) carbon taxes to reduce OPEC's monopoly rent and provide benefits to non-OPEC countries provided jointly agreed trigger strategies are adhered to enforce mutual cooperation. To this end, we develop a multi-region general equilibrium structure with an endogenously determined oil supply by OPEC in which both emissions and energy prices are endogenously determined. Our results suggest that jointly enacted carbon taxes by the US, the EU and China can be heavily borne by oil exporters; they reduce the welfare of OPEC and increase the welfare of non-OPEC countries. These carbon taxes reduce global emissions, but the effect is small. (C) 2011 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The tools we use involve classifying the sectors as surplus, balance and deficit sectors and constructing a 3 x 3 contingency table, indicating whether sectors that, say, showed a surplus at the beginning of a period remained surplus sectors at the end of the period or moved into the balance and deficit categories, testing whether the beginning pattern is independent of the pattern at the end of a period and constructing histograms regarding the distribution of how long the sectors have been showing surpluses over the period. We used these tools on Turkish trade for the full 1969 to 2001 period and for two (1969 to 1979, 1980 to 2001) and three (1969 to 1979, 1980 to 1996, 1997 to 2001) subperiods.

Based on a cluster analysis according to Tanimoto, the data of 275 German speaking and 100 managers from Slovakia show that top management in Austria and upper managers in Slovakia are completely unwilling to change their behavior. So, they can never be seen as role models for change managers. Also the upper management does not foster change according to theoretical approaches. Only the middle and operative management behaves according to literature. Thus, we definitely have to question the different hierarchical roles of managers within the change process and rethink current change management concepts. If top and upper managers don't seem to be interested in initiating change, we will have to have a closer look at bottom up processes - as it is already known from the IT perspective.","[Ferencikova, Sona] Vysoka Skola Manazmentu, Sch Management, Bratislava 85104, Slovakia; [Muehlbacher, Juergen; Kodydek, Georg] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Management, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Nettekoven, Michaela] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, A-1190 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Ferencíková, S (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Manazmentu, Sch Management, Panonska 17, Bratislava 85104, Slovakia.",sferencikova@vsm.sk; juergen.muehlbacher@wu.ac.at; georg.kodydek@wu.ac.at; michaela.nettekoven@wu.ac.at,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,24,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Despite recent efforts of the Spanish government at increasing transparency, the significant shortages of the existing data render the task of monitoring regional and local governments' public spending in real-time a complicated endeavor. Within this framework, we exploit all available short-term information on sub-national governments' spending from scattered sources, and find a subset of indicators usable for real-time policy analysis.

Whilst network trading and marketplace trading disseminate far fewer bits of information than a perfectly transparent benchmark market, they often manage to generate an allocation of resources that is almost as good. In many cases, network trading proves more effective than marketplace trading (contrary to a common preconception). This surprising performance of network trading is linked to a form of indirect arbitrage induced by connections between networks.

We have tested two regimes data: democratic (1990-1999) and military (2000-2007). The result obtained suggests that domestic investment is independent of the level of FDI inflows. In other words, it implies that a change in domestic investment is not influenced by FDI inflows.

We use peer assessment (to represent school quality) and average Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) scores (to represent student ability) as inputs and average starting salary and the percent of graduates employed upon graduation as outputs. The 50 business schools consist of 27 private schools and 23 public schools, and their efficiency scores are compared. We find that although technical efficiencies of private and public schools are both high, scale and overall efficiencies of the public schools are lower than those of the private schools. And most public schools exhibit Increasing Returns To Scale (IRTS). The returns to scale in this article refers to increases in the output measures - starting salary and the employment rates - in response to increases in the quality of inputs - peer assessment and the average GMAT scores. Hence, schools that exhibit IRTS will experience more than proportionate increases in starting salary and the employment rates by raising the quality of inputs. The policy implication is that for many public schools, efficiency will be improved if they could improve school and student quality levels.","Seikei Univ, Fac Econ, Musashino, Tokyo 1808633, Japan",Seikei University,"Hirao, Y (通讯作者)，Seikei Univ, Fac Econ, 3-3-1 Kichijoji Kitamachi, Musashino, Tokyo 1808633, Japan.",hirao@econ.seikei.ac.jp,,,,,,,10,9,9,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The first is the virtually unlimited opportunity to work and stay in Western European countries with higher salaries as well as a wider range of social advantages especially for young families with children. The second factor is virtually unrestricted access to higher education which equaled the number of graduates with the number of births in recent years in Poland. Both of these factors increased the aspirations of young people. The third factor is the fact that the structure of graduates education, especially university graduates do not fit the supply of jobs available in the market. That led to division of the labor market: a better market where there are surpluses and stagnation of wages and the worse work market where shortages appear. Shortages of jobs requiring high qualifications (especially for peripheral areas) and relatively (compared to Western Europe) low wages result in massive brain drain to a few major urban centers in Poland as well as the outflow of young people outside the country, which has, due to the decline in profitability of labor migration a more permanent character.

Phillips determined the presence of negative correlation between the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment. On the basis of so called Phillips curve a wrong conclusion was done that by increasing inflation it is possible to decrease unemployment. It wasn't confirmed in practice. There is a hypothesis stating that unemployment has a certain natural Not Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU). Nowadays Phillips curve (1958) is considered in a wider sense as a complicated event, developing in the absence of neutrality of money in economic processes. The object of the research is interconnection of inflation and unemployment in Latvia. The goal of the research - analysis of interconnection between inflation and unemployment in Latvia, estimation of the natural rate of unemployment. All these researches have not been done before. By using the statistical data of Latvia and analysis thereof show the possibility of using modern mathematical regression models for researches of macroeconomic indicators. Methods of the research are mathematical modelling, correlation and regression analysis. In Latvia systematic accounting of unemployment is done from 1996. For analysis of the interconnection between time series of inflation rate and unemployment a non-linear regression equation - a quadratic parabola was computed and estimated. The considered period is from the year 1996 until 2008. The negative correlation between inflation and unemployment occurs within the whole considered time length. Classical Phillips curve is missing. However, within the period from the year 1999 until 2008 negative correlation occurs, as it is with Phillips curve. Such change of correlation between inflation and unemployment from positive to negative value at the turn of 1998-99 is obviously explained by macroeconomic changes and development peculiarities in Latvia. To identify peculiarities of inflation in Latvia the period from 1999 to 2008 has been analysed separately. To check the quality of the regression models the correlation and regression analysis was done. The calculated index and coefficient of determination in both cases point at quite good quality of regression models: with the help thereof it is possible to explain 70 % and 60 % of inflation respectively. It is possible to say that both models of regression adequately fit empirical data and are appropriate for use. As long as analysis of dynamics time series is fulfilled, a check has been done for the presence of autocorrelation in residuals, which is subjected to autoregressive process of the first order. For the check of the main hypothesis. H-o : rho = 0 Durbin-Watson test statistics has been used. Analysis showed that in these models there is no autocorrelation, econometric models can be used for analyses. A multiple linear equation of inflation autoregression model was obtained and analysed also. To determine the natural rate of unemployment in Latvia ( NAIRU) the last equation is changed. As a result it is obtained that the estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for Latvia's economy is quite large 16%. In developed market economies NAIRU is much less. This denotes existence of disproportions and drawbacks of macroeconomic development. This is confirmed by very adverse consequences of the financial and economic crisis for Latvia. A number of macroeconomic experts believe that Latvia needs an industrial revolution: accent on development of the priority branches of industry, export. Changes in the structure of government, education, as well as creation of attractive environment for investments are necessary also. The analysis of interconnection between inflation and unemployment in Latvia, which was done according to mathematical regression models quite sufficiently corresponding to empirical data, points to the possibility of successful application of such models for analysis and researches of macroeconomic indicators.","Balt Int Acad, LV-1019 Riga, Latvia",,"Kochetkov, Y (通讯作者)，Balt Int Acad, Lomonosova Str 4, LV-1019 Riga, Latvia.",kochetkov@rtulf.lv,,,,,,,32,5,8,1,28,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Assuming that the seller announces the mechanism before investing, the paper establishes conditions on the investment technology so that a mechanism exists which leaves buyers no information rent and leaves the seller indifferent between his investments. Under these conditions, the seller can, in fact, extract the first best surplus almost fully. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, real wages are increasing in the degree of fiscal activism as wage setters exploit the response of a fiscal authority seeking to promote employment. Numerical results suggest that the benefits of targeting inflation are larger when the government pursues an activist policy and therefore that there is some substitutability between fiscal and monetary rules.","Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Larsson, A (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2012,79.0,313,,,,,97,114,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2010.00873.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,862BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000298063900005,0

A copper mine project offers a demonstration; the mine holder may temporarily close, reopen and abandon the mine at specific times before the expiration date. The mine holder may also accelerate mining speed to be optimal, referred to as the acceleration option.

The evaluation is based on three key criteria borrowed from the optimal currency area literature. A first conclusion is that the peg to the euro has granted the 16 countries a good inflation performance. However, with the clear exception of Cape Verde, the peg is not supported by the other economic requirements, namely trade integration and synchronisation of business cycles. We also assess whether the US dollar would be a better currency to anchor. Since the results are ambiguous, pegging to the euro seems to be a better alternative as these countries benefit from established exchange rate cooperation agreements. Given that most of the countries in the sample are historically grouped together in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) or the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CAEMC), the paper further assesses whether the grouping of countries in these two CFA monetary unions receives economic support. The conclusion is that the composition of CAEMC does not conform to basic requirements. In contrast, for a wide group of WAEMU countries there is room for sharing a common monetary policy.","[Loureiro, Joao; Martins, Manuel M.

Is there really a trade-off on a macro scale between going green and economic performance? The world economy has significantly expanded within the last four decades and started to exceed the Earth's resources capacity. Many forms of environmental degeneration such as soil erosion, aquifer deficiency, rangeland deterioration, air pollution, and climate change have huge negative impact on the ecosystem. If the world continues to move in this direction, it will eventually destroy its natural support system. The long-term solution to this problem is to apply ecological principles of sustainable economic development. It is commonly known that factors such as decreasing CO2 emission, water maintenance, forestry and agriculture preservation as well as properly managed production processes help preserve our planet's natural habitat and its climate, but how these activities are related to businesses? During 1960s and 1970s, organizations have mostly rejected their impact on the environment. However, after experiencing international ecological problems, countries came up with a variety of regulations to prevent further environment degradation. Many organizations were forced to accept the responsibility to protect the surroundings they were operating in. Therefore, prevailing assumption appeared that there is a fixed trade-off between ecology and economy. Social benefits that come from strict environmental regulations are placed versus private costs, which are spent for prevention and cleanup activities. Succeeding in one field has to result in other's failure. In the last decade, however, this view has been increasingly challenged. Moreover, in recent years there has been an increasing advocacy towards a notion that turning green is actually good for the business and thus for the whole economy. By preserving natural resources and creating new quality of environmentally aware management systems, a given country increases its productivity. This in turn allows achieving higher production output given inputs in relation to its less environmentally aware neighbour. In order to check the validity of this theory we apply Bayesian frontier analysis to macroeconomic production function, and incorporate key environmental indicators as explanatory variables of productivity distribution. Our model is estimated based on data from 13 EU countries over the period of 1998-2007. The use of Bayesian inference allows us to check straightforward what explanatory power those indicators have on countries' productive efficiency and thus on their economic performance.","[Makiela, Kamil; Misztur, Tomasz] Cracow Univ Econ, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Makiela, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Rakowicka Ul 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",kamil.makiela@uek.krakow.pl; tomasz.misztur@uek.krakow.pl,"Makieła, Kamil/T-5786-2018","Makieła, Kamil/0000-0003-1236-2423",,,,,22,7,7,3,59,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Known approaches to the construction of the desired definition, focusing on some important aspects of information, overlook the others, no less important.

In this article, we propose an improvement of the market data approach that takes into account the spatial component. In particular, we propose a modified market data approach based on interpolation, being the structure of the spatial correlation between the prices of properties the main factor to obtain the weights. Interpolation methods have been widely used for estimating real estate prices, but they do not take into account the structure of their spatial dependence. Although this drawback is overcome by kriged estimation, in the case of the prices of commercial properties, they do not provide good estimates because the scarceness of the market information. This is why auxiliary information is needed and cokriging methods are used to obtain estimates that are more accurate. The aim of this article is the comparison of cokriged estimation of premises prices in two different temporal moments in the emblematic old part of Toledo city (Spain), using housing prices as an auxiliary random function due to their strong correlation with the main one.

Rather than drawing out the consequences of specific psychological assumptions, the framework takes a reduced-form approach to behavioral modeling. It emphasizes the difference between decision and experienced utility that underlies most behavioral models. We use this framework to examine the behavioral implications for canonical public finance problems involving the provision of social insurance, commodity taxation, and correcting externalities.

In the former, a harsh contest between the prosecution and the defense is promoted, and an acquittal is rendered with substantial likelihood. In the latter, the prosecution overpowers the defense so that defendants are almost always convicted. We explain this procedural dichotomy as a result of optimal incentive designs institutionalized through controlling a judge's standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, a prosecutor's discretionary rule for indictment, and a defendant's right to counsel. Our theory suggests that the bona fide adversarial system performs suitably with jury trials, publiclyelected prosecutors, and government-based defense systems, while the pseudo-adversarial system is shaped by bench trials, career prosecutors, and court-appointed defense counsels. The Japanese pseudo-adversarial system might still be influenced by the defunct inquisitorial system initiated during the Meiji Restoration.","[Nakao, Keisuke] Univ Hawaii, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Tsumagari, Masatoshi] Keio Univ, Tokyo 108, Japan",University of Hawaii System; University Hawaii Hilo; Keio University,"Nakao, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, Hilo, HI 96720 USA.",keisuken@hawaii.edu; tsuma@econ.keio.ac.jp,"Nakao, Keisuke/HNR-5119-2023","Nakao, Keisuke/0000-0001-9109-2542",,,,,38,0,1,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We estimate cost and price functions in a retail electricity distribution enterprise in Slovenia by ordinary least square regressions on time series data. We confirm the hypotheses that real costs for electricity supply are positively and significantly associated with the costs for purchases of electric energy from electricity producers/wholesalers and with remuneration costs in electricity distribution enterprises. We did not confirm a negative association between the real costs for retail electricity supply and the proxy variable for electricity market liberalization. Market deregulation and price liberalization with increased competition have caused an initial decline in real consumer prices of electric energy. We found that the real consumer price of electric energy is positively associated with producer/wholesaler prices of electric energy, real wages in electricity distribution enterprises, and real tax expenses in the distribution enterprise, but negatively associated with the variable for electricity market liberalization. The results confirm the crucial role of the transmission of producer/wholesaler prices of electric energy and costs within the distribution enterprises, including labor costs, on the consumer prices of electric energy.","[Papler, Drago; Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Koper, Slovenia; [Papler, Drago] Electro Gorenjska, Kranj, Slovenia",University of Primorska,"Papler, D (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Koper, Slovenia.",drago.papler@gmail.com; stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si,"Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372",,,,,6,4,4,0,6,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The results show that average wages are 10%-20% higher in formal firms and that the majority of this gap is due to observable characteristics, in particular differences in firm size, workforce characteristics and location.

The article has been constructed in such a way that, in the first section, it discusses the elements of the theory of economic cycles and the authors hypothesize that we are just in the bear period of Kondratiev cycle, which means that going out of the crisis is not expected soon, but withinin the period of about 10 years. The second section presents the mathematical basis, which results in balance sheet structure management policies and risk policies of a banking enterprise. It also shows the influence of capital structure and assumptions of bank managers (relating to the estimated effectiveness of the total liquid capital) on the risk of bank's bankruptcy. The third section identifies some most important legal regulations, according to the authors' point of view, necessary to be rapidly introduced in the sphere of banking risk management and structuring principles of bank balance sheets to prevent further spread of bad practices and, thereby, reduce the risk of the crisis becoming deeper.","[Rozenberg, Leonard Henryk] W Pomeranian Univ Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Chair Org Engn, Czczecin, Poland; [Dorozik, Leon Zygmunt] Tech Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology; West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Rozenberg, LH (通讯作者)，Zolnierska 49, PL-71210 Szczecin, Poland.",lrozenberg@wi.zut.edu.pl; ldoroz@wneiz.pl,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

The empirical finding indicates that a significant number of traders fragment their trades, and these split trades are generally more informative than nonsplit trades. When trades are fragmented, the price impact of buy trades is significantly larger than the price impact of sell trades. By conducting an analysis of investor type, we also find that the order-splitting strategy of domestic individuals, banks and foreign institutions is quite successful in the futures market; on the other hand, the split orders submitted by domestic money managers typically incur a substantial loss.","Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Business, Yongin 449791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Business, Yongin 449791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",doojin.ryu@gmail.com,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887",,,,,19,32,32,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In contrast, we use a unique administrative micro data set for the time span 1975-2004 to investigate individual lifetime unemployment - defined as the cumulative length of all unemployment spells over a 25-year period. This new perspective enables us to answer questions regarding the long-term distribution and determinants of unemployment for birth cohorts 1950-1954. We show that lifetime unemployment is highly concentrated on a small part of the population. With censored quantile regressions we investigate the long-lasting influence of bad luck early in the professional career: Controlling for individual and firm characteristics we find that choosing at a young age what turns out to be an unfavorable occupation significantly increases the predicted amount of lifetime unemployment.

The results suggest that technical, cost and profit efficiency of Australian banks have improved over time. Large banks have attained a higher level of cost efficiency but a lower level of technical efficiency compared to small banks. No substantial difference between the two groups is found in terms of profit efficiency. A panel regression of bank stock return on bank efficiency suggests that an improvement in technical, cost or profit efficiency contributes to the market value of a bank. Thus, the shareholder wealth maximization goal is aligned with the goal of maximizing bank efficiency in the Australian context.","[Xiang, Dong] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Shamsuddin, Abul] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",Griffith University; University of Newcastle,"Xiang, D (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",d.xiang@griffith.edu.au,,"Shamsuddin, Abul/0000-0003-3109-4989",,,,,32,20,20,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper focuses on the implications of financing and infrastructure constraints by studying firms' investments in electric generators as a response to public power interruptions. A theoretical model demonstrates that financial constraints lower economic returns on owning electric generators, making firms less likely to install private generators if the public power supply becomes unreliable. The empirical results show that, controlling for other factors, firms with a lower cost of external financing are more likely to own private generators in areas where the public power supply is less reliable. Observed correlations among reliability of power supply, financial constraints, and investment in electric generators thus appear consistent with the hypothesis that underdeveloped financial markets and inadequate infrastructure can be a greater barrier for economic development than either of these constraints separately.","Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Steinbuks, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Main Campus, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jsteinbu@purdue.edu,,"Stenbuks, Jevgenijs/0000-0003-3548-2196",,,,,45,4,4,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We create clear and simple-to-implement rules which indicate whether the stock is over/undervalued. We simulate the value of the portfolio based on the buy/sell signals. Backtesting is used in order to compare the return of the model to the benchmark. Results of the trading strategy are positive, as the model outperforms the passive portfolio by more than 50%.

A static multisectoral general equilibrium model, with multinational and single-country versions, is used. This model permits the identification of sectors that are leaders in competitiveness improvement. In some countries, traditional export sectors are expected to assume this role, whereas the suppliers of intermediate goods possess the potential to fulfil this function in other countries. The results of this study show that the choice of sector and the type of labour are crucial for improving the international competitiveness of the Portuguese economy. The criterion used to measure competitiveness also has an important role. Whereas multifactor productivity is especially increased when the promotion of labour competencies occurs in import and export sectors, population welfare has a greater impact, with the generalized improvement of unskilled labour competencies.","[Vaz, Elsa Cristina] Univ Evora, Dept Econ, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Vaz, Elsa Cristina] Univ Evora CEFAGE UE, Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, P-7000809 Evora, Portugal",University of Evora; University of Evora,"Vaz, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, Dept Econ, Largo Colegiais 2, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.",elsavaz@uevora.pt,,"Vaz, Elsa/0000-0001-7024-3137",,,,,15,0,2,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In such a framework, we first identify the impact of strategic interactions between consecutive generations on the time path of human capital accumulation. To this end, we characterize the decentralized Markov stationary Nash equilibrium (MSNE) and derive the sufficient conditions for its existence and uniqueness. We then provide sufficient conditions under which human capital accumulation is unambiguously (pointwise) lower in the strategic equilibrium than under the optimal dynastic policy, and discuss an example where this ordering does not hold. Secondly, we also run a numerical sensitivity analysis to assess the magnitude of discrepancies between the two analyzed cases and discuss the potential implications of overestimation of the human capital role if intergenerational interactions are not accounted for.","[Wozny, Lukasz] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Theoret & Appl Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Growiec, Jakub] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Warsaw School of Economics,"Wozny, L (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Theoret & Appl Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",lukasz.wozny@sgh.waw.pl; jakub.growiec@sgh.waw.pl,"Growiec, Jakub/AAB-8623-2019; Wozny, Lukasz/HGV-1542-2022","Growiec, Jakub/0000-0003-2222-1691; Wozny, Lukasz/0000-0002-4777-0163",,,,,95,2,2,0,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Also, there are some difficulties unsolved while measuring the ratio of Capacity Utilization (CU) of a container shipping line. From the perspective of an engineering approach, the slots capacity installed is the most popular way to represent the capacity output. Since the slots capacity installed lacks theoretical support, this study adopts an economics model to find the capacity output of a shipping line. Further, the derived CU ratio identifies the realized utilization of fleet capacity for a shipping line. Focused on the three largest container shipping lines in Taiwan, this article shows that their fleet capacity are totally under-utilized and the movement patterns of CU ratios are approximately identical. In addition, the variations of CU ratios also suggest that the enactment of Ocean Shipping Reform Act has contributed a positive effect on the capacity utilization of a container shipping line. Finally, by running a regression model to investigate the determinants of CU ratios, the result indicates that demand condition and global shipping alliance are two critical factors to improve the utilization of fleet capacity for a container shipping line.","Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Business Management, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Wu, WM (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Business Management, 2 Juoyue Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",wwu@ccms.nkfust.edu.tw,,,,,,,31,12,15,6,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using a linear public good with centralized punishment, I find that participants increase contributions even if severity had been insufficient to deter a profit-maximizing individual. The more an individual is averse against exploiting others, the less it matters whether punishment was deterrent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show, first, that the well-documented rise of raw public-private wage differentials in the last decade was the result of increased gaps only at top deciles. Second, that, contrary to common beliefs, public versus private net premia did not fundamentally change over time, so that rising public-private raw differentials were due for the most part to changes in the mix of characteristics (especially occupations) across sectors and time. Third, that the long-term net premium is essentially zero at top percentiles and for males - with small fluctuations over time reflecting specific public policies and cycle features -, and decreasing at bottom and middle deciles.

This approach generally calculates the technical efficiency by shrinking all the input factors equally proportionally subject to the observed output still being producible. Thus, all the input factor efficiencies, including the energy efficiency, are measured as the technical efficiency. One drawback of this approach is the presumption of an identical input factor frontier for all input factors and of unrestricted factor substitutability. The present study employs a stochastic frontier analysis approach to measuring energy efficiency that not only allows for non-identical input factor frontiers, but also controls for the effects on the measure of energy efficiency of substitution away from energy or substitution of energy for non-energy factors. This approach is applied to evaluating the efficiency performances of three types of energy amongst a sample of coal mines, petroleum refineries and power plants in China's energy sector which is specifically targeted by the Chinese government to improve energy efficiency.

This paper focuses on the analysis of intra-industry trade in the context of this free trade area, where the production structure of the countries involved has changed significantly since trade liberalization, revealing the internationalization of production chains. Lastly, changes in the trade structure induced by the growing presence of China in the NAFTA region are captured.

We use a dynamic rational expectations model to analyze the search and retirement behaviour of employed and unemployed workers aged 50 or over. The model is calibrated to reproduce the main reemployment and retirement patterns observed between 2002 and 2008 in Spain. It is subsequently used to analyze the effects of the 2011 pension reform in Spain, characterized by 2-year delays in both the early and the normal retirement ages. We find that this reform generates large increases in labour supply and sizable cuts in pension costs, but these are achieved at the expense of very large welfare losses, especially among unemployed workers. As an alternative, we propose leaving the early retirement age unchanged, but penalizing the minimum pension (reducing its generosity in parallel to the cuts imposed on individual pension benefits, and making it more actuarially fair with age). This alternative reform strikes a better balance between individual welfare and labour supply stimulus.","[Sanchez-Martin, Alfonso R.; Ignacio Garcia-Perez, J.] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville 41013, Spain; [Jimenez-Martin, Sergi] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Jimenez-Martin, Sergi] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Jimenez-Martin, Sergi] FEDEA, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics,"García-Pérez, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ, Crta Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",jigarper@upo.es,"Garcia Perez, J Ignacio/JWP-2410-2024; Jimenez-Martin, Sergi/D-6744-2013; Garcia Perez, Jose Ignacio/D-2755-2009; Sanchez Martin, Alfonso Ramon/L-4452-2014","Jimenez-Martin, Sergi/0000-0002-7393-9612; Garcia Perez, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-9074-7313; Sanchez Martin, Alfonso Ramon/0000-0002-3815-6540",,,,,35,4,4,0,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2014,162.0,4,,,,,341,375,,10.1007/s10645-014-9235-7,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS3IE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344170000003,0

The results show that overeducated individuals show higher levels of dissatisfaction than those in which the fit is adequate. However, it also shows how individuals with a lower level of education than what would be required for the post do not reflect significant dissatisfaction levels.

Equivalent option price, like equivalent variation with certain outcomes, always ranks three or more projects correctly. This paper also presents a method to empirically estimate equivalent option price using estimates of the benefits of certain changes. This approach is practically important so that the same study results can be used to estimate equivalent option price even as new projects are developed or as changes occur in the scientific information regarding the probabilities of various project outcomes.

Consequently, there is persistency in the response of bank lending even when the original shock (productivity or interest rate) is i.i.d. The nonlinear nature of these financial frictions also generates (i) a precautionary motive even with risk-neutral shareholders: the bank increases its desired level of capital if risk increases; (ii) an asymmetric response of lending: negative disturbances can have a bigger impact than positive ones; and (iii) volatility clustering in risk spreads and the bank's share price.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Valencia, F (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",fvalencia@imf.org,,,,,,,37,5,5,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Although Vietnam's achievements are laudable, the economy appears to face increasingly serious challenges to sustained, robust economic performance in the long term. This paper analyzes Vietnam's economic growth to identify the institutional root causes that will make it difficult for Vietnam to sustain its high growth rates. There are three categories of institutional root causes economic, administrative, and political and these three categories are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. The economic institutional weaknesses are the absence of an independent central bank and the dominant role of the state-owned sector. The administrative institutional limitation is the lack of public management capabilities; and the political institutional limitation is the absolute monopolization of power by the Communist Party of Vietnam. I contend that without fundamental institutional reforms, Vietnam will not only be unable to achieve robust economic performance in the long term but also be at risk of experiencing a severe crisis when the regional or global economy experiences a severe shock in the future.","Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 259772, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Vu, KM (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, 469C Bukit Timah Rd OTH Bldg, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",sppkmv@nus.edu.sg,,"VU, Khuong/0000-0001-9807-7003",,,,,23,2,2,0,82,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

These price jumps in grains have also revealed the chaotic state of economic analysis of agricultural commodity markets. Economists and scientists have engaged in a blame game, apportioning percentages of responsibility for the price spikes to bewildering lists of factors, which include a surge in meat consumption, idiosyncratic regional droughts and fires, speculative bubbles, a new financialization of grain markets, the slowdown of global agricultural research spending, jumps in costs of energy, and more. Several observers have claimed to identify a perfect storm in the grain markets in 2007/2008, a confluence of some of the factors listed above. In fact, the price jumps since 2005 are best explained by the new policies causing a sustained surge in demand for biofuels. The rises in food prices since 2004 have generated huge wealth transfers to global landholders, agricultural input suppliers, and biofuels producers. The losers have been net consumers of food, including large numbers of the world's poorest peoples. The cause of this large global redistribution was no perfect storm. Far from being a natural catastrophe, it was the result of new policies to allow and require increased use of grain and oilseed for production of biofuels. Leading this trend were the wealthy countries, initially misinformed about the true global environmental and distributional implications.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Wright, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bwright@berkeley.edu,,"Wright, Brian/0000-0002-6440-8596",,,,,63,67,76,5,135,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using a unique worldwide plant-level dataset that reports detailed location, ownership, and operation information for plants in over 100 countries, we construct a spatially continuous index of agglomeration and analyze the different patterns underlying the global economic geography of multinational and non-multinational firms. We present new stylized facts that suggest that the offshore clusters of multinationals are not a simple reflection of domestic industrial clusters. Agglomeration economies including technology diffusion and capital-good market externality play a more important role in the offshore agglomeration of multinationals than the agglomeration of domestic firms.

This reform increased the net income gain of moving into employment for the treatment group by 31%. Using both DD and RD we show that this reform had a negligible effect on labour participation, with tight confidence intervals around zero. Our results are at odds with a number of related studies. This finding may be due to our treatment group of single mothers of which the youngest child is relatively old, or because the reform we consider was less salient. Furthermore, related studies typically study changes in a tax credit which was part of a broader reform package, making it harder to isolate the effect of the tax credit. Also, we show that using single women without children as the control group, as is commonly done in related studies, can be problematic. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The Package assigns binding renewable energy sources (RES) target for each EU member countries. Indeed costs to reach Package's targets vary among EU countries, given heterogeneity among regions and different instruments implemented to spur RES deployment. The aim of our paper is to provide a policy tool for EU policy makers in the negotiation process that assigns achievable quantitative targets according to which countries are not inclined to deviate from the agreement. We compute potential extra costs that may arise when some EU countries fail to reach the assigned objective within the Package with reference to RES target. More generally, our simulation model is an instrument that allows EU policy makers to assess incentives that countries might have to participate or not to the environmental agreements. Our analysis shows that partial participation to the Package produces inefficiencies by rising costs for other participating countries to the environmental agreement. Finally, we propose a new policy mechanism based on progressive sanctions for countries that do not meet their national targets, which are proportional to the monetary value of the penalty they impose to the rest of the EU countries with their opportunistic behavior.

We examine determinants of carefully constructed, bilateral measures of new import restrictions on products arising through the temporary trade barrier (TTB) policies of antidumping, safeguards, and countervailing duties. We find evidence of a counter-cyclical relationship between macroeconomic shocks and new TTB import restrictions as well as an important role for fluctuations in bilateral real exchange rates. Furthermore, the trade policy responsiveness coinciding with WTO establishment in 1995 suggests a significant change relative to the pre-WTO period; i.e., new import restrictions became more counter-cyclical and sensitive to real exchange rate shocks over time. Finally, we also present results that explicitly address changes to the institutional environment facing these emerging economies as they joined the WTO and adopted disciplines to restrain their application of other trade policies such as applied import tariffs.

Our main contribution is to argue that beyond exogeneity of the income shock, an empirical analysis of government spending cyclicality must be carefully tailored to the shock's persistence. We first illustrate this point in a simple intertemporal model. We then use instrumental variables estimation to characterize the response of government expenditures to exogenous shocks with different degrees of persistence. Our estimation strategy exploits that:.(i) year-to-year variations in rainfall have a significant positive contemporaneous effect on sub-Saharan African countries' real GDP but this effect is transitory; (ii) year-to-year variations in the GDP of sub-Saharan African countries' OECD trading partners have a significant positive contemporaneous effect on sub-Saharan African countries' real GDP and this effect is persistent. Using rainfall as an instrument for sub-Saharan African countries' GDP yields a government consumption expenditures elasticity response of around 0.4 (standard error 0.3). When the instrument is the GDP of sub-Saharan African countries' OECD trading partners the estimated government consumption expenditures elasticity response is around 1.1 (standard error 02). The elasticity response of government consumption expenditures to persistent income shocks is thus significantly higher relative to transitory shocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to most other growth accounting exercises, the official growth accounts of Statistics Netherlands employ an exogenous rate of return to capital to calculate capital services. As a consequence, in the Dutch Growth Accounts output does not necessarily match total production costs. Supplementary to the exogenous model, Statistics Netherlands also publishes growth accounts based on endogenous rates of return. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of scaling up capital measurement on input cost shares, contributions to output growth, and productivity, applying both the exogenous and endogenous models. The results show that endogenous rates of return to capital are less applicable in growth accounts in which the coverage of capital is restricted to fixed assets only. The rates of return to capital converge when expanding the capital inputs with additional assets such as land, inventories, and subsoil assets. But this is not necessarily true for the capital contributions to economic growth. Finally, the capitalization of a wider range of intangible assets, beyond the SNA boundaries, has particularly for the 1995-2001 period a significant effect on the Dutch Growth Accounting results, irrespective of using either an exogenous or an endogenous rate of return to capital.","[de Haan, Mark; Veldhuizen, Erik; Tanriseven, Murat; van Rooijen-Horsten, Myriam] Stat Netherlands, NL-2492 JP The Hague, Netherlands",,"de Haan, M (通讯作者)，Stat Netherlands, Natl Accounts, Henri Faasdreef 312, NL-2492 JP The Hague, Netherlands.",mark.dehaan@cbs.nl,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The time-series annual panel data from 1995 to 2012 regarding Korea's FDI inflows was gathered from several secondary databases. The previous empirical results from the conditional mean-based models for FDI inflows to South Korea are not informative: most of the estimated coefficeints are statistically insignificant. It implies the determinant of FDI inflows can be quite heterogeneous; that is, the determinants may differ depending on the level of FDI Thus, the dynamic panel quantile regression model is used to show that the determinants of FDI would differ based on the level of FDI inflows. To be more specific, the GDP, employment, and human resources education levels of the host country are significant determinants of FDI inflows only when the level of the inflow is low. However, corruption and anti-environment investment levels are statically significant determinants for middle- and high-level FDI inflows. This result suggests that the government should have policies to decrease the degree of corruption and increase anti-environment pollution investment in order to realize increases in FDI inflows.","[Kim, Sang Hyuck] Gachon Univ, Dept Tourism Management, Songnam, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Yang, Jae Hoon] Kyungsung Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Logist, Pusan, South Korea",Gachon University; Kyungsung University,"Yang, JH (通讯作者)，Kyungsung Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Logist, 309 Suyeong Ro, Pusan, South Korea.",shkim114@gachon.ac.kr; yjh4078@ks.ac.kr,,,,,,,41,5,5,0,28,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We show that, first, unlike in the traditional products liability model, firms' incentives to invest in precaution depend on market structure. Second, depending on the magnitude of expected damages awarded by the courts, laissez-faire can welfare dominate strict producer liability. Third, the relationship between social welfare and industry size, and hence the role for competition policy, depends on the institutional regime governing the industry. Under some circumstances, restricting industry size is unambiguously welfare-enhancing.","[Grajzl, Peter; Guse, A.

Integration (greater dependence on counterparties) and diversification (more counterparties per organization) have different, nonmonotonic effects on the extent of cascades. Diversification connects the network initially, permitting cascades to travel; but as it increases further, organizations are better insured against one another's failures. Integration also faces trade-offs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less sensitivity to own investments.

We extend this literature by shifting the focus from income to its visible manifestation-conspicuous consumption. Using variation within US states over time, we document a robust association between the distribution of conspicuous consumption and violent crime. Our results link violent crime to inequality in visible expenditure, but not to inequality in total expenditure, suggesting that information plays a key role in the determination of crime. Furthermore, focussing on conspicuous expenditure allows for new tests of competing theories of crime. Our findings are consistent with social theories that link crime with relative deprivation, but provide little support for traditional economic theory.","[Hicks, Daniel L.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Hicks, Joan Hamory] Univ Calif Berkeley, CEGA, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hicks, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, 308 Cate Ctr Dr, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",hicksd@ou.edu; jrhamory@berkeley.edu,,"Hicks, Daniel/0000-0002-1722-4970",,,,,37,30,37,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We do maintain monotonicity of the first stage relationship in the instrument and consider the case of real-valued treatment. Under these conditions alone, and given rich enough support of the data, potential outcome distributions, the average structural function, and quantile structural functions are point identified. If the support of the continuous instrument is not large enough, potential outcome distributions are partially identified. If the instrument is discrete, identification fails completely. If treatment is multi-dimensional, additional exclusion restrictions yield identification. The set-up discussed in this article covers important cases not covered by existing approaches such as conditional moment restrictions (cf. Newey and Powell, 2003) and control variables (cf.

They also indicate the existence of unidirectional causality running from CO2 emissions to economic growth, with the exception of the Middle East, North Africa, and sub-Sahara panel, for which bidirectional causality between these variables cannot be rejected.

The estimates show that the short-term dynamics are essentially driven by the autoregressive term (persistence), disposable income and mortgage loans, whereas interest rates have little effect. The long-term house price equilibrium is mainly driven on the demand side by disposable income, interest rates, and mortgage loans, whereas costs (mostly land) drive the equilibrium on the supply side. The unprecedented long-lasting boom in house prices from 1997 to 2007 is thus essentially explained by a favourable macroeconomic development caused by the EMU effect and a glut of global savings. The bust phase of euro area house prices began in 2007, and the current house price might return to its equilibrium level in 2014. According to the most realistic scenario, euro area house prices will experience a smooth and soft landing in 2016 and then begin an increasing phase that will be pulled upwards by a higher equilibrium price. However, a deflationary scenario cannot be excluded if the current credit squeeze is not solved, particularly in the peripheral euro area member states. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such competition can lead to inefficient outcomes, if nonprofits impose externalities on each others' output This paper studies the sustainability of fundraising coordination agreements, using a game-theoretic model of coalition formation. We show that three key characteristics determine the stability of cooperation between nonprofits: (i) the alliance formation rule, (ii) the extent to which fundraising efforts are strategic complements/substitutes, and (iii) whether deviation from the agreements is by an individual or by a group of nonprofits. We analyze how the interaction of these three features induces (or not) the stability of Pareto-optimal full coordination in fundraising. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It will be shown that, in Veblen's thought, crises may emerge due to the banking system's non-accommodating behaviour according to the following sequence: as firms are not homogeneous, the credit system spontaneously tends to help bigger firms increase in size, due to the increase in their capital turnover, which allows them to produce and sell before their competitors. This produces two effects: (i) the reduction in profits of the smaller firms (or their bankruptcy) generates a decline of employment and output while, at the same time, (ii) the increase in the industrial concentration ratio produces a rise in prices and a consequent drop in real wages. This in turn reduces total demand for consumption goods, thus worsening entrepreneurs' expectations and having an adverse effect on production and investment by firms.","[Davanzati, Guglielmo Forges] Univ Salento, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Pacella, Andrea] Univ Sannio, Benevento, Italy",University of Salento; University of Sannio,"Davanzati, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Hist Soc & Human Studies, Via M Stampacchia, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",gug-lielmo.forges@unisalento.it,,,,,,,87,13,13,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Its derivation and interpretation in the context of Random Utility Maximisation (RUM) models with linear-additive utility functions is straightforward and well known. The choice set-composition effects and semi-compensatory behaviour emphasised in the Random Regret Minimisation (RRM) model induces deviations from this basic VoT specification. This paper reviews and provides new insights into the RRM based VoT measure developed by Chorus (2012a). It defines the theoretical properties of the measure using the micro-economic notion of indifference, and provides insights into the limitations of the measure with respect to deriving individual and aggregate welfare measures. Additionally, the representative consumer approach is adopted to derive an alternative VoT measure, which is behaviourally more complete than the Chorus (2012a) measure. Although alleviating some of the restrictions, the measure has its own theoretical disadvantage. The main contribution of the paper can therefore be summarised as the generation of the necessary insights into the extent to which RRM-based VoT measures can be applied for the purpose of economic appraisal.

We propose theoretical channels that endogenously generate heterogeneity in the levels of financial activities on the basis of a child's gender, even if parents do not possess discriminatory tastes, which we refer to as the invest via a son hypothesis compared to the conventional taste for a son explanation. Using nationally representative household data collected in 300 rural Chinese villages and econometric models that account for censored financial activities as well as endogenous fertility choices such as sex selection, we present strong evidence that having a son increases the amount of gifts and remittances a household receives from others by over 20%; it also increases both the amounts that a family loans and gives to relatives and friends. Moreover, having a son is found to increase household investments in both agricultural activities and family businesses while no type of expenditure increase with the arrival of a son, clearly consistent with our invest via a son hypothesis. Taken together, these results suggest that social conventions play important roles in household financial decisions that extend beyond the traditional role of budget constraints and consumption shocks.

For scientific discoveries with potential commercial applicability, researchers (or their funders) may also seek to establish formal intellectual property protection (e.g., patents); choosing to establish a patent-paper pair allows researchers to influence follow-on access to knowledge disclosed in a given scientific journal. This paper evaluates the relationship between scientific journal publication and patenting in research communities with significant public and private authorship by examining the incidence and impact of patent-paper pairs in two journals founded in the late 1990s/early 2000s, Nature Biotechnology and Nature Materials. Using a differences-in-differences framework that exploits the delay between publication and patent grant, we document a range of findings about the impact of patent grant across time and across research populations. First, we find that the negative impact of patent grant is concentrated in the first few years after a journal's founding and eventually becomes positive. Second, patent grant positively impacts follow-on citations from private authors more than from public authors. Finally, we observe an assortative matching pattern where intellectual property grant increases forward citations from authors sharing the same institutional affiliation (e.g., public authors citing public papers) more than research across institutional lines (e.g., public authors citing private papers).

A recent national firm-level survey of 1,400 firms in the manufacturing sector is used as the basis of the analysis. We find that institutional, financial and knowledge/skills-related risks and constraints are all significantly associated with these firms' depth and breadth of openness in innovation. The responses, however; vary across firms of different ownership types. Foreign-invested firms appear to be most responsive and take action to widen and deepen their openness in innovation. Privately owned firms have made significant responses to market- and institution- and finance- and risk-related impediments but not to knowledge- and skills-related impediments. State-owned firms appear to be least responsive in use of open innovation. Firm size and industry specific effects also appear to have significant moderating effect on firms' responses to the various constraints. These findings are supported by an in-depth study of the Chinese semiconductor industry.","[Fu, Xiaolan] Univ Oxford, Technol & Management Ctr Dev, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 3TB, England; [Li, Jizhen; Xiong, Hongru] Tsinghua Univ, Res Ctr Technol Innovat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Jizhen] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Hongru] State Council China, Res Dev Ctr, Beijing 100010, Peoples R China; [Chesbrough, Henry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Oxford; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Fu, XL (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Technol & Management Ctr Dev, Dept Int Dev, 3 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TB, England.",xiaolan.fu@qeh.ox.ac.uk; lijzh@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; xionghongru@gmail.com; chesbrou@haas.berkeley.edu,"LI, Jizhen/A-7113-2018","LI, Jizhen/0000-0003-1940-5633",,,,,44,27,27,3,82,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

In the canonical global games model of speculative attacks with a single target, it is well known that there exists a unique equilibrium that survives iterative deletion of dominated strategies, characterized by the threshold values of the private signal and the fundamentals. This paper shows that with two targets, there is again a unique, dominance-solvable equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the threshold value of signal for attacking a given currency is a function of the signal for the other target, and the threshold value of fundamentals that determines the outcome of attack on one currency is a function of the other target's fundamentals. Under certain condition on the noise distribution, the result is shown to extend to environments with any symmetric targets. This paper then presents a number of numerical examples and shows, among other results, that more accurate private signals have a decoupling effect on the outcomes of attack on different currencies.","Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Fujimoto, J (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",junichif@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,42,2,2,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Last stand behavior, in particular, contrasts with previous research where the underdog simply gives up. The distinctive results are achieved by introducing losing penalties and discounting into the racing environment. This framework permits the momentum effect, typically ascribed to the winner of early stages, to be more thoroughly examined. I study the likelihood that the underdog will catch up. I find that neck-and-neck races are common when the losing penalty is large relative to the winning prize, while landslide victories occur when the prize is relatively large. Closed-form solutions are given for the case where players have a common winning prize and losing penalty. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We first assume that each local bidder values only a specific item, e.g. the license for the region where it has monopoly power, and that global bidders' valuation functions are convex. For this environment we show that a global bidder faces an exposure problem with adverse consequences for revenue and efficiency. In the limit when the number of items grows large, the SAA is revenue and efficiency equivalent to the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. We extend our analysis to include the case where items are substitutes for local bidders, so that price arbitrage will occur as observed in many spectrum auctions. This environment, which combines substitutes and complements, results in an aggravated exposure problem. Consequently, the SAA is no longer efficient and may yield dramatically lower revenues than the VCG mechanism. Finally, we relax the assumption that global bidders' valuation functions are convex by considering an environment with medium-sized global bidders who demand fewer than all items. We show that global bidders divide the market at low prices when market sharing is feasible while they engage in mutually destructive bidding when there is a fitting problem. In both cases, the SAA again underperforms relative to the VCG mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, we investigate the effect of matching mission preferences, i.e., a worker preferring the same charity the firm donates to.

A plea bargain provides unequal incentives to go to trial because innocent defendants are more willing to plead not guilty. We show that the court process implements the preferences of the person or group who is most concerned about wrongful conviction. If a prosecutor is more concerned about wrongful conviction than the jury, the prosecutor can shape the defendant pool at trial so that jurors act according to prosecutor's preferences against judicial mistakes. Our model also connects insights from strategic jury models that usually omit plea bargaining with the actual criminal court process where most cases are resolved through plea bargaining. As an example, we show that the inferiority of the unanimity rule established in Feddersen and Pesendorfer (Am Polit Sci Rev 92(1):23-35, 1998) persists in spite of the addition of plea bargaining.","Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",sangmok@sas.upenn.edu,,,,,,,19,2,3,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In institutional terms, the paper then explores the sources of principally sectoral discrepancies. We find that the industrial sector has been the major contributor to discrepancies in both gross domestic product (GDP) and total energy consumption in recent years. Technical aspects such as statistical coverage, data collection method, and double-counting cannot explain the discrepancy. For the industrial sector, limited data accessibility undermines external checks and balances from the general public. As the primary bodies in collecting industrial data, the Provincial Bureaus of Statistics (PBSs) are not subject to effective intemal checks and balances from other governmental divisions. To out-compete counterparts and get promoted, provincial leaders have explicit incentives to overstate provincial GDP, with industrial added value being the first statistic to be affected. This dynamic further extends to industrial energy consumption, which is over-reported as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A reference-dependent agent who experiences utility from anticipation and from changes in this anticipatory emotion makes utility-maximizing assessments about his likelihood of success in a future lottery. Consistent with the empirical evidence, the model predicts that if the lottery is sufficiently valuable, optimism decreases as the payoff date approaches. Intuitively, as time goes by, last-period expected disappointment becomes increasingly important relative to the joy of anticipating a favorable outcome. Applying the model to the optimal timing of productivity bonuses, I find that a decreasing path of beliefs reduces the cost of providing incentives. Thus, optimal bonuses are sizable and are not frequently offered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Two specific demand-side stabilization methods are examined here: conventional pump priming and the new designation of fiscal policy effectiveness found in the new consensus literature. A theoretical critique of their respective transmission mechanisms reveals that they operate in a trickle-down fashion that not only fails to secure and maintain full employment, but itself contributes to the increasing postwar labor market precariousness and the erosion of income equality. The two conventional demand-side measures are then contrasted with the proposed alternative-a bottom-up approach to fiscal policy based on a reinterpretation of Keynes's original policy prescriptions for full employment. The article offers theoretical, methodological, and policy rationale for government intervention that includes specific direct employment and investment initiatives, which are inherently different from contemporary hydraulic fine-tuning measures. It outlines the contours of the modern bottom-up approach and concludes with some of its advantages over conventional stabilization methods.","Bard Coll, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA",,"Tcherneva, PR (通讯作者)，Bard Coll, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA.",,,,,,,,40,25,25,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The cross wavelet results show that stock price movements are lagging both to the exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations. The interest rate lead over the stock price movements is even clearer, especially after 2006, and it suggests that the stock market follows the interest rate signals.

In the model, sellers hold beliefs about their opponents' strategies and play quantal best responses to these beliefs. After each round, sellers update their beliefs based on the information learned from previous play. The results indicate that when sellers have full past price information, the model explains the price distributions within periods and the dynamics across periods.

The results are striking - volatilities of GDP and inflation increase substantially. In particular, had Poland adopted the euro, GDP growth would have oscillated between -6% and +9% (-9% to +11% under more extreme assumptions) instead of between 1% and 7%.

In the public sector, defined benefit pensions usually offer lump sum distributions equal to employee contributions, not the present value of the annuity. Thus, for terminating employees that are younger or have shorter tenures, the lump sum distribution amount may exceed the present value of the annuity. We discuss the factors that may influence the choice to withdraw funds or not in this environment. Using administrative data from the North Carolina state and local government retirement systems, we find that over two-thirds of public sector workers under age 50 separating prior to retirement from public plans in North Carolina left their accounts open and did not request a cash distribution from the pension system within one year of separation. Furthermore, the evidence suggests many separating workers, particularly those with short tenure, may be forgoing substantial monetary benefits due to lack of knowledge, understanding, or accessibility of benefits. We find no evidence of a bias toward cash distributions for public employees in North Carolina. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Taking the case of the cotton reform in Burkina Faso, I study the determinants of the joint distribution of changes in subjective welfare and subjective appreciation of the welfare effects of a policy reform at the household level. A reference-based utility function with personality effects is introduced to explain large increases in experienced subjective welfare with no corresponding increases in consumption and income. Using subjective and objective welfare variables from data collected in cotton areas before and after the cotton reform, several empirical specifications are estimated to explore reference and personality effects at play, while addressing measurement issues related to subjective indicators, i.e. heterogeneity in latent psychological factors. In addition to absolute and relative welfare changes, both the large increase in subjective wealth and the ubiquitous satisfaction with the cotton reform are found to be heterogeneously driven by personality and information effects across income and ethnic groups, which underlies significant but heterogeneous appropriation of the welfare effects and policy content of the cotton reform.","World Bank, Africa Reg Chief Economist Off, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Kaminski, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, Africa Reg Chief Economist Off, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jkaminski@worldbank.org,,,,,,,57,2,3,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In our setting, the average inflation rate fluctuates around the inflation target if the computerized central bank obeys the Taylor principle. If the Taylor principle is violated, the average inflation rate persistently deviates from the target. These deviations from the target are less pronounced, if inflation rates cannot be as readily observed as nominal interest rates. This result is consistent with the interpretation that subjects underestimate the influence of inflation on the real return to savings if the inflation rate is only observed ex post.

Female labor force participation is related to competing uses for women's time, especially in a context of poor infrastructure and limited availability of purchased replacements for household labor. We examine factors affecting women's participation in employment and reproductive household work in Tajikistan, drawing on the 2003 Tajikistan Living Standards Survey. We incorporate specific conditions in Central Asia, including the prevalence of extended family households, norms about how women share household work, an absence of market substitutes for caring and reproductive labor, employment in family enterprises and poor infrastructure, especially in rural areas. We estimate the system using a Generalized Maximum Entropy (GME) approach. We find that few individual and household characteristics are related to time in employment. Time in noncare reproductive work decreases if a woman receives direct remuneration for her employment (compared to working in a family farm or enterprise but receiving no direct remuneration), but increases if the woman has less access to infrastructure. Rural women spend more time in both employment and non-care reproductive work than urban women, but less time in care work. Lack of infrastructure may leave women with few choices with respect to non-care reproductive work, while overall levels of time poverty create pressures on care time.

We develop and test a theoretical model of a venture capitalist (VC) negotiating with an entrepreneur who may overweigh or underweigh the payoff consequences of contractual downside protection (DP). A lawyer with expertise in venture capital can inform the entrepreneur about these consequences, but less expert (but otherwise high quality) lawyers cannot. We determine how a VC's decision to include DP is affected by the expected quality of the entrepreneur's project, the entrepreneur's experience, and the VC expertise of his/her legal counsel. We show that the VC's incentive to include unnecessary DP declines in expected project quality. Indeed, for inexperienced entrepreneurs involved with high-quality projects, VCs prefer that the entrepreneur's counsel has VC expertise. This implies that, when negotiating with inexperienced entrepreneurs, VCs who invest in high-quality companies should be more likely to negotiate with entrepreneurs who employ lawyers with VC expertise.

Entangled configurations never emerge because each firm has an incentive to reduce the number of products facing direct competition with its rival. This result contrasts sharply with the equilibrium of non-segmented quality differentiation when firms compete in quantities.

When each bidder can always offer a contract with higher utility for the center at an arbitrarily small loss of her own utility, the QVA is the only mechanism that is individually rational, strategy-proof, selects stable outcomes, and is Pareto efficient.

We consider an oligopoly industry producing a homogeneous output in which risk-averse firms face an entry cost upon entering the industry, and then compete in Cournot with one another. Each firm faces uncertainty in the input cost when making production decision, and has access to the futures market to hedge the random cost. We provide two sets of results. First, under general assumptions about risk preferences, demand, and uncertainty, we characterize the unique equilibrium. In contrast to previous results in the literature (without entry), both production and output price depend on uncertainty and risk aversion. Specifically, when entry is endogenized and the futures price is not actuarially fair, access to the futures market does not lead to separation. Second, to study the effect of access to the futures market on entry and production, we restrict attention to constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) preferences, a linear demand, and a normal distribution for the spot price. In general, the effect of access to the futures market on the number of firms and production is ambiguous. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We formulate a two-stage game of pricing and informative advertising in which two firms, first, compete with mass advertising and, later, build a database using their historical sales records and compete by directly targeting the ads on their potential customers. We show that, compared to the case where firms only use mass advertising, direct advertising yields higher advertising efforts and an intertemporal reallocation of both market power and profits from the first to the second period. We also find that targeting increases the overall firms' profit and the level of social welfare, but the impact on the average intertemporal price and consumer surplus is ambiguous. Finally, when reaching the potential market with mass advertising is sufficiently expensive, the use of direct advertising leads firms to provide the socially optimal level of advertising whereas, if mass advertising is cheap, firms tend to launch too little advertising in the first period and too much in the second.","[Esteban, Lola; Hernandez, Jose M.] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Hernández, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",hernande@unizar.es,"Hernández, José/JKI-8418-2023","Hernández, José/0009-0006-6689-6980",,,,,25,4,5,0,27,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

The presence of sequential types enhances expectational coordination in the case of strategic substitutability, but not in the case of strategic complementarity. In particular, eductive stability can be obtained for any degree of substitutability, provided the number of sequential types is large enough.

Three scenarios are then simulated: a step decrease in real exports from country B, increased wage pressure in country B and an income tax cut in country A. In all cases, monetary and fiscal policies in isolation enjoy little success, but a combined monetary and fiscal approach to stabilisation proves highly effective. Moreover, the model suggests that the pursuit of autonomous inflation targeting in each country introduces excessive exchange rate volatility relative to an alternative rule in which one central bank takes a leading role in interest rate setting.","[Greenwood-Nimmo, Matthew] Univ Melbourne, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Greenwood-Nimmo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ 312, 111 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",mgreenwood@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,44,9,9,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Then optimal demands can be determined from the standard two stage budgeting process, where optimal current period demands depend only on current and past prices and current period expenditure. Unfortunately this simplification does not significantly reduce the informational requirements for the decision maker since in general the expenditure is a function of future prices. Recent behavioral evidence strongly suggests that frequently individuals significantly simplify intertemporal choice problems. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions such that the current period's expenditure and hence optimal current demands are independent of future prices. Since this preference property is a special case of separability, it is referred to as myopic separability. One well known special case of myopic separability is log additive (or equivalently Cobb Douglas) utility. However, this form of utility is overly restrictive, especially given the general aversion of Fisher (1930), Hicks (1965) and Lucas (1978) to requiring preferences to be additively separable. Myopic separability requires neither additive separability nor logarithmic period utility. As an application, we derive simple restrictions on equilibrium interest rates which are necessary and sufficient for utility to take the myopic separable form. These conditions are arguably less restrictive than those implied by additively separable preferences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although the literature documenting the impact of labor market regulation on employment is extensive, there is a dearth of evidence on the impact of such policies in low-income countries (LICs). Since it is easier for workers, especially women, to slip into the informal sector in LICs, regulations are likely to have stronger impacts on formal employment in these countries (but lower impacts on unemployment). We systematically reviewed available research from countries that are, or were until recently, LICs. Most studies document that more stringent labor regulations are associated with lower formal sector employment and higher informal sector employment. We also conducted a metaregression analysis of the impact of minimum wages on formal and informal employment. After controlling for publication bias, higher minimum wages are associated with lower formal employment and a higher share of informal workers.","[Nataraj, Shanthi; Perez-Arce, Francisco; Kumar, Krishna B.] RAND Corp, Econ & Stat, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA; [Srinivasan, Sinduja V.] Pardee RAND Grad Sch, Santa Monica, CA USA",RAND Corporation; RAND Corporation; Pardee RAND Graduate School,"Nataraj, S (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, Econ & Stat, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA.",,,"Nataraj, Shanthi/0000-0002-1982-3221",,,,,48,19,21,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

This paper aims to bridge this gap in the existing literature by evaluating the impact of a large-scale irrigation infrastructure project implemented in Sri Lanka. It identifies the treatment effect of irrigation access by exploiting a situation where the government used lotteries to distribute irrigated plots. Furthermore, in order to disentangle the channels through which the irrigation reduces poverty, we extend the seasonal consumption smoothing model of Paxson (1993; Consumption and Income Seasonality in Thailand. Journal of Political Economy 191(1): 39-72) by introducing endogenous credit constraints. Using unique household level monthly panel data over a year, it is shown that with irrigation accessibility, not only the average income increases but also the patterns of income fluctuation changes and the probability of binding credit constraint declines through which transient poverty is mitigated. These empirical results suggest that irrigation infrastructure has a positive impact on reducing both chronic and transient poverty directly and indirectly by improving income and relaxing credit constraints.","[Shoji, Masahiro] Seijo Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Sawada, Yasuyuki; Sugawara, Shinya] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Shinkai, Naoko] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",University of Tokyo; Nagoya University,"Shoji, M (通讯作者)，Seijo Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",sawada@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp; shoji@seijo.ac.jp; sugawara@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp; NSHINKAI@aol.com,"Masahiro, Shoji/AAB-9339-2020",,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245047, 25780172] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,58,4,4,0,35,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Studying a 13-year long (1998-2010) price series of spot and futures prices at Nord Pool and employing regression models with GARCH residuals, we show that the impact of the water reservoir level on the risk premium is positive, which is to be expected, but contradicts the results of Botterud et al. (2010). We also show that after taking into account the seasonality of the water level, the storage cost theory proposed by Botterud et al.

However, the additional gain from coordination may not necessarily cover the extra administrative costs incurred by applying these contracts. In this paper, a production inventory problem is considered in a two-level supply chain. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game. Then, the retail fixed mark-up (RFM) policy is examined in order to investigate its performance on supply chain. We apply this policy because of its lower administrative costs compared to other policies. We found that RFM policy is not capable of coordinating the channel; however, it leads to considerable improvements over the channel. For example, it is shown that it improves each member's profit and leads to Pareto improvement over Stackelberg policy. Besides, its average efficiency is about 96% of that of integrated policy approach.","[Alaei, Saeed] K N Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Behravesh, Masoud; Karegar, Nayere] Islamic Azad Univ, Young Res & Elite Club, Marand Branch, Marand, Iran",K.

We find that economic freedom in ancient Athens is on level with the highest ranked modern economies such as Hong Kong and Singapore. With the exception of the position of women and slaves, Athens scores high in almost every dimension of economic freedom. Trade is probably highly important even by current standards. As studies of contemporary societies suggest that institutional quality is probably an important determinant of economic growth, it may also have been one factor in the relative material success of the Athenians.","[Bergh, Andreas; Lyttkens, Carl Hampus] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Bergh, Andreas] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Bergh, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden.",andreas.bergh@nek.lu.se; carl_hampus.lyttkens@nek.lu.se,"Bergh, Andreas/AAM-2478-2020; Bergh, Andreas/E-9962-2018","Bergh, Andreas/0000-0003-2621-6769; Lyttkens, Carl Hampus/0000-0002-6286-124X",,,,,69,16,17,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

To illustrate this claim we introduce conspicuous consumption concerns, as described by Veblen, into a stock-flow-consistent post Keynesian model and demonstrate that, under these conditions, a decrease in income equality leads to a corresponding increase in debt-financed consumption demand. Here Minskian dynamics come into play: if perceived economic stability causes banks' margins of safety to decrease sufficiently, increased credit demand is accommodated by credit supply giving rise to a debt-financed consumption boom. As the solvency of households decreases and interest rates move up, banks reduce lending, triggering household bankruptcies and, finally, a recession. What follows is a stable period of consolidation, where past debts are repaid, financial stability is regained and conspicuous consumption motives may gradually take over again. We illustrate this approach to the current crisis and its explanatory validity by extending our stock-flow-consistent model into a dynamic simulation.","[Kapeller, Jakob] Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, Linz, Austria; [Schuetz, Bernhard] Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Kapeller, J (通讯作者)，Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, Linz, Austria.",,"Kapeller, Jakob/AAP-1109-2020",,,,,,62,38,43,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

It is shown that the new version is consistent with extant experimental results in the literature and thus cannot be rejected by any of them. Given this observation, we then design an experiment that can test the new as well as original versions of the guilt aversion hypothesis. In contrast to the prediction of both versions of the hypothesis, we find that the correlation between elicited beliefs and (trustful or trustworthy) behavior is almost zero even in an environment with pre-play communication.

The wage-price equilibrium-correction model (ECM) and the Phillips curve model (PCM) that both can be used to represent the supply side of a New Keynesian macro model, are synthesised in a generalised model of the wage-price spiral. We show that the choice of ECM or PCM has implications for the long-run stability of the macro model, without need of a NAIRU. We also find that the range of theoretically admissible dynamics is wide. For example, both the ECM and PCM may display endogenous cyclical fluctuations in inflation and unemployment, showing that even simple structures can give rise to complex dynamics. In practice that may entail that forecasting the effects of shocks and policy changes is difficult even in the best of circumstances.","[Kolsrud, Dag] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Nymoen, Ragnar] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway; University of Oslo,"Kolsrud, D (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",Dag.Kolsrud@ssb.no; Ragnar.Nymoen@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,20,5,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Repurchase agreements (repo) are short-term debt contracts that were central in the expansion of liquidity during the run-up to the financial crisis. The irresponsible and disruptive lending within the housing market was related to excessive financial institution leverage made possible through repo. A key issue in the law relating to repo is the status of the collateral in the event of bankruptcy of the borrower.

A model of endogenous growth based on human capital accumulation is used to simulate numerically the growth effects of different environmental tax reforms and calculate their impact on welfare in the short and the long-term. Our results suggest that the magnitude of these effects depends on the type of tax reform and the presence of a convex adjustment cost for investment. Although, the green tax reform that aims to use the revenue from environmental tax in order to reduce tax on wages is always growth improving, its long term welfare effects depend on the capital adjustment cost. Moreover, regardless of the tax reform scenarios, the short-term welfare effect is always negative.

Since punishment is often costly, however, this raises an issue of second-order free-riding: indeed, the sanctioning system itself is a common good which can be exploited. Most investigations, so far, considered peer punishment: players could impose fines on those who exploited them, at a cost to themselves. Only a minority considered so-called pool punishment. In this scenario, players contribute to a punishment pool before engaging in the joint enterprise, and without knowing who the free-riders will be. Theoretical investigations (Sigmund et al., Nature 466:861-863, 2010) have shown that peer punishment is more efficient, but pool punishment more stable. Social learning, i.e., the preferential imitation of successful strategies, should lead to pool punishment if sanctions are also imposed on second-order free-riders, but to peer punishment if they are not. Here we describe an economic experiment (the Mutual Aid game) which tests this prediction. We find that pool punishment only emerges if second-order free riders are punished, but that peer punishment is more stable than expected. Basically, our experiment shows that social learning can lead to a spontaneously emerging social contract, based on a sanctioning institution to overcome the free rider problem.","[Zhang, Boyu] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Boyu; Sigmund, Karl] Univ Vienna, Fac Math, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Li, Cong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Ctr Computat Biol & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [De Silva, Hannelore] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Bednarik, Peter] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Evolut Social Behav, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Sigmund, Karl] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria","Beijing Normal University; University of Vienna; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Zoology, CAS; Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of Gottingen; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)","Sigmund, K (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Fac Math, Waehringer Guertel 18, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",karl.sigmund@univie.ac.at,"LI, WEI/JUE-9796-2023","Li, Cong/0000-0002-7201-4140",,,,,58,42,46,1,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Using a dummy-augmented GARCH specification for the period from May 1987 to October 2013, our key findings are as follows: (i) Volatilities on Mondays are significantly higher than on all other weekdays, providing the important insight that seasonal effects should be considered when forecasting crude oil volatility. (ii) Returns on the other hand tend to be lower on Mondays than on other weekdays, suggesting profitable investment strategies based on this seasonal pattern. In fact, the analysis of a simple long-short trading rule based on the Monday effect provides some evidence that it can outperform a passive buy-and-hold approach. However, it cannot do so to an extent that is statistically significant.

There are two critical vulnerabilities in the Irish economy at present. The first is the potential for sluggish economic growth due to a slowdown in external demand, which impacts on the government's ability to meet budgetary targets. The second concern relates to the financial stability of the banking system given the escalating mortgage crisis. Our results show that Irish economic growth is highly sensitive to the performance of its trading partners and any international slowdown will hinder Ireland's growth prospects. The model used suggests that the appropriate policy response is to pursue further gains in competitiveness. We estimate the impact of an external slowdown on mortgage delinquency using a new dataset on the loan books of the commercial banking sector. The results suggest that a negative one standard deviation shock to US GDP growth leads to an increase of 1600 in the number of mortgages in arrears for at least 90 days. Arrears are driven by unemployment and negative equity in the model. We discuss policies to contain the mortgage crisis by improving these intermediate target variables.

Legislators are privately informed about their ideological intensities, i.e., the weight placed on the ideological decision relative to the weight placed on the distributive decision. Communication takes place before a proposal is offered and majority rule voting determines the outcome. We show that it is not possible for all legislators to communicate informatively. In particular, the legislator who is ideologically more distant from the proposer cannot communicate informatively, but the closer legislator may communicate whether he would compromise or fight on ideology.

We first discuss the channels through which access to evasion affects labor supply responses and then set up a laboratory experiment (N=205) in which all participants undertake a real-effort task over several rounds. Subjects face a tax rate that varies across rounds and are required to pay taxes on earned income. The treatment group is given the opportunity to underreport income, while the control group is not. We find evidence that participants in the treatment group respond differently to changes in the net-of-tax rate than participants in the control group. The effect is more prevalent when tax rates fall. Additionally, the direction of the treatment effect is dependent on the evolution of tax rates across rounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Both effects are influenced by the interest alignment between manager and worker. Our data confirm the prediction that optimal monitoring depends non-monotonically on the interest alignment between managers and workers.

On the one hand, local protectionism plays a substantial role in many federations and decentralized states. On the other hand, if the country exhibits high level of cultural heterogeneity, it may also contribute to the economic fragmentation; however, this topic has received significantly less attention in the literature. This paper looks at the case of China and proxies the cultural heterogeneity by the heterogeneity of local dialects. It shows that the effect of politics clearly dominates that of culture: while provincial borders seem to have a strong influence disrupting economic ties, economic linkages across provinces, even if the regions fall into the same linguistic zone, are rather weak and, on the contrary, linguistic differences within provinces do not prevent economic integration. For some language zones we do, however, find a stronger effect on economic integration. (C) 2013 Association for Comparative Economic Studies Published by Elsevier Inc.

The analysis identifies a novel mechanism of media bias: the bias in a media outlet's news reports is the result of the slanted endogenous information acquisition strategy of its editor. In particular, the results show that the expected accuracy of news reports is lower the more ideological an editor is. Nevertheless, citizens find it optimal to acquire information from a media outlet whose editor has similar ideological preferences.

The effects of this tax reform are evaluated with a Computable General Equilibrium model with the neoclassical closure rule. The model is calibrated with a Social Accounting Matrix for the year 2000 (SAMES-00) elaborated by the authors. Results show that lower SSCs of employers raise employment, households' welfare and real gross domestic product (GDP) but also increase the public deficit. These positive effects remain when the reduction is compensated with personal income taxes to keep the public deficit/GDP ratio constant and also when the compensating variable is value-added tax (VAT). Unlike in previous studies, the most positive effects are obtained when the lower public revenues are compensated via lower coverage of unemployment benefits.","[Teresa Alvarez-Martinez, Maria] Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Polo, Clemente] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Alvarez-Martínez, MT (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",mta60@rci.rutgers.edu,"Alvarez-Martinez, Maria Teresa/HLH-2155-2023",,,,,,11,3,4,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

We also find some evidence that private ownership is associated with higher skill utilization, particularly following privatizations and when foreign investment is present. The estimated job losses associated with private ownership are consistent with a theory in which the shift in ownership increases the degree of profit orientation and leads to lower job security.","[Bastos, Paulo] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Monteiro, Natalia P.] Univ Minho, NIPE, Dept Econ, Braga, Portugal; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Minho, NIPE, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Braga, Portugal; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, Bergen, Norway",The World Bank; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; University of Bergen,"Bastos, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",pbastos@worldbank.org; n.monteiro@eeg.uminho.pt; o.r.straume@eeg.uminho.pt,"Straume, Odd Rune/B-6090-2009; Monteiro, Natalia/B-5868-2009; Bastos, Paulo/G-3137-2018","Straume, Odd Rune/0000-0002-6889-2717; Monteiro, Natalia/0000-0002-4821-7685; Bastos, Paulo/0000-0002-3665-0000",,,,,26,3,4,2,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Non-linearity of the Nash equilibrium strategies is used to investigate the effect of task complexity on adaptive learning by varying the degree of approximation the agents can handle. In addition, learning in different information environments is explored. Social learning allows agents to imitate each other's bidding strategies based on their relative success. Under individual learning agents are limited to their own experience. We observe convergence to steady states near the predicted equilibrium in all cases. The ability to learn non-linear functions helps the agents with a non-linear equilibrium strategy but hurts the agents with an almost linear one. Better information about the opponent population has a relatively modest impact. A larger number of strategies to experiment with and an ability to systematically compare strategies by holding a number of factors constant have a comparatively stronger beneficial effect.","San Francisco State Univ, Dept Econ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Chernomaz, K (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Dept Econ, 1600 Holloway Ave,HSS 142, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",kirillch@sfsu.edu,"Dao, Rock/E-5736-2014",,,,,,20,2,3,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

In a laboratory labor market experiment, we test whether subjects provide higher effort if they can choose the mission of their job. We observe that subjects do not provide higher effort than in a control treatment. Surprised by this finding, we run a second experiment in which subjects can choose whether they want to work on a job with their preferred mission or not. A subgroup of agents (roughly one third) is willing to do so even if this option is more costly than choosing the alternative job. Moreover, we find that these subjects provide substantially higher effort. These results suggest that some workers can be motivated by missions and that selection into missionoriented organizations is an important factor to explain empirical findings of lower wages and high motivation in these organizations.

As a result, business cycle theories of the labor wedge should primarily focus on improving the household side of the labor market.

We discuss and extend the Yoshida model to some non-Gaussian distributions and provide associated ES. Secondly, assuming that the risk factors' degree of imprecision changes over time, original fuzzy portfolio VaR and ES models are introduced. For a given subjectivity level fixed by the investor, these models allow the computation of a pessimistic and an optimistic estimation of the value-at-risk and of the expected shortfall.

The estimated parameters disclose that the optimal hedge ratio is not constant in case of the US and the UK. We find one negative and one positive shift in the optimal hedge ratio in the US. However, we find only one significant and positive shift in the optimal hedge ratio in the UK. The implication of these findings from the perspective of both investors as well as policy-makers is elaborated on in the main text.","[Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser] UAE Univ, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Roca, Eduardo] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",United Arab Emirates University; Griffith University,"Roca, E (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",E.Roca@griffith.edu.au,"Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser/AAC-3942-2019; Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023","Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser/0000-0002-6212-1292;",,,,,25,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

One such Australian strategy heavily subscribed by females with young children has been to promote part-time employment. Results provide evidence that females with young children at home engaged in part-time employment are generally more satisfied with their working hours and work-life balance relative to those with older and no children, whilst the opposite holds when looking at those in full-time employment.

Moreover, total factor productivity, the unemployment rate and the degree of urbanisation are also important determinants of private sector wage growth. With respect to public sector wage growth, we find that it is influenced by fiscal conditions in addition to private sector wages.

As in the standard Condorcet Jury Theorem, we consider large committees with common values and incomplete information. Our main result is that the joint trial by a single committee can aggregate information if and only if the severed trials by separate committees can aggregate information. Specifically, suppose that either for the joint trial or for the severed trials there exists a sequence of equilibria that implements the optimal outcome with probability approaching one as the number of voters goes to infinity. Then a sequence of equilibria with similar asymptotic efficiency exists for the other format. Thus, the advantage of either format cannot hinge on pure information aggregation with many signals.

Reductions in banks' credits to nonfinancial sectors were driven by increased collateralization, credit rationing, and a neglect of cash flow performance of banking clients. These jeopardized the normal deleveraging of companies with positive cash flows, and rolling over credits, which stifled economic growth. Erroneous sequencing, timing, and calibration of measures steering the deleveraging process generated these processes. Optimal deleveraging process demands that the Central Bank also focus on the stability of the financial system.

Contrary to both evidence from previous fiscal stimulus programs and standard theories of legislative politics, we do not find evidence of substantial political targeting. The districts of party leaders did no receive more funds than those of rank-and-file legislators, nor did the districts of pivotal voters in the Senate or swing voters in the House receive more money. While Democratic districts overall received more per resident than Republican districts, this differential nearly disappears when we consider award per worker in each district or when we control for district poverty rate. Democratic states did receive modestly greater funds, but this is largely due to higher levels of funding going to places with more generous state welfare programs. At the same time, we find no relationship between the amount awarded and measures of the severity of the downturn in the local economy, while we do find more funds flowing to districts with higher levels of economic activity and greater incidence of poverty. The results are consistent with the discretionary component of ARRA being allocated through funding formulas or based on project characteristics other than countercyclical efficacy or political expediency, which stands in contrast to evidence from fiscal stimulus in the New Deal. One explanation suggests that over the past century, legislative norms have reduced the scope of discretion with attendant benefits and costs.","[Boone, Christopher] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dube, Arindrajit] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Kaplan, Ethan] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Columbia University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Boone, C (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,28,15,22,0,20,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Using a large fiscal dataset at the county level from 1997 to 2006, this paper studies the effects of fiscal decentralization on local expenditure policy and analyzes how the vertical fiscal imbalance shapes these effects. The estimation results show that expenditure decentralization increases government spending and leads to a fund allocation with a larger weight on capital construction and smaller weights on education and administration. In contrast, revenue decentralization has little influence on local government expenditures. We show that the differences in the effects of expenditure and revenue decentralization can be attributed to the distortionary effects caused by the vertical fiscal imbalance and, thus, offer support to the importance of the common-pool problem at the county level of China's fiscal system.

A calibration exercise finds that the tendency of the labor force withdrawal rate of the long-term unemployed to decline in a recession and then rise in a recovery plays an important role in the well-documented loop around the Beveridge curve. Overall, the results suggest that the longer workers are unemployed, the less attached they become to the labor market.","[Krueger, Alan B.; Cramer, Judd; Cho, David] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Krueger, AB (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,48,71,84,0,21,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

It is possible to investigate its basic functioning and see whether its teachings may buttress Keynes's concept of animal spirits. Seven features constitute them: duality of reasoning; automatic analogical assessment; automatic decision; anchorage in emotions; intermediation between body and soul; beyond the rational/irrational dichotomy; and conventional basis. This article aims to compare these features comprising animal spirits with Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis. It appears that both theories are very much in tune, in that they emphasize analogical induction, the intelligence of emotions, and the automaticity of cognition and action. It may prove useful, as a way to stimulate further research, to enrich and deepen animal spirits thanks to somatic markers.","Univ Bordeaux, GREThA Grp Rech Econ Theor & Appl, Bordeaux, France",Universite de Bordeaux,"Lainé, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GREThA Grp Rech Econ Theor & Appl, Bordeaux, France.",,,,,,,,82,1,1,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The paper also examines the main poverty alleviation policies implemented in rural areas over the past 10 years and assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of these policies from the perspective of targeting accuracy. It is found that China has achieved significant progress in rural poverty reduction in recent decades, although the speed of poverty reduction has varied from one period to another. The largest contribution to rural poverty reduction has been economic growth, which has been increasingly offset by the inequality effect on poverty reduction. In addition, poverty alleviation policies are effective, but not efficient.","Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Li, S (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",lishi@bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,22,16,17,2,87,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR,2014,22.0,2,,,SI,,22,41,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12060.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AC5YW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332597900003,0

Using Chinese manufacturing firm data for the 1998-2007 period, we find that firms become less capital-intensive but more productive after exporting, compared to non-exporters that share similar ex ante characteristics. To rationalize these findings that contrast with existing studies, we develop a variant of the model by Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010, 2011) to consider firms producing multiple products with varying capital intensity. The model predicts that when a firm in a labor-abundant country starts exporting, it specializes in its core competencies by allocating more resources to produce more labor-intensive products. Firm ex ante productivity is associated with a smaller decline in capital intensity after exporting. A sharper post-export decline in capital intensity is associated with a larger increase in measured total factor productivity. We find firm-level evidence supporting these predictions. Using transaction-level data for the 2000-2006 period, we show that Chinese new exporters add products that are less capital-intensive than their existing products and drop those that are more capital-intensive in subsequent years.

Further, correcting for two potential biases, namely Nickell bias and time aggregation bias, we obtain half-life estimates of 2.3-3.8 quarters that are much shorter than those reported by previous research.

The Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) is the most striking example of a policy in this area. This study employs a conjoint survey and Bayesian mixed logit model to analyze consumer preferences for specific attributes of the RPS policy. It analyzes households' marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for the RPS with specific attributes and simulates the degree of household acceptability of the policy through a scenario analysis. Comparison between costs and benefits of implementing the policy is also attempted by analyzing the households' MWTP with the actual transition expense of RPS implementation incurred by electricity supply companies. The simulation results provide implications for improving RPS policy implementation; households consider the creation of new jobs as the most important policy attribute, followed by increase in electricity prices, damage to forests, reduction in CO2 emissions, and length of power outages. Moreover, the Korean household is willing to accept an increase of up to 1.39% in its electricity prices (relative to 2012), and the median MWTP of each household for RPS implementation is KRW 734.99/month (USD 0.67/month).

Countries afflicted by the recent financial crisis launched general programs in one or two, and even in three different categories. In this paper, we examine that the design of a government rescue package for a distressed bank depends on the expected reduction of the default risk in the bank's equity returns. We find that the bank's default risk is negatively related to distressed loan purchases, and to capital injections, but positively related to guaranteed debt issuance. We also find that the rescue package including all three categories is not guaranteed to increase stability for the rescued bank Specifically, the combination of distressed loan purchases and capital injections is superior to the package of the three categories in addition to the solo instrument. This suggests that an effective design of a government rescue package for the financial services industry largely depends on its targets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This is often seen in recycling of materials such as used papers, plastics and so on. This paper analyses this aspect, and demonstrates how the formation of prices and activity levels is made in a long-run growing economy, by means of a neo-Ricardian type of production model. It is proved that a long-run equilibrium exists under reasonable assumptions. It is also shown how the sorting rate of different types of waste affects the grade of recyclable resources as well as prices.","Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Hosoda, EB (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",hosoda@econ.keio.ac.jp,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,FEB,2014,65.0,1,,,,,58,94,,10.1111/meca.12029,0.0,,,37,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,272JN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328456700003,0

If profits are private but losses are borne by taxpayers, banks have perverted incentives to take excessive risks. Cordella and Levy Yeyati (2003) presented an opposing hypothesis. Safety nets offered during turbulent times help banks to survive and may increase banks' franchise value. This induces stronger risk aversion. This unorthodox hypothesis is tested with a cross-national comparison. National banking crises in 1981-2003 were handled by national authorities in different ways, and countries may have built reputations as tough or generous crisis managers. The recent financial crisis was less severe in countries where the government had offered blanket guarantees in previous crises, which may be interpreted as a sign of stronger risk aversion during the pre-2007 build-up phase. Moreover, losses suffered by depositors in past crises made the recent crisis worse. These findings are consistent with the franchise value hypothesis but in strict contradiction with the mainstream moral hazard argumentation. The finding is politically unpopular and based on relatively few observations, but it is statistically significant and robust to the inclusion of numerous control variables.","[Kauko, Karlo] Bank Finland, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Kauko, Karlo] Aalto Univ, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Bank of Finland; Aalto University,"Kauko, K (通讯作者)，Bank Finland, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",karlo.kauko@bof.fi,,,,,,,22,5,5,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2014,67.0,1,,,,,82,92,,10.1111/kykl.12044,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,282JM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329167200006,0

We show how tougher competition in an export market induces a firm to skew its export sales toward its best performing products. We find very strong confirmation of this competitive effect for French exporters across export market destinations. Theoretically, this within-firm change in product mix driven by the trading environment has important repercussions on firm productivity. A calibrated fit to our theoretical model reveals that these productivity effects are potentially quite large.

Boosting is used to screen as many as 1,500 potentially relevant predictors consisting of 132 real and financial time series and their lags. Estimation over the full sample 1961:1-2011: 12 finds that there are fewer than 10 important predictors and the identity of these variables changes with the forecast horizon. There is a distinct difference in the size and composition of the relevant predictor set before and after mid-1980. Rolling window estimation reveals that the importance of the term and default spreads are recession specific. The Aaa spread is the most robust predictor of recessions three and 6 months ahead, while the risky bond and 5-year spreads are important for 12 months ahead predictions. Certain employment variables have predictive power for the two most recent recessions when the interest rate spreads were uninformative. Warning signals for the post-1990 recessions have been sporadic and easy to miss. The results underscore the challenge that changing characteristics of business cycles pose for predicting recessions.","Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Ng, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",serena.ng@columbia.edu,"Ng, Serena/AAA-1003-2020","Ng, Serena/0000-0003-2684-364X",,,,,46,36,45,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

A maximum likelihood estimation procedure is applied to analyse the Pareto or power law tail of wealth distribution.
