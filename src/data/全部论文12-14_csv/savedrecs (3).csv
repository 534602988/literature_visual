We model the size of two different public programs under the welfare state. We investigate bidimensional voting on the tax rates that determine the allocation of government revenues among transfer payments and old-age pensions. We show that the coalitions formed, the resulting political equilibria, and the demand for redistribution crucially depend on the level of income inequality and mobility.","[Bossi, Luca] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gumus, Gulcin] Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",University of Pennsylvania; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Bossi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 160 McNeil Bldg,3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",boluca@econ.upenn.edu,,"Gumus, Gulcin/0000-0002-9824-6994",,,,,36,4,4,2,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Empirical results reveal three interesting findings. First, incorporating the asymmetric GARCH effect and the oil price shock can substantially improve fitting ability. Second, the GARCH and jump components show very different behaviors during turbulent and stable periods. Third, the effects of current and past oil price shocks differ. The conditional mean, mean of jump size and variance of jump size immediately respond to a current oil price shock A one-period lagged oil price shock, no matter whether positive or negative, can affect the transition probability that the stock market will remain conditional in the next period. Moreover, the effects of lagged positive and negative shocks on transition probabilities are very different. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, happiness has emerged as an alternative indicator of well-being, and research has mainly focused on determining the level of happiness. While it is important to look at the level, the distribution of happiness is also a salient aspect in any evaluation of inequality. There has been a growing interest in the distribution of happiness, although the ordinal nature of the data makes the use of standard inequality measures problematic. Our paper contributes to the literature by exploring the distributions for the U. S. from 1972 to 2010. Based on new methods developed for ordinal data, we are able to overcome the problems associated with ordinality and obtain unambiguous rankings of happiness distributions. We also compute the level of happiness inequality using existing measures based on median centred approaches. Further, we decompose the median based inequality measures of happiness by gender, race, and region.","[Dutta, Indranil] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Foster, James] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of Manchester; George Washington University,"Dutta, I (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Arthur Lewis Bldg 3-010, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",i.dutta@manchester.ac.uk,,"Dutta, Indranil/0000-0003-3488-808X",,,,,32,43,44,4,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Economic models based on production functions typically suggest that China's rapid growth will continue at similarly high rates, but they ignore pressing structural and institutional constraints on its development. Among the problems identified in this paper, we point to an impending demographic shift that will greatly increase the number of economic dependents, the inadequate corporate legal foundation for indigenous private enterprise, and the discriminatory, defective and disruptive system of land tenure. These issues point to a pressing agenda of institutional reform to help China develop in future decades. Reforms have to concentrate on political structures, state efficiency, incentives to educate and train migrant workers, land tenure, and on private enterprise.","[Hodgson, Geoffrey M.] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England; [Huang, Kainan] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan, Peoples R China",University of Hertfordshire; Shandong University,"Hodgson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021",,,,,,68,12,13,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The analysis of each country touches upon the factors that have contributed to the local development of FX borrowing. However, the study focuses on the regulatory measures taken to curb such lending.

Governments that compete with others for factors of production face the incentive to adjust key policy variables such as tax rates to improve their competitive position. Disentangling market-induced and politics-induced changes in competitiveness are not easy, but strongly warranted given current discussions that some Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) Member States should improve their competitive position within the euro area by adjusting policy variables. Increasing country competitiveness is one of the key objectives currently discussed by policy makers in the context of creating an economic union in the euro area, to complement monetary union. We propose a new competitiveness index that captures the dimensions in which politics can influence competitiveness beyond factor price adjustments. Our index shows that the individual components of institutional competitiveness have developed heterogeneously among EMU Member States. To explain these divergent developments, the uneven integration within the European Union Single Market may play a role.

In contrast, we employ a fully dynamic model and show that LPGs robustly facilitate tacit collusion, by reducing a deviating firm's immediate deviation profit. This difference of results is because in a static model, any equilibrium has to be immune from any deviation, including infinitesimal deviation. In a dynamic model, however, one can ignore infinitesimal deviations since firms never have an incentive for such deviations.","Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Liu, QH (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",,,,,,,,27,2,3,3,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

In addition, it is increasingly difficult to identify the right technologies because technologies are increasing in number and complexity. This study proposes a technology selection process integrating the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Delphi method. The former effectively conducts the fuzziness existing in experts' responses and identifies the strength of technology selection criteria and the relationship between the two. The latter provides the main technology alternatives for Taiwan's future photovoltaic industry. Finally, through the two-way linkage between technology selection criteria and main industrial technologies, the technology fields of the photovoltaic industry can be identified. The empirical results indicate that the benefit of a technology is the most important factor among technological selection criteria, and that Taiwan should adopt and develop microcrystalline silicon film multi-junction and amorphous-silicon solar cells as its main industrial technologies. The results may serve to guide industrial technology acquisition and the work of resource allocations on the behalf of government and enterprises. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By following a similar line of reasoning to the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theoremin the deterministic framework, we first show that if a decision scheme satisfies strategy proofness and unanimity, then there is an underlying probabilistic neutrality result which generates an additive coalitional power function. This result is then used to prove that a decision scheme which satisfies strategy proofness and unanimity can be represented as a weak random dictatorship. A weak random dictatorship assigns each individual a chance to be a weak dictator. An individual has weak dictatorial power if the support of the social choice lottery is always a subset of his/her maximal utility set. In contrast to Gibbard's complete characterization of randomdictatorship, we also demonstrate with an example that strategy proofness and unanimity are sufficient but not necessary conditions for a weak random dictatorship.","Univ Bath, Dept Econ & Int Dev, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Nandeibam, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Econ & Int Dev, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",ecssn@bath.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,7,8,1,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

In India, outsourcing has created a new class of high-skill jobs which have increased overall returns to schooling. Existing evidence suggests education may broadly respond to this change.

We merge panel data on school enrollment from a comprehensive school-level administrative dataset with detailed data on Information Technology Enabled Services CITES) center location and founding dates. Using school fixed effects, we find that introducing a new ITES center causes a 5% increase in the number of children enrolled in primary school; this effect is localized to within a few kilometers. We show the effect is driven by English-language schools, consistent with the claim that the impacts are due to changes in returns to schooling, and is not driven by changes in population or income resulting from the ITES center.

It shows that, in some important cases, critics who were successful in arguing that past Fed approaches were responsible for mistakes that caused harm succeeded in making the Fed averse to these approaches. This can explain why the Fed stopped basing monetary policy on the quality of new bank loans, why it stopped being willing to cause recessions to deal with inflation, and why it was temporarily unwilling to maintain stable interest rates in the period 1979-1982. It can also contribute to explaining why monetary policy was tight during the Great Depression. The paper shows that the evolution of policy was much more gradual and flexible after the Volcker disinflation, when the Fed was not generally deemed to have made an error.","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Rotemberg, JJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",jrotemberg@hbs.edu,,,,,,,56,7,7,0,12,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In the second, direct method, we estimate TFP with imported inputs as a state variable in one stage. Both approaches show that the effect of a firm's decision to source intermediates and capital equipment abroad on its TFP depends critically on its capacity to absorb technology, measured by the proportion of skilled labour.","[Augier, Patricia; Dovis, Marion] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Augier, Patricia; Dovis, Marion] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, EHESS, Marseille, France; [Augier, Patricia; Dovis, Marion] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, FEMISE, Marseille, France; [Cadot, Olivier] Univ Lausanne, CEPR, CEPREMAP, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Cadot, Olivier] Univ Lausanne, FERDI, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; University of Lausanne; University of Lausanne,"Augier, P (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France.",patricia.augier@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,63,33,36,1,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The phenomenon is modeled with a pseudo memory-damped accelerator. It is the case of the people, mostly peasants, returning to their homes after leaving them as a consequence of the 1951 Po River flood in Polesine (Italy), of the variation of the number of Revenue Passenger Miles (RPM) in the US after the 2001 September 11(th) terrorist attack in New York, of the number of abortions in Italy following the 1978 law which legalized the abortions and of the embezzlement crimes in Italy during the clean hands period at the end of the last century. We verified that in the four cases the return to normality had similar features: the number of individuals affected by the extreme event had a step-like variation followed by oscillation with decreasing amplitude. The assumption is that the evolution of a market or population may be governed by an equation similar to that of an oscillator including a memory formalism, and that the extreme event is the delta function which generates the Green function. We also show how the memory may stabilize the market or the population, when the perturbation is constant while an increasing perturbation may lead to a crisis. We estimate the parameters characterizing the effects of the extreme event of the 2001 September 11(th) terrorist attack and of the 1978 abortion law in Italy.","[Caputo, Michele] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Fis, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Caputo, Michele] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Sapienza University Rome; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Caputo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Fis, Piazzale A Moro 2, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",mcaputo@g24ux.phys.uniroma1.it,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

India's manufacturing sector is smaller as a share of GDP than that of East Asian countries, even after controlling for GDP per capita. Hence, its contribution to overall GDP growth is modest. Without greater participation of the secondary sector, the argument goes, the country will not be able to develop and become a modern economy. Standard arguments blame the license-permit raj, the small-scale industrial policy, and the labor laws. All these were part of the industrial policy regime instituted after independence. This regime favored the heavy-machinery subsector. We argue that despite its shortcomings and misallocations, the bias towards machinery, metals, chemicals, and other capital- and skilled labor-intensive products allowed Indian manufacturing to accumulate a wide range of capabilities. We show that India's manufacturing sector is more diversified and sophisticated than one would expect given the country's income per capita. This positions India well to continue expanding its exports of other sophisticated products. India's failure, however, lies in not being able to diversify into labor-intensive sectors and generate the type of structural transformation seen in China.

We first analyse the evolution of the global business cycle and present its main properties during global recessions and recoveries. We then consider how the sensitivity of national cycles to the global cycle varies over different phases of the global cycle and depends on country-specific features. Our findings collectively portray an intricate liaison between the global business cycle and national cycles. National business cycles are tightly linked to the global cycle, but the sensitivity of national cycles to the global cycle is much higher during global recessions than expansions. There are significant differences across countries in how they respond to the global cycle as advanced economies appear to be more sensitive to global recessions than are developing economies. Moreover, countries tend to be more sensitive to the global cycle, the more integrated they are to the global economy.","[Kose, M.

These tight lower bounds can be computed quickly, and with minimal hand-crafting. Our focus is on accelerating policy iteration to the point where it can be used in similar computation times to the basic least-squares approach, but in doing so introduce a number of improvements which can be applied to both the least-squares approach and the calculation of upper bounds using the Andersen-Broadie method. The enhancements to the least-squares method improve both accuracy and efficiency. Results are provided for the displaced-diffusion LIBOR market model, demonstrating that our practical policy iteration algorithm can be used to obtain tight lower bounds for cancellable CMS steepener, snowball and vanilla swaps in similar times to the basic least-squares method.

We find more evidence of selective disclosure in 20012002 than in 20062007, when the costs of gathering and disclosing information on school assignments and quality were lower. Furthermore, we find more evidence of strategic behavior among sellers of large single-family units that presumably appeal to families with children. After controlling for school quality, information disclosure does not appear to affect housing prices. Taken together, our results support the findings of the education literature on the importance of school quality capitalization in residential real estate and they provide the first evidence of strategic information disclosure in housing markets.

With human capital, a second potential source of departure from optimality arises, related to education decisions. We propose to recover the Golden Rule of physical and also human capital accumulation. We characterize the optimal policy to decentralize the Golden Rule balanced growth path when there are no constraints for individuals to finance their education investments, and show that it involves education taxes. Also, when the government subsidizes the repayment of education loans, optimal pensions are positive. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The empirical estimation of the degree of selection suffers from a lack of complete and nationally representative data. This paper uses a dataset that addresses both issues: the ENET (Mexican Labor Survey), which identifies emigrants right before they leave and allows a direct comparison to non-migrants. This dataset presents a relevant dichotomy: it shows negative selection for urban Mexican emigrants to the United States for the period 2000-2004 together with positive selection in Mexican emigration out of rural Mexico to the United States in the same period. Three theories that could explain this dichotomy are tested. Whereas higher skill prices in Mexico than in the US are enough to explain half of the negative selection result in urban Mexico, its combination with network effects and wealth constraints fully accounts for positive selection in rural Mexico.

In this paper, we provide an empirical impact assessment of the economic and environmental effects of Portugal's FITs policy to promote RES-E generation. Impact assessment of policy instruments plays a crucial role on decision-making process. For numerical simulations, we make use of a hybrid top-down/bottom-up general equilibrium modeling approach, which represents a reliable tool to analyze the complex interactions between economic, energy, and environmental issues related to energy policies. Numerical simulations confirm the empirical evidence that the FITs policy implemented by Portugal was both an effective and a cost-efficient way to increase the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources and thus to achieve the national RES-E target of 45% in 2010. Results show relatively modest macroeconomic impacts indicating potentially low economic adjustment costs. From an environmental perspective, the deployment of renewable energy source results in significant carbon emissions reductions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a model in which both a multinational firm and its local joint venture partner can ex post engage in costly rent-seeking actions to increase their ex ante agreed upon revenue share. We show that the host country's level of contract enforcement and level of judicial favoritism affect the parties' incentives to contribute to the international joint venture. The model allows us to identify testable hypotheses relating these institutional features with the performance and optimal ownership structure of international joint ventures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence of positively significant two-way relationships between each of the six individual governance indicators and lagged FDI inflows scaled by lagged GDP to confirm that governance is a function of FDI inflows and vice-versa. The overall interpretation of the results is that FDI inflows, IFRS, ownership diffusion and legal framework of a country 'matter' for macro-level governance in a competitive global business environment while FDI inflows are dependent on individual governance indicators and other macro-economic variables to a large extent. Both IFRS and legal origin have no direct link to FDI inflow.

To address potential endogeneity, we rely on a quasi-natural policy experiment in 2004, when the fiscal conditions of local governments became important in determining the actual VAT rebate rates for exports. The empirical findings demonstrate significant and large effects of VAT rebates on export volume. On average, for each percentage point increase in the VAT rebate rate, the amount of exports increased by 13%, which translates into an additional $4.70 of exports for each $1 of export tax rebates paid.

Despite the fact that the share of old employees increases in most developed countries and many establishments apply specific measures for old employees, this is the first large scale study on this topic. We find that the relative productivity contributions of old workers are significantly higher in establishments that provide either specific equipment of work places or age-specific jobs for old workers. In establishments that apply mixed-age working teams the relative productivity contributions of old and of young employees are significantly higher than in establishments without this measure. Working time reductions and specific training for old employees are not associated with higher relative productivity of these employees. Our results suggest that the application of SMOE can contribute to the explanation for two recent findings, the only modest decline of the relative productivity contributions of old workers and the high variance for estimates of age-productivity profiles.

In order to identify age effects, we use the 1994 and 2003 surveys to create synthetic cohorts. Our analysis shows that the modest negative slope of the literacy-age profile in cross-sectional data arises from offsetting ageing and cohort effects. Individuals from a given birth cohort lose literacy skills after they leave school at a rate greater than indicated by cross-sectional estimates. At the same time, more recent birth cohorts have lower levels of literacy. All three countries show similar patterns of skill loss with age, as well as declining literacy across successive cohorts.

This programme aimed to enhance not only access to primary education but also the quality of teaching. This paper examines the effects of the introduction of free primary education on school enrolment and grade achievement. Data from the 2001 Household Budget Survey (HBS), collected just before the reform, and the 2007 HBS, collected 5 years into the programme, are employed to examine these effects. This is done by running a difference-in-difference comparison using a before-and-after comparison for age cohorts that did and did not benefit from the reform. School fee elimination is found to have enhanced enrolment rates significantly with girls, children from poorer families benefiting most. The impact of the reform on grade achievement, however, is found to have been negative, particularly for those living in rural areas and children from poor households. PEDP, thus, created a dilemma as increased opportunities for one set of deserving children went at the expense of opportunities for other, equally deserving children.","[Hoogeveen, Johannes] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Rossi, Mariacristina] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, Turin, Italy; [Rossi, Mariacristina] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy",The World Bank; University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Hoogeveen, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jhoogeveen@worldbank.org,,,,,,,12,8,10,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Three types of shocks are identified based on their impact on commodity prices, global manufactured prices and global economic activity. The first two shocks, a world demand shock and a commodity-market-specific shock, are fairly standard. The third shock, a globalisation shock that may result, for instance, from the increasing importance of China, India and eastern Europe in the global economy, is more novel. The globalisation shock is associated with a decline in manufactured prices, a rise in commodity prices and an increase in global economic activity. Determining the underlying source of variation in the terms of trade is shown to be important for understanding the impact on the Australian economy as all three shocks propagate through the economy in different ways. The relative contribution of each shock to inflation, output, interest rates and the exchange rate has also varied over time. The main conclusion of the article is that a higher terms of trade tends to be expansionary but is not always inflationary. A key result is that the floating exchange rate has provided an important buffer to the external shocks that move the terms of trade.","[Jaaskela, Jarkko P.; Smith, Penelope] Reserve Bank Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Reserve Bank of Australia,"Jääskelä, JP (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank Australia, GPO Box 3947, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",jaaskelaj@rba.gov.au,,,,,,,15,18,23,1,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

Special categories of consumption, such as basic needs, or of goods, such as subsistence goods are seen as extra theoretical baggage that add few, if any, insights. This theoretical orientation has been absorbed into the theory of aggregate demand, but the aggregate theory has a serious problem that is not shared by the individual-level theory: no matter how well-behaved the individual-level demand functions may be, the aggregate-level function can take on almost any form. This result follows from the SMD theorem, named after Sonnenschein, Mantel, and Debreu, who developed the theory; Kirman and Koch strengthened the results, and the SMD-KK theorem poses a fundamental challenge to models linking micro and macroeconomics. A standard response to the aggregation problem is to introduce a representative agent, but this merely sidesteps the problem. We argue that the aggregation problem arises, in part, because of the exclusion of needs from the theory. Specifically, we argue that material needs such as basic needs for energy, water, food, and shelter must be included as theoretical primitives because both the needs and the satisfiers of those needs are universal. We construct a microeconomic model with material needs and show that the form of the aggregate excess demand function is not completely arbitrary, so the SMD-KK theorem does not apply. We discuss the implications of this result. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This paper questions the use of standard income inequality measures (e.g., Gini coefficient) in such studies and shows that income-mobility-based measures are effective in explaining outcomes of social unrest. Analyses of Korean and the United States region-by-year data suggest that crime and suicide rates are better explained by income immobility (i.e., the degree of economic segregation) rather than the inequality aspects of income distribution. The explanatory power improves as a heavier weight is placed on the poor group's degree of immobility.

Key to this mechanism is that policies are implemented under discretion. The government's discretionary incentive to erode the real value of nominal public debt by means of surprise inflation renders inflation expectations and, in further consequence, equilibrium inflation rates highly correlated with the stock of public debt. Debt, in turn, is highly persistent, allowing for tax-smoothing in the face of disturbances. Due to the aforementioned correlation, the persistence in debt carries over to inflation. Our analysis uncovers a non-monotonic effect of nominal rigidities on inflation persistence and shows that government debt under discretion does not display the near random walk property familiar from the Ramsey literature. A calibrated version of the model that incorporates a moderate degree of monopolistic competition and price stickiness is quantitatively consistent with the inflation dynamics experienced in the USA since the Volcker disinflation of the early 1980s.

An exhaustive Chinese panel data set for capital, infrastructure and a sectoral agglomeration index is linked with an economic distance matrix derived from inter-sectoral transactions. The latter matrix can replace the conventional geographic distance matrix from spatial econometrics. The impact through spillovers is mixed-the direct impact passing to related sectors and back to the initial sector itself, and the indirect impact arising from changes in all sectors. The results suggest that (1) economic growth in a sector is driven by spillovers among sectors that are linked through flows of goods and services; economic distance plays a more important role in stimulating productivity spillover than spatial distance; a shorter economic distance transmits a larger productivity spillover between sectors; (2) infrastructure spillover improves labor productivity in linked sectors; (3) agglomeration diseconomies can be partially reduced by infrastructure investment.

The proposed model can be linked to Madison's understanding of the nature of the choice of Chief Magistrate (Madison, James Madison: writings. The Library of America, New York, 1999 [1787]) and Condorcet's work on the so-called Jury Theorem (Condorcet 1994 [1785]). Electoral models use the notion of a Nash Equilibrium. This notion generally depends on a fixed point argument. For deterministic electoral models, there will typically be no equilibrium. Instead we introduce the idea of a preference field, for the society. A condition called half-openess of is sufficient to guarantee existence of a local direction gradient, Even when is not well-defined we can use the idea of the heart for the society. This is an attractor of the set of social moves that can occur. As an application, a stochastic model of elections is considered, and applied to the 2008 presidential election in the United States. In such a stochastic model the electoral origin will satisfy the first order condition for a local Nash equilibrium. We then show how to compute the Hessian of each candidate's vote share function, and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence to the electoral origin, suggesting that there will be a social direction gradient. The origin maximizes aggregrate voter utility and can be interpreted as a fit choice for the polity.","Washington Univ, Ctr Polit Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Schofield, N (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Ctr Polit Econ, Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",schofield.norman@gamil.com,,,,,,,98,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

One reason for this gap might be the high levels of tuition and fees for senior high school. By reducing students' expectations of attending high school, high levels of tuition and fees could be reducing student academic performance in junior high schools. In this paper we evaluate the impacts of a senior high tuition relief program on the test scores of poor rural seventh grade students in China. We surveyed three counties in Shaanxi Province and exploited the fact that, while the counties are adjacent to one another and share similar characteristics, only one of the three implemented a tuition relief program. Using several alternative estimation strategies, including difference-in-differences, propensity score matching and difference-in-differences matching, we find that the tuition program has a statistically significant and positive impact on the mathematics scores of seventh grade students. More importantly, this program is shown to have a statistically significant and positive effect on the poorest students in the treatment group compared to their wealthier peers.","[Chen, Xinxin] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yaojiang] NW Univ Xian, Northwest Social Econ Res Ctr, Xian 710069, Peoples R China; [Mo, Di] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Louvain, Belgium; [Chu, James; Loyalka, Prashant; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Zhejiang Gongshang University; Northwest University Xi'an; KU Leuven; Stanford University,"Shi, YJ (通讯作者)，NW Univ Xian, Northwest Social Econ Res Ctr, Xian 710069, Peoples R China.",chenxx@mail.zjgsu.edu.cn; syj8882002@yahoo.com.cn; di.mo@kuleuven.be; jchu1225@stanford.edu; loyalka@stanford.edu; rozelle@stanford.edu,"Loyalka, Prashant/Y-6174-2018","Chu, James Y./0000-0003-2702-470X",,,,,23,9,12,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2013,21.0,3,,,SI,,80,97,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12023.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,148AB,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319212800006,0

The decision of whether to migrate or not depends on the proportion of highly-skilled workers among the migrants. The migration game exhibits strategic complementarities, which, because of standard coordination problems, lead to multiple equilibria.

Another application lies in the improvement of Monte Carlo schemes, where the Australian approach results in a path-independent method. We also show how the Milevsky and Posner (1998) result on the reciprocal F-approximation for Asian options can be quickly obtained by using the connection to Australian options. Further, we present an analytical (exact) pricing formula for Australian options and adapt a result of Carr et al.

However, this smaller literature has not typically used causal methods in estimating the results. One source of heterogeneity that may play an important role in producing both personality and other non-cognitive skills and labor market outcomes is family background, including genetic endowments. This paper is the first to use sibling differences to estimate the associations between personality on employment and wages and is also able to control for many other sources of heterogeneity, including attractiveness, cognitive ability, schooling, occupation, and other factors. Overall, the findings suggest that personality measures have important associations with labor market outcomes in adulthood and that the results vary considerably by demographic group. The findings also highlight the potential role of extraversion in being associated with favorable labor market outcomes, which has not been documented in many other studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Integration is privately costly but is effective at coordinating production decisions; nonintegration is less costly but coordinates relatively poorly. Output price influences the choice of ownership structure: integration increases with the price level. At the same time, ownership affects output, because integration is more productive than nonintegration. For a generic set of demand functions, equilibrium delivers heterogeneity of ownership and performance among ex ante identical enterprises. The price mechanism transmutes demand shifts into industry-wide reorganizations and generates external effects from technological shocks: productivity changes in some firms may induce ownership changes in others. If the enterprise managers have full title to its revenues, market equilibrium ownership structures are second-best efficient. When managers have less than full revenue claims, equilibrium can be inefficient, with too little integration.

In recent years the study of environmental themes (e.g., carbon emissions) has more and more internalized negative externalities with DEA (data envelopment analysis), and therefore undesirable outputs are jointly produced with desirable outputs. Even though a few research studies look at the status of variables (e.g., undesirable variables), they neglect to consider some input/output variables that are non-proportional at the same time. The purpose of this research is to incorporate both undesirable and non-proportional variables in order to solve for the non-radial output variables that change non-proportionally and the radial input/output variables that could be exchanged proportionally. The results show that the countries' efficiency rankings from 2005 to 2007 when controlling CO2 emissions present more volatility. Almost all European countries are the most efficient, while Japan is the only Asian country with an efficiency score close to 1 in this period. In addition, Germany and New Zealand have become more efficient during this period. All OECD countries are required in the next several years to reduce CO2 emissions by 6.66%-7.49%.

We ask how an adaptation of the familiar 'divide and choose' mechanism (DCM) performs as a protocol for dispute resolution in the absence of an arbitrator. We show that there is a unique equilibrium of the DCM if the parties' von Neumann Morgenstern utilities from the compromise settlement are drawn independently from a concave distribution, or from any Beta-distribution (which need not be concave). Furthermore, for Beta-distributions that concentrate increasing probability mass on high von Neumann Morgenstern utilities of the compromise, the social choice rule implied by the DCM is asymptotically ex post Pareto efficient.

Since two types of individuals are assumed, the poor and the rich, Gini-coefficient is treated in two variables, namely the relative wealth of the poor and the population share of the poor, each having a different effect on economic performance. Particularly in the separating equilibrium, an improvement in the relative wealth of the poor impedes economic growth, but a decline in the population share of the poor enhances economic growth. Furthermore, the current paper combines the Schumpeterian quality improvement model and the neoclassic production function. Thus, the impact of wealth inequality on economic growth is through the supply of human capital as well as the demand for better quality goods. Our results suggest that empirical research on the base of Gini-coefficient cannot generate a general relationship between wealth inequality and economic growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TCR sees regulation as the governance structure of these interactions, and thus, as in standard transaction cost economics, it places emphasis in understanding the nature of the hazards inherent to these interactions. The emphasis on transactional hazards requires a microanalytical perspective, where performance assessment is undertaken within the realm of possible institutional alternative. In that sense, politics becomes fundamental to understanding regulation as the governance of public/private interactions. The paper discusses two fundamental hazards and their organizational implications: governmental and third party opportunism. Both interact to make regulatory processes and outcomes more rigid, formalistic, and prone to conflict than envisioned by relational contracting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical results in this paper are consistent with the learning hypothesis, with coefficients estimated by the instrumental variable (IV) method implying that a household's saving rate increases by 2-3 percentage points if a sibling has been unemployed.

Our dynamic general equilibrium framework integrates incentive based informational frictions with a matching process highlighted by (i) borrowers' endogenous market entry and exit decision (entry frictions) and (ii) time and resource costs necessary to locate credit opportunities (search frictions). A key feature of the incentive compatible loan contract negotiated between borrowers and lenders is the interaction of informational frictions (in the form of moral hazard) with entry and search frictions. We find that the removal of entry barriers can eliminate incentive-based equilibrium credit rationing. More generally, entry and incentive frictions are important in understanding the extent of credit rationing and credit mismatch, while search and incentive frictions are important for understanding credit market breakdown.

In this paper, we offer an agent-based analysis of innovation diffusion which is better suitable for those cases. We explore future scenarios of car engine technology with support of a simulation model. In the model, actor behavior is modeled explicitly on the basis of actor frames and the consequent appraisal of technology options by potential adopters and by suppliers. The model is analytically novel in that it incorporates five feedback loops: interactive learning between suppliers and users, scale and learning economies, endogenous taste formation among consumers, and social learning (attribution of meaning). In the model, consumer decisions influence each other and the supply of innovation by shaping R&D and investment decisions of suppliers. The model is applied to explore future diffusion scenarios of clean vehicles, though it starts with simulating recent historic trends, including the quick diffusion of direct fuel injection systems and slow diffusion of electric vehicles in the last 20 years. It is shown that the success of hybrid electric vehicles critically depends on suppliers shifting towards HEV development and production (resulting in greater supply of HEV models) and on consumers valuing hybrid electric vehicles more than environmentally improved diesel vehicles.","[Dijk, Marc; Kemp, Rene; Valkering, Pieter] ICIS, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Dijk, M (通讯作者)，ICIS, Maastricht, Netherlands.",m.dijk@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Dijk, Marc M/A-6638-2013",,,,,,41,15,16,0,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

(2001, 2002). We find that the open economy framework can bring about more complex dynamics, along with a wider variety of qualitative behaviors and policy responses. Introducing parameters related to the open economy structure affects the values of bifurcation parameters and changes the location of bifurcation boundaries. As a result, the stratification of the confidence region, as previously seen in closed-economy New Keynesian models, remains an important research and policy risk to be considered in the context of the open-economy New Keynesian functional structures. In fact, econometrics and optimal policy design become more complex within an open economy. Dynamical inferences need to be qualified by the risk of bifurcation boundaries crossing the confidence regions. Without adequate prior econometric research, policy design needs to take into consideration that a change in monetary policy can produce an unanticipated bifurcation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Blum, U",,,,"Blum, Ulrich",,,Eastern Germany's economic development revisited: path dependence and economic stagnation before and after reunification,POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Twenty years after reunification Eastern Germany's economy is relatively stagnant compared with most of the productivity and income variables of Western Germany. The strong initial take-off which lasted until the mid to late 1990s ended at a level of 70%80% of the western reference values. In this article two interdependent hypotheses are put to the test: (i) that the communist economy prior to reunification was on a stagnating path, contrary to what standard analyses show; and (ii) that strong elements of path dependence exist and that the switch from a planned to a market economy offset the pre-unification stagnation but was not able to repair structural deficits inherited from the past. In fact, looking into Western Germany's long-term data, an extremely stable development path can be found that extends from the nineteenth century to the present. Thus analysis of the East German development path is both economically relevant and politically interesting if economic policies are to be formulated. A series for East German output is recalculated to describe the macroeconomic development relative to its West German twin. In doing so, assumptions are made about its initial starting point after World War II and the effects which the deterioration of product quality over time, the loss of international competitiveness and the unavailability of foreign goods had on purchasing power. In fact, performance was very bleak and growth halted in the 1970s. This coincides with fundamental changes in the world economy, the confiscation of the remaining parts of the private sector and ever-expanding subsidisation of private consumption. This led, in sharp contrast to findings by other authors, to a decline in real output until the mid 1980s, when fresh money was brought in from the West. In the end, East Germany collapsed at an economic level comparable to that of West Germany in the mid 1950s to early 1960s, depending on whether the external value of goods or internal purchasing power is used as a reference point. In spite of overcoming its low initial starting position during the first years after transition to a market economy began, Eastern Germany has reverted to its old development path extending from the 1950s and the 1960s.","Univ Halle Wittenberg, D-06108 Halle, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Blum, U (通讯作者)，Univ Halle Wittenberg, D-06108 Halle, Germany.",ulrich.blum@wiwi.uni-halle.de,,,,,,,64,5,5,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,MAR 1,2013,25.0,1,,,,,37,58,,10.1080/14631377.2013.756672,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,083GU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314451900003,0

The most difficult aspect of the empirical analysis is the approximation of labour income risk as a proxy variable for future labour income uncertainty. Individual disposable income is interacted alternately with the probability of being unemployed and with the probability of job loss in the next period to generate the labour income risk variables. The econometric results support the precautionary saving hypothesis and labour income risk emerges as one of the main determinants of household saving decisions. Moreover, households implement alternative strategies to smooth out their income streams such as holding a second job and increasing the number of income earners in the family. However, it is evident that they are still vulnerable against labour income risk, which underlines the need for an effective and efficient social security system.","CBRT, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Ceritoglu, E (通讯作者)，CBRT, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",evren.ceritoglu@tcmb.gov.tr,"Ceritoglu, Evren/JDD-6928-2023",,,,,,30,15,15,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Our main findings are, firstly, during election years, the private financial institutions earned higher ROA and loan growth than the government- and foreign-owned. Secondly, government-owned institutions are not affected by current elections for all measures of performance, while foreign institutions significantly earned lower ROA, higher interest margin, and spent higher overhead costs.

To illustrate this hypothesis, I examine three Italian city-states in the period between eleventh and sixteenth centuries. This was a time when the commercial revolution was underway in these city-states. As a result, there were institutional innovations in settlement patterns, work organization, and self-governing institutions to help provide for mutual defense and for the internalization of gains from long-distance trade. I contrast this case study with the methodology and findings employed by Douglass C. North, John J. Wallis, and Barry R. Weingast (2009) in Violence and Social Orders. Rather than analyze the importance of beliefs and the protection of property rights as in prior work of theirs, the authors here focus on the Schumpeterian competition between impersonal organizations as an effective institutional form to control violence. Moreover, the timeframe of their book extends to all recorded human history. In contrast to North, Wallis, and Weingast's approach, I concentrate on Genoa, Florence, and Venice in an effort to explain more effectively the emergence of the public/private divide and the relationship between politics and economics in modern industrial society. Experimentation in medieval Italy in mediating conflict between newly emerging classes, innovating in public finance to support the military, and focusing on broad civic participation in the political process had a lasting impact on the development of the state as an institution.","Marist Coll, Sch Management, Poughkeepsie, NY USA",Marist College,"Davis, AE (通讯作者)，Marist Coll, Sch Management, Poughkeepsie, NY USA.",,,"davis, ann/0000-0002-5356-0517",,,,,119,3,3,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

To that end, the paper first investigates the long-run equilibrium relationship and then employs Granger causality analysis. Results of the bounds test for cointegration within the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) modelling approach of Pesaran . (2001) reveal level relationship between the diverse private capital inflows, EMP and REER. Granger causality analysis suggests that there is a unidirectional causality running from all the concerned private capital inflows and EMP to REER. The ARDL model shows first that the impact of bank liabilities and portfolio investment liabilities are almost equal, high and positive. Second, foreign direct investment and workers' remittances have a negative but statistically insignificant effect. Third, EMP mitigates REER appreciation of the currency in Turkey. The empirical results suggest that speculative portfolio investment liabilities but particularly bank liabilities with short maturities should be better managed; more flexibility should be introduced to the floating exchange rate regime to avoid loss of competitiveness related with capital inflows; whereas foreign direct investments and remittances should be encouraged.","Marmara Univ, European Union Inst, Dept European Union Econ, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey",Marmara University,"Ersoy, I (通讯作者)，Marmara Univ, European Union Inst, Dept European Union Econ, Goztepe Campus, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey.",iersoy@marmara.edu.tr,"Ersoy, İmre/AAL-9221-2020",,,,,,35,3,5,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The results indicate that the introduction of futures contracts in the French electricity market, as well as the launch of the joint futures market in these countries in 2009, has decreased spot price volatility. However, this effect was not as explicit for the German market, due to data specificities. Other interesting results are: the German market dominates and leads the long run price relationship; the impact of cooling needs on demand is greater than the impact of heating needs; there is a substantial systematic pattern of electricity prices and their respective volatilities during weekdays and holidays.

We show that capital accumulation facilitates intertemporal consumption smoothing and significantly reduces the volatility of the real exchange rate. Nonetheless, monetary and investment-specific technology (IST) shocks still induce more real exchange rate volatility and less consumption comovement than productivity shocks (with or without capital). We find that endogenous persistence is particularly sensitive to the inertia of the monetary policy rule even with persistent exogenous shocks. However, irrespective of whether capital is present, productivity and IST shocks trigger highly persistent real exchange rates, whereas monetary shocks do not. Moreover, we point out that IST shocks tend to generate countercyclical real exchange rates-unlike productivity or monetary shocks-but have the counterfactual effect of also producing excessive investment volatility and countercyclical consumption.","[Martinez-Garcia, Enrique] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX 75201 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Martínez-García, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",enrique.martinez-garcia@dal.frb.org,"Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/AAH-7320-2019","Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/0000-0001-5736-361X",,,,,47,7,7,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This paper looks at the effects of such a policy on CO2 emissions from the electricity sector, the mix of technologies used to supply electricity, electricity prices, and regional flows of clean energy credits. The CES leads to a 30% reduction in cumulative CO2 emissions between 2013 and 2035 and results in dramatic reductions in generation from conventional coal.

I put forward a model of credit frictions to show that if financial integration exceeds financial deepening, productivity will fall, generating a slump as relatively unproductive firms in the non-tradables sector expand at the expense of more productive tradables firms.

It is shown that this approach nests both the traditional error correction model - where no weight is given to deviations from the steady state prior to the most recent period - and the error correction model based on the idea of multicointegration. The form of accumulation presented here does not change the order of integration of the series, as is the case in the multicointegration approach of Granger and Lee (1989). Furthermore, it is very parsimonious as only one or two parameters more have to be estimated. The assumption of geometrically decreasing weights can be tested by estimating the model in its unrestricted form. Based on this new model type, the relationship between private consumption and real disposable income of private households in the US is estimated. The short-term forces which set off the most recent period's deviations are much smaller than would be suggested by a VEC and a conventional single equation ECM, and the income elasticity is lower as well. The proposed model outperforms the other two with respect to its forecasting power. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In option pricing, this has been used to fit risk-neutral asset price distributions to the implied volatility smile, ensuring an arbitrage-free interpolation of implied volatilities across exercise prices. However, the existing literature is restricted to truncating the series expansion after the fourth moment. This paper presents an option pricing formula in terms of the full (untruncated) series and discusses a fitting algorithm, which ensures that a series truncated at a moment of arbitrary order represents a valid probability density. While it is well known that valid densities resulting from truncated Gram/Charlier Series A expansions do not always have sufficient flexibility to fit all market-observed option prices perfectly, this paper demonstrates that option pricing in a model based on these densities is as tractable as the (far less flexible) original model of Black and Scholes (1973), allowing non-trivial higher moments such as skewness, excess kurtosis and so on to be incorporated into the pricing of exotic options: Generalising the Gram/Charlier Series A approach to the multiperiod, multivariate case, a model calibrated to standard option prices is developed, in which a large class of exotic payoffs can be priced in closed form. Furthermore, this approach, when applied to a foreign exchange option market involving several currencies, can be used to ensure that the volatility smiles for options on the cross exchange rate are constructed in a consistent, arbitrage-free manner.

This study also shows that for a developing country the institutional and policy rent is more important than other two indices that curb political rents and those that reduce transaction risks. This study also highlights the positive complementarities between index of political rents and index of risk-reducing technologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Training programs during unemployment mitigate these losses but also affect the unemployed's willingness to search. This paper analyzes how mandatory training programs affect the optimal design of unemployment insurance and how the training intensity should evolve during the unemployment spell. The introduction of training reverses the optimal consumption dynamics during the unemployment spell and makes it optimal to incentivize the long-term unemployed to find employment despite the depreciation of their human capital. Targeting training programs towards the long-term unemployed, however, is optimal only if the fall in human capital upon displacement is small relative to the depreciation during unemployment.

To that end, we develop a partial transmission input output model that captures the uniqueness of the Chinese market. We hypothesize and simulate price control, market factors and technology substitution - the three main factors that restrict the functioning of a price pass-through mechanism during oil-price shocks. Using the models of both China and the US, we separate the impact of price control from that of other factors leading to China's price stickiness under oil-price shocks. The results show a sharp contrast between China and the US, with price control in China significantly preventing oil-price shocks from spreading into its domestic inflation, especially in the short term. However, in order to strengthen the economy's resilience to oil-price shocks, the paper suggests a gradual relaxing of price control in China. (C) 2012 Society for Policy Modeling.

We develop a formal model of an innovation arising from the combination of two existing modules, with the objective to optimize the net benefits of diversity. The model takes into account increasing returns to scale and the effect of diversification of investments on the probability of emergence of a third option. We obtain analytical solutions describing the dynamic behaviour of the values of the options. Next, diversity is optimized by trading off the benefits of recombinant innovation and returns to scale. We derive conditions for optimal diversity under different regimes of returns to scale. Threshold values of returns to scale and the recombination probability define regions where either specialization or diversity is the best choice. When the investment time horizon is beyond a threshold value, a diversified investment strategy is the best choice. This threshold will be larger for higher returns to scale. This problem is relevant to allocation of scarce funds by governments, research councils, firms and investors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We do not find any overall difference in the chances of finding employment between private placement agencies and the PES, but this hides important heterogeneities across different types of unemployed.

We also present a model which estimates the satisfaction function and reference point simultaneously. When pooling the data across individuals, we find an S-shaped satisfaction function in which the reference point depends on past payments, social comparisons, and subjective expectations. There is mixed evidence of loss aversion. At the individual level, there is substantial variation in satisfaction function shapes, although the S-shape is common.

The study discusses one of the mechanisms that may generate such biases, based on the extrapolation of information from endogenous reference groups, and presents some suggestive evidence that this mechanism has significant explanatory power. The impact of these biased perceptions on attitudes toward redistributive policies is studied by means of an experimental design that was incorporated into the survey, which provided consistent information on the own-ranking within the income distribution to a randomly selected group of respondents. The evidence suggests that those who had overestimated their relative position and thought that they were relatively richer than they were tend to demand higher levels of redistribution when informed of their true ranking.

Countries have varying degrees of similarity in their factor endowment ratios, and are subject to aggregate productivity shocks. Risk-averse consumers can insure against these shocks by investing their wealth at home and abroad. In a many-good setup, the change in factor prices after a positive shock in a particular country provides insurance to countries that have dissimilar factor endowment ratios, but is bad news for countries with similar factor endowment ratios, since their incomes will worsen. Therefore countries with similar relative factor endowments have a stronger incentive to invest in one another for insurance purposes than countries with dissimilar endowments. The importance of this effect depends on the size of countries. Empirical evidence linking bilateral international equity investment positions to a proxy for relative factor endowments supports our theory: the similarity of host and source countries in their relative capitallabor ratios has a positive effect on the source countrys investment position in the host country. The effect of similarity is enhanced by the size of host countries.","[Cunat, Alejandro] Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Fons-Rosen, Christian] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Fons-Rosen, Christian] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",University of Vienna; Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics,"Cuñat, A (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",alejandro.cunat@univie.ac.at; christian.fons-rosen@upf.edu,"; Fons-Rosen, Christian/C-7426-2013","Cunat, Alejandro/0000-0003-4828-704X; Fons-Rosen, Christian/0000-0003-2620-7205",ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,38,1,1,0,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We develop a model of criminal subcultures in which people gain social status among their peers for being tough by committing criminal acts. As zero-tolerance keeps relatively gutless people from committing a minor offense, the signaling value of that action increases, which makes it attractive for some people who would otherwise commit more severe crime. If social status is sufficiently important in criminal subcultures, zero-tolerance reduces crime across the board.","[Dur, Robert] Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Van der Weele, Joel] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, Frankfurt, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Dur, R (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",dur@ese.eur.nl; vdweele@econ.uni-frankfurt.de,"Dur, Robert/J-4142-2012","Dur, Robert/0000-0001-9081-4179; van der Weele, Joel/0000-0002-1855-9289",,,,,49,10,12,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In our setting, the already given party ideological predispositions and power distribution determine the expected policy outcome. Our analysis applies to the case of un-enforced or enforced party discipline as well as to two-party and multi-party (proportional representation) electoral systems. The interest groups' objective is to influence the outcome in their favor by engaging in a contest that determines the final decision in the legislature. Our first result clarifies how the success of an interest group hinges on the dominance of its ideologically closer party and, in general, the coalition/opposition blocks of parties under un-enforced party or coalition/opposition discipline. Such dominance is defined in terms of ideological inclination weighted by power. Our second result clarifies how the success of an interest group hinges on the dominance of its ideology in the ruling coalition (party) in a majoritarian system with enforced coalition (party) discipline. We then clarify under what condition an interest group prefers to direct its lobbying efforts to two parties or the two coalition and opposition blocks of parties under un-enforced discipline rather than to the members of the ruling coalition (party) under enforced discipline. The lobbying efforts under un-enforced and enforced party discipline are also compared.

Based on a dynamic general equilibrium model foreign debt positions of European crisis countries are shown to have significantly diverged from a sustainable path. Today, high foreign debt positions prove difficult to reverse given appreciated real exchange rates and high real interest rates. Real depreciations in European crisis countries, while necessary for long-term crisis resolution, further worsen foreign debt sustainability by raising the real value of debt in the short-term. To prevent a debtdeflation spiral the real interest burden should be reduced and the real value of debt should be capped.","[Koerner, Finn Marten] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ctr Transnat Studies ZenTra, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Zemanek, Holger] Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Leipzig University,"Körner, FM (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ctr Transnat Studies ZenTra, V03-W322,Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",koerner@zen-tra.de; zemanek@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,"Körner, Finn Marten/D-3335-2015",,,,,,17,6,6,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Also, the analysis uses a novel approach to take into account the possibility that physical distances can act as a barrier to economic and technological interactions amongst countries, by embedding a measure of geographical distance into two specific channels: international trade and FDI.

This is in apparent conflict with neoclassical theory, according to which trade should decrease the relative return on the relatively scarce factor, and thus decrease the skill premium in skill-scarce developing countries. We develop a simple model of trade with talent heterogeneity and capital market imperfections, and show that trade can increase the skill premium in a skill-scarce South that opens up to a skill-abundant North, both in the short run as well as in the long run. We show that trade has two effects: it reduces the skilled wage, and therefore drives non talented agents out of the skilled labor force. It also reduces the cost of subsistence, thereby allowing the talented offspring of unskilled workers to go to school. This compositional effect has a positive effect on the observed skill premium, potentially strong enough to outweigh the decrease in the skilled wage. In our framework, trade liberalization may trigger an increase in the skill-premium in both the North and the South. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the role played by MNCs' corporate culture in affecting employees' orientation toward KS behaviors seems to be unclear. Some authors have focused on the impact of countries' institutional environments on moving practices within MNCs, while others have argued that KS is more likely to occur when the organizations involved are culturally compatible. Nevertheless, the role played by MNCs' organizational culture has not received sufficient attention in the management literature yet. To fill this gap, this paper builds on the relevance of knowledge assets in providing competitive advantage in dynamic economies. In order to outperform rivals in today's high-velocity markets, firms need to put in place appropriate knowledge management activities that are essential to speed learning processes, that is, to be able to rapidly adapt to evolution. In this regard, KS is considered a key process through which employees can gain access to the organizational intellectual capital and contribute to the firm's innovativeness and competitiveness. KS processes are particularly relevant in MNCs. By operating in more than one country, MNCs provide an effective organizational vehicle by which to transfer knowledge as they are seen as networks that create, access, and share knowledge across national boundaries. Building on prior literature, we attempt to study how KS processes occur within multinational enterprises, by focusing on the antecedents of such processes. In particular, we investigate the impact of both MNCs' corporate culture-distinguished in four different typologies, that is, innovative, competitive, bureaucratic, and community culture-and the employees' perceptions of top management support toward two dimensions of KS, that is, knowledge donating and knowledge collecting. To test our hypotheses, we analyze survey data drawn from a sample of 396 employees working in six MNCs operating in Italy. Our findings show that the four types of MNCs' organizational culture may differently affect KS sub-processes. This evidence is consistent with the argument that the two KS dimensions have different natures and, as such, may be influenced by different kinds of factors. We also found top management support to strongly and positively affect both KS dimensions.","[Cavaliere, Vincenzo] Univ Florence, Sch Business, Dept Business Adm, Florence, Italy; [Lombardi, Sara] LUISS Guido Carli Univ, Dept Business & Management, Rome, Italy",University of Florence; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Lombardi, S (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli Univ, Dept Business & Management, Rome, Italy.",vincenzo.cavaliere@unifi.it; slombardi@luiss.it,,,,,,,40,3,5,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,82,90,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000010,0

(1995) and Burdett and Smith (2002) to an environment where the link between education and job destruction is taken into account. This enables us to study how a European-type Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) with heavily regulated long-term contracts and more flexible short-term contracts affects the return to schooling, equilibrium unemployment and welfare. In this context, we show that firing costs and temporary employment have opposite effects on the rate of use of human capital and thus, on educational investments. We furthermore demonstrate that a laissez-faire economy with no regulation is inefficient as it is characterized by insufficient educational investments leading to excess job destruction and inadequate job creation. By stabilizing employment, firing costs could spur educational investments and therefore lead to gains in welfare and productivity, though a first-best policy would be to subsidize education. However, there is little chance that a rise in firing costs in a dual (European-type) EPL context would raise the incentives to schooling and aggregate welfare. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The definition of shift contagion of Forbes and Rigobon (2001) and their adjusted correlation analysis (Forbes and Rigobon, 2002) have gained a lot of attention but the later faces the problem of ad hoc determination of the crisis periods and the issue of volatility adjustment. The aim of this paper is to elaborate the weaknesses of the method of Forbes and Rigobon and to provide a modification of their test that addresses these issues. To achieve this, a moving-window approach of Forbes and Rigobon's (2002) method is proposed, by splitting the moving-windows into two equally sized sub-windows. We then apply the modified method to examine whether there was a (shift) contagion in the stock markets of five Eurozone countries (namely France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Spain) in the time period from December 2003 to January 2012. We found that shift contagion has played an important role in the propagation of shocks in the investigated stock markets during the crises. The start of the Greece's debt crisis in May 2010 coincided with contagion from the Ireland's, Italy's, and Spain's stock markets to the stock markets of France and Germany. Similar episodes of contagion were indentified around the Middle East financial crisis, at the end of 2006 and the start of 2007. The global financial crisis coincided with contagion from the Italy's and Spain's to the German stock market, while the Ireland's debt crisis with contagion from the Ireland's to the German stock market. The results of the paper have important implications for the investors in these stock markets. In the mainstream financial literature it has been recognized that international diversification reduces the total risk of a portfolio. This is due to nonperfect positive co-movement between returns of the portfolio assets. Increased co-movement between asset returns, identified during financial market turmoil, therefore can diminish the advantage of internationally diversified investment portfolios. The contagion analysis is also important for financial sector supervisory authorities and the monetary policy as different policy actions may be successful when the increase in co-movement between financial markets is a result of contagion or a result of a change in interdependence between the markets.","Univ Maribor, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,26,3,3,0,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Regarding megacities, informal sector growth undercuts the government's capacity to fund fully adequate public services. Regarding the Eurozone, an increase in the relative size of the periphery will under the government's balanced-budget constraint undercut the provision of public safety-net and infrastructure services. And if low-wage production is initiated in the European periphery, the core is likely to collapse. Urbanization is decisive because it is so expensive. The difference between the costs of urban development and rural development does not turn on comparing the capital required for factories and that required for farms. Each of these is a small part of total investment, and the difference per head is not always in favor of industry. The difference turns on infrastructure.

The relationship between Real Exchange Rate (RER) volatility and the degree of price convergence is examined within a panel data context. The city-pair and goods selected provide a unique experiment in which distance, tradability and industry considerations are set aside and the extent of RER volatility is the only factor to influence price convergence. We find nonmonotonic relationships between mean reversion and RER volatility: very fast adjustments for both low and high volatility panels of goods (between 1 and 2 months) and slower half-lives (between 3 and 4 months) at moderate levels of uncertainty. These figures are, however, substantially smaller than the 6 or 7 months reported in previous research for general US-Mexico goods, suggesting the very strong price convergence observed along the US-Mexican border.","[Mollick, Andre Varella] Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Fullerton, Thomas M., Jr.] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Econ & Finance, El Paso, TX 79968 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Mollick, AV (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Econ & Finance, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",amollick@utpa.edu,"Fullerton, Thomas M./R-4946-2019; Fullerton, Thomas/AAF-9255-2020; Mollick, Andre/AAP-2699-2020","Fullerton, Thomas/0000-0002-5820-0713;",,,,,43,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I test whether voucher-school competition (1) improves student outcomes and (2) has stronger effects when public schools face a hard-budget constraint. Since both voucher-school competition and the degree of hardness of the budget constraint for public schools are endogenous to public school quality, I exploit (i) the interaction of the number of Catholic priests in 1950 and the institution of the voucher system in Chile in 1981 as a potentially exogenous determinant of the supply of voucher schools and (ii) a particular feature of the electoral system that affects the identity of the mayors of different counties (who manage public schools) as a source of exogenous variation in the degree of hardness of the public schools' budget constraints. Using this information, I find that (1) an increase of one standard deviation of the ratio of voucher-to-public schools increases test scores by just around 0.10 standard deviations; and (2) the effects are significantly bigger for public schools facing more binding minimum enrollment levels.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago Na, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Gallego, F (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago Na, Chile.",fgallego@alum.mit.edu,"Gallego, Francisco/E-5485-2015","Gallego, Francisco/0000-0002-2252-891X",,,,,43,9,14,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Hence, offshoring has contributed to a widening of the wage gap between skilled and less skilled workers.

Also, there have been many studies of the consequences of various forms of uncertainty. However, exploration of the nexus between economic uncertainty and corruption appears scarce. After providing an intuitive and heuristic linkage between general economic uncertainty and corruption, this article uses a large cross-country data set to augment a fairly standard model with simple proxies for uncertainty and to investigate how economic uncertainty might affect the prevalence of corruption. In addition, a quantile-regression framework is used to judge how the strength of various covariates may differ with the level of corruption. Seven main points emerge from the estimates. First, economic uncertainty is associated positively with corruption, and the relation seems to be robust across measures of uncertainty and corruption. Second, quantile-regression estimates indicate considerable parametric heterogeneity across the distribution of corruption. Third, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita has the expected corruption-mitigating role. Fourth, increased political rights and civil liberties also appear to lower corruption. Fifth, greater government consumption is associated with lower corruption. Sixth, while the hyperinflation dummy lacks significance in most OLS regressions, its significance varies across the distribution of corruption. Seventh, neither police force nor government subsidies shows significance, but transition economies have more corruption.","[Goel, Rajeev K.; Ram, Rati] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Illinois State University,"Ram, R (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 4200, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",rram@ilstu.edu,"Goel, Rajeev K/HPD-3780-2023","Goel, Rajeev/0000-0001-9580-3196",,,,,26,27,32,3,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, does mother's autonomy influence the quality of child healthcare and, second, which is related to the first, whether mother's autonomy reduces the apparent gender bias in child healthcare. Using household survey data from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in India the article finds that for the most part as the mother's autonomy (measured several different ways) increases, the quality of care for children improves. The results also indicate that gender bias exists in the provision of quality healthcare for children. Male children generally receive better quality care. However, for several measures of female autonomy, an increase in such autonomy reduces the bias. The results of this analysis have important policy implications and provide additional insight into the state of affairs of children's health in rural India.","[Grabowski, Richard] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Self, Sharmistha] Missouri State Univ, Dept Econ, Springfield, MO 65897 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; Missouri State University,"Grabowski, R (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Faner Hall, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",ricardo@siu.edu,,,,,,,31,6,8,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

About 22,000 NGOs are working in Bangladesh with a view to developing the socio-economic conditions of the people. Knowledge transfer is a crucial element of the Knowledge Management (KM) process. Successful knowledge absorption by the recipients of the knowledge is an indication of a successful knowledge transfer. The NGO beneficiaries are the main actors who are engaged in receiving and absorbing the knowledge transferred by the NGOs. So it is imperative to know the knowledge absorption capacity of the beneficiaries. This study follows a multi-stage sampling procedure. Fourteen NGOs (7 large and 7 small of the NGO Affairs Bureau enlisted NGOs) from each administrative division of Bangladesh are purposefully selected. Fifty-four semi-structured interviews consisting of top, middle and lower levels based on the salary grades (18 interviewees from each level) were conducted. Simultaneously, Thirty-five questionnaires were also administered among the beneficiaries (5 from each administrative division, e.g. 5X7=35). Content analysis technique is used to analyse the interview transcript. The study reveals that female beneficiaries are more capable of absorbing knowledge than male beneficiaries. The study also finds that females of the age group 36-55 years have more knowledge absorption capacity than groups of below 20 and 21-35 years. This research has been carried out on enlisted NGOs (e.g. foreign fund recipients) in Bangladesh. Future researchers may carry out a similar study with non-foreign fund recipient NGOs.

Surprisingly, the empirical reality remains an almost complete mystery. In this paper, the very recent data on income inequality as well as indicators of the social inequalities (In the sense of fair access to health care and education) have been used to examine this controversial issue. Since these data do not come yet in a satisfactorily long time series, the cross-sectional analysis remains the only option for the research. On the other hand, the process of globalization has been analyzed and quantified by the Swiss Economic Institute Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF) back to 1980 for most of the countries which makes It possible to apply the longitudinal analysis. This article combines both to search for the impact that the pace of globalization may have In the developing countries. The conclusions are rather surprising: The pace of globalization has very weak (but still significant) positive impact on income Inequalities In the sample of 87 developing countries, but it has quite strong negative impact on social Inequalities In these economies. Thus, the overall effect on reduction of human development due to income and social inequalities is the strongest in the countries that globalized themselves slowly in the previous two decades, while those that globalized their economies faster enjoy now more equalized societies (mainly in the sense of equal access to health care and education).","[Kocourek, Ales] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,ales.kocourek@tul.cz,"Kocourek, Ales/HKW-2602-2023","Kocourek, Ales/0000-0002-5880-7515",,,,,23,5,5,0,7,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,297,306,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300031,0

The model interprets regional differences in constant quality wages and rents as compensating firms and residents for inter-regional differences in amenities. This paper extends the Roback model to allow for moving costs which vary among a city's residents and businesses. This modification of the model generates new interpretations of regional differences in rents and wages. The theoretical results suggest that the interpretation of inter-city rent and wage differentials as compensating is misguided, that such differentials are inappropriate as weights in Quality of Life (QOL) comparisons, and stresses the importance of local housing market parameters in the determination of these differentials. The importance of amenities is retained, but housing supply becomes the main other determinant of regional rents. Housing supply was ignored in the literature following on Roback's initial insight. We show that interactions between amenities and housing supply will bias QOL rankings. Finally, we support the empirical importance of heterogeneous moving costs by demonstrating the effects of exogenous supply constraints on local housing prices.

The given risks arise mainly from its lower economic level and possible internal or external imbalance. The unified internal market, as it is also seen from experience of the countries which entered the EU in the earlier years, tends to deepen the imbalance unless it is eliminated by external (often administrative) interference. One of the basic indicators characterising the internal economic imbalance is also a deficit of public budgets which is subsequently reflected in public indebtedness of the country. Many member states of the European Union have already been facing the problems connected with deficit and public indebtedness for a number of years, which also proves complexity of a solution of this problem. Moreover, in past 4 years the development of public finances in these countries has also been influenced by the current financial and economic crisis the impacts of which deteriorated significantly the budget situation in these countries and some of them were even brought to the verge of bankruptcy. The main aim of this contribution is therefore assessment of the development of the basic parameters of public finances, level of the deficit of the public budgets and public debt in the Czech Republic in relation to the other member countries of the European Union.

This article discusses theory and evidence that suggest that this standard model is too simple to capture the long-run labor market impact of immigration. A level of capital-skill complementarity supported in studies both involving and not involving immigration alone reduces the relative wage impact of immigration by 40% compared to simulations with separable capital. Other models in which the production structure responds to skill-mix changes, including models with endogenous choice of technique, directed technical change, or human capital spill-overs, also imply that the long-run impact of immigration on wages is smaller than predicted by the standard model. This article discusses new research that tries to credibly evaluate such models using immigration-induced variation in the skill mix, an approach with further potential, and evidence that immigration impacts innovation and firm formation.","[Lewis, Ethan] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Lewis, Ethan] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lewis, E (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",ethan.g.lewis@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,96,26,30,2,19,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4605-8,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Digital signal transmission permits broadcasters to offer greater programming variety, which makes televisions more valuable to consumers. Similarly, the presence of adapters on televisions enables compatibility with a multitude of complementary devices, also increasing consumers' values of televisions.

First, we allow evolutionary path of per capita income to contain stochastic shocks which may not converge fast enough to the long-run mean. Under this condition, we show that the conventional inference on sigma convergence can be enlarged with more predictive power if one assumes, along with the necessary condition of beta convergence, that the stochastic shocks are covariance stationary. Second, we argue that for economies to (conditionally) converge, they need to be sufficiently cohesive so that the growth of stochastic shocks is not sustained through complex socio-economic interactions. Empirical examination is carried out by analyzing time series properties of state per capita income in India and performing convergence analysis by conditioning a constructed social cohesion index based on indicators collected from the National Sample Survey. It is demonstrated that when the economy faces monotonic social segmentation, persistence of stochastic shocks considerably affects speed of per capita output convergence. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from Seven West African Countries,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BUSINESS; FAMILIES,"This paper aims at highlighting the debate on firm heterogeneity in the informal sector by testing whether entrepreneurial familial background impacts informal businesses outcomes in the West African context. In the USA, a literature aiming at understanding the high intergenerational correlation of the self-employed status shows that children of self-employed have better business performance than children of wage earners. However, it is not obvious that this result could be generalised to developing countries. Using 1-2-3 surveys collected in the commercial capitals of seven West African countries in 200102, this paper shows that children of self-employed, who own an informal business, do not have better business outcomes than children of wage earners, except when they choose a familial tradition in the same sector of activity. Thus, in the West African context, having a self-employed father seems not sufficient for the transmission of valuable skills and does not provide any advantage in terms of value added or sales if the activity is different from that of the father. On the other hand, informal entrepreneurs who have chosen a specific enterprise based on familial tradition have a competitive advantage. Their competitive advantage is partly explained by the transmission of enterprise-specific human capital, acquired through experiences in the same type of activity and by the transmission of social capital that guarantees a better clientele and a reputation.","Univ Paris 09, UMR DIAL IRD 225, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Pasquier-Doumer, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, UMR DIAL IRD 225, Paris, France.",pasquier@dial.prd.fr,,"Pasquier-Doumer, Laure/0000-0002-1721-5070",,,,,36,12,15,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The results show that foreign firms with production connected to global value chains enjoy higher export intensity than national firms even when controlled for age. Also, foreign firms with access to superior support from parent plants enjoy higher technology capability than national firms even after controlling for age. The Levene's two-tail 't' tests show that foreign firms also enjoyed higher human resource, process technology and adaptive capabilities than national firms. Foreign firms are also larger and pay higher wages than national firms. The results show that foreign firms' superior market access and technological capabilities can offer the potential for knowledge spillover to national firms provided the government stabilizes the political situation and strengthens the basic and high technology infrastructure in Myanmar. Unlike the Maquiladoras of Latin America, not only that a quarter of the inputs are sourced by garment firms from Myanmar, a handful of national firms have already acquired the export and technological capabilities to compete with foreign firms.","[Rasiah, Rajah; Myint, Myo Myo] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm Bldg, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Rasiah, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm Bldg, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",rajah@um.edu.my,"Rasiah, Rajah/X-9122-2019; RASIAH, RAJAH/B-9552-2010","RASIAH, RAJAH/0000-0002-6654-3011",,,,,55,10,11,0,23,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

They dictate behaviour of members of the organization. Therefore, organizational values are a key element of organizational culture. The purpose of this paper is to present results from survey of the organisational values of Lithuanian police organization which is going through the process of organizational transfomation. That is why it is so important to identify how oficially expressed values, goals and norms of organization are shared among the members of the organization. A questionnaire was developed and 199 Kaunas city headquarters officers were interviewed. 21 police organizational values were based on Glomseth, R., Gottschalk, P., Hole A. S. (2010) police personnel occupational values. This paper analyzes the employees' perception about the dominant and less important occupational values. The results of the survey show that police officers highlighted such professional values as time being firm, task orientation versus relation, security and integrity rather than effectiveness and productivity, formal communication preferable to informal, control rather than freedom, hierarchy rather than equality and empowerment, firm leadership and tradition versus changes. The hierarchy of occupational values shows that the organization is fully formalized, and its activity is controlled and planned. Status impact on the perception of value was determined - although employees similarly perceive organizational values, there are more similarities among proffesionals and managers than between first line officers and managers.","[Ruibyte, Laima; Adamoniene, Ruta] Mykolas Romeris Univ, LT-4424 Kaunas, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University,"Ruibyte, L (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, V Putvinskio St 70, LT-4424 Kaunas, Lithuania.",laimaruibyte@mruni.eu; rutadam@mruni.eu,"Adamonienė, Rūta/V-6784-2019",,,,,,29,7,9,2,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It is also disputed whether event promoters benefit from scalper participation or not. Our article explores two questions: can promoters benefit from scalpers' activities and what are the resulting consumer welfare effects? We address these questions by developing a three period game where the secondary market is supported by an auction mechanism, interacting with primary market decisions. We find that participation by scalpers can lead to underpricing in the primary market and that this may benefit small or credit-constrained promoters. This requires the scalper's discount factor to be higher than the promoter's discount factor. The necessary premium on the discount factor increases with the fraction of early buyers and decreases with market size. Finally, the effect of scalper participation on aggregate consumer welfare is shown to be positive for a large enough market size or discount rate for the scalper.","[Sa, Nelson; Turkay, Evsen] Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, Poughkeepsie, NY 12603 USA",Vassar College,"Sá, N (通讯作者)，Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, 124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, NY 12603 USA.",nesa@vassar.edu; evturkay@vassar.edu,,"Sa, Nelson/0000-0002-4406-2807",,,,,30,1,1,8,29,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We challenge the applicability of standard decision-theoretic models to social settings. In an experiment where choices affect the payoffs of someone else, we find that a large fraction of subjects prefer randomization over any of the deterministic outcomes. This tendency prevails whether the other party knows about the choice situation or not. Such randomization violates standard decision theory axioms that require that lotteries are never better than their best deterministic component. For conceptually similar choices in classical non-social situations, we do not find much evidence for such violations, suggesting the need for theories of uncertainty that are targeted to social settings.","[Sandroni, Alvaro] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Ludwig, Sandra] Univ Ulm, Inst Econ, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Kircher, Philipp] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Kircher, Philipp] London Sch Econ, London, England",Northwestern University; Ulm University; University of Edinburgh; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sandroni, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",Sandroni@kellogg.northwestern.edu; sandra.ludwig@uni-ulm.de; p.kircher@lse.ac.uk,"Sandroni, Alvaro/KCY-0041-2024","Sandroni, Alvaro/0000-0001-7139-587X",,,,,61,13,14,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This article examines the effect of temporary benefit extensions using a Regression Discontinuity (RD) approach that addresses the endogeneity of benefit extensions and labour market conditions. Using data from the 1991 recession, the results indicate that the Stand-by Extended Benefit (SEB) program has a significant, although somewhat limited, impact on county unemployment rates and the duration of unemployment. The results suggest that the temporary nature of SEB benefit extensions may mitigate their effect on search behaviour.","Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA",Loyola University Maryland,"Schwartz, J (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 4501 N Charles St,Sellinger 315, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA.",jsschwartz1@loyola.edu,,,,,,,33,5,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The originality of these simulations holds in using an aggregate indicator of morbidity-mortality, capturing vital risk and making it possible to adapt the quantification of life expectancies by taking into account the presence of severe chronic pathologies. We forecast future national drugs expenditure, under different epidemiological scenarios of chronic morbidity: trend scenario, healthy ageing scenario and medical progress scenario.

The purpose of the work is to determine the factors that explain the insurance service purchase decision of the Lithuanian citizens. To this end, a structured 5-point Likert scale questionnaire-based survey is employed to collect data. A research model composed of two main stages (purchase inclination and decision) is proposed. Factor analysis and multiple regression analysis are used to determine how the factors are formed and what their relative weights are. Five factors are identified: the acceptability of insurance conditions (F1), insurance service provider's competence (F2), consumers' monetary attitude towards insurance (F3), the positivity of consumers' insurance experience (F4), and the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance (F5). Subsequently, path analysis is applied to further refine the research model by eliminating the less significant relationships between the variables (the relationships between F5 and inclination, between F3 and decision, and between F4 and decision were eliminated). The refined model provides the revised impact weights of the variables on the consumers' decision to purchase insurance services: Decision = 0,192 F1 + 0,379 F2 + 0,156 F5 + 0,222 Inclination + e2, where e2 represents the possible impact of other variables. The results show that in Lithuania, insurance consumption decision making is still mostly influenced by monetary considerations such as consumers' evaluation of an insurance service in monetary terms and the search for the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance. The results also indicate that the demographical and socio-economical characteristics of the consumers influence their behaviour. Among the main findings here are the most distinctive ones: men base their insurance decisions mostly on the acceptability of insurance conditions, whereas women do on the insurance service providers' competence; when purchasing insurance services, mature adults only care about the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance, while the youth and young adults mostly rely on the insurance service provider's competence; generally, for the Lithuanians a monthly amount of 800 LTL per person is the income level which enables them not only to form the inclination to purchase insurance services, but also to decide to purchase them actually; the higher degree or education acquired by the individuals, the fewer factors impact their insurance purchase decision: masters and doctors of science evaluate only the insurance service provider's competence, while bachelors, besides the insurer's competence, are also concerned with insurance service conditions and all the monetary issues; Vilnius' citizens evaluate a rather wider range of factors as compared to the individuals living in other places; individuals who are either married or living in a couple are more than singles inclined to purchase insurance services if an opportunity to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance exists; individuals who live alone are mostly concerned with the acceptability of insurance conditions, whereas families composed of two and more members highly focus on the insurer's competence; the decision of families with at least one child is determined by the insurer's competence, whereas families without children take a wider range of factors into account when making the insurance service purchase decision.","[Ulbinaite, Aurelija; Kucinskiene, Marija] Vilnius State Univ, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Le Moullec, Yannick] Aalborg Univ, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark",Vilnius University; Aalborg University,"Ulbinaite, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Sauletekio Av 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",aurelija.ulbinaite@ef.vu.lt; marija.kucinskiene@ef.vu.lt; ylm@es.aau.dk,"Ulbinaite, Aurelija/AAE-8774-2020; Le Moullec, Yannick/F-7387-2010","Le Moullec, Yannick/0000-0003-4667-621X",,,,,42,8,9,1,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We find evidence that stronger competition implies significantly lower spreads between bank and market interest rates for most loan market products, in line with expectations. This result implies that stronger competition causes both lower bank interest rates and a stronger pass-through of market rate changes into bank rates. Evidence of the latter is also presented by our Error Correction Model (ECM) for bank rates. Further, banks compensate income losses from increased loan market competition by offering lower deposit rates. Our findings with respect to the loan market rates have important monetary policy implications, as they suggest that measures to promote competition in the European banking sector are likely to render the monetary policy transmission mechanism more effective.","[Bikker, Jacob A.] Nederlandsche Bank, Supervisory Policy Div, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Rixtel, Adrian A.

We include several commonly used methods and evaluate their performances in terms of in-sample beta estimates and out-of-sample beta forecasts. We apply these methods to U.S. equity REITs. Our results overwhelmingly suggest that the state space model is the best performer. Such a conclusion is supported by different evaluation criteria and robust to different sample splitting. Our findings have direct financial implications. The forecasted betas (preferably through the state space model) can be used in many applications such as estimating the cost of capital for the purpose of capital budgeting involving REITs, identifying equity REIT mispricing, evaluating the performance of managed REIT portfolios, etc. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For each GDP component, bridge equations are specified by using a general-to-specific approach implemented in an automated way by Hoover and Perez and improved by Krolzig and Hendry. This approach allows to select explanatory variables among a large data set of hard and soft data. A rolling forecast study is carried out to assess the forecasting performance in the prediction of aggregated GDP, by taking publication lags into account in order to run pseudo real-time forecasts. It turns out that the model outperforms benchmark models. The results show that changing the set of equations over the quarter is superior to keeping the same equations over time.

Most of these analyses, however, are confined to consider emissions from fuel combustion only. Yet, some of the most relevant simultaneously energy intensive and internationally trade exposed sectors are also subject to substantial emissions from industrial processes. Carbon dioxide emissions can be released in industrial processes which physically or chemically transform materials. In the steel and cement sectors, for example, these process emissions amount to about half of sector carbon dioxide emissions in many countries. We incorporate industrial process emissions based on UNFCCC data into a multi-sectoral multi-regional computable general equilibrium model and analyze the implications of a unilateral EU 20% carbon dioxide emission reduction policy on leakage and the effectiveness of border carbon adjustment in reducing leakage. By comparing the results to a model without process emissions, we find that leakage of climate policy so far has been underestimated. Leakage turns out to be higher when process emissions are correctly accounted for (38% instead of 29% for combustion emissions only). Conversely, border carbon adjustment measures are found to be roughly twice as effective to reduce leakage rates, when process emissions are correctly accounted for as carbon adjustment rates are more directly targeted to the relevant sectors.

Public Econ. 12:1-26, 1979) overlapping generations optimal nonlinear income tax problem with two types of worker and quasilinear-in-leisure preferences is investigated. A decrease in the rate of population growth, which leads to an aging population, increases the relative price of consumption per person in retirement, which tends to decrease optimal consumption for retirees of both skill types. Nevertheless, it is also shown that the optimal marginal income tax rates are independent of the rate of population growth. In addition, the steady-state interest rate unambiguously declines when the rate of population growth declines. Resulting adjustments in production plans have an ambiguous effect on the aggregate wage rate. This article identifies factors contributing to an increase in the aggregate wage when the population ages, namely normality of consumption in retirement, complementarity between capital and labor in production, and a large capital deepening effect relative to the increase in dependency owing to demographic change. Depending on the sign of this wage effect, ambiguities may arise in the direction of change in the optimal steady-state consumption and production plans. However, when the dependency effect is sufficiently strong, it is possible to sign the direction of change in all production and consumption plans. Moreover, regardless of the direction of change in optimal consumption plans, the absolute value of the changes in consumption plans are smaller for low-skilled workers than for high-skilled when utility is time-separable and preferences exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion. Adopting, instead, a quasilinear-in-consumption specification of preferences sharpens the comparative statics of consumption allocations, but introduces ambiguity into the effect of the rate of population growth on the optimal marginal income tax rate.","Mt Allison Univ, Dept Econ, Sackville, NB E4L 1A7, Canada",Mount Allison University,"Brett, C (通讯作者)，Mt Allison Univ, Dept Econ, 144 Main St, Sackville, NB E4L 1A7, Canada.",cbrett@mta.ca,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Spain approved two labor reforms aimed at reducing the unemployment level and its volatility. Overall, these reforms involved two measures designed to induce firms to meet their labor needs via adjustment of permanent positions: restricting the use of temporary workers and reducing the amount of severance payments. This paper empirically assesses the impact of these reforms on the allocative efficiency of the labor input employing Petrin and Sivadasan's (2011) value of the marginal product-marginal cost gap methodology. We find a statistically significant increase in within-firm permanent labor gaps following the reforms. These results suggest that restrictions on the use of temporary workers (increasing the probability of hiring fragile workers for permanent positions), when coupled with uncertainty about enforcement of reduced severance payments, could more than offset the reduction in severance payments; hence, the net effect of the reforms could be to increase adjustment costs for permanent positions.

The identification strategy exploits an exogenous variation in union threat induced in the UK by new legislation enabling unions to obtain recognition even against the will of the management. The analysis finds no evidence of an effect on the probability that a firm employs fixed-term workers, and some weak evidence of a negative effect on the probability of using agency workers. Furthermore, estimates of the effect on the share of temporary employment are negative and statistically insignificant. Overall, therefore, there is no support for the hypothesis that firms under the threat of unionisation are more likely to use this type of non-union employment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In a traditional efficiency wage model, only the representative firm is optimizing against an assumed S-shaped effort supply function. This S-shaped supply curve is critical for the model and the absence of a derivation of the curve in the literature means that it is an incomplete theory. In the present paper, we extend the model by specifying a worker's representative utility function so that the corresponding argmax function will be the S-shaped effort supply curve. This will make the worker's decision process endogenous and will produce a more complete model. The importance of this extension is clear. The characterization of the utility function will make explicit the necessary conditions and crucial assumptions of the traditional model. More importantly, the extension will allow researchers to introduce employment compensation factors into the worker's utility function for analysis. This has important bearings on future development in employment theory. For example, a worker's satisfaction from shirking (net of dismissal risks), or his or her willingness to search for jobs (net of search cost), can now be included in his or her utility function to form an optimal work or search strategy. Incorporating the worker's optimization behaviour into the model will also enable researchers to study policy directed not just towards firms but also towards the worker's decision process. Furthermore, this approach provides a framework for researchers to generate comparative statics. These comparative statics can lead to interesting topics for econometric models or to further research within this field.","[Wu, Joseph S.

The bounds testing approach to the cointegration and the error correction modeling is employed. We, however, adopt a new strategy in the model selection phase and select the optimal model from those models that satisfy both diagnostics and cointegration, thus, unlike the previous literature, ensuring that a statistically reliable and cointegrated model is picked up. Results indicate that for the import demand, relative price is a significant determinant in both short-run and long-run, nominal effective exchange rate matters only in the long-run, but domestic income is not at all a significant determinant for Turkish agricultural import demand. As for the export demand, while all determinants affect the export demand significantly in the short-run, given the relatively small share of Turkish agricultural exports within the world agricultural exports, none individually matters in the long-run.","Cankaya Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06810 Yenimahalle Ankara, Turkey",Cankaya University,"Yazici, M (通讯作者)，Cankaya Univ, Dept Econ, 29 Km, TR-06810 Yenimahalle Ankara, Turkey.",myazici@cankaya.edu.tr,"YAZICI, Mehmet/GWZ-2001-2022","YAZICI, Mehmet/0000-0003-2924-9865",,,,,23,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In addition, we estimate the order of integration of the series, allowing for fractional degrees of differentiation, to assess the persistence of unemployment in the region. Our results indicate that when endogenous structural changes are included in the model, in general we find evidence of mean reversion of unemployment rates for the Latin American countries under study.

The penalty is worst for those who have committed murder.","[Loureiro, Maria L.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Santiago De Compostela, A Coruna, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Loureiro, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Avda Burgo Nacions S-N, Santiago De Compostela, A Coruna, Spain.",maria.loureiro@usc.es,"Loureiro, Maria/Q-2384-2015","Loureiro, Maria/0000-0002-7082-3980",,,,,29,8,15,1,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

In the two subsequent decades a great deal has been learned. The problem of stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has proved far more difficult than envisioned in 1992 and the role of technology appears even more important when emissions mitigation strategies are co-developed in the context of multiple competing ends.

The intermediation market is frictional, whereas the goods market is perfectly competitive. Unlike their random-search-and-price-bargaining setup, intermediaries herein post intermediation prices and farmers direct their search. Contrary to their findings, we show that opening the economy to international trade always leads to welfare gains. This is the case because domestic farmers benefit from relatively efficient intermediation technologies in terms of higher matching probabilities but also lower intermediation prices.

We show that initial inequality has a positive indirect effect on average output growth by lowering the ratio of physical to human capital, besides its standard negative direct effect.

This paper investigates whether successful skill acquisition through trainingas opposed to general exposure to federal assistanceimproves the post-participation outcomes using the Trade Act Participant Report. Success in skill acquisition is indicated by a match between occupations of training and entered employment. The average matching rate for the sample is 37.53%. Trainees with a match display wage replacement rates that are 2 to 3 percentage points higher than those without one, while they display very similar post-participation earnings that are inferior to that of non-trainees. This generally indicates that participants with limited skill sets with lower pre-participation earnings select into training, and successful skill acquisition offsets the negative impacts of their lack of marketable skills. Matching itself does not improve the retention at the job. However, participation in various training programs improves retention.","Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Kent, OH 44242 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent,"Park, J (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",jpark8@kent.edu,,,,,,,12,17,20,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The framework used in this paper is the single-sector aggregate production function, which is the first comprehensive approach used in an Australian study of this type to include energy, capital and labour as separate inputs of production. The empirical evidence points to a cointegration relationship between energy and output and implies that energy is an important variable in the cointegration space, as are conventional inputs capital and labour. We also find some evidence of bidirectional causality between GDP and energy use. Although the evidence of causality from energy use to GDP was relatively weak when using the thermal aggregate of energy use, once energy consumption was adjusted for energy quality, we found strong evidence of Granger causality from energy use to GDP in Australia over the investigated period. The results are robust, irrespective of the assumptions of linear trends in the cointegration models, and are applicable for different econometric approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

But the rising price of non-wood energy has had a positive effect on the consumption and offset the downward trend effect in the last decade. Residential wood energy consumption has also been sensitive to changes in wage rate in both long-run and short-run, but the total estimated wage rate effect since 1967 is negligible.

When two objects are sold separately via such auctions, bidders signal their willingness to pay via jump bids, thereby forming rational expectations of the prices without relying on any central mediator. Hence a multi-item bidder does not suffer the exposure problem of having to buy an item while he is uncertain about the price of its complement. Single-item bidders, however, free-ride one another in competing against a multi-item bidder. Consequently, the auctions overly concentrate the goods to a multi-item bidder and never overly diffuse them to single-item bidders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This paper provides a simultaneous approach, considering both objectives, by using the psychological distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, in order to reconcile conflicting results reported in the literature. Following the simultaneity approach, the paper develops a theoretical model of unpaid labour supply within an agent's two-period utility maximization problem, taking into account the role of psychological motivation. The theoretical hypotheses are tested with a sample selection model for Italy, by using the 1997 Multipurpose Households Survey on everyday life issues carried out by the Italian National Statistical Office. A robustness analysis and endogeneity test for intrinsic motivation are also performed. Empirical analysis rejects the hypothesis that only a consumption or investment motive can explain Italian volunteers' behaviour, supporting the hypothesis that both motives interact in shaping regular unpaid labour supply, with a stronger impact of consumption motives. The relevant variables for frequently supplied unpaid labour are intrinsic motivation, age, household income, family responsibilities and activity sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Later papers confirmed this conclusion about the negative impact of learning. In the light of intensified research efforts worldwide to reduce uncertainty about the environmental impact of emissions and the cost of reducing them, this conclusion is intriguing. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, we analyse whether the result carries over to a more general setting without restriction on the number of players and which considers not only 'no' and 'full learning' but also 'partial learning'. Second, we test whether the conclusion also holds if there is uncertainty about abatement costs instead of uncertainty about the benefits from global abatement. Third, we propose a transfer scheme that mitigates the possible negative effect of learning and which may even transform it into a positive effect.","[Finus, Michael] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England; [Pintassilgo, Pedro] Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Faro, Portugal; [Pintassilgo, Pedro] Univ Algarve, Res Ctr Spatial & Org Dynam, Faro, Portugal",University of Exeter; Universidade do Algarve; Universidade do Algarve,"Finus, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",m.finus@exeter.ac.uk,"Pintassilgo, Pedro Miguel/H-5848-2019","Pintassilgo, Pedro Miguel/0000-0001-9115-4301; Finus, Michael/0000-0001-8248-2768",,,,,32,9,11,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We surveyed a representative sample of US workers to inquire about the wage determination process at the time they were hired into their current or most recent jobs. A third of the respondents reported bargaining over pay before accepting their current jobs. Almost a third of workers had precise information about pay when they first met with their employers, a sign of wage posting. About 40 percent of workers were on-the-job searchers-they could have remained at their earlier jobs at the time they accepted their current jobs, indicating a more favorable bargaining position than is held by unemployed job-seekers.

Increased economic integration, particularly through the capital account, combined with asymmetries in exchange-rate regimes between China and the US, have shown that reliance on the automatic adjustment mechanisms of the non-system are no longer feasible, so that a return to policy cooperation is necessary in order to rebalance the world economy and reduce the adverse spill-over impacts that uncoordinated rebalancing would entail. The article explores the nature of this coordination and provides a context for other contributions to the issue, analysing positive and normative aspects of macroeconomic policy coordination from a global perspective and from the prospective of key global players including China and the European Union.","[Adam, Christopher] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Adam, Christopher] Univ Oxford, St Cross Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Vines, David] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Vines, David] Univ Oxford, Balliol Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Vines, David] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Australian National University,"Adam, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",chris-topher.adam@economics.ox.ac.uk; psubacchi@chathamhouse.org; david.vines@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,9,9,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

J,"Calcagno, A",,,,"Calcagno, Alfredo",,,Can austerity work?,REVIEW OF KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,austerity; financial crisis; multipliers; debt; confidence; macroeconomic policy,,"Economic policies in several major countries have shifted from fiscal stimulus to austerity in the last few years. They seek to reduce fiscal deficits and reverse the increasing trend of public debt mainly through immediate spending cuts. The fact that fiscal austerity is applied simultaneously in these countries adds to its negative impact on economic recovery. Austerity policies are based on a wrong diagnosis of the nature and depth of the crisis, and also on erroneous views of economic mechanisms. This is a financial crisis due to private over-indebtedness and financial deregulation, not a crisis caused by fiscal profligacy: austerity focuses on a symptom of the crisis, not on its causes. With high unemployment and the ongoing de-leveraging process, private demand tends to remain subdued for a prolonged period and will not be stimulated by monetary expansion alone. If in addition governments tighten fiscal policies, demand and growth will be further compressed, fiscal revenues will decline, expected fiscal consolidation will remain elusive and so will the recovery of investors' confidence, which many see as the key to restoring growth. Only a recovery of growth, with nominal GDP expanding at rates higher than interest rates in the medium and long run will abate debt-to-GDP ratios. That growth can result from coordinated supportive policies, which may include changes in the level and composition of public income and expenditure and a better distribution of income and credit, which would expand fiscal multipliers and the purchasing power of low and medium income groups with a high propensity to consume.","UNCTAD, Macroecon & Dev Policies Branch, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Calcagno, A (通讯作者)，UNCTAD, Macroecon & Dev Policies Branch, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,23,4,5,0,13,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The model can be thought of as a reduced form model of rational inattention that has only one additional state variable relative to the Calvo model [Journal of Monetary Economics 12 (1983), 383-398]. Like the model of backward-looking automatic indexation to past aggregate inflation, it generates a gradual and persistent reaction of the inflation rate, and output losses, following highly persistent monetary shocks. But unlike that model, its price setters behave very similarly to Calvo price setters when shocks are transitory.","[Kumhof, Michael] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Cespedes, Luis Felipe; Parrado, Eric] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Recreo, Vina Del Mar, Chile",International Monetary Fund; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Kumhof, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mkumhof@imf.org,,,,,,,48,0,1,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

For an arbitrary type distribution, we prove several properties of optimal menus, such as efficiency at the top and downward distortions elsewhere. We show that these results extend beyond the insurance problem we emphasize. We also prove that the principal always prefers an agent facing a larger loss and prefers a poorer one if the agent's risk aversion decreases with wealth. For the standard case of a continuum of types and a smooth density, we show that, under the mild assumptions of a log-concave density and decreasing absolute risk aversion, the optimal premium is backward-S-shaped in the amount of coveragefirst concave, then convex. This curvature result implies that quantity discounts are consistent with adverse selection in insurance, contrary to the conventional wisdom from competitive models.","[Chade, Hector; Schlee, Edward] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Chade, H (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",hector.chade@asu.edu; edward.schlee@asu.edu,,,,,,,40,23,27,0,20,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

However, the effect of intergovernmental transfers on equalization has been called into question by anecdotal evidence that seems to suggest that transfers from the center are not rule-based and are subject to heavy rent-seeking. Unlike past studies, which have focused on the equalization effects of total fiscal transfers from the center, this paper includes an examination of the equalization effects of different types of transfers because some transfers, which are inherently anti-equalizing, may mask the equalization effects of other types of transfers when they are lumped together to find the average effect. Using inequality measures, a decomposition of fiscal disparities, and dynamic panel data models, we find that China's intergovernmental transfer system that was established in 1994 does have some equalizing elements. To a large extent, these elements exist due to the mechanism designed to shrink the tax rebates that bear the legacy of the pre-1994 system; to a small extent, these elements exist due to the rule-based general-purpose transfer whose share in total transfers remains small but has increased since 2002. However, the equalization effects of the largest component of transfers, specific-purpose transfers, are anti-equalizing. They are typically not rule-based and thus subject to political influence. As a result, total transfers also exhibit significant anti-equalization effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It is frequently argued that an ineffective judicial system, implying a cumbersome procedure to evict a non-paying tenant or simply requiring a long period to execute a decision, may be an important determinant of the tenancy market's weakness, as it constrains the effective supply by reducing the profitability of landlords. This research studies this effect econometrically using a panel data approach and exploring differences in judicial efficacy among the Spanish provinces.

This tale is reminiscent of a similar tale concerning the Great Depression. In the 30s technical change was localized in agriculture, where income fell because rising productivity could not be offset by a shrinking labor force due to the costs of moving out of agriculture for unemployed workers, inelastic demand for agricultural output meant that as output increased income declined. As individual incomes fell below the level necessary to finance the transition to manufacturing, excess labor became trapped in agriculture, reducing wages and exacerbating the rise in output. Shrinking incomes in agriculture reverberated on the other sectors, mainly manufacturing causing a large depression. Nowadays, it is manufacturing that plays the role of epicenter of technical change. Falling incomes in manufacturing yield a lack of demand for goods produced in the rest of the economy, namely the service sector. This may be the deep rooted cause of the long lasting slump and the painfully slow recovery. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We show that growth can be enhanced by the introduction of pay-as-you-go pensions even if the growth rate of aggregate wages falls short of the interest rate. The reason is that the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system allows future retirees to partially internalize positive externalities of public education due to the positive effect of higher future labor productivity on their pension benefits. The majority support for education funding will be especially strong when the PAYG benefit formula is flat, i.e., progressively redistributive. If a flat benefit PAYG pension system is in place then the economy will achieve the highest growth rate relative to the alternative pension system designs. While such PAYG pension system may be opposed by the majority of working individuals due to inferior returns to their pension contributions relative to a funded scheme, it is likely to be politically sustained by a coalition of older individuals and lower income workers.","[Kaganovich, Michael] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Meier, Volker] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Kaganovich, M (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Wylie Hall, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",mkaganov@indiana.edu; Volker.Meier@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,"Kaganovich, Michael/ABG-5924-2020","Kaganovich, Michael/0000-0003-4675-576X",,,,,31,17,17,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

This large influx of tourism dollars is only part of the overall impact of hosting the Olympic Games. In order to host the visitors and sporting events, cities must make sizable investments in infrastructure such as airports, arenas, and highways. Additionally, the publicity and international exposure of a host city may benefit international trade and capital flows. Proponents argue that this investment will pay off through increased economic growth, but research confirming these claims is lacking. This paper examines whether hosting an Olympiad improves a city's long-term growth. In order to control for the self-selection of cities that host Olympic Games, this paper matches Olympic host cities with cities that were finalists for the Olympic Games, but were not selected by the International Olympic Committee. A difference-in-difference estimator examines post-Olympic impacts for host cities between 1950 and 2005.

Agents with heterogeneous skills seek loans in order to undertake risky investment projects. Asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders implies a menu of loan contracts that induce self-selection in a separating equilibrium. Faced with these contracts, agents choose how much of their income to declare by trading off their incentives to offer collateral against their disincentives to comply with tax obligations. The key implication of the analysis is that the marginal net benefit of income disclosure increases with the level of financial development. Thus, in accordance with empirical observation, we establish the result that the lower is the stage of such development, the higher is the incidence of tax evasion and the greater is the size of the underground economy.

I go on to explore other dynamic consequences of integration. The entry of multinationals makes the lifetime earning profiles of host country workers steeper. At the same time, if agents learn fast enough, integration creates unequal opportunities, thereby widening inequality.

More noticeable, however, are the major changes that have been experienced in empirically-oriented innovation research as a result of the introduction of firm level innovation surveys. Collecting innovation related data via firm based surveys has now become a common practice for many countries for example, Canada, United States, Malaysia, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand as well as almost all EU countries. These survey-lead approaches have transformed our understanding of the nature and determinants of innovation and also increased our understanding of the role played by innovation in growth. At the same time, the surveys themselves have also been adapted as our conceptual understanding of innovation has increased. As such, the balance of innovation-related research has shifted from a theoretical to a primarily empiricist-lead agenda, and increasingly combined both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The objective of this paper is examine how our understanding of innovation has evolved over the last few decades, to identify the major theoretical and empirical influences on our understanding, and to assess the role which innovation surveys have played in this evolution.","[Hong, Shangqin] Univ Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Oxley, Les] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [McCann, Philip] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Canterbury; University of Waikato; University of Groningen,"Hong, SQ (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.",,"Oxley, Les T/A-6075-2008; Oxley, Les/JDW-1971-2023; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654; Oxley, Les/0000-0003-3621-2323",,,,,168,54,61,4,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We find that the effect of VC is significant only in the subsample of high-VC countries, where the ratio VC/R&D has averaged around 3.9% between 1991 and 2005 and VC has accounted for 10.2% of industrial innovation during that period. We also find that VC is relatively more successful in fostering innovation in countries with lower barriers to entrepreneurship, with a tax and regulatory environment that welcomes venture capital investment, and with lower taxes on capital gains.

J,"Popp, D; Newell, R",,,,"Popp, David; Newell, Richard",,,Where does energy R&D come from? Examining crowding out from energy R&D,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Technological change; Energy efficiency; Alternative energy; R&D; Patents,TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; CASH FLOW; INNOVATION; PATENTS; GROWTH; POLICY; PRODUCTIVITY; INVESTMENT; EMISSIONS; TAXES,"Recent efforts to endogenize technological change in climate policy models demonstrate the importance of accounting for the opportunity cost of climate R&D investments. Because the social returns to R&D investments are typically higher than the social returns to other types of investment, any new climate mitigation R&D that comes at the expense of other R&D investment may dampen the overall gains from induced technological change. Unfortunately, there has been little empirical work to guide modelers as to the potential magnitude of such crowding out effects. This paper considers both the private and social opportunity costs of climate R&D. Addressing private costs, we ask whether an increase in climate R&D represents new R&D spending, or whether some (or all) of the additional climate R&D comes at the expense of other R&D. Addressing social costs, we use patent citations to compare the social value of alternative energy research to other types of R&D that may be crowded out. Beginning at the industry level, we find no evidence of crowding out across sectors that is, increases in energy R&D do not draw R&D resources away from sectors that do not perform R&D. Given this, we proceed with a detailed look at alternative energy R&D. Linking patent data and financial data by firm, we ask whether an increase in alternative energy patents leads to a decrease in other types of patenting activity. While we find that increases in alternative energy patents do result in fewer patents of other types, the evidence suggests that this is due to profit-maximizing changes in research effort, rather than financial constraints that limit the total amount of R&D possible. Finally, we use patent citation data to compare the social value of alternative energy patents to other patents by these firms. Alternative energy patents are cited more frequently, and by a wider range of other technologies, than other patents by these firms, suggesting that their social value is higher.

The treaty provisions are structured in such a way that the Commission is in principle obliged to authorize every single grant of aid. This has proved to be practically impossible, the more so with 27 members of the EU. As a result, the Commission has issued a number of exemption and de minimis rules, for which notification is not required, that suggest that the bulk of state aid is beneficial. In order for state aid policy to become more rigorous, the 2005 State Aid Action Plan rightly enhanced the role of economic analysis. This means rethinking the exemption regulations and the way individual decisions are taken. One important step forward would be to make sure that distortions of competition are noticeable before a state measure is declared incompatible. As a result, at least with respect to individual decisions, EU policy would stop addressing cases where the distortions of competition are minimal. Furthermore, the Commission would stop imposing irrelevant constraints on subsidized forms. This is particularly the case for restructuring aid, where the restoration of the healthiness of the firm is the final objective of the aid. However, even in recent decisions taken as a result of the financial crisis, the Commission uses competition-type considerations only to overcome moral hazard by attaching a number of intrusive conditions to its authorization decisions (prohibition of reducing prices before a competitor does, introduction of capacity or sales caps, merger prohibitions, caps on managers' salaries, etc.). Very often these conditions reduce, not increase, the probability that these companies restructure successfully. Moral hazard can only be eliminated by not allowing the aid, by limiting the aid to what is strictly necessary, or by making sure that it is a once-and-for-all option, and not by constraining the company from competing.","[Heimler, Alberto] Scuola Super Pubbl Amministraz, Rome, Italy; [Jenny, Frederic] ESSEC Business Sch, Paris, France",ESSEC Business School,"Heimler, A (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Pubbl Amministraz, Rome, Italy.",a.heimler@SSPA.it; frederic.jenny@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,7,8,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Although the non-profit sector has experienced growth in relative socio-economic importance in recent decades, the available data on the size of the sector indicates substantial variations among countries. Existing literature provides several multi- and interdisciplinary theories, hypotheses and concepts that try to explain those differences, such as for instance the heterogeneity and failure theories, the resource dependence theory and interdependence theory. Empirical findings indicate that the selection of the measurement of sector size influences the ability to explain the differences in the size of the sector across countries. The results of a cross-section regression analysis indicate that almost three quarters of cross-national variation in the sector workforce could be explained, whereas pooled regression indicates that almost three fifths of variation in sector size, if workforce and expenditures are taken as dimensions of the sector, could be explained.

However, relatively little is known about returns to higher education (i.e. college premium) and how it varies across population in China over time. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by examining college premium in urban China during the period of 1995-2002. We also explore the differences in college premium by gender and by sector. To isolate the causal effects of college education, we employ a novel instrumental variable approach based on heteroskedasticity in college decision to circumvent potential endogeneity and measurement error problems. Our results imply a much larger college premium and a greater growth in the college premium relative to their OLS counterparts, consistent with the general literature on returns to education. More interestingly and starkly contrasting to the existing studies using OLS in the Chinese context, our results imply that (1) the college premium is larger for women than for men in the early stage of economic reforms, but the difference decreases and becomes statistically insignificant over time; (2) the college premium is larger for workers in the state-owned enterprises than that in the non-state-owned enterprises during the early stage of economic reforms; this gap is, however, reversed in the later stage. We discuss potential reasons for these results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

It analyses the period 1990-2007 in three steps. First, the income 'turning point' of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) has been estimated using quadratic log function and obtained a turning point consistent with existing studies. Second. adopting Dean's (2002) simultaneous equations system, the relationships between trade, growth and emissions has been estimated and the results confirm the dominance of scale effects over technique effects. Third, the estimated per capita turning point for EKC is used to split the provincial industrial database into two groups (below and above turning point income) and simultaneous equations are estimated separately for them. The split sample provided limited support for the trade-induced emissions hypothesis for COD, but not for SO2. At the provincial level rising incomes via increased levels of international trade were associated with falling COD due to the technique effect, so that rising incomes among the provinces tended to be associated with lower emissions. Stricter environmental regulations are required for growing incomes because they may encourage better production techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A decision maker tries to find the optimal choice in a financial problem by maximizing the subjects' expected utility for multiple periods, which is measured by the value function in the prospect theory. The subjects are assumed to be myopic for monetary reward and show time-inconsistent preference. Additionally, they have different risk tolerances for gains and losses, causing the framing effect. Under these conditions, a comparative analysis is carried out numerically to evaluate a combined effect of the two psychological factors on the intertemporal choice. The paper also presents a simple computational method for the numerical analysis and proves its validity.","[Shoji, Isao] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan; [Kanehiro, Sumei] Keihatsusha Inc, Tokyo 1350042, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Shoji, I (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",shoji@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp,,"Shoji, Isao/0000-0002-5160-693X",,,,,21,4,4,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Drawing on our experience in the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), we describe survey design and field strategies that contributed to minimizing attrition over four waves of the survey. The data are used to illustrate the selectivity of respondents who attrit from the survey and, also the selectivity of respondents who move from the place they were interviewed at baseline and are subsequently interviewed in a new location. The results provide insights into the nature of selection that will arise in studies that fail to track and interview movers. Attrition, and types of attrition, are related in complex ways to a broad array of characteristics measured at baseline. In addition, the evidence suggests attrition may be related to characteristics that are not observed in our baseline. Integrating IFLS with data from a Survey of Surveyors, we describe characteristics of both the interviewers and the interview that predict attrition in later waves. These characteristics point to possible strategies that may reduce levels of attrition and may also reduce the impact of attrition on the interpretation of behavioral models estimated with longitudinal data.

Although all workers have identical productivity and leisure value, the random arrival of job offers creates ex-post differences with respect to their time remaining until benefit expiration. Firms, which are also homogeneous, can exploit these differences, leading to an endogenous wage distribution. This allows us to examine the equilibrium effect of policy changes in both the size and length of UI benefits. Surprisingly, an increase in benefits can actually cause wages to fall, which is contrary to the predictions of on-the-job-search models. Moreover, we explain well-documented patterns of how the hazard rate of exiting unemployment responds to these policy changes. Our theory also explains why this hazard rate jumps at the time of benefit exhaustion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In the proposed mechanism, the ownership of the upstream firm is allocated to downstream firms in proportion to their shares of input purchases. This mechanism, while preserving downstream competition, partially internalizes the benefits of exploiting economies of scale resulting from an increase in downstream output. We show that this mechanism is more efficient than a disintegrated market structure in which the upstream natural monopoly bottleneck sets a price equal to average cost.","[Boffa, Federico] Univ Macerata, Dept Legal & Econ Studies, Jesi, Italy; [Panzar, John] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Panzar, John] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL USA",University of Macerata; University of Auckland; Northwestern University,"Boffa, F (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Dept Legal & Econ Studies, Jesi, Italy.",federico.boffa@unimc.it; j.panzar@auckland.ac.nz,,"Boffa, Federico/0000-0002-2394-9441",,,,,23,4,4,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Insights about individual risk beliefs and behavioural responses to changing risks are relevant for insurers, as it allows them, for example, to estimate the demand for new insurance products that cover weather-related damage. This study elicits individual risk beliefs and the demand for low-probability, high-impact flood insurance using the contingent valuation survey method among approximately 1000 homeowners in the Dutch river delta. This study is of practical relevance since currently flood insurance is not available in the Netherlands, while insurers have been considering to provide such insurance. Individuals generally do not behave in accordance with the expected utility model since a significant proportion of homeowners neglect the low-probability flood risk. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) of those individuals who demand flood insurance is on average considerably higher than the expected value of the flood risk they face. Moreover, the WTP for flood insurance is less than proportionally related to increased flood probabilities that were presented to respondents in the questionnaire. Individuals follow a process of Bayesian updating of flood probabilities, since perceptions of flood risk are an important determinant of the WTP, while objective risks derived from geographical characteristics influence the WTP to a lesser extent. Communication of baseline probabilities and changes in flood probabilities using risk ladders facilitate the comprehension of risk by respondents, and has a considerable effect on the level of the WTP and its sensitivity to probability changes. The results indicate that the current ex post public compensation scheme of flood damage lowers demand for private insurance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Botzen, W. J.

This paper presents evidence that, once industry heterogeneity in firm size distribution is taken into account, financial development is an important determinant of cross-country differences in vertical integration. Financial development fosters entry of firms and increases competition in the industry. This reduces vertical integration of larger firms, but also leads smaller, non-integrated, firms to exit the industry. As a result, higher financial development reduces vertical integration in industries where a high share of output is produced by small firms. The positive effect of financial development on entry also reduces vertical integration by fostering the development of input markets.","Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Macchiavello, R (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",r.macchiavello@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,14,17,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Trade liberalization changes the supply of skilled production teams available for hire, even when firm production techniques remain fixed. As trade barriers fall, some workers choose to quit small firms in order to accept less skill intensive jobs at large firms that participate in foreign markets. Changes in worker matching behavior can explain several stylized features of firm-level adjustments to trade, with effects that are not limited to firms on the margin of exit or exporting. Trade is shown to rationalize the matching behavior of workers, leading to aggregate gains in productivity and lower prices. Openness benefits workers employed at exporting firms, however the likelihood of gaining from trade is not necessarily increasing in skill. Wages in the open economy are tied to both worker skill and job type. (C) 2012 Elsevier ay.

This article investigates how students choose the composition of their majors conditional on pursuing more than one major, that is, whether the majors that they choose are substitutes or complements. As the students use both their preferences and expectations about the realizations of future major-specific outcomes when choosing their college majors, I collect innovative data on subjective expectations from a sample of Northwestern University sophomores. Although there is substantial heterogeneity in beliefs across students, they seem to be aware of differences across majors and have sensible beliefs about the outcomes conditional on major. Students believe that their parents are more likely to approve majors associated with high social status and high returns in the labor market. I incorporate the subjective data in a choice model of double majors that also captures the notion of specialization. I find that enjoying studying the coursework and gaining approval of parents are the most important determinants in the choice of majors. The model estimates reject the hypothesis that students major in one field to pursue their own interests and in another for parents' approval. Instead I find that gaining parents' approval and enjoying studying and working in a field of study are outcomes that are important for both majors in a student's major pair. However, I do find that students act strategically in their choice of majors by choosing majors that differ in their chances of completion and difficulty, and in finding a job upon graduation.

To decrease the possibility of internal rebellions, a ruler could organize the government to establish the division of power among ministers. While effective in preventing internal rebellions, this approach could make the defense of the country against external threats less effective. The trade-off between preventing internal rebellions and dealing with external threats in a ruler's choice of government organizational form is affected by factors such as the size of the population, the level of coordination efficiency, and the degree of increasing returns to the military sector. If the magnitude of external threats increases, regardless of the type of equilibrium organizational form, the equilibrium level of the concentration of power among division heads increases.","Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Zhou, HW (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",hzhou@odu.edu,,,,,,,36,6,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The paper reviews some of the most prominent IDI indices proposed in the last four decades. The assessment focuses on how these indices react to inequalities that are disadvantageous to different groups, using two operationalizations of a concept of group-specific disadvantage focus (GDF). Relying on a complementary set of properties, the review also assesses whether these indices are informative about other interesting features related to IDI comparisons, chiefly distributional equality, but also absence of distributional overlap and presence of first-order stochastic dominance. The author proposes amendments to several of these indices in order to render them in fulfillment of GDF properties and more informative on the mentioned distributional features.","Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Yalonetzky, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",g.yalonetzky@leeds.ac.uk,,"Yalonetzky, Gaston/0000-0003-2438-0223",,,,,40,0,0,0,13,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 30,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,20129.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-9,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,928BP,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302954900001,0

We provide an explanation for this finding by highlighting one key difference between bank loans and bonds: bank loans are rarely traded, while bonds are heavily traded on the secondary market. In our theory, the secondary market plays a crucial information revelation role in shortening renegotiations. Consider a dynamic bargaining game with incomplete information between a government and creditors. The creditors' reservation value is private information, and the government knows only its distribution. Delays in reaching agreements arise in equilibrium because the government uses costly delays to screen the creditors' reservation value. When the creditors trade on the secondary market, the market price conveys information about their reservation value, which lessens the information friction and reduces the renegotiation duration. We find that the secondary market tends to increase the renegotiation payoff of the government but decrease that of the creditors while increasing the total payoff. We then embed these renegotiation outcomes in a simple sovereign debt model to analyze the ex ante welfare implications. The secondary market has the potential to increase the government ex ante welfare when the information friction is severe. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using a gravity equation approach, we analyze how the decrease in tariffs promoted during the 90s by the Uruguay Round multilateral trade agreement affected the trade margins of French firms for 57 sectors and 147 countries from 1993 to 2002. Our main contribution is to estimate the elasticity of trade on both margins, controlling for the unobserved heterogeneity of trade flows thanks to a three-dimensional panel and to time-varying tariffs as a measure of variable trade costs. Our results show that the number of firms exporting in a given sector to a given destination is related to the level of tariffs. But they also show that the decrease in tariffs induced by the implementation of the Uruguay Round did not lead more firms to export and that it only induced incumbent exporters to increase their shipments. We control for two problems that may affect our basic specification: tariff changes may be endogenous and zero flows are not included. Our results are confirmed - even when the extensive margin is significant, its magnitude is very small. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Closing down a subset of tax havens reduces competition among the havens that remain active. This makes their tax haven business more profitable and shifts a arger share of rents to these remaining tax havens, making them more reluctant to give up their tax haven business.

We examine the extent to which family stresses influence the timing of initiation of smoking and drinking. Using national panel data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) we capitalize on the survey design and use school-level fixed effects that control for the local environments, including prices of cigarettes and alcohol. In addition, we narrow our control group to classmates who will experience a similar stressor in the future. We find that a composite measure of family stressors when young increases the likelihood of initiating tobacco and alcohol use, with much of the impact attributable to parental divorce. In our baseline estimates, the composite stress measure is associated with a 30% increase in the likelihood of smoking and a 20% increase in drinking. When we control for multiple sources of confounding, the impact shrinks and remains significant for smoking but not for drinking. We conclude that studies which do not control for confounding are likely to significantly overestimate the impact of family stress on substance use. Our approach helps to move the literature forward by separating causal results from spurious associations.","[Fletcher, Jason M.; Sindelar, Jody L.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Sindelar, Jody L.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Fletcher, JM (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, 60 Coll St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",jason.fletcher@yale.edu; jody.sindelar@yale.edu,,,NIAAA NIH HHS [RL1 AA017542] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHS [PL1 DA024859] Funding Source: Medline; NIDCR NIH HHS [UL1 DE019586] Funding Source: Medline,NIAAA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NIDCR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)),,,26,6,11,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

However, the first two expositions of Keynesian-type business cycle theory had no direct influence on Hicks' model. This paper examines the business cycle theories of Harrod and Kalecki. This is done mainly for its own sake-both of these theories are very important in the history of economic thought. But it is also of interest to see that constituent parts, which Hicks ignored, gave a richness absent in the Hicksian theory. In the case of Harrod aspects of the role of money and the explicit incorporation of imperfect competition in the micro foundation were important. While in the case of Kalecki it was imperfect competition and an emphasis on the contradictory nature of investment as both creating effective demand and capacity.","[Kriesler, Peter] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2054, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Kriesler, P (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2054, Australia.",p.kriesler@unsw.edu.au,"Kriesler, Peter/J-9164-2012",,,,,,26,6,6,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We investigate framing effects by replicating the Holt and Laury's (Am. Econ. Rev. 92:1644-1655, 2002) procedure for measuring risk aversion under various frames. We first examine treatments where participants are confronted with the 10 decisions to be made either simultaneously or sequentially. The second treatment variable is the order of appearance of the ten lottery pairs. Probabilities of winning are ranked either in increasing, decreasing, or in random order. Lastly, payoffs were increased by a factor of ten in additional treatments. The rate of inconsistencies was significantly higher in sequential than in simultaneous treatment, in increasing and random than in decreasing treatment. Both experience and salient incentives induce a dramatic decrease in inconsistent behaviors. On the other hand, risk aversion was significantly higher in sequential than in simultaneous treatment, in decreasing and random than in increasing treatment, in high than in low payoff condition. These findings suggest that subjects use available information which has no value for normative theories, like throwing a glance at the whole connected set of pairwise choices before making each decision in a connected set of lottery pairs.","[Masclet, David] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, Rennes, France; [Levy-Garboua, Louis; Maafi, Hela; Terracol, Antoine] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Levy-Garboua, Louis; Masclet, David] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Maafi, Hela] GREGHEC HEC Sch Management, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes; Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite de Montreal,"Masclet, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, Rennes, France.",louis.levy-garboua@univ-paris1.fr; maafi@hec.fr; david.masclet@univ-rennes1.fr; terracol@univ-paris1.fr,,"Terracol, Antoine/0000-0001-9937-4114",,,,,21,45,48,4,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Our results do not support established theoretical predictions according to which the increase in the opportunity cost of motherhood connected to higher female labour participation is responsible for the fall in fertility. On the contrary, the instability of women's work status (i.e. having occasional, precarious, and low-paid positions) is revealed as a significant dissuasive factor in the decision to have children. Couples in which there is an unemployed woman are less likely to plan childbearing as well.

Using iTraxx CDS index spreads from Japanese and Australian markets, the paper models the different relationships that can exist in different ranges of behavior. We consider several Archimedean copula models with different tail dependence structures, namely, Gumbel, Clayton, Frank, AMH and Joe copulas. Although the dramatic change in the levels of the iTraxx CDS index, we find strong evidence that the dependence structure between CDS and stock market conditions is asymmetric and orienting toward the upper side. In addition, we find that the Japanese CDS market is more sensitive to the stock return volatility than the jump risk and the magnitude of this sensitivity is related to the market circumstances. However, Australian CDS market is more sensitive to the jump risk than stock return volatility before and during the financial crisis. This result has important implications for both global financial stability and default risk management. Specifically, the heterogeneity of markets, coupled with the diversity in the risk exposures cause the default risk premium and equity markets to exhibit different levels of sensitivity.

This paper finds that the guarantee pattern has no effect on the monopoly firm's profits if all information is known to both the consumer and the monopolist.

We first provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the local identification of the structural parameters based on the (first and) second order properties of the process. The condition allows for arbitrary relations between the number of observed endogenous variables and structural shocks, and is simple to verify. The extensions, including identification through a subset of frequencies, partial identification, conditional identification, and identification under general nonlinear constraints, are also studied. When lack of identification is detected, the method can be further used to trace out nonidentification curves. For estimation, restricting our attention to nonsingular systems, we consider a frequency domain quasi-maximum likelihood estimator and present its asymptotic properties. The limiting distribution of the estimator can be different from results in the related literature due to the structure of the DSGE model. Finally, we discuss a quasi-Bayesian procedure for estimation and inference. The procedure can be used to incorporate relevant prior distributions and is computationally attractive.","[Qu, Zhongjun; Tkachenko, Denis] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Qu, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",qu@bu.edu; tkatched@bu.edu,"Tkachenko, Denis/AAV-1036-2020; Malyutina, Tatiana/AAF-5268-2019","Tkachenko, Denis/0000-0002-0255-5152; Malyutina, Tatiana/0000-0002-0144-6464",,,,,29,43,50,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Furthermore, poorer countries do not just trade less, but have a lower number of trading partners. In this paper, I construct and estimate a general equilibrium model of trade that captures both these features of the trade data. The key element of the model is an association between trade costs (both variable and fixed) and countries' development levels, which can account for the effect of per capita income on trade volumes and explain many zeros in bilateral trade flows. I find that market access costs play an important role in fitting the model to the data. In a counterfactual analysis, I find that removing the asymmetries in trade costs raises welfare in all countries with an average percentage change equal to 29% and larger gains for smaller and poorer countries.

The direct effect of the HIV epidemic is that it increases mortality and morbidity. The two indirect effects, resulting from the first, are the reduction in productivity of adults and the transmission of the disease to their offsprings. We allow these different effects to act either separately or together, and we investigate the marginal efficiency of health expenditures on the survival probability of individuals and demographics. The direct effect of the HIV virus is that it leads adults to increase their own health expenditure and to decrease that of their children. On the contrary, the transmission effect of the HIV virus leads parents to spend more on their children than on their own. We show that the reduction in productivity of young adults decreases health expenditures for themselves and their children. Furthermore, we find that the productivity effect dominates by large the two others. Moreover, when adults decide to have fewer children because of HIV, we show that the ratio of low to high skilled workers increases. This demographic impact impoverishes the economy in the short and medium run. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the constraint imposed by the quota caused a significant drop in the stock price at the announcement of the law and a large decline in Tobin's Q over the following years, consistent with the idea that firms choose boards to maximize value.

We show that the strict alternative between wage-led and profit-led growth is misguided, and that an expansion of real wages and employment is feasible when enduring incomes policies are established.

However, problems arise because these mutually amicable paths of trade and health policies are occasionally thrown into disarray, as demonstrated by the recent beef struggles in Korea. This struggle demonstrates how badly a legitimate trade liberalization effort can be thrown into disarray if there is a lack of a consensus-building process in domestic politics. It also shows how deeply domestic politics may penetrate trade policies in situations in which there is an imbalance of power among interest groups. Serious and continuous procedural steps must be taken through active communication with the general public so that unnecessary political struggles induced by misinformation and consumer anxiety can he minimized. Without building consumer confidence in domestic politics, any international standards or scientific principles may only build a house of cards. To shape integrated trade and health policies in highly political environments, governments need to maintain a high-level health and food safety management system. Such a system, based on an overall balance of interest between domestic producers and consumers, should help stabilize their long-term trade relationship with the world.","Ewha Womans Univ, Sch Law, Seoul, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Choi, WM (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Sch Law, Seoul, South Korea.",wmchoi91@hanmail.net,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,12,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

This assumption generates amplification in the response of labour market variables to technology shocks by producing endogenous countercyclical mark-ups. The cyclical fluctuations of vacancies and unemployment in our model can replicate those observed in the US data, with labour market tightness being 20 times more volatile than consumption. Vacancies display a hump-shaped response to technology shocks and the numerical simulations generate an artificial Beveridge curve that is in line with the data. Our model preserves the assumption of fully flexible wages for new hires and the calibration is consistent with the estimated elasticity of unemployment to unemployment benefits. Finally, we show that in contrast to models with exogenous mark-up shocks, the deep habits model does not require an implausible variation in the elasticity of demand to match the volatility of labour market variables, and the cyclical properties of the mark-up are in line with empirical evidence.

We incorporate this factor into an otherwise ordinary principal-agent framework and examine its impact on the optimal incentive scheme and the agent's behavior, especially focusing on the form of intrapersonal strategy known as self-handicapping. Incorporating self-esteem concerns into a contracting situation yields an implication that runs counter to conventional wisdom; that is, the standard tradeoff between risk and incentives may break down (i.e., more uncertainty reduces agency cost and hence results in stronger incentives) in the presence of self-esteem concerns. This is because uncertainty mitigates the need for self-handicapping. This result provides a possible reason for why we do not empirically observe this tradeoff in a robust manner. We present an intuitive condition for this anomaly to arise and provide a set of testable implications. The present framework also reveals why and how team production can be made more profitable, which provides an explanation for the increasing popularity of team production. Finally, this simple logic is applied to identify additional implications for the hidden costs of external enforcers, such as evaluation and monitoring, which are discussed extensively in social psychology.

In addition to obtaining results for a falling employment share of agriculture and a rising share of services, we demonstrate analytically the hump-shaped share of manufacturing by identifying two countervailing effects: the productivity effect and the BalassaSamuelson effect. The first effect, arising from differential rates of productivity growth among sectors, increases the share of manufacturing; the second effect, together with low rates of substitution between products, enhances the service sector and eventually draws labour from the manufacturing sector. At the aggregate level, however, the economy maintains a constant rate of growth.

Players who reach agreement are removed from the network without replacement. The global logic of efficient matchings and the local nature of bargaining, in combination with the irreversible exit of player pairs following agreements, create severe hurdles to the attainment of efficiency in equilibrium. For many networks all Markov perfect equilibria of the bargaining game are inefficient, even as players become patient. We investigate how incentives need to be structured in order to achieve efficiency via subgame perfect, but non-Markovian, equilibria. The analysis extends to an alternative model in which individual players are selected according to sonic probability distribution, and a chosen player can select a neighbor with whom to bargain.

This paper concerns the relationship between changes in the US dollar-Deutsche Mark exchange rate and returns to short investments in US and German long-term government bonds. The hypothesis that expected returns to investments in bonds denominated in the two currencies are equal is not rejected, and the estimated slope coefficients are positive.

We develop a simple general equilibrium model that can handle taxes on five major tax classes, and can be calibrated with little more than national accounts data. A key feature of our model is the explicit recognition of the informal economy. Our base case estimate of the average MCF from marginal increases in all five tax instruments is 1.2. Focusing on the lowest cost tax instruments in each country, commonly the VAT but not always, the average MCF is 1.1. Finally extending the tax base to include sections of the informal economy by removing some tax exemptions offers the potential for a low MCF source of public funds, and a lowering of MCFs on other tax instruments.

Identification of the effects of (endogenous) cyclical expenditure policy is achieved by exploiting the exogeneity of countries' political and institutional characteristics, which we find to be relevant determinants of the cyclicality of expenditures. There are three main results: first, both pro- and countercyclical expenditure policy amplify output volatility, much in a way like pure fiscal shocks; second, output volatility, due to variations in cyclical and discretionary fiscal policy, is negatively associated with economic growth; third, there is no direct effect of cyclicality on economic growth other than through output volatility.","[Badinger, Harald] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Badinger, Harald] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Badinger, H (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria.",harald.badinger@wu.ac.at,,"Badinger, Harald/0000-0002-7238-5136",,,,,23,8,8,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In capturing the effect of trade protection on tariff evasion, we use a much improved measure of trade protection (MAcMap-HS6 2001 and 2004). For two of these countries, this dataset allows the novelty of using variation in trade protection across product, time, and trading partners leading to significantly refined estimates of evasion elasticity relative to existing studies on tariff evasion. We find a robust evidence for positive elasticity of evasion with respect to tariffs in Kenya and Nigeria with relatively weaker evidence for Mauritius. Our results match the rankings of countries in institutional quality. Greater responsiveness of evasion to the level of tariffs is established in Nigeria (comparatively weak institutional quality) vis-a-vis Kenya, and in Kenya vis-a-vis Mauritius (comparatively good institutional quality). This pattern is preserved even when focusing on same set of trading partners and same set of imported products for the three countries. This result is robust to controlling for protection on related products (that creates incentives/opportunities for evasion) and also for degree of differentiation of the product and some other characteristics.","[Bouet, Antoine; Roy, Devesh] MTID, IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Bouet, Antoine] Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, LAREFI, Bordeaux, France",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Universite de Bordeaux,"Bouët, A (通讯作者)，MTID, IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",a.bouet@cgiar.org,,"Bouet, Antoine/0000-0002-8020-8877",,,,,24,10,10,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

National and regional data on job vacancies and unemployment are combined to estimate the Beveridge curves of five European countries and their regions, focusing on the period 1975 to 2004. I also analyse whether shifts in European Beveridge curves are due to changes in the composition of the unemployed pool, labour market rigidities or cyclical and structural shocks. The empirical evidence suggests that changes in labour market rigidities, long term unemployment, as well as cyclical shocks are responsible for outward shifts in European Beveridge curves.

Accounting information systems play a significant role in providing the financial information for decision making within an organization. The systems are simultaneously providing information for a variety of other decision makers in production, human resources, finance, management, marketing, and supply chain logistics. Unfortunately, accounting systems often do not support business properly. The causes may be: systems mostly are too large and complex to comprehend them in entirety and traditional information technologies are not efficient. There is a need to adopt the newest technologies in small to medium sized business. In the paper investigated study showed the newest trends in accounting information systems for small to medium sized business. One of the newest trends in the information technologies world is cloud computing based technology. Accounting transfer to cloud is a new and innovative solution that can help save significant funds small and medium-sized enterprises.

To illustrate this view, we have constructed a two sector model of productivity differences in which the level of technology is determined endogenously depending on the aggregate capital externalities. The relative supply of skilled and unskilled labor determines the direction of technical choices of the countries and differences in these relative factor supplies lead to cross-country income differences combined with the fact that capital is more productive in the advance of the skilled labor complement technologies than in the unskilled labor complement technologies.","Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University,"Dinç, T (通讯作者)，Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",adinc@yildiz.edu.tr,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,5,,,,,583,598,,10.2298/PAN1205583D,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,068XA,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313398300003,0

Since most freshwater withdrawals are for agriculture, reliance on water embodied in imported food (trade in 'virtual water') is a possible strategy to provide food to water-stressed regions while conserving their scarce supply for other purposes. To evaluate this proposition, we extend a model of interregional trade by (1) defining endowments of water that cannot be exceeded, (2) allowing simultaneous operation of rainfed and irrigated agriculture, and (3) distinguishing sub-regional endowments within a larger economic region. An application to the Mexican economy compares region-specific water abundance with economic comparative advantage under alternative scenarios. We conclude that the water-rich regions of Mexico are relatively high-cost producers of food and that they do not pick up the slack even when the lowest-cost Mexican regions are constrained by binding water constraints.","[Duchin, Faye; Lopez-Morales, Carlos] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Duchin, F (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",duchin@rpi.edu,"López-Morales, Carlos A/AAM-6293-2020","Lopez Morales, Carlos Andres/0000-0001-9296-7136",,,,,54,33,34,3,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Because of the nature of such goods, the demand curve for network markets typically rises and then falls. If the marginal cost curve of the producer is also upwardly sloping, the firm may be either unable to profitably produce a sufficient quantity to satisfy demand at any price, or may be able to, but benefit more if there are other producers also. Interestingly, optimal behavior by the producer is independent of the type of competition that will exist between the firms after the competitors have entered the market. Because the firm controls the number of entrants, it can always guarantee that it will receive maximal profits given the demand function and its technology. Implications for antitrust legislation and for strategic behavior by the firm are discussed.","[Weiss, Avi] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The findings from panel instrumental variable regression confirm international trade to have caused income to rise on average across all the trading nations, but particularly so for countries of developing Asia, where this effect appears to be strongest. By contrast, domestic trade potential as explained by country size is found to be less relevant a factor explaining the rise in income of developing Asia. In light of a likely softening of external demand for Asian exports, as global rebalancing will take hold, Asia's underexploited domestic market potential represents considerable scope for the region to step up its efforts to gradually reinforce the domestic and regional dimensions as an additional engine of growth.","Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Ferrarini, B (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines.",bferrarini@adb.org,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We address this issue when contracts are renegotiable. More precisely, we analyze the equilibrium outcomes of two-stage games with renegotiation-proof third-party contracts in relation to the equilibrium outcomes of the same game without contracts. We assume that one of the parties in the contractual relationship is unable to observe everything that happens in the game when played by the other party. We first show that when contracts are non-renegotiable, the set of equilibrium outcomes of the game with contracts is restricted to a subset of Nash equilibrium outcomes of the original game. Introducing renegotiation, in general, imposes further constraints and in some games implies that only subgame perfect equilibrium outcomes of the original game can be supported. However, there is a large class of games in which non-subgame perfect equilibrium outcomes can also be supported, and hence, third-party contracts still have strategic implications even when they are renegotiable.","[Gerratana, Emanuele] Columbia Univ, SIPA, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kockesen, Levent] Koc Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Columbia University; Koc University,"Gerratana, E (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, SIPA, New York, NY 10027 USA.",eg198@columbia.edu; lkockesen@ku.edu.tr,"Kockesen, Levent/AAX-1291-2020; Kockesen, Levent/AAT-3425-2020","Kockesen, Levent/0000-0001-6877-0739;",,,,,23,2,2,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6124,1935-1704,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Given the ongoing uncertainty of economic conditions and the obvious difficulty of forecasting the stability of coalition policy, it is not possible to arrive at a firm conclusion as to the sustainability of the recent change of policy direction. Nevertheless, in a critical assessment of policy in three areas-labour market governance, the life course and the public sector-the paper argues that the UK is witnessing an intensified neoliberal policy emphasis, a redrawing or abolition of minimum standards and failures to meet changing patterns of social needs. While the collectivist elements of New Labour's social policy approach were contradictory in many respects, the coalition government through a withdrawal of the state and obtuse pronouncements about the big society is seeking to embed in the UK a stronger neoliberal approach to social policy. Flawed assumptions about the scope for traditional families and localised big society programmes to compensate for state withdrawal mean the trajectory of change is not clear-cut; preferences for collectivist and publicly accountable solutions to issues of social policy are unlikely to be easily eroded. However, ongoing policy change during the austerity crisis is already inflicting radical change with adverse impacts upon many groups of society.","[Grimshaw, Damian; Rubery, Jill] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Rubery, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St W, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",Jill.Rubery@manchester.ac.uk,"Hayashi, Mayumi/G-8961-2013","Hayashi, Mayumi/0000-0002-5666-8718; Grimshaw, Damian/0000-0002-4564-4841",,,,,69,86,94,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Rules are reinforced over time based on their historically observed payoffs in a given game. Past works on rule learning have shown that when playing a single game over a number of rounds, players can learn to form sophisticated beliefs about others. Here we are interested in learning that occurs between games where the set of actions is not directly comparable from one game to the next. We study a sequence of ten thrice-played dissimilar games. Using experimental data, we find that our rule learning model captures the ability of players to learn to reason across games. However, this learning appears different from within-game rule learning as previously documented. The main adjustment in sophistication occurs by switching from non-belief-based strategies to belief-based strategies. The sophistication of the beliefs themselves increases only slightly over time.

Because air pollution and solid waste are not produced independently of one another, we identify the settings in which it is meaningful to institute a separate policy for mitigating each pollutant, versus those in which only one pollutant needs to be actively addressed. The scenarios considered here represent a range of options that could be available to policy makers, depending on the country's international commitments and the effects on economic and environmental variables.","[Hristu-Varsakelis, Dimitrios] Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Karagianni, Stella] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Pempetzoglou, Maria] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Social Adm, Komotini, Greece; [Sfetsos, Athanasios] NCSR Demokritos, Environm Res Lab, INT RP, Aghia Paraskevi, Greece",University of Macedonia; University of Macedonia; Democritus University of Thrace; National Centre of Scientific Research Demokritos,"Hristu-Varsakelis, D (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece.",dcv@uom.gr,"Hristu-Varsakelis, Dimitrios/AAL-4894-2021; PEMPETZOGLOU, MARIA/AAP-1331-2021","Sfetsos, Athanasios/0000-0003-1906-8059; Hristu-Varsakelis, Dimitrios/0000-0002-2186-0865",,,,,36,6,11,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Three categories of thresholds, which are housing prices, housing volumes and price-to-income ratios, are adopted in an attempt to examine the US state-level housing market cycles in multiple dimensions. In general, while lagged differenced thresholds fail to capture the recent housing boom-and-bust regime switching, moving-average thresholds succeed in signalling a housing crisis in many states. The regime-switching autoregressive structures show that housing price cycle has remarkable series dependence, and the housing volume cycle tends to show a mean-reversion pattern. Most importantly, only four states, Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada, display the bust regime of housing price growth during 2006 to 2010. The price-over-income also indicates that less than five states have significant two switching regimes. Otherwise, most states exhibit low-growth regime of housing permits, implying a nationwide housing volume cycle during the current housing crisis. The forecasting system provides a helpful guideline for policy-making of the government as well as household decisions of consumption and investment.","Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management Finance, Tao Yuan 320, Taiwan",Yuan Ze University,"Huang, MC (通讯作者)，Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management Finance, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Tao Yuan 320, Taiwan.",huamaggie@saturn.yzu.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,1,1,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Labor is used in the agricultural, resource extraction and conflict sectors, and the groups also buy a capital input to conflict subject to the constraint that capital spending cannot exceed resource earnings. I find that exogenous shocks can have different effects on conflict intensity depending on whether the credit constraint binds. In particular, international policies to ban natural resource exports from conflict zones (e.g. 'blood diamonds'), raise agricultural productivity or limit the import of weapons will limit conflict intensity if the credit constraint binds. However, if the credit constraint does not bind, then the first two policies promote conflict, and so could even the third policy. The results therefore suggest some caution in international policymaking. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

S. investment during the boom-bust cycle of 1995-2003. This view is formalized and evaluated in a general equilibrium model with news shocks about future productivity and preferences for financial wealth. The model generates a boom-bust cycle in response to good news that is not realized. A method is devised to estimate the productivity prospects: a series that captures the effects of news shocks on economic decisions. The estimated series rises during the boom, falls during the recession and helps forecast future productivity shocks at several horizons. The model's predictions for sample paths of hours worked, output, investment, consumption, wages and stock prices are largely in conformity with U. S. data. The model therefore offers a possible solution to several puzzles identified in the literature regarding the 1990's boom and the 2001 recession.","Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Karnizova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",lkarnizo@uottawa.ca,,"Karnizova, Lilia/0000-0003-1841-567X",,,,,43,6,6,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to extend the existing models of strategic alignment and include such factors. The study proposes a conceptual model that adds two new linkages of environment and resources in existing literature on IS strategic alignment. The first part of the model proposes a relationship between environment and strategies (business strategy and IS strategy); and among business resources and strategies. Whereas the second part proposes the relation of IS strategic alignment and organizational performance. The proposed model also suggests that strategic alignment of business strategy and IS strategy is a better predictor of performance than business strategy alone. It is a qualitative study which provides conceptual groundwork to test the proposed model empirically in future studies.","[Khan, Sana Akbar; Qureshi, Salman Ali] Iqra Univ, Islamabad, Pakistan",Iqra University,"Khan, SA (通讯作者)，Iqra Univ, Islamabad, Pakistan.",,,,,,,,48,1,1,0,23,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

In the simulations we control the data generating process, which ensures that we obtain accurate TME metrics. In the real-data portion of our analysis we use estimates of TME provided by a major test publisher. In both the simulations and real-data analyses, we find that inference from VAMs is improved by making simple TME adjustments to the models. The improvement is larger in the simulations, but even in the real-data analysis the improvement is on the order of what one could expect if teacher-level sample sizes were increased by 11 to 17 percent.","[Koedel, Cory; Leatherman, Rebecca; Parsons, Eric] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Koedel, C (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",koedelc@missouri.edu; rebecca.whitworth@mail.missouri.edu; parsonses@missouri.edu,,,,,,,54,18,21,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We consider the inflation rates of thirty developed and emerging economies using quarterly data for the period 1958 to 2007 which include alternative monetary policy regimes. The coefficient of the inflation parameter is estimated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) models. Furthermore, the grid-bootstrap Median Unbiased (MUB) estimator approach developed by Hansen (1999) is used to estimate the finite sample OLS estimates coupled with the 95% symmetric confidence interval.

This study focuses primarily on 20 major cities in Taiwan and China. Using annual data for each city over the period 2001-2007, this study observes the relative efficiency of major cities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait with the authentication of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model and Bootstrap confidence interval model. This study measures the long-term competitiveness achieved through urban changes through the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) and also measures the structural productivity changes to understand the strengths and weaknesses of individual cities as well as differences in their competitiveness, and to establish future development directions for each city. Finally, this study applies the Bootstrap to obtain an accurate confidence interval for evaluating the accuracy of various efficiency indicators through the MPI. Based on multi-input and multi-output data, this study examines whether the main cities in Taiwan and China use their resources effectively to enhance urban efficiency of competitiveness and provide inefficient cities with suggestions on improvement.","[Liu, Chun-Chu] Chang Jung Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, Tainan, Taiwan; [Chuang, Li-Min; Huang, Chien-Min] Chang Jung Christian Univ, Grad Sch Business & Operat Management, Tainan, Taiwan",Chang Jung Christian University; Chang Jung Christian University,"Liu, CC (通讯作者)，Chang Jung Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, Tainan, Taiwan.",lcc@mail.cjcu.edu.tw,,"Liu, Chun chu/0000-0002-0727-0164",,,,,13,1,1,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Recently, this practice has come under legal scrutiny motivated by models which suggest syndicates are anti-competitive. These models do not account for two important features of financial markets: bidders' value estimates are likely to be correlated, and complicated mechanisms known to be optimal in such settings are usually eschewed in favor of simpler auction formats. We show that these features make it possible for syndicate bidding to generate higher revenues for the auctioneer than bidding among independent firms, even when syndicates are asymmetric or lead to a highly concentrated market. This occurs because syndication can make the industry more suitable to the simple auction format in use. We identify conditions under which syndicates are pro-competitive and discuss the implications for antitrust.","[Mares, Vlad] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Shor, Mikhael] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT USA",Northwestern University; University of Connecticut,"Mares, V (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",v-mares@kellogg.northwestern.edu; Mike.Shor@owen.vanderbilt.edu,"Shor, Mikhael/ABE-4407-2020","Shor, Mikhael/0000-0002-2027-3810",,,,,57,1,1,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The conclusion is momentous: adopting voting technologies that minimize under-voting in presidential races actually increases under-voting across all races on the same ballot. This study extends Lott's by examining the Congressional vote on the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA 2002), which established a program to provide funds to states in order to replace punch card voting systems with newer technologies. We focus on the racial component of Lott's finding, specifically that Hispanic-American voters exhibit greater rates of voter fatigue than do white voters. This study posits that, given the large Hispanic-American populations in California and Texas and their propensity to support Democrats in these states, House Democrats from these states would not view the HAVA 2002 as favourably as House Democrats from other parts of the US. Among other results presented here, the data show that support for HAVA 2002 among California and Texas House Democrats was 11.6 percentage points below that of House Democrats from the other 48 states.","[Mixon, Franklin G., Jr.] Columbus State Univ, D Abbott Turner Coll Business & Comp Sci, Columbus, GA 31907 USA; [King, Ernest W.] Univ So Mississippi, Coll Business, Dept Finance Real Estate & Business Law, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA",University System of Georgia; Columbus State University; University of Southern Mississippi,"Mixon, FG (通讯作者)，Columbus State Univ, D Abbott Turner Coll Business & Comp Sci, Columbus, GA 31907 USA.",mixon_franklin@colstate.edu,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Time-series data for the total insurance premium of 35 insurance companies in China during the December 2005 to May 2011 period are used. Since other panel-based unit root tests are joint tests of a unit root for all members of a panel and are incapable of determining the mix of I(0) and I(1) series in a panel setting, the SPSM, proposed by Georgios Chortareas and George Kapetanios (2009), classifies a whole panel into a group of stationary series and a group of non-stationary series. In doing so, we can clearly identify how many and which series in the panel are stationary processes. The empirical results from the SPSM tests unequivocally indicate that Gibrat's Law is only valid for one of these 35 companies studied here. Our study has important policy implications for insurance regulation, insurance market construction, and policyholder protection.","[Pan, Guochen] Wuhan Univ, Dept Insurance & Actuarial Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sen-Sung] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan",Wuhan University; Feng Chia University; Feng Chia University,"Pan, GC (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Dept Insurance & Actuarial Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",pan.guochen@gmail.com; chenss@fcu.edu.tw; tychang@fcu.edu.tw,"pan, guochen/D-3056-2013",,,,,,29,2,2,0,14,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,3,,,,,311,324,,10.2298/PAN1203311P,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,964RB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305713300004,0

A more detailed examination, however, shows that Poland fitted best to the euro area in the years 2004-2005, just after its accession to the EU, while in the last years the OCA index, measuring the concordance of the Polish economy with the euro area, deteriorated, due mainly to the discrepancy of cyclical fluctuations during the lat economic crisis.","Univ Lodz, Katedra Funkcjonowania Gospodarki, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Pilat, K (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Katedra Funkcjonowania Gospodarki, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",katarzyna.pilat@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,3,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2012,,3,,,,,325,338,,,,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,965KJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305766400003,0

A selection of suitable management tools for organization requires consideration of characteristics of the known tools, comparison of different tools, and consideration of demands and conditions of the organizations. But direct comparison of different management tools is not possible because of their content-related and methodological differences. In management theory, various authors tried to consider the use of management tools more deeply. The main purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of important organizational factors on usage of single management tools in Slovenian organizations. Thus, we consider: 1) usage patterns of management tools in different areas worldwide, 2) the influence of single organizational factors - i.e. education, position, and working years, on the usage of management tools in Slovenian organizations, and 3) the influence of a linear combination of selected factors on usage of management tools in Slovenian organizations. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative analysis is applied on the basis of the selected cognitions from Management, and Organization. The quantitative analysis includes desk research about the management tools, and analysis of the results from a survey about management tools in Slovenian organizations in 2010. In examining the impact of the considered organizational factors (separately and in combination) on management tools we use linear regression analysis to predict the influence of single factors and linear combination of the selected factors on the use of selected management tools. AMOS 17.0 was used for analysis. Findings - Intensity of management tools usage in Slovenian organizations is similar to the global patterns, while patterns of their usage are rather different. Examination of factors influencing usage of the top five management tools in Slovenian organizations reveal: education has the strongest impact on the usage of management tools, the impact of employees' position in organization is weaker, and the impact of working years is very weak. When we take into consideration all three predictors simultaneously, the impact of education and position becomes weaker, while the impact of working years becomes insignificant. We apply a deeper approach to gauge the influence of organizational factors on usage of the selected management tools. The impact of other considered factors, we find, is not significant. Research limitations/implications - Research is limited to a hypothesis, broader qualitative aspects encountered during desk research, and some quantitative analysis of results from our survey. We test our hypotheses and the chosen model on the top five management tools most used by employees in Slovenian organizations. Practical implications - Authors try to overcome the prevailing practice of very general consideration of management tools usage, especially regarding organizational factors, which influence the usage of management tools. Authors suggest a new approach, hardly known in the main-stream literature. They propose a more specific and target-oriented approach to consideration of management tools usage in business. Originality/value - Available management literature does not provide a similar solution for considering and researching the usage of management tools in business. This is useful for business practice in organizations, for advancing the usage of management tools, since the most important organizational factors on management tools usage are outlined.","[Potocan, Vojko; Nedelko, Zlatko; Mulej, Matjaz] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Potocan, V (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",vojko.potocan@uni-mb.si; zlatko.nedelko@uni-mb.si; mulej@uni-mb.si,,"Nedelko, Zlatko/0000-0002-6840-877X",,,,,45,20,22,0,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

To test this phenomenon, data on the attendances of five English and two Italian city rival clubs is used to conduct a cointegration analysis. The results imply that a stable relationship does not exist between the attendance series which throws doubt on the proposition that supporters of a team are unlikely to switch their support to a rival club. To test the possibility that this result could be due to fickle supporters ceasing to attend, a sensitivity analysis is conducted between attendances and performance.","Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Robinson, T (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",terry.a.robinson@mbs.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,31,34,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A number of worldwide investors - so-called water funds - have started to take up this challenge. For these global water investors, knowledge about the extent of integration between the water sectors of financial markets is highly important. According to international portfolio diversification theory, the less (more) integrated markets are, the more (less) benefits there are from international diversification. In this study, we investigate the extent and manner of interdependence among the US, European and Asian water sector of the equity markets based on Vector Autoregression (VAR), Granger causality and impulse response analyses. We find that world water stock market prices are indeed significantly interdependent although this interdependence varies across time periods. Each market quickly responds to shocks from each other and completes its response within 3 days. Hence, for water investors, international diversification that is undertaken just within the water sector will not be beneficial. The result also implies that there is the risk of crossmarket contagion - that is, price volatility spill over across water sectors of different financial markets, and therefore, water authorities in one market should take cognisance of events in other markets.","[Roca, Eduardo] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Tularam, Gurudeo Anand] Griffith Univ, Fac Sci Engn Environm & Technol, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Roca, E (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",E.Roca@griffith.edu.au,"Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023",,,,,,26,12,12,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

(Neutrally stable strategies are also known as weakly evolutionarily stable strategies.) Such neutrally, but not evolutionarily stable strategies can however still be relatively stable or unstable, depending on whether or not the neutral mutants it allows for - which by definition do not have a selective advantage themselves - can open doors for other mutants that do have a selective advantage. This paper defines robustness against indirect invasions in order to be able to discern between those two very different situations. Being robust against indirect invasions turns out to be equivalent to being an element of a minimal ES set, where this minimal ES set is the set that consists of this strategy and its (indirect) neutral mutants. This is useful, because we know that ES sets are asymptotically stable in the replicator dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Paul Warburg, its principal architect had in mind that a U.S. central bank would follow Bagehot's strictures 'to lend freely at a penalty rate' in the face of a scramble for high powered money. Yet the Federal Reserve Act never spelled out how the Fed was supposed to act as an LLR. This omission came to the fore in the Great Contraction 1929 to 1933 when the Fed failed to prevent four banking panics which turned a serious recession into the Great Contraction. Reforms in the 1930s corrected some of the Fed's failures but clamped down on financial activity for 40 years. The financial crisis problem returned in the 1970s with financial liberalization. The Fed abandoned Bagehot's strictures and adopted the 'Too big to fail' doctrine and 'creative ambiguity'. This policy shift contributed to moral hazard and created new threats to financial stability with the rise of the 'shadow banking system'. The subprime mortgage crisis prompted the Fed to take unprecedented LLR activities which have opened up a Pandora's box of perils. The Fed has moved away from rules based policy in its LLR function.

We argue that the profound implication of an advancing state sector is not the size expansion of the state ownership in the economy per se, but the likely retardation of the development of the already financially constrained private sector and the issues around the sustainability of the already weakening Chinese economy growth. Drawing on recent methodological advances, we provide a critical analysis of the contributions of the state and non-state sectors in the aggregate Total Factor Productivity and its growth over the period of 1998-2007 to verify the existence of GJMT and its possible impacts on Chinese economic growth. Overall, we find strong and consistent evidence of a systematic and worsening resource misallocation within the state sector and/or between the state sectors and private sectors over time. This suggests that non-market forces allow resources to be driven away from their competitive market allocation and towards the inefficient state sector.

One is the multidimensional choice set arising from the interdependence of the voucher, public education spending, and taxation. Second, even absent a voucher, preferences over public spending are not single-peaked; a middling level of public school spending may be less attractive to a household than either high public school spending or private education coupled with low public spending. We show that Besley and Coate's (1997) representative democracy model provides a viable approach to overcome these hurdles. We provide a complete characterization of equilibria with an endogenous voucher. A voucher is adopted in political equilibrium provided the coefficient of variation of income is sufficiently small. We undertake a parallel quantitative analysis and we find that no voucher arises in equilibrium for the U.S. income distribution, which exhibits too much heterogeneity. For a tighter income distribution, including those in Douglas County, Colorado where a voucher was recently adopted, our model predicts a positive voucher. Public support for a not-too-large voucher arises because the cross subsidy to public school expenditure from those switching to private schools outweighs the subsidy to those who attend private school in the absence of a voucher.

We identify 43 episodes over a period of nearly 3 decades in 94 rich, middle-income and transition countries. Unemployment reductions often coincide with an acceleration of growth and an improvement in macroeconomic conditions. Episodes are much more prevalent in countries with higher levels of unemployment and, given unemployment, are more likely in countries with better regulation. An efficient legal system that enforces contracts expeditiously is particularly important for reducing unemployment. The results imply that while employment is largely related to the business cycle, better regulation reduces likelihood of high unemployment and facilitates a more rapid recovery in the event unemployment builds up.

We find that senders who make decisions on behalf of others do not behave significantly different from senders in our baseline trust game who manage their own money. But receivers return significantly less money when senders send a third party's money. As a result, trust is only profitable in the baseline trust game, but not in the OPM treatment. The treatment effect among the receivers is gender specific. Women return significantly less money in OPM than in baseline, while there is no such treatment effect among men.

The emergence of NIE is a success story by many measures: four Nobel laureates in less than 20 years, increasing penetration of mainstream journals, and significant impacts on major policy debates. This rapid acceptance is remarkable when we consider that it was divided from birth into distinct schools of thought. What will be the future of NIE? Will it be quietly absorbed by mainstream theory, or will it radically transform neoclassical economics into a new paradigm that includes institutions?

Participants in our experiment earn incomes by trading and must collectively choose one of the two tax regimes to raise a given tax revenue. A uniform tax (UT) imposes the same tax rate on all markets and is fair in that it yields the same - but low - income to participants in all markets. The discriminatory tax (DT) imposes a higher burden on markets with inelastic demand and is therefore efficient but it is also unfair in that incomes are unequal across markets. We find that DT is unpopular, as predicted. Surprisingly, however, DT remains unpopular when they are both efficient and produce a fair (equal) distribution. We conclude that non-discrimination (equal treatment) is a salient fairness principle in taxation that shapes voting on commodity taxes above and beyond concerns for efficiency and equal distribution.

However, the bias-corrected Malmquist productivity index offers a remedy to this shortcoming. This paper, thus, employed the bias-corrected Malmquist productivity index to measurement of the total factor productivity changes in the Lithuanian family farms. The paper employed the Malmquist productivity indices to measure the technical changes (TCs) in terms of input-saving or input-use. Specifically, a sample of 200 family farms was used for the analysis. The research period covered years 2004-2009. The three farming types were considered, namely crop, livestock, and mixed farming. The analysis indicted that crop farming was peculiar with land-using and asset-saving TC, whereas labour-using and intermediate consumption saving TCs were observed only for certain combinations of inputs. As for livestock farms these generally experienced intermediate consumption and asset saving TCs against all the remaining inputs, whereas labour-saving and land-using TC varied with the reference inputs. Finally, mixed farms can be considered as those peculiar with increasing land use and decreasing capital consumption. Labour-using and intermediate consumption saving TCs did also hold for most of the analysed factors. The Lithuanian agricultural sector has not been analysed by the means of the bias-corrected Malmquist indices. Furthermore, there is a gap in the literature on the efficiency and total factor productivity in the Lithuanian farms in general. The present study, therefore, presents insights on the technology change based on non-parametric estimates.","Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics,"Balezentis, T (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",tomas@laei.lt,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711",,,,,42,8,8,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2014,41.0,4,,,,,731,746,,10.1007/s10663-013-9234-y,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS6BC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344348900007,0

The optimal-taxation literature has often concentrated on representative-agent models, in which it is optimal to smooth distortionary taxes. When tax liabilities are unevenly spread in the population, deviations from tax smoothing lead to interest rate changes that redistribute wealth. When a bad shock hits the economy, the optimal policy will then call for smaller or larger deficits, depending on the political power of different groups. This effect is particularly relevant in the case of large shocks to government finances, such as wars.","[Bassetto, Marco] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Bassetto, Marco] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA",University of London; University College London; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Bassetto, M (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",bassetto@nber.org,,"Bassetto, Marco/0000-0001-8325-8450",,,,,23,16,17,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

This study focuses on inventory information shocks using a new measure rather than on inventory changes themselves. The empirical results reveal that inventory information shocks rather than actual inventory changes negatively affect crude oil returns on the day the EIA releases the inventory information, although inventory shocks have no effect on daily conditional variance, which mainly follows a GARCH(1,1) process. To test the robustness of our model, we re-estimate the models for three subsamples.

We collect nationally representative information concerning individual willingness to pay for several packages of social security benefits; identify and quantify for the first time three specific distortions caused by existing social security and social assistance systems; and simulate the gains that social protection reforms would bring about in terms of reduced labor distortions. We find that workers in Colombia, regardless of occupation, have a very similar willingness to pay for the full insurance package below 20% of their labor earnings and very similar valuation of social protection services about 50% below par. Labor distortions are large, as expected from very high labor costs, but we quantify an implicit formality tax and informality subsidy ranging between 2 and 27 percent of different representative workers' earnings. Critically, the long-discussed reforms in Colombia including the elimination of parafiscales will not reduce substantially the multiple distortions in its labor market.

Due to the data structure, we apply a Multilevel Random Coefficient Model to test our hypotheses.

To accommodate various dependence and tail decay patterns, this study models energy returns using different generalized hyperbolic conditional distributions and time-varying conditional mean and covariance. Employing daily energy futures data from August 2005 to March 2012, the authors recursively estimate the models and evaluate tail risk measures for the portfolio's profit-and-loss distribution for long and short positions at various horizons and confidence levels. Both in-sample and out-of-sample analyses applied to different energy portfolios show the importance of heavy tails and positive asymmetry in the distribution of energy risk factors. Thus, tail risk measures for energy portfolios based on standard methods (e.g. normality, constant covariance matrix) and on models with exponential tail decay underestimate actual tail risk, especially for short positions and short time horizons.

Using monthly data of Korean exports to the world and to the US. from 2000:01 to 2014:06, and a bivariate GARCH estimator with corrections for leptokurtic errors, the paper shows that won/dollar real exchange rate volatility has positive and significant impact on Korean heavyweight industry's export to the world, while won/dollar real exchange rate volatility has negative and insignificant impact on Korean heavyweight industry's export to the US.. The impact of won/dollar on the other three industries (food, material, lightweight) is not significant for both markets.

While estimating housing consumption for tenants amounts to observing rents, estimating housing consumption for owner-occupiers is challenging because it is not directly observable and interest payments vary with re-paid principals. In order to examine the housing consumption for owner-occupiers, this article combines micro data sets on income and imputed rents for owner-occupiers based on home attributes from a consumer expenditure survey and monthly rents in a rental survey. This allows estimation of an Engel curve of owner-occupied consumption, both parametrically and non-parametrically.

The changes of industries and employment structure have the government, in consideration of budgets and downsizing, apply Human Resource Outsourcing and introduce temporary employees to reduce labor personnel costs and labor flexibility and to solve the demands for temporary and non-core businesses for achieving the innovation of administrative services and organizational reform as well as enhance organizational competitiveness. Acquiring expected and stable temporary employees with favorable work performance is a dilemma for personnel units. By distributing and collecting questionnaires on-site, 230 copies of questionnaires were distributed to the superiors and public servants in various sectors of Kaohsiung City Government. A total of 169 valid copies were retrieved, with the retrieval rate of 73%. The empirical results show partially positive effects of Human Resource Outsourcing on Service Concept, Customer Interface, and Delivery System in Service Innovation, significantly positive effects of Human Resource Outsourcing on Technology Option in Service Innovation, and remarkable moderating effects of background variables on the correlations between Human Resource Outsourcing and Service Innovation.","I Shou Univ, Dept Publ Policy & Management, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan",I Shou University,"Liu, HC (通讯作者)，I Shou Univ, Dept Publ Policy & Management, 1,Sec 1,Syuecheng Rd, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan.",hcliu@isu.edu.tw,,,National Science Council of the Republic of China [NSC: 102-2410-H-214-008],"National Science Council of the Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The author would like to thank the National Science Council of the Republic of China for financially supporting this research under contract no.

The focus of the model is observational learning; that is, each agent receives initial private information and makes inferences regarding the private information of others through the repeated interaction with his neighbors in the network. The main question is how well agents aggregate private information through their local interactions. I show that in finite networks consisting exclusively of non-Bayesian (boundedly rational) agents, who revise their choices by averaging over the previous period's observed choices, all agents fail to perfectly aggregate the privately held information. However, the presence of at least one Bayesian agent in a strongly connected network is shown to be generically sufficient for every agent, whether Bayesian or non-Bayesian, to perfectly aggregate the private information of all agents.

In spite of marked differences between its national varieties, a common characteristic of this species can be found in the global monopolisation of knowledge. This monopolisation involves hierarchical relations among firms and between capital and labour, because the capital of some firms includes the exclusive ownership of much of the knowledge used in production. Since the 1994 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreements, the growing commoditisation of knowledge has extended the role of closed science and closed markets at the expense of open science and open markets. The intrinsic long-term dynamics of this species of capitalism is increasingly characterised by financialisation, inequality and stagnation. In order to exit from the current crisis, we must change many features of intellectual monopoly capitalism and rely on an eclectic approach that draws insights from liberal, Keynesian and Marxian traditions.","[Pagano, Ugo] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Pagano, Ugo] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",University of Siena; Central European University,"Pagano, U (通讯作者)，Dept Econ & Stat, Piazza S Francesco 7, I-53010 Siena, Italy.",pagano@unisi.it,,"Pagano, Ugo/0000-0002-9917-5091",,,,,59,115,122,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

However, minor and realistic relaxations of the assumptions underlying the BSH greatly generalise the set of possible influences over real exchange rates. This paper surveys the literature on real exchange rate determination, investigates short-run behaviour, and addresses puzzles over the trends in China's real exchange rate. While China was widely expected to appreciate against the advanced economies following its first growth surge in the mid-1990s, it actually depreciated slightly until the early 2000s. Then, after 2005, its rate of appreciation was more rapid than expected. These puzzles are resolved by accounting for the effects of the trade liberalisations associated with World Trade Organization accession, China's excess saving, and the tightening of rural labour markets.","[Tyers, Rod] Univ Western Australia, Business Sch, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Zhang, Ying] UWA Business Sch, Crawley, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Tyers, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Business Sch, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",rod.tyers@uwa.edu.au,,"Tyers, Rodney/0000-0003-3080-0415",,,,,112,6,6,2,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Using the N-MRIO and the R-MRIO approach allows the study of global and regional issues, respectively. The WF is an indicator influenced by trade among nations and regions. However, the treatment of imports in an R-MRIO approach differs in whether international imports are separated or combined. We evaluate the effects of the difference between these models and discuss policy implications for the Yangtze River, China. The WF calculated using the combined type model is 11% larger than that by the separated type model.

Instead, we find that the provision of social information on past average levels of consumption results in a greater deviation of consumption from both the unconditional and the conditionally optimal paths. We find some improvement in consumption planning relative to the conditional optimum when social concerns (external habits) are explicitly incorporated into subject's period utility functions as in external habit formation preference specifications. Our results on the effects of social information on consumption behavior may help to explain the phenomenon of over-consumption and under-saving that has been observed in many developed countries in recent decades as social information on the behavior of others has become more readily available.

This research has established that UI matters for labor market behavior, in particular the duration of unemployment, although there remains substantial uncertainty about the magnitudes of the effects. The research on MW should have shaken economists' belief in the competitive labor market model as a result of frequent failures to find noticeable employment effects despite considerable effects on wages.

Credit unions are the nonprofit organization used in my analysis. Credit unions provide essentially identical types of consumer financial services and products as commercial banks but do so from. a very different not-for-profit orientation. However, in this study, I document similar asymmetric rate-setting behavior by credit unions.

Second, we find that the program was associated with a very large impact on investment and maintenance of soil conservation measures. This effect was particularly pronounced for female headed households, suggesting that this group had suffered from high levels of tenure insecurity which the program managed to reduce.

Prescott has argued that mandatory saving is socially desirable because it solves the problem of people intentionally free riding and becoming a welfare burden. Inspired by Prescott's argument, we develop a model in which rational individuals choose between saving and free riding. We find that free riding is a robust outcome for a significant share of the population and that everyone, including the free riders, benefits from the elimination of free riding through mandatory saving.

The 'tragedy' arises from several interacting resources and institutions. If the grass on the pasture was not subject to appropriation, the cattle were not privately owned, or property-and contract-enforcement institutions supporting market exchange were absent, then the 'tragedy of the commons' would not have arisen regardless of the open-access pasture.

This process may be accompanied by a reduction in wage fluctuations if labor contracts are used as income smoothing mechanisms. This paper tests to what extent salaried jobs help reduce the volatility of wages by insuring workers against productivity shocks. Analysis of MxFLS data indicates that the average contractual arrangement in Mexico insures the worker against idiosyncratic productivity fluctuations associated with episodes of illness. The evidence is stronger for workers in formal jobs. To validate the methodology, the test is also implemented on a sample of self-employed workers. In this case, it correctly rejects the presence of insurance against productivity shocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the welfare effect of regulating misinformation and strengthening MQSs. We find that the welfare effect of a decrease in misinformation crucially depends on the existing amount of misinformation; moreover, a more stringent MQS either improves or deteriorates welfare. Two effects figure strongly throughout our results. First, changes in misinformation and/or an MQS make price competition between firms more or less serious, causing changes in price and quantity. Second, these changes influence some consumers' choices, leading them to change the products that they purchase. This change in consumption behavior increases or decreases inappropriate choices when misinformation is present.

While most studies found that such price cycles are well characterized by the theoretical Edgeworth price cycle, some studies suggest alternative explanations. This paper contributes to this literature by being the first to compare regular price cycles in a nongasoline product-liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)-with gasoline price cycles. Our main finding is that LPG price cycles in the Perth area of Western Australia are much longer and more asymmetric than gasoline price cycles in the same market.

My analysis identifies why firms choose defensive publishing over patenting and trade secrecy. I present summary data suggesting that defensive publishing has become more common recently, that the composition of firms using it is changing, and that it has emerged especially as a response to the fear of bad patents being issued in the area of software and business methods.

On one level, long-term unemployment can be accounted for by structural changes. But, on another level, the problem of long-term unemployment is really no more complicated than the absence of effective demand. This study looks at the demographics of the long-term unemployed for the years 2007-2010, and compares them to the years 1991-1994 to see what changes have occurred specifically among the long-term unemployed. The data shows that, in terms of structural changes, the 1991-1994 and 2007-2010 periods were not much different. Rather, the nature of this recession resulted in an altered composition of the long-term unemployed. Because long-term unemployment in this recession is a function of a particularly deep recession, a new approach is needed. Based on the data, this study argues for a wage policy that would allow for people to increase their effective demand for goods and services.","Metropolitan Coll New York, Sch Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10013 USA",,"Levin-Waldman, OM (通讯作者)，Metropolitan Coll New York, Sch Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10013 USA.",,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The long time horizon of our database allows us to investigate the stability and robustness of the parameters of the decomposition over time. Specifically, we show that the mobility component of the decomposition, as measured by Gini correlation coefficients, changes over the observation period. This makes it difficult to predict the impact of the income accounting period on inequality in a more general context.

In China, whose population has been aging rapidly, such a challenge is of extreme importance. This article finds that, in China, the cumulative funding gap in pensions should be 2022.34 billion Yuan until 2020, and 71 731.94 billion Yuan until 2050; however, based on the fiscal capacity of the Chinese state, the fiscal burden created by pensions is not expected to create a financial crisis between 2013 and 2020. Furthermore, a fiscal crisis can be avoided between 2021 and 2050 if fiscal revenue increases by at least 6.18% a year on average during that period. This absence of predictable financial crisis does not mean that there are no significant demographic and fiscal issues ahead. This means that China should promote pension reform to prepare for an increasingly heavy financial burden in the future.

There is, for example, considerably less world trade than predicted by Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) models. Trade among rich countries is higher and trade between rich and poor countries lower than suggested by HOV and other supply-driven theories, and trade-to-GDP ratios are higher in rich countries. Our approach focuses on the relationship between characteristics of goods and services in production and characteristics of preferences. In particular, we find a strong and significant positive correlation of more than 45% between a good's skilled-labor intensity and its income elasticity, even when accounting for trade costs and cross-country price differences. Exploring the implications of this correlation for empirical trade puzzles, we find that it can reduce HOV's overprediction of the variance of the net factor content of trade relative to that in the data by about 60%. Since rich countries are relatively skilled-labor abundant, they are relatively specialized in consuming the same goods and services that they are specialized in producing, and so trade more with one another than with poor countries. We also find a positive sector-level correlation between income elasticity and a sector's tradability, which helps explain the higher trade-to-GDP ratios in high-income relative to low-income countries.","[Caron, Justin] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Caron, J (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,50,62,75,5,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We show that storability imposes novel constraints on a monopolist's ability to extract surplus. We then show that the attempt to relax these constraints can generate cyclical patterns in pricing and sales, even when consumers are homogeneous. Thus, the model provides a novel explanation for sales that does not rely on discriminating heterogeneous consumers.

Earlier literature suggests that religiosity insures happiness against various individual stressful life events. This phenomenon is well-explored in developed countries but rarely studied in post-communist countries, where religion was officially suppressed for a long period. These countries have undergone considerable economic transformations over the past two decades. Using cross-sectional Life in Transition Survey data and historical data on religions, I examine if religion insures against economic reforms. The endogeneity of religion is taken into account. The findings suggest that economic reforms may have both positive and negative effects on happiness. Religiosity indeed insures happiness and perceptions of economic and political situations against economic reforms. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (3) (2014) 804-818.

For convex domains, our main theorem characterizes truthful social choice functions as those satisfying two properties: local weak monotonicity and vortex-freeness. The first of these constrains the function values at any two sufficiently proximal points, while the second asserts that its line integrals around sufficiently small triangular loops must vanish. The characterization implies a local-to-global principle that allows one to deduce truthfulness of a function from its behavior on arbitrarily small neighborhoods of each point. Other consequences include a simple alternate derivation of the Saks-Yu Theorem that weak monotonicity characterizes truthfulness of functions having a convex domain and finite range, and a sufficient condition for constructing truthful functions by stitching together truthful subfunctions on different subsets of the domain.

We compare two different policies aimed at supporting less developed countries: climate mitigation by developed countries, which moderates the increase in stock pollution and hence capital depreciation, and income transfers in the tradition of development aid. Under a mild set of assumptions we find that active climate policies are more efficient for developed economies and also, remarkably, better for developing countries than additional development aid. The main reason is the difference between the two policies with respect to their effects on economic growth. The results are robust with respect to possible model extensions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The jointness in crushing oil and meal from the oilseed reduces the size of the link between biodiesel and oilseed prices. A diesel price shock with a mandate results in a smaller change in oilseed prices compared with a tax exemption. Higher diesel prices increase biodiesel prices under a tax exemption but lower them with a blend mandate. When both canola and soybeans are used to produce biodiesel, an increase in the diesel price leads to higher canola prices, but the effect on soybean prices is ambiguous and depends on relative elasticities of meal demand and canola supply because canola produces more oil than soybeans.

Both policies are set to achieve a targeted reduction in gasoline use at the state level. The model is then calibrated for a small open economy such as Illinois which is one of the largest producers of biofuels such as ethanol in the US. The main result of the paper shows that raising the biofuel subsidy use reduces overall welfare by more than a higher gas tax, both aimed to achieve a targeted reduction in pure gasoline. The relative efficiency of the higher gas tax is primarily due to it exacerbating the pre-existing distortion in the biofuel market by less than the subsidy. Moreover, for current parameter estimates welfare improving policy combinations for achieving a targeted amount of energy security are higher gas taxes combined with lower biofuel subsidies and a lower tax on income. However, the preference for a gasoline-labor tax swap shrinks as the elasticity of substitution between the two fuels rises. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The framework allows for analysis using only part of the spectrum, say at the business cycle frequencies. First, we characterize weak identification from a frequency domain perspective and propose a score test for the structural parameter vector based on the frequency domain approximation to the Gaussian likelihood. The construction heavily exploits the structures of the DSGE solution, the score function, and the information matrix. In particular, we show that the test statistic can be represented as the explained sum of squares from a complex-valued Gauss-Newton regression, where weak identification surfaces as (imperfect) multicollinearity. Second, we prove that asymptotically valid confidence sets can be obtained by inverting this test statistic and using chi-squared critical values. Third, we provide procedures to construct uniform confidence bands for the impulse response function, the time path of the variance decomposition, the individual spectrum, and the absolute coherency. Finally, a simulation experiment suggests that the test has adequate size even with relatively small sample sizes. It also suggests it is possible to have informative confidence sets in DSGE models with unidentified parameters, particularly regarding the impulse response functions. Although the paper focuses on DSGE models, the methods are applicable to other dynamic models with well defined spectra, such as stationary (factoraugmented) vector autoregressions.","Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Qu, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",qu@bu.edu,,,,,,,44,16,19,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

However, heterogeneity in reported findings makes it difficult to synthesize the evidence base with a view to test competing hypotheses and/or support evidence-based policy and practice. To address this issue, we have extracted 327 estimates of corruption's direct effect on per-capita GDP growth from 29 primary studies, following a peer-reviewed and pre-published systematic review protocol. Precision-effect and funnel asymmetry tests indicate that corruption has a negative effect on per-capita GDP growth after controlling for publication selection bias and within-study dependence. However, multivariate meta-regression analysis results indicate that the overall effect is not robust to inclusion of moderating variables through a general-to-specific procedure for model specification. We report that the marginal effect of corruption on per-capita GDP growth is more adverse when the primary study estimates relate to long-run growth, are based on low-income-country data only, and extracted from journal papers. The effect is less adverse in studies that use the International Country Risk Guide corruption perceptions index and in those reporting estimates from two-stage least-squares estimations.","Univ Greenwich, London SE18 6PF, England",University of Greenwich,"Ugur, M (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, London SE18 6PF, England.",,"Ugur, Mehmet/AAG-5018-2019","Ugur, Mehmet/0000-0003-3891-3641",,,,,85,94,97,3,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

This paper is an extension of Escude (A DSGE Model for a SOE with Systematic Interest and Foreign Exchange Policies in Which Policymakers Exploit the Risk Premium for Stabilization Purposes, 2013), which focused on interest rate and XR policies, since it introduces the third vertex of the 'trinity' in the form of taxes on private foreign debt. These affect the risk-adjusted uncovered interest parity equation and hence influence the SOE's international financial flows. A useful way to illustrate the range of policy alternatives is to associate them with the faces of a triangle. Each of 3 possible government intervention policies taken individually (in the domestic currency bond market, in the FX market, and in the foreign currency bonds market) corresponds to one of the vertices of the triangle, each of the 3 possible pairs of intervention policies corresponds to one of its 3 edges, and the 3 simultaneous intervention policies taken jointly correspond to its interior. This paper shows that this interior, or 'possible trinity' is quite generally not only possible but optimal, since the CB obtains a lower loss when it implements a policy with all three interventions.","[Escude, Guillermo J.] Cent Bank Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Escude, Guillermo J.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Escudé, GJ (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",gescude@bcra.gov.ar,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,32,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 25,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201425.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-25,0.0,,,58,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1NB,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339612000001,0

Control over labour migration could be a vital policy tool for the Scottish government, influencing long-run economic growth rates and demographic change. This paper explores migration policy in the context of alternative constitutional outcomes for Scotland. It asks what scope a small economy that is intimately linked to a neighbouring larger economy has in shaping immigration policy. It finds that the level of international migration to Scotland is relatively low and that there are some significant differences in migrant characteristics compared to the rest of the UK (RUK). It also considers the political economy aspects of labour immigration through analysis of recent survey data. Whatever the outcome of the referendum, we would argue that Scotland would benefit from a more nuanced approach to immigration policies rather than the current 'one size fits all' UK-wide model.","[Bell, David N.

The extensive and intensive margins are equally important in total firm exports.","[Bernard, Andrew B.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Dartmouth, NS, Canada; [Bernard, Andrew B.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Van Beveren, Ilke] KULeuven CES, Lessius Dept Business Studies, Louvain, Belgium; [Van Beveren, Ilke] LICOS, Louvain, Belgium; [Van Beveren, Ilke] Natl Bank Belgium, Louvain, Belgium; [Vandenbussche, Hylke] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES CORE, KULeuven LICOS, Natl Bank Belgium, Louvain, Belgium; [Vandenbussche, Hylke] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; KU Leuven; European Central Bank; National Bank of Belgium; European Central Bank; National Bank of Belgium; Universite Catholique Louvain; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Bernard, AB (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Dartmouth, NS, Canada.",,"Bernard, Andrew B/G-9809-2011; Van Beveren, Ilke/C-8046-2013","Vandenbussche, Hylke/0000-0002-4073-0097",,,,,21,17,19,0,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

The model developed is a strategic regular network where firms have the opportunity to form pair-wise collaborative links with other firms and then compete a la Cournot. Different to the existing literature, we find that firms' R&D efforts could increase or decrease with the degree of the network, depending on the level of absorptive capacity, the market size and the network dimension. In particular, in the case of small market size and low learning effect, the connection between firms drives up research investments. Moreover, if absorptive capacity is sufficiently low, the research collaboration between firms turns out not to be desirable from a private point of view while, in line with the existing literature, social efficiency requires a complete or intermediate level of collaborative activity. We also show that the complete network is pair-wise stable and socially optimal for an intermediate level of spillover intensity, while the empty network maximizes firms' profits when absorptive capacity is small, yet it is not pair-wise stable.","[Correani, Luca; Garofalo, Giuseppe; Pugliesi, Silvia] Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ & Management, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University,"Correani, L (通讯作者)，Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ & Management, Via Paradiso 47, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",correani@unitus.it,"Garofalo, Giuseppe/HNQ-0582-2023","GAROFALO, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0921-3590",,,,,55,6,6,0,59,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Control stores were kept unaware of their involvement, so that their performance generates exogenous variation in the relative performance of the treatment stores.

The nature of the complementarities determines the equilibrium skill distribution across cities. With extreme-skill complementarity, the skill distribution has thicker tails in large cities; with top-skill complementarity, there is first-order stochastic dominance. Using wage and housing price data, we find robust evidence of thick tails in large cities: large cities disproportionately attract both high-and low-skilled workers, while average skills are constant across city size. This pattern of spatial sorting is consistent with extreme-skill complementarity, where the productivity of high-skilled workers and of the providers of low-skilled services are mutually enhanced.","[Eeckhout, Jan] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Eeckhout, Jan] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Eeckhout, Jan] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Pinheiro, Roberto] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Schmidheiny, Kurt] Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland",University of London; University College London; Pompeu Fabra University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Basel,"Eeckhout, J (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",,"Schmidheiny, Kurt/R-4167-2016; Eeckhout, Jan/A-3981-2008","Schmidheiny, Kurt/0000-0001-7637-7451; PINHEIRO, ROBERTO/0000-0002-5989-4999; Eeckhout, Jan/0000-0001-6509-4296",,,,,41,111,140,5,72,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

In the model I propose, risk-averse workers can opt between the free-entry informal sector and queuing for formal occupations. Conditional on identifying the riskier option, the model yields testable implications on the relationship between risk-preferences and workers' allocation. My testing strategy proceeds in two steps. First, I estimate expected income uncertainty through panel data and find it to be higher in the informal sector. Second, using novel experimental data to elicit individual attitudes to risk, I estimate the direct effect of risk-aversion on occupational choices and find that, in line with the first result, more risk-averse workers are more likely to queue for formal jobs and less likely to be in the informal sector. The results bear important implications for the optimal design of employment policies and social security. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Standard formulations of the model predict that the ongoing large shortfall in economic activity relative to full employment should have led to deflation over the past several years. I confirm previous findings that the slope of the Phillips curve has varied over time and probably is lower today than it was several decades ago. This implies that estimates using historical data will overstate the responsiveness of inflation to present-day economic conditions. I modify the traditional Phillips curve to explicitly account for time variation in its slope and show how this modified model can explain the recent behavior of inflation without relying on anchored expectations. Specifically, I explore reasons why the slope might vary over time, focusing on implications of the sticky-price and sticky-information approaches to price adjustment. These implications suggest that the inflation environment and uncertainty about regional economic conditions should influence the slope of the Phillips curve. I introduce proxies to account for these effects and find that a Phillips curve modified to allow its slope to vary with uncertainty about regional economic conditions can best explain the recent path of inflation.

By adopting a business history approach that appraises the development of tacit knowledge, this study validates the need for family SMEs to institute organizational reforms to codify knowledge and therefore ensure long-term sustainability.","[Yew, John Lee Kean] Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Gomez, Edmund Terence] Univ Malaya, Dept Adm Studies & Polit, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya,"Yew, JLK (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",kean_yew@yahoo.com; etgomez@um.edu.my,"Yew, John Lee Kean/HHM-5124-2022; GOMEZ, EDMUND TERENCE/B-8444-2010; Yew, John Lee Kean/AAE-2581-2020","Yew, John Lee Kean/0000-0002-2313-4066; Yew, John Lee Kean/0000-0002-2313-4066",,,,,27,5,6,1,28,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

I estimate a structural VAR model with monthly macro-financial data, and identify the structural shocks based on the recursiveness assumption. Both adverse funding liquidity and monetary policy shocks, which are orthogonal to each other by construction, cause significant recessions, with monetary policy shocks generating relatively deeper and longer recessionary effects. Only funding liquidity shocks significantly reduce market liquidity. These two shocks account for over 30% of the cyclical fluctuations of the unemployment rate and industrial production two years after the shocks hit.","Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Chiu, CW (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",jeremy.chiu@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,7,3,4,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The bank may refuse LLP when its knock-out value is too low. When the bank decides to participate in the LLP, the participation of a private investor generates a decrease in bank interest margin and an increase in equity risk, but the knock-out value with the LLP assistance generates an increase in bank interest margin and a decrease in equity risk. Our results suggest that the success of LLP depends critically on the willingness of a weak bank to participate in it. However, the participation of a private investor in LLP does not decrease the weak bank's equity risk but poses instability to the banking system.","[Lin, Jyh-Horng; Tsai, Jeng-Yan] Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hung, Wei-Ming] Tamkang Univ, Dept Management Sci, Taipei, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Tamkang University,"Tsai, JY (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan.",tsaijy@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We model a player's uncertainty about another player's strategy as an atomless probability distribution over that player's strategy set. We call a strategy profile robust to strategic uncertainty if it is the limit, as uncertainty vanishes, of some sequence of strategy profiles in which every player's strategy is optimal under his or her uncertainty about the others. When payoff functions are continuous we show that our criterion is a refinement of Nash equilibrium and we also give sufficient conditions for existence of a robust strategy profile. In addition, we apply the criterion to Bertrand games with convex costs, a class of games with discontinuous payoff functions and a continuum of Nash equilibria. We show that it then selects a unique Nash equilibrium, in agreement with some recent experimental findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Both theory and the empirical literature suggest that financial liberalization and regionalism lead to higher levels of capital inflows. By using a dynamic panel data analysis, this research tests these hypotheses. The impact of financial liberalization depends on the type of liberalization implemented. Liberalization of the domestic financial system and the domestic equity market has a positive and significant impact on international capital flows. Aggregate capital account liberalization is not significant, but the elimination of multiple exchange rates significantly affects international capital flows, while other components have a more limited impact: the liberalization of inward FDI directly increases foreign direct investments, whilst the deregulation of offshore borrowing directly causes an increase in foreign debt inflows. Regionalism causes an increase in foreign direct investment inflows but does not affect other forms of capital inflows.","[Brafu-Insaidoo, William Gabriel; Biekpe, Nicholas] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Biekpe, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",winsaidoo@yahoo.com; nicholas.biekpe@gsb.uct.ac.za,"Biekpe, Prof Nicholas/AHB-9529-2022; Biekpe, Nicholas/GNH-1675-2022","Biekpe, Nicholas/0000-0002-9702-1232",,,,,39,7,9,0,17,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

In laboratory asset markets we evaluate the impact of four trader incentive bonus, bonus with cap, linear, and penalty - on asset prices and trader behavior. We find that (i) an asset with identical expected dividend shows price levels which differ by more than 100 percent depending on the incentive scheme subjects face. In particular, prices of markets populated by subjects with bonus incentives show the highest prices, whereas those with penalty-like incentivized subjects exhibit the lowest. (ii) However, subjects act approximately rational as different incentives generate different optimal price levels. (iii) In markets where different subjects have different incentive schemes we find that those with bonus incentives exhibit a riskier investment behavior and prefer the riskier asset, whereas subjects with penalty incentives invest conservatively and mainly hold cash. Since we find no difference in risk attitude of subjects prior to the experiment, differences in investment behavior are induced by the applied incentives. Our results highlight that incentives on financial markets have a huge impact on asset prices and investment behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we develop a competitive equilibrium model that calculates the impact of this imperfect regulatory framework on the cost of renewable energy. We apply the model to a power system with two interconnected zones, and find that the impact is case specific, but significant. We also find that the negative impact of national transmission planning on the cost of renewable energy is more significant in a state of the world in which Member States trade renewable energy, but that this negative effect is much smaller than the positive effect of renewable energy trade between Member States. We conclude that the imperfect regulatory framework for transmission investment is a significant cost for renewable energy in the EU, but that it should not stop Member States from trading renewable energy.

We also investigate which structural factors help the country to experience shorter recessions. We implement survival regression analysis and conclude that expansionary monetary policy significantly decreases durations of recessions whereas fixing the exchange rate does not have an effect on the durations of recessions. Expansionary fiscal policy has undesired effects and decreases the probability that recession will end, thus increasing the durations of recessions. The analysis of country specific factors indicates that emerging countries experience shorter recessions. Recessions in countries with higher trade openness last significantly longer. Financial openness and institutional quality do not have significant effects of recession durations. The empirical analysis takes into account alternative probability distributions and endogeneity of policy actions.","[Tas, Bedri Kamil Onur] TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Ankara, Turkey; [Cunedioglu, Huseyin Ekrem] Ozyegin Univ, Grad Sch Business, Econ Policy Res Fdn Turkey, TR-34794 Istanbul, Turkey",TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University; Ozyegin University,"Tas, BKO (通讯作者)，TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Sogutozu Cad 43 Sogutozu, Ankara, Turkey.",onurtas@etu.edu.tr; ekrem.cunedioglu@ozu.edu.tr,,"Tas, Bedri/0000-0001-5418-777X",,,,,29,1,1,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

We study the effects of such externalities in a competitive labor market if workers have private information on their productivity. We find that in any competitive equilibrium there must be Pareto-efficient separation of workers according to their productivity.

In the presence of greater regional disparities, the balance of politics may tilt towards redistributive concerns and away from government efficiency considerations, especially since the latter can be opposed by organized public sector interest groups. Our empirical analysis, based on a sample of 22 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries over the period from the mid-1990s to 2005, supports our basic intuition that regional disparities may lead to territorially based redistributive conflict to the detriment of government quality.","[Kyriacou, Andreas P.] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona 17071, Spain; [Roca-Sagales, Oriol] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de Girona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Kyriacou, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Campus Montilivi, Girona 17071, Spain.",andreas.kyriacou@udg.edu; oriol.roca@uab.cat,"Kyriacou, Andreas/G-8973-2015; roca-sagales, oriol/K-6415-2017","Kyriacou, Andreas/0000-0001-9571-2833; roca-sagales, oriol/0000-0002-5401-442X",,,,,73,16,16,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

A finite number of firms decide when to make an irreversible, observable investment. Upon investment, a firm receives flow profits, which decrease in the number of firms that have invested. The cost of investment declines over time exogenously. We characterize the subgame-perfect equilibrium outcome, which is unique up to a permutation of players. When the preemption race among late investors is sufficiently intense, the preemption incentive for earlier investors disappears, and two or more investments occur at the same time. We identify a sufficient condition in terms of model parameters: clustering of investments occurs if the flow profits from consecutive investments are sufficiently close. This shows how clustering can occur in the absence of coordination failures, informational spillovers, or positive payoff externalities.","[Argenziano, Rossella] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Schmidt-Dengler, Philipp] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of Essex; University of Mannheim,"Argenziano, R (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",rargenz@essex.ac.uk; p.schmidt-dengler@uni-mannheim.de,"Schmidt-Dengler, Philipp/AAE-5675-2020","Schmidt-Dengler, Philipp/0000-0003-1862-9483; Argenziano, Rossella/0000-0003-1346-8668",,,,,30,12,12,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Between 1992 and 2007, the average real wage increased by 202%, accompanied by a sharp rise in wage inequality. Decomposition analysis reveals 80% of this wage growth to be attributable to higher pay for basic labor, rising returns to human capital, and increases in the state-sector wage premium. By employing an aggregate production function framework, we account for the sources of wage growth and wage inequality amid fast economic growth and transition. We find capital accumulation, skill-biased technological change, and rural-urban migration to be the major forces behind the evolving wage structure in urban China.","[Ge, Suqin] Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Yang, Dennis Tao] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Virginia,"Ge, SQ (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",ges@vt.edu; yangd@darden.virginia.edu,,"Ge, Suqin/0000-0002-8844-580X",,,,,45,75,86,1,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

I model an oligopoly game where firms first decide on entry and sector, and then compete in price. Operating in the underground sector reduces variable costs, but comes at the risk of being detected and fined. As competition intensifies (i.e., as consumers become more and more price-sensitive), underground firms attract more demand, thus stealing business and profits from official firms. As a consequence, more firms enter the underground economy. A lenient policy toward the underground economy may increase welfare when markups are high, but will be welfare-detrimental when markups are low.","Univ LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Econ & Finance, I-00197 Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Karlinger, L (通讯作者)，Univ LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Econ & Finance, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",lilianegk@gmail.com,,"GIARDINO-KARLINGER, LILIANE/0000-0002-8694-957X",,,,,12,2,2,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We develop a model showing that leverage, the ratio of liabilities to assets, is lower under high-powered regulation and that firms operating under high-powered regulation make proportionally larger reductions in leverage when the cost of debt increases. We test the predictions of the model using an original panel dataset of 124 transport concessions in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru over 1992-2011. For each concession we have data on the regulatory regime, annual financial performance and contract renegotiations. We begin by demonstrating that, although pervasive, contract renegotiations do not fundamentally alter the regulatory regime. Importantly, firms are not systematically able to renegotiate when in financial difficulty, implying that price cap contracts remain high-powered in practice. We use this result for our main empirical work, where we find broad support for our theoretical predictions: when the cost of debt increases, firms operating under high-powered regulation make proportionally larger reductions in leverage.","[Moore, Alexander] World Bank, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Moore, Alexander] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Straub, Stephane] Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Dethier, Jean-Jacques] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; The World Bank,"Moore, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.moore@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,12,12,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We show that this is not the case if at least one sector of the economy is a Cournot oligopoly. In a simple small open economy with one oligopolistic and one competitive sector, welfare is an inverted U-shaped function of tariffs. Hence, an optimal tariff rate can be determined. The optimal rate depends on the number of firms in the oligopolistic sector. Below the optimal level, the competitive sector overproduces, i.e. oligopolistic good have a higher marginal effect on welfare. Increasing tariff rates stimulate the production of the oligopolistic sector by dampening imports. Under balanced trade, this reduces exports and production in the competitive sector, thus shifting resources to oligopolistic goods production. We also find that given certain levels of protection, perfect competition is not welfare maximal and, hence, not desirable. The finding explains why developing economies with imperfect competition are often reluctant to embrace trade liberalization and why, conversely, countries with high levels of external protection may be unenthusiastic about competition theory.","[Zotti, Jacopo; Lucke, Bernd] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Zotti, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany.",jacopo.zotti@econ.units.it,,"Lucke, Bernd/0000-0002-4883-8756; ZOTTI, Jacopo/0000-0002-6906-6142",,,,,27,0,0,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Our paper addresses this question from the viewpoint that capital ultimately seeks returns from its perpetual reallocation and essentially faces two choices: it can either be entrepreneurially allocated to real economic activity, or it can be financially invested in legal claims against such activity. Adopting such a perspective, we study here how real and financial returns relate to each other over the past fifteen years, both within and across countries, by considering more than 30,000 publicly traded firms in more than forty countries that stand for 70% of the global population and about 90% of world income. We compare the average rates of return to both types of investment and their respective volatilities. While average returns, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, turn out to be roughly equal across the two domains, the volatility of financial returns exceeds 'real volatility' by an order of magnitude. From a systemic point of view, these findings raise the question why capital would seek out financial investments in the first place.","[Mundt, Philipp; Foerster, Niels; Milakovic, Mishael] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany; [Alfarano, Simone] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; Universitat Jaume I,"Mundt, P (通讯作者)，Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany.",philipp.mundt@uni-bamberg.de,"Alfarano, Simone/JNE-2129-2023; Milakovic, Mishael/ABA-9718-2020","Mundt, Philipp/0000-0002-4106-1809; Alfarano, Simone/0000-0002-8690-7978; Milakovic, Mishael/0000-0002-3114-204X",,,,,26,2,2,0,11,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 31,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201417.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-17,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1MP,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339610700001,0

For all races/ethnicities, the addition of hypertension and/or obese to diabetes substantially increases health care expenditures: by over 25% for whites, by over 70% for Blacks and by over 48% for Hispanics. We further find that interactions of obesity and hypertension with race indicate lower health expenditures by minorities compared to whites having the same combination of conditions. Diabetic-obese-not-hypertensive blacks spend 37.7% ($4224 per year) less than their white counterparts. Diabetic-obese-not-hypertensive Hispanics spend 41% ($4591 per year) less than diabetic-obese-not-hypertensive whites.

In this paper we argue that the delivered justifications for these policies are at least questionable. We add a completely new argument to the discussion and show in a simple theoretical model that vehicle safety systems might cause positive externalities. Based on a large dataset of traffic accidents in Germany we show that the these externalities in fact occur. Based on our estimation results we show that for anti-lock-brakes (ABS) and electronic stability programmes (ESP) the average expected externality exceeds the price of these systems. Thus, the obligation to equip any new car with both ABS and ESP is adequate from an allocative point of view although the official justification for the introduction of these regulations are flawed.

Earlier studies concluded that wage rates are an important determinant of partners' hours of market and non-market work and also that house work may lower married women's wage rates. However, the bulk of earlier literature in this area failed to account for the endogeneity of wages or the simultaneity of partners' time allocation choices. Here we take a reduced form approach and specify a ten simultaneous equations model of wage rates, employment and hours of market work, house work and childcare of parents. Non-participants are included in the model. We exploit a rich time use dataset for France to estimate the model. We find that the own wage affects positively own market hours and negatively own house work and childcare hours. The wage of the father has a significantly negative effect on the mother's market hours while her wage rate has a significantly positive effect on his house work hours.","[Bloemen, Hans G.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bloemen, Hans G.] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bloemen, Hans G.] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Bloemen, Hans G.; Stancanelli, Elena G.

This paper examines the policy choices involved in the extended national innovation performance framework for creating an open innovation system. Innovation capabilities, incentives and institutional frameworks are examined. The paper argues that China should continue to increase its investment in R&D and in education, and that there should also be an attempt to strengthen the incentive system at the macro, meso and micro levels. This strengthening may include reforms to: release the power of competition and guide resources towards innovative sectors; adopt appropriate human resource management, such as appraisal and remuneration systems; create effective policies for research funding management; and evaluate the efficiency of research to encourage the creativity of researchers, managers and employees. The paper also discusses the space for industrial policy in the 21st century.","[Fu, Xiaolan] Univ Oxford, Technol & Management Dev Ctr, Oxford, England; [Mu, Rongping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Oxford; Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development,"Fu, XL (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Technol & Management Dev Ctr, Oxford, England.",xiaolan.fu@qeh.ox.ac.uk; mrp@casipm.ac.cn,,,,,,,23,18,20,0,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR,2014,22.0,2,,,SI,,42,60,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12061.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AC5YW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332597900004,0

Governments of such countries often compete fiercely for attracting multinational corporations (MNCs) in the expectation of the advantages they will bring to their economies, often prioritising economic goals over fundamental human rights. For a long time, economists have analysed the economic impacts of MNCs, while a parallel strand of work in political science, business ethics and international law investigates the repercussions of MNC operations on human rights. Despite the significant relatedness and complementarities, these two bodies of literature have so far poorly interacted. This paper addresses this limitation and systematically analyses and integrates existing micro-level empirical evidence on the economic and human rights impacts of MNCs on developing countries. It provides a critical analysis of what is known and highlights what we do not know about the factors that mediate the positive and/or negative impacts of MNC operations on host developing countries. Based on a critical analysis of the literature, it discusses avenues for future research in this field and sets the grounds for a new interdisciplinary research agenda on this subject.","[Giuliani, Elisa] Univ Pisa, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Macchi, Chiara] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Giuliani, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",giulel@ec.unipi.it,,"Macchi, Chiara/0000-0002-3910-9340; Giuliani, Elisa/0000-0002-3813-1861",,,,,266,64,74,3,76,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The Granger test indicates that there is evidence of a bi-directional causal relationship between gold prices and the exchange rate, except when the threshold parameter exceeds the threshold value in the exchange rate equation. According to these findings, gold price can be used as a hedge against the exchange rate.

This is an extremely important oversight. Not only might such a study be useful to researchers, but students are anxious to acquire practical as well as theoretical knowledge and to see historical applications of theory. This article fills that gap by offering both theory and evidence regarding U. S. cycles from 1950 through the Great Recession. The theory is derived from Keynes's General Theory, while the evidence is composed of a simple statistical analysis along with a narrative covering each expansion and recession. It will be argued that, despite mainstream descriptions of capitalism as a relatively stable system occasionally interrupted by exogenous shocks, business cycles are systemic and a manifestation of the instability inherent to the capitalist system.

The economy contracted for the first time since 1998 and entered recession during the fourth quarter of 2008. The gross domestic product contraction was soon transmitted to the labour market. Between the second quarters of 2008 and 2009, employment fell by 3.8%. However, not all individuals were hit with the same intensity. Using panel data from a quarterly labour force survey unique in the African context, we find that human capital (i.e. education as years of schooling and workforce experience) provided a buffer against the shock. After controlling for observable characteristics, education and experience showed the potential to entirely offset the effect of the recession on the likelihood of employment. This has important policy implications, as it strengthens the case for strategic investments in human capital and helps identify the unskilled as having the greatest need for social safety net interventions during a recession.","[Leung, Ronald] African Dev Bank, Res Dept, Tunis, Tunisia; [Stampini, Marco] Interamer Dev Bank, Social Protect & Hlth Div, Washington, DC USA; [Vencatachellum, Desire] African Dev Bank, Resource Mobilizat Dept, Tunis, Tunisia",African Development Bank Group (AfDB); Inter-American Development Bank; African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Leung, R (通讯作者)，African Dev Bank, Res Dept, Tunis, Tunisia.",r.leung@afdb.org; mstampini@iadb.org; d.vencatachellum@afdb.org,"Stampini, Marco/GVT-9917-2022",,,,,,37,2,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The policy implication emerging from our analysis suggests that entry should be encouraged in industries with strategic managerial delegation, cost asymmetry and not large-scale economies.","[Mukherjee, Arijit] Univ Loughborough, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Mukherjee, Arijit] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Tsai, Yingyi] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",Loughborough University; Ifo Institut; National University Kaohsiung,"Tsai, YY (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",yytsai@nuk.edu.tw,"MUKHERJEE, Arijit/J-9398-2019; MUKHERJEE, Arijit/JJC-1751-2023","Tsai, Yingyi/0000-0002-8011-9946",,,,,40,8,8,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

In this paper. I examine the impacts of trade liberalization on the labor markets of a small open economy, in an environment in which tariffs affect firms' payroll tax compliance decisions. I demonstrate that a reduction in domestic import tariffs reduces the average formal wage and show that the direction of the effect on the share of informal employment depends on the initial labor market conditions. A cut in trading partner import tariffs decreases the share of domestic informal employment and increases the average formal wage. I confirm the model's principal findings empirically, using data from the 1989-2001 Brazilian trade liberalization episode. I find the results robust to endogeneity and self-selection concerns, which are addressed, respectively, using instrumental variable and switching regression approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using latent class analysis, three different classes of mothers are identified based on their attitudes: home-oriented, adaptive and career-oriented mothers. Controlling for observable individual and family characteristics as well as the institutional and economic environment, it is shown that home-oriented mothers have more children and take longer leaves for each child than adaptive mothers, who themselves take longer leaves than career-oriented mothers. The difference is more marked among mothers who have been working the last quarter before giving birth: while 80 % of the career-oriented mothers return to work after 6 months, only 70 % of home-oriented mothers do so. Pre-motherhood and pre-labor-market attitudes of mothers are used in the determination of classes to avoid reverse causation of motherhood and work experiences on attitudes. These results cast doubts on the effectiveness of one-size-fits-all-policies and make the case for flexible policies that allow for different combinations of wages and maternity-leaves.","Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Rahim, F (通讯作者)，Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal.",fsrahim@fe.unl.pt,,,,,,,44,8,10,6,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

A country-level dataset is used to measure PSE in delivering education and health services and the new indices are regressed on well-established decentralization measures. Irrespective of whether PSE concerns education or health services, an inverted U-shaped relationship has been identified between government efficiency in providing these services and fiscal decentralization.

Policy proposals abound and often build on implicit assertions concerning intergenerational equity. This paper offers a simple but manageable OLG model with endogenous retirement and cohort-specific longevity to address intergenerational redistribution and risk sharing. While it is well known that a utilitarian planner strives for consumption smoothing, it is shown that healthy ageing calls for work smoothing in the sense that retirement ages increase with longevity. Hence, cohorts with higher longevity should contribute to their larger consumption needs via later retirement, although it is shown that the planner still front-loads some financing (pre-saving). Stochastic longevity raises the issue of intergenerational risk sharing, which implies that cohorts turning out to have a high longevity are compensated at the expense of cohorts turning out to have a relatively short longevity.","[Andersen, Torben M.] Aarhus Univ, CESifo, CEPR, Dept Econ & Business, Aarhus, Denmark; [Andersen, Torben M.] EPRU, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Andersen, TM (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, CESifo, CEPR, Dept Econ & Business, Aarhus, Denmark.",tandersen@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,41,6,6,0,27,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

To improve the significance of the rare and specific region belonging to the minority class in the decision region, we take the SVM as a pre-processor to balance the training dataset and use multiple feature selection combination grounded on ensemble learning in order to determine the most representative features from the re-sized dataset The representative features are then fed into the BPNN ensemble to construct an effective financial pre-warning mechanism. Lacking comprehensibility and readability is one of the fatal weaknesses of an ensemble classifier and it impedes its real-life application. Thus, the study executes RST to extract knowledge from the BPNN ensemble for decision makers to make suitable judgments. Decision makers can take the decision rules as a roadrnap to modify a firm's capital structure so as to survive in an extremely turbulent financial market. Empirical results reveal that the introduced EBM's prediction accuracy is very promising in financial risk mining, relative to other detection approaches in this study. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

When the war ended, trade costs declined and China's terms of trade increased, further stimulating exports.

In this article, I argue that greater volatility leads to an increase in aggregate price flexibility so that nominal stimulus mostly generates inflation rather than output growth. To do this, I construct price-setting models with volatility shocks and show these models match new facts in CPI micro data that standard price-setting models miss. I then show that these models imply that output responds less to nominal stimulus during times of high volatility. Furthermore, because volatility is countercyclical, this implies that nominal stimulus has smaller real effects during downturns. For example, the estimated output response to additional nominal stimulus in September 1995, a time of low volatility, is 55% larger than the response in October 2001, a time of high volatility.

This paper estimates the magnitude of these gains and compares it to the magnitude of employment loss due to worker displacement. A model based on the production task framework from Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) is used to demonstrate that the effect of offshoring depends on the intensity of use of these tasks and, ultimately, impacts domestic employment through three channels: a direct displacement effect, which negatively impacts employment; an output effect generated by the productivity gains from offshoring, which reorganizes and increases aggregate production in the economy and impacts domestic employment positively; and a substitution effect among factors and tasks, which has an ambiguous effect Using the model's structure as a roadmap and applying it to detailed U.S. manufacturing sector data over 20012007, results from GMM 3SLS regressions provide overall support for the structure and predictions of the tasks model of offshoring.

The results show that energy consumption uni-directionally Granger causes carbon emissions and economic growth, while there is a bidirectional causality between carbon emissions and economic growth.

However, divestments are quite common among the operations of MNEs. In order to derive their effects, we build a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that includes two non-standard characteristics: the presence of MNEs and unemployment. The model is applied to the Spanish economy, where FDI inflows have surpassed divestments at the aggregate level in the period 2005-2009, although divestments have been sizeable in ten sectors. We analyse two different scenarios: 1) divestments that involve the closure of plants of foreign affiliates and 2) divestments where national firms buy the plant of foreign affiliates. The model allows estimating the overall impact of the divestments occurring simultaneously in ten sectors and in particular sectors. Results not only show that national acquisitions are less harmful than closures, but quantify those effects, and provide information on the role of the divesting sector.

We apply a novel method of testing for social learning by focusing on how the addition of individual and partner health and marriage length affects the correlation in spousal BMI. Results show the importance of matching in the marriage market in explaining correlated BMI outcomes. There is significant correlation in partner BMI even after controlling for own health, spouse health, marriage length and regional effects, suggesting evidence of a social influence.

The key causes of the low level of the economy competitiveness are related to the decoupling between science and production, insufficient financing of innovation projects, absence of the efficient mechanisms of bringing scientific-technical production to the level of goods, high capital consumption. Renunciation of the raw materials model requires modernization and simultaneous transition to the innovation economy, as Kazakhstan relates its constant stable growth, first of all, to the transition to the innovation way of development. Today Kazakhstan is actively forming a new economy which is being built on the present day knowledge and competitive innovations. Besides, the purpose of institutional transformations is the establishing of the market innovative-active subjects. However, till nowadays the program of reduction of home economy dependence of on raw materials does not give the expected results and until this key problem is left unsolved, it will effect negatively economy's development, especially in case of the sharp worsening of the environment Unconditionally, there are other domestic problems that will prevent from supporting a stable growth. Kazakhstan 's transition to the innovation type of development can be conditionally divided into two stages. The beginning of the first stage is connected with adoption of the Strategy of industrial-innovation development in 2003, formation of the institutional base and the key moments of the national innovation system. In 2010, having adopted the State program of forced industrial-innovation development of the country for 2010-2014 there began the stage of accelerated building of the innovation economy, strengthening of legislative and financial stimulation of the innovation activity. At present the efforts of the state innovation policy are aimed to, firstly, the development of innovation clusters and innovation environment, secondly, the increase of the innovation infrastructure efficiency, thirdly, the development of principally new system of scientific-technological developments' commercialization. Up to 2015 the main priority trends of the state policy on the country's forced industrialization will become realization of innovation-investment projects in traditional export-oriented sectors of economy. The main accent will be made on development of new instruments of the state-private partnership in the sphere of innovations development, as well as target technological programs for co-funding prospective research.

Advocates for school nutrition reform have suggested that it is important for children to have an adequate amount of time to eat meals in school in order to maintain a healthy weight. This article examines whether the length of time children are given to eat lunch in school has an impact on their weight. I find evidence that an increase in lunch length reduces the probability a child is overweight, and this finding is robust across various econometric specifications, including a two-sample instrumental variable model and difference-in-differences model that account for the potential endogeneity of lunch length.","Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Bhatt, R (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, POB 3992, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",rbhatt@gsu.edu,,,,,,,39,10,15,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

To correct for some of these limitations, we test for the impact of past income inequality on intergenerational social status persistence using the International Social Survey Program (2009). In accordance with previous studies, we find a positive relationship between these two variables, though the relatively poor model fit suggests the presence of other factors.

Investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders are less trustful in recent decades. While rethinking what is needed to build trust in business environment, one of the most important subjects to discuss is increasing of business transparency because companies that are in conflict with their stakeholders cannot survive for a long run. Thus, corporate social reporting serves as a true opportunity to improve trust and competitiveness. Companies report on social issues under many different communication forms such as corporate social responsibility report, sustainability report, report to society, social report, communication on progress, social information disclosure on their websites or even annual reports. European countries, including Lithuania, haven't formed a single system of corporate social reporting as social disclosure is voluntary. Thus, not only a relatively small number of companies make these statements, but at the same time they are different in content and structure, and therefore not always comparable. Stakeholders, assessing companies in the context of social responsibility and making socio-economic decisions, have no opportunity to use understandable and comparable information on human resources, products, environment control and public services. Thus the research question is directed to the identification of problems of corporate social reporting development both at the institutional and organizational levels. The objective of this paper is to analyze problems of social reporting and disclosure in Lithuania in order to increase the transparency of business activities. The research methods applied in this article are analysis of legal acts, logical and comparative analysis OFM scientific literature, dynamic and social reporting content analysis, problem analysis. As the article refers to corporate social reporting development in Lithuania, there is the theoretical background of researches mainly made in Lithuania carried out. This paper also presents the problems of social reporting in Lithuania from institutional and organizational views, the results from empirical researches of companies' disclosed social information. The findings of the article show that still more declaratory socially responsible business ideas dominate in Lithuania, while the actual manifestation of social reporting is in the initial level. At the same time the most important thing should be the process of implementation of socially responsible business, as social reporting is rather a process for better business transparency than just a document. The process of corporate social reporting may be improved by strengthening legal framework and improving legal conditions for voluntary reporting. But at the same time the regulatory mechanism is not enough because trust is always related to main values driving the companies and their managers.","[Dagiliene, Lina; Leitoniene, Sviesa] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Grencikova, Adriana] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trecin, Trecin 91150, Slovakia",Kaunas University of Technology; Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Dagiliene, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",lina.dagiliene@ktu.lt; sviesa.leitoniene@ktu.lt; Adriana.grencikova@tnuni.sk,"Dagiliene, Lina/AAI-7238-2020; Grenčíková, Adriana/JLL-2678-2023; Leitoniene, Sviesa/G-7250-2015","Grenčíková, Adriana/0000-0003-1077-1127; Leitoniene, Sviesa/0000-0001-8457-5773; Dagiliene, Lina/0000-0001-6564-7663",,,,,34,34,35,1,47,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Given their industrial usage, the non-ferrous metals have a great importance for the economic activity. The volatility and unpredictability of metals prices create risks for an important number of companies and for the economy. The existence of basis risk leads to the need for the optimal hedge ratio estimation. Our paper estimates the optimal hedging ratio in the case of the non-ferrous metals traded on the London Metals Exchange using three methods: the ordinary least squares regression, the error-correction model, and the auto regressive distributed lag model.

The results show that the optimal hedge ratio and hedging effectiveness increase with the hedging horizon, converging to 1 for long tenors.

Regarding that the analysis is completed with detecting some relations of Adjusted Net Saving with the Resource Productivity, which is one of the EU SDIs. The aim of the Paper is to critically assess the development of the Adjusted Net Saving indicator in the EU countries in terms of sustainable development and to evaluate the compliance of its development with the Resource Productivity in these countries. The Adjusted Net Saving indicates the best results in terms of sustainable development for Sweden but it cannot be said that the EU is on the sustainable development path.

Thus, innovative financing should be analysed in connection with the system's other basic elements, such as traditional financing instruments and the structure and functioning of the international economic and financial system through which these resources flow. Hence, a systemic approach to international financing for development (SAIFfD) is needed. The main conclusion is that, although current innovative instruments should be welcome, there is a need to accelerate the launch of new innovative mechanisms and to develop some important accompanying measures basically related to both the reform of traditional instruments of IFfD and the international financial architecture.","[Garcia-Arias, Jorge; Macias Vazquez, Alfredo; Fernandez-Huerga, Eduardo] Univ Leon, E-24071 Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Garcia-Arias, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leon, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",jrgara@unileon.es; amacv@unileon.es; eduardo.fernandez@unileon.es,"Garcia-Arias, Jorge/AGF-8614-2022; Fernández-Huerga, Eduardo/AAC-5767-2019; Macias Vazquez, Alfredo/D-2953-2017","Fernández-Huerga, Eduardo/0000-0001-8974-0440; Macias Vazquez, Alfredo/0000-0002-2684-2666",,,,,63,2,2,0,11,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

This paper empirically investigates the impacts of four different measures of trade openness and globalisation on the unemployment rate in an unbalanced panel framework. The analysis focuses on the G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Robust empirical findings from panel data estimates demonstrate that, along with macroeconomic indicators and market size, all the measures of trade openness and globalisation are significantly and negatively associated with the unemployment rate. Therefore, we conclude that the continuation of the globalisation process instead of protectionism is of great importance in reducing the unemployment rate in developed economies.","Dogus Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, TR-34722 Kadikoy, Turkey",Dogus University,"Gozgor, G (通讯作者)，Dogus Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Zeamet St 21 K505 Acibadem, TR-34722 Kadikoy, Turkey.",ggozgor@dogus.edu.tr,"Gozgor, Giray/K-1372-2017","Gozgor, Giray/0000-0003-1238-8105",,,,,48,23,24,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

J,"Hajzler, C",,,,"Hajzler, Christopher",,,Resource-based FDI and expropriation in developing economies,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Expropriation; Foreign direct investment; Natural resources,RISK,"Globally, foreign direct investment (FDI) assets are expropriated more in resource extraction industries compared to other sectors. Despite the higher apparent risk of expropriation in resources, countries more likely to expropriate also have a larger share of FDI in the resource sector. An incomplete markets model of FDI is developed to account for this puzzle. The type of government regime is stochastic, with low penalty regimes facing a relatively low, exogenous cost of expropriating FDI, and country risk is measured by the variation in these costs across different regimes. The key innovation of the model is that the government, before the regime type is known, is able to charge different prices to domestic and foreign investors for mineral rights. Granting cheap access increases FDI and reduces the country's share of resource rents, increasing the temptation to expropriate in a relatively low penalty regime. In very high-risk countries, subsidizing resource FDI increases the total value of output by raising investment and the net gains from expropriating in a low penalty regime outweigh the rents foregone under a high penalty one. However, a stochastic resource output price results in relatively low-risk countries restricting FDI inflows to the resource sector instead - windfall profits in this sector raise incentives to expropriate when prices are high, yet minimization of the ex ante risk of expropriation is preferred owing to the relatively high penalty for expropriating. These results imply a higher average share of resource-based FDI in countries most likely to expropriate, while resources account for a high share of expropriated assets compared to the sector's global share of FDI. We show that the model is able to reconcile observed patterns of foreign investment and expropriation for a sample of 38 developing and emerging economies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For remittances, we use the exponential trend function as the best fit to approximate data for remittances over the period of 1980-1992 and 2012. Similar approach is used to approximate data for GDP (at current prices) for the period of 1980-1989 and gross fixed capital formation for the period of 1980-1994 to build the capital stock data. Further, we use the polynomial trend function to approximate data for GDP (constant 2005 USD) for the period of 1980-1994. Within the necessary caveats, our results show that output per worker, capital per worker and remittances are cointegrated, and remittances contribute about 0,02 % and 0,04 % to output per worker in short-run and long-run, respectively, and the capital share is around 0.50. We note a bidirectional causation and hence a mutually reinforcing effect between capital per worker and output per worker, and a unidirectional causation from remittances to output per worker, duly supporting the remittances-led growth hypothesis in Lithuania. However, our results are not unambiguous due to data constraints. In this regard, further research will supplement and give more insights to the results and outcomes of this paper.","[Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Univ South Pacific, Suva, Fiji; [Stauvermann, Peter Josef] Changwon Natl Univ, Gyeongnam 641773, Changwon, South Korea",University of the South Pacific; Changwon National University,"Kumar, RR (通讯作者)，Univ South Pacific, Suva, Fiji.",kumar_RN@usp.ac.fj; pjsta@changwon.ac.kr,"Stauvermann, Peter Josef/I-3470-2019; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/H-4968-2015; Kumar, Ronald/AAK-7991-2020","Stauvermann, Peter Josef/0000-0001-7011-2209; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/0000-0001-9658-4896;",,,,,48,12,12,1,7,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We first show analytically that in the presence of sectoral Ricardian comparative advantage, a one-sector sufficient statistic formula that uses total trade volumes as a share of total absorption systematically understates the true gains from trade. Greater relative sectoral productivity differences lead to larger disparities between the gains implied by the one-sector formula and the true gains. Using data on overall and sectoral trade shares in a sample of 79 countries and 19 sectors we show that the multi-sector formula implies on average 30% higher gains from trade than the one-sector formula, and as much as 100% higher gains for some countries. We then set up and estimate a quantitative Ricardian-Heckscher-Ohlin model in which no version of the formula applies exactly, and compare a range of sufficient statistic formulas to the true gains in this model. Confirming the earlier results, formulas that do not take into account the sectoral heterogeneity understate the true gains from trade in the model by as much as two-thirds. The one-sector formulas understate the gains by more in countries with greater dispersion in sectoral productivities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The development of credit markets enables more agents to acquire skills to work in non-agricultural sectors. The expansion of the sectors decreases the labor supply to agriculture as well as increases the supply of modern intermediate inputs to agriculture. Agricultural producers accordingly substitute the relatively cheap intermediate inputs for labor to produce a given level of an agricultural good, and, thereby, the output per worker in agriculture is improved. Poor countries with less developed credit markets are, therefore, far less productive in agriculture than rich countries with well-developed credit markets.","Fukuoka Univ, Fac Econ, Fukuoka 81401, Japan",Fukuoka University,"Nishida, K (通讯作者)，Fukuoka Univ, Fac Econ, Fukuoka 81401, Japan.",knishida@fukuoka-u.ac.jp,"Nishida, Keigo/F-7380-2017","Nishida, Keigo/0000-0001-9697-3277",,,,,27,5,5,3,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

I find that the 1970 legalization of abortion in the repeal states led to about a 6% reduction in unwed childbearing rates for white women aged 15-20 who were born in these states immediately after abortion became legal. I find a larger long-term impact for African-American women of the same ages: a 7.5%-13% reduction in unwed childbearing. My estimates are smaller and not as precise for the effect of Roe v. Wade. This outcome is not surprising given that I am able to estimate only a potential lower bound of the effect on unwed childbearing rates. On the other hand, when I estimated a Difference-in-Difference regression for the non-repeal states assuming that there was no national trend that affected the childbearing behavior of the treatment age groups and their respective control age groups separately, I found that the true effect of Roe v.

The objective of supplier selection problem is an identification of suppliers that have the highest capability of responding desirably to firm's needs. Suppliers are ranked from the best to worst total performance regarding to use of a common set of criteria and measures. Defined method intends to take two considerable actions: to employ typically available information and lessen the burden of choosing of weights for DM (decision maker). Owing to the paucity of information, measuring of the exact value of the attributed weights of criteria and input data seem to be impossible. Therefore, the use of fuzzy techniques is justifiable. According to brought weights, F-PROMETHEE method is implemented to rank the suppliers. In previous works, weights of criteria were achieved in relation to DM's comments and there was less attention given to the fact that suppliers work in a competitive environment, furthermore, situations of rivals have not been considered as an important factor, precisely. In addressed approach, the information of the enterprise, which is working with DM and its rivals' information in different criteria, is regarded as input data and weighting of these criteria and ranking of those suppliers are conducted through a suggested algorithm.","[Shahmardan, Amin] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Zadeh, Mohammad Hendijani] Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran",Amirkabir University of Technology; University of Tehran,"Shahmardan, A (通讯作者)，Amirkabir Univ Technol, POB 1476885173, Tehran, Iran.",amin.shahmardan@aut.ac.ir; hendijani@ut.ac.ir,,,,,,,39,2,2,0,14,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Improving the quality of supply of the Route in the Bijelo Brdo (Croatia) - Petrovaradin (Serbia) section, in terms of investment in road infrastructure, signs for tourists and designing thematic maps and guides, might strengthen cross-border cooperation between Croatia and Serbia, which would result in a direct impact on tourism and the economy of both countries. After analysing the current situation of the quality of supply, on the aforementioned relation, the aim of this study was to design a series of measures to improve cycle tourism. For the purpose of this paper the survey was conducted during the year 2010, where foreign tourists - cyclists from eight countries - participated. The cyclists were asked to analyse the condition of the Route in the section Bijelo Brdo - Petrovaradin. The initial hypothesis was that that the existing tourism supply is on a relatively poor level of development, and that long-term positive effects in this part of the region can be achieved by some strategic measures to enhance the quality. This work will result in the synthesis of theory, statistical methods, and secondary publications since the analysis of the obtained data may lead to the confirmation of the main hypothesis. The survey method is used in the study, whereas the chi-square test is used to determine the frequency of specific deviations.

In these experiments, most agents are rational in an operational sense, and their expectations coordinate quickly, but not necessarily on the rational expectations value. In several situations, the homogeneous rational expectations hypothesis of Lucas and Prescott poorly describes the expectational dynamics and is outperformed by other hypotheses. But even in those situations in which the hypothesis gives a good description, it is more likely that coordination on rational values is brought about by the institutional structure of the market rather than the rationality of the agents.","[Wagener, Florian] Univ Amsterdam, CeNDEF, Dept Econ & Econometr, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wagener, Florian] Tinbergen Inst, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Wagener, F (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, CeNDEF, Dept Econ & Econometr, Kruislaan 403, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands.",F.O.O.Wagener@uva.nl,"Wagener, Florian O.

Specifically, we investigate how the presence of optimism bias impacts the severity of the free-rider problem, the organizational structure of the team and the compensation contracts offered to agents in equilibrium. The results indicate that all agents become more reluctant to exert effort and the team welfare decreases when some of its agents are optimistic, suggesting that optimism aggravates the free-rider problem in teams. Appointing a team leader makes all agents work harder, and the team benefits more by having the optimistic agent as its leader. These findings are in sharp contrast to the effects of overconfidence as identified in the literature. It is advisable to pay the optimistic agents less than the rational agents. Encouragingly, optimistic agents can learn about their own bias in the long run, leaving their team without too much detriment of optimism.","[Wang, Jian; Zhuang, Xintian] Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jun] Acad Univ, Sch Business Adm, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada; [Sheng, Jiliang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat Technol, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China; Acadia University; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Yang, J (通讯作者)，Acad Univ, Sch Business Adm, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada.",jun.yang@acadiau.ca,,,,,,,53,5,7,2,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the proposed model, the dynamic n-order 2-factor fuzzy time series model can automatic choose the best n-order for searching similar data from historical data and, then, build a training dataset for the radial basis function neural network model to forecast the option price.

One of the purposes of these researches, and probably the most important one, is to find a better prediction of future economic changes. Economic theory suggests a strong link between stock market and economic activity. The question is whether the stock market is a predictor of future economic activity measured as growth of country's gross domestic product. In this paper we analyze which economic sectors, represented by stock market sector indices, could have most impact on GDP. The aim of this paper is to analyze whether some sectors are more important than others while analyzing GDP change. The study uses data for the period 2000 Q2 - 2012 Q1 of the U. S. seasonally adjusted GDP and Dow Jones indices and data for the period 2001 Q1 - 2012 Q1 of France seasonally adjusted GDP and Euronext CAC indices. In order to find a relation between selected stock market sector indices and GDP, we will use cross correlation analysis. Our findings support the theory that stock market is a leading indicator for economic growth. In France stock market appears to be a stronger indicator for economic growth compared to the U. S. The results revealed that seasonally adjusted GDP growth lagged behind changes in stock market indices four quarters in France and three quarter in the U. S. In the U. S. worst predictive capabilities for GDP growth come from utilities, oil and gas sectors. Industrial and financial sectors gave the best cross correlation results with GDP growth. In France telecommunication, utilities sectors have the worst predictive capabilities, and consumer services and health care sectors gave the best cross correlation results on GDP growth, compared with others.","[Zalgiryte, Lina; Guzavicius, Andrius; Tamulis, Vidas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Zalgiryte, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",lina.zalgiryte@ktu.edu; andrius.guzavicius@ktu.lt; vidas.tamulis@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,4,4,2,35,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Purchase offers contingent upon successful land aggregation are compared to combination offers containing both guaranteed and contingent payments to determine which approach better mitigates holdout. The distribution of gains between developers and landowners is also examined. The results of a series of economic experiments suggest that contingent offers expedite land aggregation but developer payoffs are higher when combination offers are used. The results offer insight to real-estate developers participating in land aggregation and inform government entities considering the necessity of public-sector intervention in real-estate markets to encourage desired development projects.,"[Zillante, Arthur; Schwarz, Peter M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Read, Dustin C.] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Real Estate, Dept Finance, Charlotte, NC 28202 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Zillante, A (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",azillant@uncc.edu; pschwarz@uncc.edu; dcread@uncc.edu,,,,,,,27,9,11,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

This study is the first attempt to quantify the economic cost of the DC. The war's costs include the destruction of infrastructure, direct military spending attributable to the war effort, and the impact of the latter on capital formation. In addition, the human destruction - loss of life and income - must be taken into account. Our calculations show that the government of Sudan has incurred costs totaling US$30.5 billion, equivalent to 171% of 2003 Gross Domestic Product GDP, on the war in Darfur. This includes $10.1 billion in direct military expenses; $7.2 billion in the lost productivity of internally displaces persons; $2.6 billion in foregone lifetime earnings of the dead; $4.1 billion in infrastructure damage; and $6.5 billion in war impacts on GDP. The total costs of the war are $41.5 billion if we added military spillover and African Union/UN hybrid operation in Darfur peace-keeping operations of $10.9 billion. While the country has spent only 1.3% of its budget on public health and less than 1% on education over the past two decades. The war consumes 13% of GDP in a society that lacks the means to provide the basic entitlements of education, food, health care, and shelter to its people.","Amer Univ Cairo, Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); American University Cairo,"Ali, HE (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Cairo, Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, Cairo, Egypt.",hali@aucegypt.edu,,,,,,,61,12,12,1,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Instead, it has represented the entire Hungarian community in Slovakia. On the basis of oral history interviews analyzed against the background of local and state-level politics in Slovakia and in Hungary, this article considers the way Komarno Hungarians and Slovaks perceive themselves in their bi-ethnic environment. It contrasts the local, everyday cohabitation with the instrumentalization of the national question in Budapest and Bratislava. It shows how the continued dynamic development of the bi-ethnic community is undermined by the politicization of the national question, which in itself is seen as a part of the post-communist legacy: as if the fading contours of the physical border after the fall of the Iron Curtain had to be replaced by a symbolic border of language and nationality.","[Blaive, Muriel] Charles Univ Prague, Chair Hist Sociol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Oates-Indruchova, Libora] Palacky Univ, Dept Sociol Andrag & Cultural Anthropol, CR-77147 Olomouc, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Palacky University Olomouc,"Blaive, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Chair Hist Sociol, Prague, Czech Republic.",mblaive@gmail.com; libora.oates-indruchova@upol.cz,"Oates-Indruchova, Libora/AAD-7565-2020; Blaive, Muriel/AAA-7561-2020","Oates-Indruchova, Libora/0000-0002-1384-0450",,,,,50,3,3,0,6,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

We specifically focus on the initial level and type of regulatory capital banks hold. First, we assume that risk changes depend on banks' ex ante regulatory capital position. Second, we consider the impact of an increase in each component of regulatory capital on banks' risk changes. We find that, for highly capitalized, adequately capitalized and strongly undercapitalized banks, an increase in equity or in subordinated debt positively affects risk. Moderately undercapitalized banks tend to invest in less risky assets when their equity ratio increases but not when they improve their capital position by extending hybrid capital or subordinated debt. On the whole, our conclusions support the need to implement more explicit thresholds to classify European banks according to their capital ratios but also to clearly distinguish pure equity from hybrid and subordinated instruments.","[Camara, Boubacar] Autorite Controle Prudentiel, F-75009 Paris, France; [Lepetit, Laetitia; Tarazi, Amine] Univ Limoges, LAPE, F-87031 Limoges, France",Universite de Limoges,"Lepetit, L (通讯作者)，Univ Limoges, LAPE, 5 Rue Felix Eboue, F-87031 Limoges, France.",laetitia.lepetit@unilim.fr,"Tarazi, Amine/GQP-4387-2022","Tarazi, Amine/0000-0001-8385-2994; Lepetit, Laetitia/0000-0002-2875-4432",,,,,47,21,28,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Many scholars focus on 'wedge' issues such as religion or race, but another explanation might be geographically-based patronage-or pork. We examine the tension between redistribution and patronage with a model that combines partisan elections across multiple districts with legislation in spatial and divide-the-dollar environments. The model yields a unique equilibrium that describes the circumstances under which poor voters support right-wing parties that favor low taxes and redistribution, and under which rich voters support left-wing parties that favor high taxes and redistribution. The model suggests that one reason standard tax and transfer models of redistribution often do not capture empirical reality is that redistributive transfers are a less efficient tool for attracting votes than are more targeted policy programs. The model also underlines the central importance of party discipline during legislative bargaining in shaping the importance of redistribution in voter behavior, and it describes why right-wing parties should have an advantage over left-wing ones in majoritarian systems.","[Huber, John D.; Ting, Michael M.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Huber, JD (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jdh39@columbia.edu; mmt2033@columbia.edu,"Ting, Michael M/IYT-3438-2023",,,,,,38,12,12,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Using a stylized macroeconomic model, I derive optimal policies under uncertainty for both conventional and unconventional monetary policies. According to an estimated version of this model, the US economy is currently suffering from a large and persistent adverse demand shock. Optimal monetary policy absent uncertainty would quickly restore real GDP close to its potential level and allow the inflation rate to rise temporarily above the longer-run target. By contrast, the optimal policy under uncertainty is more muted in its response. As a result, output and inflation return to target levels only gradually. This analysis highlights three important insights for monetary policy under uncertainty. First, even in the presence of considerable uncertainty about the effects of monetary policy, the optimal policy nevertheless responds strongly to shocks: uncertainty does not imply inaction. Second, one cannot simply look at point forecasts and judge whether policy is optimal. Indeed, once one recognizes uncertainty, some moderation in monetary policy may well be optimal. Third, in the context of multiple policy instruments, the optimal strategy is to rely on the instrument associated with the least uncertainty and use alternative, more uncertain instruments only when the least uncertain instrument is employed to its fullest extent possible.

National (organizational) cultures are defined as sigma-algebras over the collective set of accumulated choices by all the people in the society (organization).

In the context of residential location choice, Kaplan et al. (2009), (2011), (2012) (KBS) developed a semi-compensatory choice model incorporating data of individuals searching for dwellings observed using a customised real estate agency website. This secondary data is used to compute the probability of considering a choice set that takes the form of an ordered probit model. In this paper, we illustrate that the simplicity of the KBS model arises because of an unrealistic assumption that individuals' choice sets only contain alternatives that derive from their observed combination of thresholds. Relaxing this assumption, we introduce a new probabilistic choice set formation model that allows the power set to include all potential choice sets derived from variations in thresholds' combinations. In addition to extending the KBS model, our proposed model asymptotically approaches the classical Manski model, if a suitable structure is used to categorise alternatives. In order to illustrate the biases inherent in the original KBS approach, we compare it with our proposed model and the MNL model using a Monte Carlo experiment. The results of this experiment show that the KBS model causes biases in predicted market share if individuals are free to choose from any potential choice sets derived from combinations of thresholds.

We consider a particular intra-industry trade model amended to allow for firms producing differentiated products. Our main finding is that trade liberalization may have an anti-competitive effect. We find that there is no unique relation between a reduction in trade costs and the degree of competition. When products are differentiated, a lowering of trade costs is pro-competitive if trade costs are initially high, but anti-competitive if trade costs initially are low. Hence, trade policy is not necessarily a substitute for competition policy.","[Hansen, Per Svejstrup] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Ashournia, Damoun] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Hansen, Jonas Worm] Danmarks Nationalbank, DK-1093 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Ashournia, D (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",psh@ifro.ku.dk,"Hansen, Per Svejstrup/D-8621-2015","Hansen, Per Svejstrup/0000-0001-5724-2877",,,,,15,4,5,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

To understand these patterns, we analyze a panel of urban Chinese households over the period 1989-2009. We document a sharp increase in income uncertainty, largely due to an increase in the variance in household income attributed to transitory idiosyncratic shocks. We then calibrate a buffer-stock savings model to obtain quantitative estimates of the impact of rising household-specific income uncertainty as well as another shock to household income the pension reforms that were instituted in the late 1990s. Our calibrations suggest that rising income uncertainty and pension reforms lead younger and older households, respectively, to raise their saving rates significantly. These two factors account for two-thirds of the increase in China's urban household saving rate and the U-shaped age-savings profile. (C) 2013 International Monetary Fund. Published by Elsevier BV.

Examining Australian and Canadian Census data between 1986 and 2006, we find that this performance advantage is not driven by differences in broader labour market conditions affecting all new labour market entrants. Rather, the results from comparing immigrants from a common source country - either the U.K., India, or China - suggest that Australian immigrants perform better, particularly in average earnings, primarily because of a different source country distribution. Moreover, the recent tightening of Australian selection policy, most notably its use of mandatory pre-migration English-language testing, appears to be having an effect, primarily by further shifting the source country distribution of immigrants away from non-English-speaking source countries, rather than in identifying higher-quality migrants within source countries.","[Clarke, Andrew] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Skuterud, Mikal] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Melbourne; University of Waterloo,"Clarke, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",andrew.clarke@unimelb.edu.au; skuterud@uwaterloo.ca,"Clarke, Andrew J/O-6201-2015",,,,,,19,14,17,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The transition towards a low-carbon economy implies the almost complete decarbonization of Europe's power sector, which could be achieved along various pathways. In this paper, we evaluate the economic implications of alternative energy policies for Europe's power sector by applying a linear dynamic electricity system optimization model in over 36 scenarios. We find that the costs of decarbonizing Europe's power sector by 2050 vary between 139 and 633 (sic)(2010), which corresponds to an increase of between 11% and 44% compared to the total system costs when no CO2 reduction targets are implemented. In line with economic theory, the decarbonization of Europe's power sector is achieved at minimal costs under a stand-alone CO2 reduction target, which ensures competition between all low-carbon technologies. If, however, renewable energies are exempted from competition via supplementary renewable energy (RES-E) targets or if investments in new nuclear and CCS power plants are politically restricted, the costs of decarbonization significantly rise. Moreover, we find that the excess costs of supplementary RES-E targets depend on the acceptance of alternative low carbon technologies. For example, given a complete nuclear phase-out in Europe by 2050 and politically implemented restrictions on the application of CCS to conventional power plants, supplementary RES-E targets are redundant. While in such a scenario the overall costs of decarbonization are comparatively high, the excess costs of supplementary RES-E targets are close to zero. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Williamson was central to the emergence of the transaction cost framework as an important aspect of social scientific analysis. Part of this approach makes important efficiency predictions and prescriptions regarding the division of labour within firms in contemporary capitalist economies. This discounts issues of power and privileges firm-specific human assets as the key organisational driver. Indeed, Williamsons approach intentionally conflates the employment relation with exchanges for intermediate goods. This article seeks to investigate Williamsons explanatory claims through a UK-based panel dataset using a dynamic logit modelling approach. The findings question Williamsons central argument. The results, instead, are more consistent with the idea of the industry-specificity of labour and highlight the importance of firm size.","[McMaster, Robert] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [White, Michael J.] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Architecture Design & Built Environm, Nottingham, England",University of Glasgow; Nottingham Trent University,"McMaster, R (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",robert.mcmaster@glasgow.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,2,2,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We analyze the interaction between the call and put option contracts, taking into account the underlying game, in the infinite Markov decision process with discounting, explaining the relationship between the valuation of options on the SPR by refiners and the valuation of financial options on a marker crude in financial markets. We conclude that the values of both call and put options on the SPR increase with oil prices and decrease with total inventory. Furthermore, our analysis shows that a more active management of the SPR creates higher social welfare (although refiners profit less from inventories) and larger volatility in inventory profits, decreasing private investment in petroleum stocks.

Whereas burdening them with legal liability for misconducts that benefit those who resort to their services actually discourages wrongdoings-as will be clarified in the article-an alienation effect can also arise. The gatekeeper might become more interested in covering up the illegal behavior. This article studies the problem with respect to tax evasion by firms in a principal-agent framework. It highlights the role of legal rules pertaining to liability for tax evasion in shaping the choices of the parties, as concealment costs vary according to whether the risk-neutral principal or the riskaverse agent is held responsible when tax evasion is detected. The main result of the analysis is that there is a simple ex post test that can be carried out to infer whether harnessing the agent was socially beneficial.","[Biswas, Rongili] Maulana Azad Coll, Kolkata, India; [Biswas, Rongili; Marchese, Carla; Privileggi, Fabio] Univ Piemonte Orientale Amedeo Avogadro, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice Polis, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Marchese, C (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale Amedeo Avogadro, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice Polis, Via Cavour 84, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy.",rongilibiswas@hotmail.com; carla.marchese@sp.unipmn.it; fabio.privileggi@sp.unipmn.it,"Privileggi, Fabio/AAW-2106-2020; Marchese, Carla/AAF-8420-2020; MARCHESE, Carla/AAK-9591-2021","Privileggi, Fabio/0000-0002-8837-2006; Marchese, Carla/0000-0001-9935-2038; MARCHESE, Carla/0000-0001-9935-2038",,,,,21,2,4,0,19,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

To address this question, the paper analyzes the welfare implications of privatization and examines the interplay of firm location in the vertical stream, differential priorities on private and public profit in welfare and cost asymmetries in a mixed bilateral monopoly. We conclude that merely comparing cost savings from privatization upstream/downstream, is inadequate. If public profit is relatively insignificant in welfare, then only relative cost savings matter. However, if public profit is sufficiently important, then privatization downstream will maximize welfare if it is as (or more) cost effective compared to privatization upstream. We find that downstream privatization can be better than upstream privatization even when the latter is more cost effective than the former.","[Bose, Arup] Indian Stat Inst, Stat Math Unit, Kolkata 700108, India; [Gupta, Barnali] Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Gupta, B (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",bosearu@gmail.com; guptab@muohio.edu,,,,,,,30,12,13,1,27,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Due to the opacity of the financial sector, outside providers of funds cannot distinguish prudent intermediaries from those imprudent ones that voluntarily hold high-risk portfolios and expose themselves to the risk of bankrupcy. We show how the number of imprudent intermediaries is determined in equilibrium jointly with the interest rate, and how both ultimately depend on the cross-sectional distribution of intermediaries' capital. One implication of our analysis is that an exogenous increase in the supply of funds to the intermediary sector lowers interest rates and raises the number of imprudent intermediaries. Another one is that easy financing may lead an increasing number of intermediaries to gamble for resurection following a bad shock to the sector's capital, again raising economywide systemic risk.

The model describes in a stylized way brain processes engaged in evaluating information provided by the experimental stimuli, and produces a consistent account of several important features of the decision process in different environments: e.g., when the probability is specified or not (ambiguous choices). These features include the choices made, the time to decide, the error rate in choice, and the patterns of neural activation. The model predicts that the further two stimuli are from each other in utility space, the shorter the reaction time will be, fewer errors in choice will be made, and less neural activation will be required to make the choice. The model also predicts that choices with ambiguity can be made more quickly and will require reduced neural activation in the horizontal intra-parietal sulcus than for choices with risk. Also, everything else being equal a larger value of certainty option in the choice will induce larger neural activation, and less experience on the part of the subject making choices will induce larger activation. We provide experimental evidence that is consistent with these predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In its 2009 linkLine decision, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the TPR for the purpose of enforcing the anti-monopolization prohibition of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. In contrast, a vertical price squeeze, defined by a TPR-like standard, is an abuse of a dominant position under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In this article, we model the impact of the TPR on market performance. We find that the TPR increases consumer surplus and net social welfare if all firms remain active in the downstream market. It sometimes induces the upstream firm to refuse to supply the downstream firm, and in such cases, consumer surplus and net social welfare are reduced. The impact of the TPR on market performance thus depends on whether or not an upstream firm can refuse to supply downstream firms on terms that would offer it at least a normal rate of return on investment.","[Martin, Stephen] Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Vandekerckhove, Jan] Univ Maastricht, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ AE1, NL-6211 LM Maastricht, Netherlands",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Maastricht University,"Martin, S (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",smartin@purdue.edu; j.vandekerckhove@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Labour institutions and globalisation are often taken to be causally related to this phenomenon, but the evidence remains inconclusive. In India, there has been an increasing use by firms in the formal manufacturing sector of temporary workers employed through contractors (contract workers) who are not represented by trade unions and do not fall under the purview of the labour laws that are applicable to directly employed workers on long-term contracts (permanent workers). We develop a model of labour demand where firms choose a mix of contract workers and permanent workers rather than permanent workers alone, essentially to counter the bargaining power of permanent workers. Our model predicts that greater import penetration will cause an increase in the employment of contract workers, while greater export orientation will have the opposite effect on contract labour usage. Our model also predicts that greater worker bargaining power will increase contract labour usage. We then test the model using state-industry-year panel data for Indian manufacturing. Consistent with our theoretical model, we find that increased import penetration leads to greater use of contract labour in Indian manufacturing, and that the effect of trade exposure on contract labour usage is stronger in states with pro-worker labour institutions.

Special emphasis is placed on the modelling of energies, crude oil, and the factors of production in the economy. To fully outline the model's features, we build simulations that hypothesize removing fuel and crude oil subsidies in an oil exporting economy to assess their effects on the labour market. The model allows for extensive treatment of transition dynamics, featuring gradual as well as immediate removal of the subsidies. We focus on constructing two alternative simulations applied to a purpose built Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of the Iranian economy, with the revenue from subsidy elimination redistributed to households as extra income or into increased investment. The study pays particular attention to SAM data construction of energy goods and factors of production. In the specific case of Iran, the model shows that rebating the revenue from subsidy removals to households affects the labour market adversely, while channelling revenue into investment improves labour fortunes in the long run. The model is sufficiently detailed and encompassing to allow for further applications to other countries and energy-labour policy issues. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

They correspond respectively to stationarity under translations and stationarity under rotations. Testing the hypothesis of isotropy is a common practice in many fields of application of spatial statistics where directional biases are of paramount importance like, for instance, in meteorology, geology or medicine to name only a few. In spatial econometrics, however, isotropy has been systematically neglected and just assumed away with no formal testing. This lack is somehow surprising, because anisotropies are more the rule rather than the exception when observing most economic phenomena. In this paper we introduce a testing procedure for spatial econometric models based on regional data that derives from Besag's idea of the unilateral approximations (Besag, 1974). The power of the test is assessed by means of a Monte Carlo experiment. Finally, we perform an empirical data analysis to test isotropy when analysing the regional convergence in Italy in the years 2000-2008.","[Arbia, Giuseppe] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Bee, Marco; Espa, Giuseppe] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; University of Trento,"Arbia, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ, Piazzale Vito 1, I-00168 Rome, Italy.",giuseppe.arbia@rm.unicatt.it; marco.bee@unitn.it; giuseppe.espa@economia.unitn.it,"arbia, giuseppe/AAD-1772-2022; Bee, Marco/K-6675-2017","Bee, Marco/0000-0002-9579-3650",,,,,34,7,7,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

This paper explores how much of these movements in the spreads of Asian economies reflected shifts in global risk aversion or country-specific risks, directly from worsening fundamentals, or indirectly from spillovers originating in other sovereigns, or risks and uncertainty surrounding their exchange rates. This analysis finds that earlier in the crisis, the increase in market-implied contagion led to an increase of sovereign bond yields relative to the swaps. Higher-rated sovereign bonds in Asia benefited from the flight to quality that accompanied the increase in global risk aversion during this period. Once the systemic risks in the financial sectors worldwide were contained, the risk of sovereign spillovers eased, which, together with a fall in perceived currency-related risks, led to a fall in sovereign bond yields relative to swaps yields across the board. Comparing the situation to that of Europe, the present paper concludes that the debt crisis in the euro area has not affected the perception of sovereign risks of Asian economies. In fact, a fall in exchange rate and spillover risks, combined with stronger fundamentals, have led to a continued normalization of Asian sovereign spreads since the height of the financial crisis.","[Caceres, Carlos; Unsal, D.

We study land conversion under competition on the market for agricultural products when voluntary and mandatory measures are combined by the Government to induce habitat conservation. We show that land conversion can be delayed by paying landholders for the provision of environmental services and by limiting the individual extent of developable land. It is found, instead, that the presence of ceilings on aggregate conversion may lead to runs which rapidly exhaust the targeted amount of land. We study the impact of uncertainty on the optimal conversion policy and discuss conversion dynamics under different policy scenarios on the basis of the relative long-run expected rate of deforestation. Interestingly, we show that uncertainty, even if it induces conversion postponement in the short-run, increases the average rate of deforestation and reduces expected time for total conversion in the long run. Finally, we illustrate our findings through some numerical simulations.","[Di Corato, Luca] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Moretto, Michele] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, I-35123 Padua, Italy; [Moretto, Michele] Ctr Studi Levi Cases, I-35123 Padua, Italy; [Vergalli, Sergio] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, I-25122 Brescia, Italy",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Padua; Fondazione Mattei; Fondazione Mattei; University of Brescia,"Vergalli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy.",luca.di.corato@slu.se; michele.moretto@unipd.it; vergalli@eco.unibs.it,"Sergio, Vergalli/U-5327-2019","Di Corato, Luca/0000-0002-1023-9504; MORETTO, MICHELE/0000-0002-5892-8165; VERGALLI, Sergio/0000-0003-2279-5011",,,,,59,5,5,0,29,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

The auctioneer receives perfect information about the bids (there is no statistical discrimination), and she has no monetary incentive to favor the members of her own group (the bidders are symmetric). We observe nonetheless some discrimination by auctioneers, who tend to assign the prize more frequently to a member of their own group when two or more players put forward the highest bid. Out-group bidders react to this bias and reduce significantly their bids, causing an average decay of their earnings throughout the game, with cumulative effects that generate unequal outcomes. Because the initial bias is costless, such mechanism can survive even in a competitive market, providing a rationale for the long-run persistence of discrimination.","[Filippin, Antonio; Guala, Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Guala, F (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy.",antonio.filippin@unimi.it; francesco.guala@unimi.it,"Filippin, Antonio/L-4243-2017; Guala, Francesco/B-6425-2015","FILIPPIN, ANTONIO/0000-0002-3824-9544; Guala, Francesco/0000-0002-6252-2264",,,,,44,6,6,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

We focus in the case of the Chinese economy in the last few decades. We find evidence that the ratio of imported to domestic capital goods, that is, the composition of investment, as well as the capital accumulation (both physical and human), was key determinants of the long-run growth rate of per capita GDP over the analyzed period. Furthermore, our results are also consistent with the hypothesis that the link between trade openness and long-run growth operates mainly through imports. This finding supports some recent developments of Schumpeterian models of growth, and the very specific economic policy recommendations arising thereof. In short, these models state that, in the early stages of growth, government intervention to encourage an investment-based strategy, with emphasis on large investment efforts and the adoption of foreign technology, could be an appropriate strategy for development.

I use the randomized roll-out of a CCT program in the Philippines. Although the program was usually implemented in all villages in a municipality, a subset of beneficiary municipalities were randomly selected to receive the program in a randomly selected subset of villages. A number of municipalities are tightly controlled by political dynasties and, thus, I can test whether the effects are dependent upon the political environment. In a competitive political environment, incumbent vote share is 26 percentage-points higher in municipalities where the program was implemented in all villages than in municipalities where the program was implemented in half of them. The program had no impact in municipalities with low levels of political competition. Further, there is evidence consistent with the argument that incumbents compensated households in control villages by redistributing their own budget there. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Barth and Ramey show that the supply-side effect of a monetary policy shock may be greater than the demand-side effect. We argue that it is crucial for monetary authorities to understand whether an increase in expected future inflation is due to supply shocks or demand shocks before applying contractionary policy to forestall inflation. We estimate a standard New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with the cost channel of monetary policy for the South African economy to show that whether the South African Reserve Bank should apply contractionary policy to fight inflation depends critically on the nature of the disturbance. If an increase in expected future inflation is mainly due to supply shocks, the South African Reserve Bank should not apply contractionary policy to fight inflation, as this would lead to a persistent increase in inflation and a greater loss in output. Our estimation results also show that with a moderate level of cost-channel effect and nominal rigidities, a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with the cost channel of monetary policy is able to mimic the price puzzle produced by an estimated vector autoregressive model.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Liu, GL (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",gliu@sun.ac.za,,,,,,,27,3,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

In this review, two broad approaches are identified: preference economisation and preference moralisation. The former is analytical, concentrates upon issues of poor respondent cognition and produces a narrow conception of value linked to utilitarianism. The latter emphasises political legitimacy, appeals to community values and tends to privilege arguments made in the public interest. Both approaches are shown to embrace forms of value convergence, which undermine the prospects for value pluralism. As a result exclusion and predefinition of values dominates current practice. In order to maintain democratic credentials, the importance attributed to monetary value needs to be left as an open question to be addressed as part of a process determining an agreement to pay. To this end we identify a discourse-based approach as a third way consistent with the democratic and value plural potential of deliberative monetary valuation.","[Lo, Alex Y.] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Lo, Alex Y.; Spash, Clive L.] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Griffith University; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Lo, AY (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",,"Lo, Alex/B-7948-2008; Spash, Clive/IST-5510-2023","Lo, Alex/0000-0002-5953-4176;",,,,,81,91,102,1,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

However, the success of such market reforms depends partly on the strength of the transmission of price signals between spatially separated markets and between different levels of commodity value chains. This study employs momentum threshold cointegration and error correction models to examine the impact of policy reforms on the transmission of prices between the world coffee market and domestic prices in Zambia and Tanzania. The findings show that in the case of Zambia, where policy reforms liberalized coffee markets, the producer prices respond more swiftly to decreases than increases in world market prices, and this swiftness increased after the policy reforms. For Tanzania, where reforms resulted in increased government intervention, producer prices were found to respond quicker to increases than decreases in world market prices over the period under consideration. However, the period before reforms showed domestic prices responding more swiftly to decreases than increases in world prices, while the post-reform period was characterized by faster responses to increases than decreases in world prices.

On one side, numerous authors have criticised Giddenss methodological writings for their failure to properly elucidate the relationship between agency and structure. Giddenss refusal to accept a role for structural causation has been the primary concern in these methodological appraisals as the upshot is a conception of social relations without any efficacy. On the other side have been the numerous critiques of Giddenss purported renewal of social democracy. Here the criticism tends to focus on Giddenss shift to the political right, but it is rarely noticed that there is also a methodological critique waiting to be developed. Giddenss early work is nothing if not a celebration of the agent with structure demoted to little more than an epiphenomenon. The later writings are, in contrast, almost entirely built around the structural omnipotence of neo-liberal capitalism, and this paper sets out to elucidate the incongruence between these two positions.","Coll Natl Univ Ireland, St Angelas Coll Sligo, Lough Gill, Co Sligo, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; St Angela's College,"O'Boyle, B (通讯作者)，Coll Natl Univ Ireland, St Angelas Coll Sligo, Lough Gill, Co Sligo, Ireland.",Boboyle@stangelas.nuigalway.ie,,,,,,,23,7,12,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

But surveys are commonly affected by nonresponding units, which can cause biased results. Many papers have examined the effect of nonresponse in individual or household surveys, but less is known in the case of business surveys. For this reason, we analyse and impute the missing observations in the If Business Survey, a large business survey in Germany. The most prominent result of this survey is the Ifo Business Climate Index, a leading indicator for the German business cycle. To reflect the underlying latent data generating process, we compare different imputation approaches for longitudinal data. After this, the microdata are aggregated and the results are compared with the original indicators to evaluate their implications at the macro level. Finally, we show that the differences between the original and imputed indicators do not lead to substantial changes in the interpretation and the forecasting performance of the indicators.

This uncertainty can only be resolved after the actual transactions take place and upon incurring significant post-purchase cost. We focus on two different settings regarding how the seller values a returned object (salvage value). We first study the case where the salvage value is exogenously determined. We find that the revenue maximizing mechanism is deterministic and separable. We illustrate that the optimal revenue can be implemented by a mechanism with a no-questions-asked return policy. In addition, we show that linear return policies are suboptimal when the hazard rates of initial estimates are monotone. We next examine the case where the salvage value is endogenously determined. We demonstrate that separability no longer holds and the recall of buyers is necessary in the optimal mechanism. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The firms' investment sensitivity on external financing explains the relatively underdeveloped capital market and the prominent role played by the banking sector for capital allocation in the Malaysian economy.

We exploit the minimum wage introduction and subsequent increases in the German roofing sector that gave rise to an internationally unprecedented hard bite of a minimum wage. We look at the chances of remaining employed in the roofing sector for workers with and without a binding minimum wage and use the plumbing sector that is not subject to a minimum wage as a suitable benchmark sector. By estimating the counterfactual wage that plumbers would receive in the roofing sector given their characteristics, we are able to identify employment effects along the entire wage distribution. The results indicate that the chances for roofers to remain employed in the sector in eastern Germany deteriorated along the entire wage distribution. Such employment spillovers to workers without a binding minimum wage may result from scale effects and/or capital-labour substitution.","[Aretz, Bodo; Arntz, Melanie; Gregory, Terry] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Aretz, Bodo] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Arntz, Melanie] Heidelberg Univ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Aretz, B (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",aretz@zew.de,"Gregory, Terry/ABD-9926-2021","Gregory, Terry/0000-0001-5334-1667",,,,,28,16,17,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The government is concerned with the redistribution of income from individuals with high utility to individuals with low utility, recognizing that some individuals live in couple households where resources are unevenly distributed. I analyze how redistributive linear income taxes, which depend on either gender or household composition (or both) impact the distribution of utility within and across households. An interesting implication arising from the interaction between the model elements is that even though between-group lump-sum transfers always favor women, when the bargaining power of men is high, women are subject to a higher tax rate; this in contrast to previous analyses of gender-based taxation. My quantitative analysis demonstrates that the welfare effects of gender-based taxation are sizable and even larger when taxes depend on the composition of the household.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Bastani, S (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",spencer.bastani@nek.uu.se,,,,,,,37,8,11,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In this paper, we investigate how release form affects the demand of a new movie after it is nationally released. In particular, we focus on movies for which the platform release is pre-planned to make the problem tractable. We estimate our model using a sample of Hollywood movies that eventually received nationwide release from 1999 to 2003. Our results show that platform release shifts consumers' perception of unobservable movie appeal through its first stage performance, which turns out to be a stronger effect than that of advertising. Meanwhile, we find that the demand for platform movies decays faster than for wide release ones after their national release. Using counterfactual analysis, we find that more than half of the platform movies which later went to national release would have earned higher profits if they had been given a wide release.","[Chen, Xinlei; Weinberg, Charles B.] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Chen, Yuxin] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL USA",University of British Columbia; Northwestern University,"Chen, XL (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",jack.chen@sauder.ubc.ca; yuxin-chen@kellogg.northwestern.edu; charles.weinberg@sauder.ubc.ca,"li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023; Wang, Jinguo/JED-9233-2023",,,,,,20,19,20,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

In our model, the agent can initiate influence activities and manipulate the behavioral signal. These activities are costly for the principal as they detract the agent from the productive task. We show that the agent's ability to manipulate the behavioral signal leads to low-powered incentives and increases the cost of implementing the efficient equilibrium as a result. Interestingly, the fact that manipulation activities entail productivity losses may lead to the design of influence-free contracts that deter manipulation and lead to high-powered incentives. This result implies that the optimal contract (and whether manipulation is tolerated in equilibrium or not) depends on the magnitude of the productivity-based influence costs.

Different salaries were announced randomly across recruitment sites, and job offers were subsequently randomized. Screening relied on exams designed to measure applicants' intellectual ability, personality, and motivation. This allows the first experimental estimates of (1) the role of financial incentives in attracting a larger and more qualified pool of applicants, (2) the elasticity of the labor supply facing the employer, and (3) the role of job attributes (distance, attractiveness of the municipal environment) in helping fill vacancies, as well as the role of wages in helping fill positions in less attractive municipalities. A theoretical model of job applications and acceptance guides the empirical inquiry. We find that higher wages attract more able applicants as measured by their IQ, personality, and proclivity toward public sector work-that is, we find no evidence of adverse selection effects on motivation; higher wage offers also increased acceptance rates, implying a labor supply elasticity of around 2 and some degree of monopsony power. Distance and worse municipal characteristics strongly decrease acceptance rates, but higher wages help bridge the recruitment gap in worse municipalities.

We show that such a common wisdom, while it holds when either unions or cross-ownership separately exist, is reversed for a fairly low degree of product differentiation and a large percentage of cross-ownership when both unions and cross-ownership are in existence: this is because the interaction between the reduced employment due to cross-ownership and the moderation of wage claims due to the menaces for employment, both magnified by increasing product market competition, works to increase profits more than how the latter are reduced by a higher competition.

The geographical course of transactions among regions is modeled as determined based on firms' modal choice. The model also includes estimates of some border cost measures such as tariff rates, non-tariff barriers, other border clearance costs, transshipment costs and so on. Our simulation analysis for Asia includes several scenarios involving the improvement/development of routes and the reduction of the above-mentioned border cost.

We suggest an alternative approach: firms promote workers only when they acquire both firm specific skills and general skills. This promotion scheme reveals information about the general skill to competing firms, which in turn allows the firm to credibly reward firm specific skills. Firms thus have an incentive to pay for general training to induce firm specific skills and they are more likely to pay for it when jobs are flexible. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The latter includes situations of bilateral trade in one direction but not in the opposite direction. While some recent literature has addressed the selection bias, there are no studies that address both problems in the context of the effect of exchange rate volatility on international trade. The article contributes to the literature by applying a recent model of firm selection to control for both biases. We found that the effect of exchange rate volatility on trade, that appears to be weak under the standard gravity model or in those models that only correct for sample selection bias, emerges as a strong negative effect as both biases get controlled.","[Al-Rashidi, Atef] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Lahiri, Bidisha] Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Lahiri, B (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",bidisha.lahiri@okstate.edu,"Lahiri, BIdisha/AAA-6584-2020","Lahiri, Bidisha/0000-0003-1884-0537",,,,,12,2,2,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The results show that there is a negative but statistically insignificant relationship between outflows of workers' remittances and economic growth in the long term. However, there is a negative and statistically significant relationship between workers' remittances and economic growth in the short term. To decrease workers' remittances, Saudi Arabia must find appropriate new channels to convince foreign workers to consume and invest their money in the country. The roles of government expenditures and exports in the economic growth of Saudi Arabia were also investigated.

We show that multinational firms are able to shift profits abroad even if they fully comply with the tax code. This is because, in equilibrium, intra-firm transactions occur in firms that are better than the market at input production. Moreover, market input prices include a mark-up that arises from the bargaining between the firm and the independent supplier. Transfer prices set at market values following the arm's length principle thus systematically exceed multinationals' marginal costs, leading to a reduction of tax payments for each unit sold. The optimal organization of firms hence provides a new rationale for the empirically observed lower tax burden of multinational corporations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

When there is a proper habit effect with a positive intertemporal elasticity of substitution, we find that the model exhibits indeterminacy if the coefficient of the habit formation is sufficiently large that allows for a substantial impact of current consumption on the habit. Indeterminacy arises even though the elasticity of the Frisch labor supply is positive and the elasticity of the labor demand in negative. In a calibrated version, we find that indeterminacy is empirically plausible when the habit effect is negative that features the catching up with the Joneses effect. Under given catching up with the Joneses effects, the external consumption habit can be a source of indeterminacy even if more than a half of the external consumption habit comes from past average consumption.","[Chen, Been-Lon] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Hsu, Yu-Shan] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Mino, Kazuo] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto Inst Econ Res, Kyoto, Japan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chung Cheng University; Kyoto University,"Chen, BL (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, 128 Acad Rd Sect 2, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",bchen@econ.sinica.edu.tw; ecdysh@ccu.edu.tw; mino@kier-koto-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23530220] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,43,5,5,0,17,SPRINGER WIEN,Vienna,"Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

This paper provides a new explanation for the complex issue of Chinese saving using a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model. We find that China's growth is positively affected by saving but has a limited effect on saving, that inequality mainly has a negative impact on growth but has a positive impact on saving, and that inequality is a stronger factor than growth in explaining high saving. Therefore, inequality must be mitigated to lower the high saving rate in China, and growth will be unaffected by lowering both inequality and saving. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The significance of the liquidity variable clearly points out that credit policy and accommodating monetary policy with the lower rates of interests must be the essential elements of economic policies that revive investment in Turkey. It seems from the empirical results that the cost of capital has a significant but discouraging effect on investment expenditure. With this empirical finding it also becomes evident that fiscal stimuli would work in stimulating private investment, they must be the essential components of an investment programme in Turkey. In regard with the purpose of this paper, the variable, namely the willingness-to-invest, that is expected to capture the perception of investors on investment climate, also appears to be significant factors for the overall sample period. Interestingly, the speed of adjustment of private investment from disequilibrium is fairly slow. This is because there may be some frictions (such as heavy tax burden) and/or some structural constraints (e.g. insufficient infrastructure and inadequate legislative structure) in the economy causing this slow down. In reviving private investment, especially in the long run, one must pay attention to the importance of these factors, and appropriate government actions have to be taken.

In a standard demand-deposit model where the HIV/AIDS prevalence among depositors is random, we show that (1) the probability of a large-scale banking failure without a bank run increases as the odds of any prevalence level increases, and (2) it is always optimal to deposit, and thus to accept the risk of banking failure, to maintain long-term investments in place.","EUROMED Management, F-13288 Marseille 9, France",,"Leoni, PL (通讯作者)，EUROMED Management, Domaine Luminy BP 921, F-13288 Marseille 9, France.",patrick.leoni@euromed-management.com,,,,,,,18,10,10,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

However little research has been devoted to forecasting hypothetical projections for important UK economic variables, assuming that the UK had in fact joined the euro at its inception in 1999. This paper focuses on estimating counterfactual series for two key macroeconomic variables: unemployment and output. We do this by estimating Phillips curves for the UK, which we then use to compute counterfactual series for what unemployment and output may have looked like for the UK had they adopted the single currency in 1999. Based on the comparison of our forecasts with observed data, we find that the UK was correct in not joining the euro; had they adopted the European single currency in 1999, unemployment would have been higher and output would have been lower.","[Mazumder, Sandeep] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",Wake Forest University,"Mazumder, S (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",mazumds@wfu.edu; pahl.ryan@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This paper addresses the quality commitment under the duopoly. By establishing a Cournot model, the effects of quality commitment are discussed. Firstly, under one-sided quality commitment, the higher efficiency firm committing in quality brings about larger price difference, larger price dispersion and higher social welfare than the lower efficiency firm launching quality commitment. Secondly, bilateral quality commitment reduces price difference and price dispersion. Thirdly, the social welfare reaches maximization under bilateral quality commitment. Finally, two firms' optimal strategies are no-commitment or simultaneously commitment and the threshold value to commitment in quality is outlined. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we use a previously unexploited data set to analyze the determinants of Janjaweed attacks on 530 civilian villages in Southwestern Darfur during the campaign that started in 2003. Our results clearly indicate that attacks have been targeted at villages dominated by the major rebel tribes, resulting in a massive displacement of those populations. Resource variables, capturing access to water and land quality, also appear to have played an important role. These patterns suggest that attacks in the area were motivated by both ethnic cleansing and resource capture, although the ethnic variables consistently have a larger impact. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Too much fiscal decentralization hurts central government incentives, whereas too little fiscal decentralization renders the local governments vulnerable to capture by the protectionist special interest groups. Moreover, the local government's preference for FDI can be endogenously polarized; therefore, a small change in fiscal decentralization across certain threshold values may lead to a dramatic difference in equilibrium FDI inflows. Empirical investigations support the idea that the difference in fiscal decentralization is an important reason for the nine-fold difference in FDI per capita between China and India. Cross-country regression results also support the inverted-U relationship. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using a task-based approach, we analyze the consequences that technological progress had on changes in the distribution of tasks performed by the men and the relative wages they received. Technological changes implied fewer physically demanding job tasks and a growing use of cognitive skills, particularly tasks where fluid cognitive abilities are important. A number of earlier physiological and cognitive studies suggest that younger workers have a comparative advantage in terms of physically demanding work and fluid cognitive abilities. Our findings confirm that while physical task use has generally decreased for most age groups, workers in their 50s experienced a more rapid growth not only in cognitively intense tasks than those in their 30s, but also in tasks that were intense in the use of fluid cognitive abilities. Following cohorts overtime, we find that all cohorts, also when education was controlled for, experienced a rapid increase in fluid task use by the 2000s. Further, the relative earnings of those in their 50s compared to younger age groups increased - possibly as result of a shift towards cognitively based work tasks where age-earnings curves are relatively steep.

F. Henderson, the inaugural director. Following the spirit of his 1960s poverty research, in the mid-1970s, government doubled unemployment allowances in real terms and increased pensions by approximately 40 per cent. Both income support payments were to be indexed by average wage increases. At the time, unemployment was typically around 1 per cent and the pension take-up for those of workforce age was also limited. Today, income support take-up rates have probably increased fivefold. In response, government has adopted a make work pay' policy over the last two decades and indexed allowances for Consumer Price Index increases and allowances have fallen by 25-35 per cent, relative to community living standards. Pensions continue to be indexed by average wage changes. I address a range of questions arising from this experience, including: Why has government abandoned the Henderson recommendations?; Is there any evidence that a make work pay' policy is working?","[Gregory, Robert G.] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Gregory, Robert G.] Victoria Univ, Ctr Strateg Econ Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Australian National University; Victoria University,"Gregory, RG (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",bob.gregory@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,29,2,3,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

However, the effect of market forces on executive compensation in SOEs is limited by CEOs' political connections.

Thus, it is standard practice to test for order homogeneity prior to testing for cointegration. Tests for the equality of integration orders are particular cases of more general tests of linear restrictions among memory parameters of different time series, for which asymptotic theory has been developed in parametric and semiparametric settings. However, most tests have been just developed in stationary and invertible settings, and, more importantly, many of them are invalid when the observables are cointegrated (because they involve inversion of an asymptotically singular matrix). We propose a general testing procedure which does not suffer from this serious drawback, and, in addition, it is very simple to compute, it covers the stationary/nonstationary and invertible/noninvertible ranges, and, as we show in a Monte Carlo experiment, it works well in finite samples.

High returns make the VCs more selective and eager to terminate nonperforming ventures because they can move on to new ones. The scarcity of VCs enables them to internalize their social value, and the competitive equilibrium is socially optimal. Moreover, the bilaterally efficient contract is a simple equity contract. We estimate the model for the period 1989-2001 and compute the excess return to venture capital, which turns out to be 8.6 percent.

Such analyses may not be enough to capture the important aspects of family behaviors since their common-preference assumption is frequently inconsistent with observed economies. By making use of a family bargaining framework, we argue that the heterogeneity in parental preferences among household members influences the result of existing studies on tax systems. Our results show that when women prefer larger family size than men, the tax reform towards individual taxation raises the fertility rate even more. In this case, female labor supply can be still increased in spite of enhanced fertility due to bargaining allocation.","Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Komura, M (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",mizuki.komura@gmail.com,"Komura, Mizuki/AAY-4040-2020",", Mizuki/0000-0001-7694-8488",,,,,68,2,3,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The motivation for this paper was whether it was possible to rationalize the lack of democratic space in Kashmir, relative to other states in India (especially since the founding fathers of the country had announced such democratic practices to be the guiding principles of the new nation) and at the same time, a highly rigid stance of the Indian Government on the Kashmir issue. An otherwise standard political economic model is used to capture how the way in which citizens determine their allegiance to one or the other nation state (India or Pakistan) can, in turn, affect the nation state's (India's) policies towards the contested land. I conclude that if the Indian Government perceives allegiance of the citizens to be determined primarily by partisan preferences of the citizens, not so much by their preferences for policies, then the government rationally concentrates on minimizing its disutility due to deviations from its most-favorite' policy. This understanding rationalizes the policies of the Indian Government towards Kashmir. More importantly, it points towards areas that need consideration for any peace-making process to take-off.","IIMB, Econ & Social Sci Area, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore,"Munshi, S (通讯作者)，IIMB, Econ & Social Sci Area, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",soumyanetra.munshi@iimb.ernet.in,,,,,,,45,2,2,0,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The panel structures considered include the pure random coefficients (RC) model with no autoregressive error component, as well as the more general case of random coefficients combined with an autoregressive error component. The ability of the MSL and CML approaches to recover the true parameters is examined using simulated datasets. The results indicate that the performances of the MSL approach (with 150 scrambled and randomized Halton draws) and the simulation-free CML approach are of about the same order in all panel structures in terms of the absolute percentage bias (APB) of the parameters and econometric efficiency. However, the simulation-free CML approach exhibits no convergence problems of the type that affect the MSL approach. At the same time, the CML approach is about 5-12 times faster than the MSL approach for the simple random coefficients panel structure, and about 100 times faster than the MSL approach when an autoregressive error component is added. As the number of random coefficients increases, or if higher order autoregressive error structures are considered, one can expect even higher computational efficiency factors for the CML over the MSL approach. These results are promising for the use of the CML method for the quick, accurate, and practical estimation of panel ordered-response models with flexible and rich stochastic specifications.

In biological systems we usually understand the source of variation as best described by the mechanisms of genetics. If human social systems are evolutionary systems, however, it would seem the variation that most explains the sources of change in these systems, occurs not from a genetic mechanism, but from individual learning. We use an evolutionary computational methodology to explore the way individual learning and adaptation lead to the evolution of persistent, self-organized social and economic activity. The basic idea behind these explorations is that the character and extent of self-organizing social and economic activity depends upon the way the environment frames the costs of individual learning and adaptation. We consider three different kinds of costs affecting learning and adaptation: the costs of autonomous searching, of communicating, and of deciding. Individuals respond to these costs by carefully, i.e., economically, choosing to learn about and interact with familiar agents in familiar arenas in which they have relatively secure expectations about the outcome of their actions. Emerging from these choices are persistent relationships among agents that lead to social and economic structure and to the imperfect coordination of aggregate production. The character and the extent of each are a function of the way the costs of information change with changing natural and human system conditions. We use a learning classifier system (LCS) to model learning. The logic of an LCS closely mimics the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution, but is applied to the evolution of an agent's decision rules. We describe the environmental context necessary for an LCS to produce economizing behavior and apply the method to a multi-agent simulation of the Maine lobster fishery, which we treat as a metaphor for competition based on the search for useful knowledge. The structure and method of the model is similar to a conventional agent-based model except we use LCS to evolve decision rules for each agent rather than supplying those rules ourselves. This allows agents to change their behavior, i.e., to learn and adapt, as their environment changes. Modeling learning and adaptation as the source of behavioral variation makes it possible to use evolutionary theory to address important questions of social and economic emergence not possible with current methods.

We find that this relation presents a U-shape profile, and that the optimal annual inflation rate (defined as the one that minimizes RPV) is around 4%, higher than the 2% inflation target proposed by the European Monetary Union. More importantly, this result does not depend on whether the monetary regime is before or after the euro. Hence, the main policy implication is that disinflation efforts to achieve the 2% inflation target result in welfare losses. The key link between inflation and RPV is unexpected inflation, whose optimal level is around zero. This suggests that monetary policy matters: the welfare costs associated with higher RPV can be minimized with a credible and predictable inflation targeting policy set at the appropriate level.","[Dabus, Carlos] Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Econ, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Angeles Caraballo, Ma] Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Seville 41018, Spain",National University of the South; University of Sevilla,"Dabús, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Econ, 12 Octubre & San Juan, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",mcaraba@us.es; cdabus@criba.edu.ar,"Caraballo, M.

Recent studies have examined industry-level trade, often using cointegration analysis, finding that a significant fraction of industries respond positively to devaluations. Oftentimes, adjustment lags result in a J curve effect, where devaluations hurt the trade balance temporarily. This study examines the specific case of trade between the United States and France, but finds that these flows are less sensitive than has been shown for other country pairs. Only 30 of 118 industries see increased trade balances after a dollar depreciation, and virtually none follow any type of a J curve. Certain industry sectors are more sensitive than others, however. Examining the SITC classifications of those 30 industries, we find that many of them are clustered in the SITC 700 (Machinery and Transport Equipment) and 800 (Miscellaneous Manufactured Articles) categories.

We use a dataset of a sample of Italian students which allows us to build different measures of risk aversion based, respectively, on a survey asking students about their willingness to invest in a risky asset and about their preferences for job security and on the results of an entry test using explicit penalty points in the case of incorrect answers. In line with the findings highlighted by the existing literature, we find that women are more risk averse than men, more patient subjects are more risk averse, while high-ability students are less risk averse. As far as intergenerational transmission of preferences is concerned, it emerges that students whose fathers are entrepreneurs have a higher propensity to take risks, while students whose fathers are employed in the public sector are more risk averse. Only fathers matter with regards to their children's risk attitudes. These results are robust to different measures of risk aversion and to different specifications of our model.","Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria,"De Paola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, Via P Bucci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",m.depaola@unical.it,,"DE PAOLA, Maria/0000-0002-1704-4136",,,,,35,11,14,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether firms' integration opportunities affect the way contract enforcement institutions determine international trade patterns. We find that the benefits of judicial quality for the exports of contract-intense goods are more muted in industries that have a greater propensity towards vertical integration arrangements with input suppliers. We show that our results are not driven by primitive industry characteristics. Our results confirm the role of judicial quality as a source of comparative advantage and suggest that this depends not only on the technological characteristics of the goods produced but also on the way firms are able to organize the production process.

While the resource boom is suspected to be the source of the real exchange rate appreciation, administrative controls on foreign exchange and imports had much more impact. Foreign exchange controls limited the convertibility of the kyat to foreign currencies and spurred negotiated transactions of foreign exchange outside the banking sector, hampering the foreign exchange market interventions of the government and Central Bank.

This paper offers an alternative to the traditional accounts that stress religiosity, the repressive nature of the previous regimes, poverty and underdevelopment, or Arab grievances against Israel. Instead, it outlines a rational choice-based explanation, in which religious political parties are able to address the problem of credible commitment, ubiquitous in new democracies. Instead of having to rely on patronage as the only mechanism of making pre-electoral commitments, Islamic parties are able to directly make credible promises about the supply of public goods. This is because they already have a history and a reputation, which both serve as channels of communication with the voters. Their reputation relies most importantly on a track record of providing social services in environments where governments have failed to do so. Furthermore, we argue that their religious nature makes them well equipped to overcome collective action problems.","[Rohac, Dalibor] Cato Inst, Washington, DC 20001 USA; [Rohac, Dalibor] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2B 4LL, England",University of London; King's College London,"Rohac, D (通讯作者)，Cato Inst, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",dalibor.rohac@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,72,9,9,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2013,66.0,2,,,,,256,274,,10.1111/kykl.12020,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,126NN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317624500004,0

We use Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) model in which parameters change according to the phase of the housing cycle. The results suggest that monetary policy is not neutral as house price growth decreases substantially with a contractionary monetary policy. We find that the impact of monetary policy is larger in bear regime than in bull regime; indicating the role of information asymmetry in reinforcing the financial constraint of economic agents. As expected, monetary policy reaction to a positive house price shock is found to be stronger in the bull regime. This suggests that the central bank reacts more in bull regime in order to prevent potential crisis related to the subsequent bust in house prices bubbles which are more prominent in bull markets. These results substantiate important asymmetries in the dynamics of house prices in relation to monetary policy, vindicating the advantages of generating regime dependent impulse response functions.

An increase in the coefficient of trade intensity and the significance of financial integration is observed in the post-Crisis period.

We find entry into male-dominated fields of study and male-dominated occupations are both related to the extent to which individuals have masculine traits and believe they are intelligent, while entry into male-dominated occupations is also related to the willingness to work hard, impulsivity, and the tendency to avoid problems. The nature of these relationships differs for men and women, however. Psychosocial traits (self-assessed intelligence and impulsivity) also influence movement into higher-paid occupations, but in ways that are similar for men and women. On balance, psychosocial traits provide an important, though incomplete, explanation for segregation in the fields that young men and women study as well as in the occupations in which they are employed.

We use both a difference-in-difference approach - in which the impact of regulations is identified by exploiting likely cross-industry differences in their impact - and standard time-series analysis - in which the effect of regulations is identified through regulatory changes over time. We find that the more restrictive the regulation, the smaller is the rate of within-industry job-to-job transitions, in particular towards permanent jobs. By contrast, we find no significant effect as regards separations involving an industry change or leading to non-employment. The extent of reinstatement in the case of unfair dismissal appears to be the most important regulatory determinant of gross worker flows.

This can be applied to multi-unit assignment problems and certain two-sided matching problems.","[Budish, Eric] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Che, Yeon-Koo] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Che, Yeon-Koo] Yonsei Univ, YERI, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kojima, Fuhito; Milgrom, Paul] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Chicago; Columbia University; Yonsei University; Stanford University,"Budish, E (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",eric.budish@chicagobooth.edu; yeonkooche@gmail.com; fuhitokojima1979@gmail.com; paul@milgrom.net,"Koo, Yeon/Q-3792-2019; Milgrom, Paul/AAF-3285-2019","Milgrom, Paul/0000-0002-1919-4138; Kojima, Fuhito/0000-0002-1154-2652","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1023818] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,44,134,161,1,54,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We show, within a stylized life-cycle framework, that the Ramsey optimal policy consists in equalizing consumption/leisure wedges over the life cycle. A simple way to implement this is to make day care expenses tax deductible. Modifying and calibrating our model to fit some key facts about labour supply in Germany, we find that the reform that maximizes a distribution-neutral social welfare function involves subsidizing day care at a rate of 50% and leads to a near doubling of labour supply for mothers with small children. The overall welfare gain from this reform corresponds to a 0.4 percent increase in consumption.","[Domeij, David] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Klein, Paul] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Stockholm School of Economics; Simon Fraser University,"Domeij, D (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,"Klein, Paul/0000-0002-0141-3902",,,,,51,28,34,3,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

For a sample of 202 countries over the period 1950-2006, we find that most changes are relatively small and roughly equally likely to be either in the direction of more parliamentarian or more presidential systems. Based on a fixed effects ordered logit panel data model estimated over the period 1951-2000 for 146 countries, we find that such changes in the constitution can be explained by characteristics of the political system, internal and external political conflicts, and political leaders, whereas economic and socio-demographic variables do not matter.

Our main theoretical results are two-fold. First, unemployment is lower under firm-level bargaining, due both to a lower job destruction rate and a higher job-finding rate. Key to this result is the interplay between firm heterogeneity and wage compression under sector-level bargaining. Second, introducing efficient opting-out of sector-level agreements suffices to bring unemployment down to its level under decentralized bargaining. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In an environment where firms are binded by contractual constraints regarding the duration of partnerships, how does the tacitness and complexity influence the overall knowledge in the industry? Through an agent based simulation model, we compare the knowledge generation in irreversible and reversible systems in two regimes as tacit and codified. The emerging network structures are also analysed. The results reveal that, in tacit regimes irreversible systems generate more knowledge only when product complexity is at an intermediate level.","[Llerena, Patrick] Univ Strasbourg, BETA, CNRS, UMR 7522, F-67085 Strasbourg, France; [Ozman, Muge] Telecom Ecole Management, Inst Telecom, F-91011 Evry, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Lorraine; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique,"Ozman, M (通讯作者)，Telecom Ecole Management, Inst Telecom, 9 Rue Charles Fourier, F-91011 Evry, France.",muge.ozman@it-sudparis.eu,"Ozman, Muge/AAG-5104-2019","Ozman, Muge/0000-0002-4201-414X",,,,,48,4,5,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

However, due to usual survey designs, both IVs are available only for the individuals whose spouse or parents are present in the same household. The IV estimates based on these selective sub-samples may be inconsistent, even when the IVs satisfy the standard assumptions. In this paper, we examine the empirical relevance of this issue in the Chinese context. To our surprise, unlike the selection issue in other situations, this kind of selection does not appear particularly worrisome, suggesting that the previous IV results are robust. In particular, using China Household Income Project 1995 and 2002, we find that correcting for this potential issue has only a modest impact on the magnitude of the standard IV estimates using parental education as an IV, but a negligible impact on those using spousal education. By using the specification tests proposed, we find that these impacts are generally not statistically significant. These results are further confirmed by our analysis using U.S. data. We believe that these results are of use to both policymakers and practitioners. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

If anything, the Doha Round has been a victim of its own success: considerable de facto liberalization in agriculture has been achieved since the launch of the round. Second, to secure the future of the multilateral trading system, it is nevertheless crucial that the Doha Round is brought to a conclusion even if in a highly diluted form. The damage to the system from an outright failure will be very substantial. Finally, closing the Doha Round will require the United States leading the negotiations.
