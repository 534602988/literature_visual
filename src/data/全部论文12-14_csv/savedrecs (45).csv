In this paper, we provide a comprehensive picture of the philanthropic behavior in Europe by analyzing both, the correlates of individuals' charitable cash donations and volunteer labor as well as their interdependence. Using data from the European Social Survey, we document a positive correlation between time and money contributions on the individual as well as on the country level. In addition, we find evidence that individuals substitute time donations by money donations as their time offered to the market increases. Moreover, analyzing philanthropic behavior on the disaggregated level reveals large differences in the determinants and the relationship of time and money donations in Europe - both across different types of voluntary organizations and across different welfare regimes.

This paper presents research which has studied the potential benefits of changing the infrastructure within a cycle network - here the National Cycle Network (NCN) in the United Kingdom (UK) - to enhance the intrinsic rewards of cycling. The rationale in this approach is that this could be a motivating factor in encouraging greater use of the cycle network, and consequently help in promoting cycling and active travel more generally amongst family groups. The project involved in-depth research with 64 participants, which included family interviews, self-documented family cycle rides, and school focus groups. The findings suggest that improvements to the cycling environment can help maintain ongoing motivation for experienced cycling families by enhancing novel aspects of a routine journey, creating enjoyable activities and facilitating other incidental experiences along the course of a route, and improving the kinaesthetic experience of cycling. For those less experienced, this can create a legitimacy of space and mode that could help dispel real or imagined safety fears associated with cycling. Despite the potential of these benefits to assist in changing travel behaviour, it is acknowledged that they are not alone a solution to the barriers to greater cycling uptake, and continued development of off-road and specialist cycle networks must continue.

It measures the economic value of a number of methods for forming optimal portfolios on the basis of realized volatility. These include the traditional econometric approach of forming portfolios from forecasts of the covariance matrix. Both naive forecasts using simple historical averages, and those generated from econometric models are considered. A novel method, where a time series of optimal portfolio weights are constructed from observed realized volatility and direct forecast is also proposed. A number of naive forecasts and the approach of directly forecasting portfolio weights show a great deal of merit. Resulting portfolios are of similar economic benefit to a number of competing approaches and are more stable across time. These findings have obvious implications for the manner in which volatility timing is undertaken in a portfolio allocation context. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of the current study is to test if money management, buying motivations for improving mood and identity, and self-transformation expectations mediate the link from material values to compulsive buying. In one sample (N= 1077) we find, as expected, that materialism correlates positively with compulsive buying and that a lack of money management mediates the path from materialism to compulsive buying. In a second sample (N = 650) we find that, specifically, it is the poor credit management of materialists that most strongly mediates this relation. Further, emotional buying motives (i.e., shopping in order to improve one's mood) and transformation expectations also mediate the relationship between materialism and compulsive buying. Thus, the tendency of materialists to (a) not manage their credit, (b) believe that their purchases will transform their lives, and (c) make purchases for emotional reasons completely explains their greater frequency of compulsive buying.

The information agent performs the task of disseminating information regarding a green and a polluting firm's environmental profiles to consumers differing in their preferences for the two firms' products. The result reveals that, in the absence of information dissemination, the green firm earns a lower market share which necessitates the information agent's intervention to encourage the consumption of green product. Moreover, complete information dissemination regarding the green firm's environmental profile is sufficient to generate a higher market share for the green firm. The paper also finds that an increase in information dissemination regarding either of the two firms' environmental profiles decreases environmental damage accrued to the society and encourages a greener consumption pattern.

Time geography and, in particular, the concept of space-time constraints provides a useful framework for these selection processes. In this work we empirically determine space-time constraints from the Chilean household and travel survey. Based on a specific activity pattern example, where trips are made from home to work to a discretionary activity and back home, we estimate detour factors. Detour factors describe the spatial deviations that are made from the home-work axis to conduct the discretionary activity. Using GIS we estimate potential path areas (PPAs), where discretionary activities may be located. Within the PPAs, applying a time constraint that is the maximum daily travel time refines the selection of discretionary activity locations. The thresholds of the daily travel time vary according to the PPA-size and mode combinations. We were able to reproduce between 38% and 72% of the discretionary location choices observed in the survey (according to the rigor of the constraints applied). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we consider the nature of the time inconsistency involved in such a policy and its implication for discretionary policymaking. We show that governments are tempted, given inflationary expectations, to utilize their monetary and fiscal instruments in the initial period to change the ultimate debt burden they need to service. We demonstrate that this temptation is only eliminated if following shocks, the new steady-state debt is equal to the original (efficient) debt level even though there is no explicit debt target in the government's objective function. Analytically and in a series of numerical simulations we show which instrument is used to stabilize the debt depends crucially on the degree of nominal inertia and the size of the debt stock. We also show that the welfare consequences of introducing debt are negligible for precommitment policies, but can be significant for discretionary policy. Finally, we assess the credibility of commitment policy by considering a quasi-commitment policy, which allows for different probabilities of reneging on past promises.","[Leith, Campbell] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Wren-Lewis, Simon] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Glasgow; University of Oxford,"Leith, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Campbell.leith@glasgow.ac.uk; Simon.wren-lewis@economics.oc.ac.uk,"Leith, Campbell/N-1025-2019","Leith, Campbell/0000-0002-6406-2636","ESRC [ES/G006873/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G006873/1, RES-156-25-0003] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,37,17,19,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

When we analyzed the average results, we found that participants behave as the Sshape value function predicts. However, breaking the data down on the individual level reveals that the S-shape is valid just for about one-third of the cases. This result emerged from all three experiments. In the first experiment, we used lotteries with different stakes and found that in the high stake only 31% of the participants behave as the S-shape value function predicts. The percentage decreases to 16% when the stakes were lowered. In the second experiment, we used the prepayment mechanism (PPM) to create a more realistic experimental environment. In this case, 37% of the participants behaved consistently with the S-shape value function. In the third experiment, we used allocation tasks. The results revealed that most subjects could not be classified into one of the classical risk attitude groups. Our results imply that more than one value function is needed to characterize individuals' attitudes toward risk. Deeper analysis is needed to characterize different value functions for different groups of individuals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Historical financial events have shown that correlations can rise quickly, causing a huge increase in portfolio risk. Therefore, in stress testing portfolios, it is important to consider the influence of a sudden surge in selected correlations. Standard correlation stress testing mechanisms require us to change the selected correlations to designated values. However, the correlation matrix may become non-positive definite after some of its entries are altered. This paper proposes a blocking method by which an existing correlation matrix can be converted to incorporate change while keeping the matrix positive definite. In comparison with existing methods that usually only achieve semi-positive definiteness, the proposed method outperforms in the revised elements, while the approximation error of the non-revised elements is maintained within acceptable levels. Simulations show that our method is efficient and performs well for dimensions of 100, 500 and 1000. Our method is also shown to be more reliable in stress testing higher dimension correlation matrices. Information on the performance of the blocking method using a high-dimensional real data is also provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[So, Mike K.

It does so by re-evaluating the results of a recent, influential paper which concluded that health aid is fully fungible in the long run. Allowing for the presence of off-budget aid indicates that the degree of fungibility of health aid is much more uncertain than at first blush appears. Under plausible assumptions about the role of off-budget aid, the conclusion of full fungibility is overturned and at most only a limited degree of fungibility is found.","[Van de Sijpe, Nicolas] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 3TB, England; [Van de Sijpe, Nicolas] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 3TB, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Van de Sijpe, N (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Queen Elizabeth House,3 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TB, England.",nicolas.vandesijpe@qeh.ox.ac.uk,"Van de Sijpe, Nicolas/G-6451-2010","Van de Sijpe, Nicolas/0000-0003-0442-7020",,,,,29,12,12,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Both these trends combined would be consistent with a decrease in the volatility of output. We suggest testable implications in terms of both growth of credit and output and volatility of growth. In a multivariate GARCH framework, we test this view for home mortgages and residential investment. We observe unidirectional causality in variance from total output, residential investment and non-residential output to mortgage lending before, but not during the Great Moderation.

Throughout those years he was a leading critic of U.S. monetary policy. Francis argued in policy meetings and public venues that monetary policy should focus on maintaining a stable price level. In contrast, most policymakers at the time believed it possible to exploit a trade-off between unemployment and inflation. While Francis attributed inflation directly to excessive growth of the money stock, other policymakers blamed labor and product market failures, fiscal policy, and commodity price shocks. Francis argued that inflation could not be controlled except by limiting the growth of monetary aggregates; other policymakers promoted price controls or other schemes. Francis favored maintaining a stable money stock growth rate at a time when monetary policy was widely interpreted as involving the manipulation of interest rates. Reviewing the debates between Francis and his Federal Reserve colleagues improves our understanding of the reasons behind the Fed's monetary policy actions at the time and illuminates how policy views evolved within the System toward accepting price level stability as the paramount, long-run objective for monetary policy.","[Hafer, R.

The relation holds for various measures of information asymmetry such as the probability of information-based trading (PIN), permanent price impact, and adverse selection component of bid-ask spread, even after adjusting for endogeneity between news release and information asymmetry. By decomposing the PIN into intensities of uninformed and informed trades, similarly to Brown and Hillegeist (2007), we find that intensity of uninformed trading increases much more than that of informed trading for firms with more frequent news releases. As a result, information asymmetry, as is measured by PIN, decreases for such firms due to the large increase in the intensity of uninformed trading. Our findings highlight not only the importance of news releases in leveling the playing field of investors but also the role of uninformed investors in reducing trading cost due to information asymmetry.

Cross-sectional dispersion of firm valuations and expected returns,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Return predictability; Dispersion; Overconfidence; Investor sentiment; Valuation ratios; Business cycle,BOOK-TO-MARKET; STOCK RETURNS; OVERCONFIDENCE; EQUILIBRIUM; SAMPLE; VOLATILITY; EARNINGS; TESTS; PRICE,"Behavioral theories predict that firm valuation dispersion in the cross-section (dispersion) measures aggregate overpricing caused by investor overconfidence and should be negatively related to expected aggregate returns. This paper develops and tests these hypotheses. Consistent with the model predictions, I find that measures of dispersion are positively related to aggregate valuations, trading volume, idiosyncratic volatility, past market returns, and current and future investor sentiment indexes. Dispersion is a strong negative predictor of subsequent short- and long-term market excess returns. Market beta is positively related to stock returns when the beginning-of-period dispersion is low and this relationship reverses when initial dispersion is high. A simple forecast model based on dispersion significantly outperforms a naive model based on historical equity premium in out-of-sample tests and the predictability is stronger in economic downturns.

Using weekly data (2000-2012), the cash rate and lending rates are pairwise cointegrated. An asymmetric short-run dynamic model is then estimated in which both the size and sign of disequilibria are taken into account. Significant evidence of the adjustment asymmetry is found among 8 lenders (including all foreign subsidiary banks). This paper also finds that the three largest domestic banks pass on the RBA's official rate rises to borrowers more than they do for rate cuts, affecting the efficacy of expansionary versus contractionary monetary policy.

They are believed to reduce car dependency and stimulate sustainable mobility. We test this assumption through an analysis of workplace relocation to such a centre located in the inner suburbs of Lisbon, Portugal and examine its impact on commuting. We use primary data concerning previous and current commuting patterns, collected through a survey of employees working at the site. Binary and multinomial logistic models were developed to identify the explanatory variables of the observed impacts on commuting behaviour. Our findings showed a significant increase in commuting distance and.the use of the car, and an insignificant change in commuting time. The relocation affected city centre residents most negatively. This demonstrates a strategy that aims to maintain commuting time within acceptable limits. Car use is greater when travel time increases and there is transportation mode inertia within the acceptable travel time. In this case, workplace relocation to a suburban mixeduse transit-oriented centre did not trigger the expected changes in mobility pattern, suggesting that the structure needs to be complemented by other travel demand measures to discourage workers from using their cars to commute.

Changes in labor force and industrial compositions account for one quarter of the increase of nonstandard workers. Product-demand fluctuation and the introduction of information and communication technologies increased firms' usage of nonstandard workers, but its quantitative effects are limited. The increase of nonstandard workers was concentrated among new entrants to the labor market, male workers of younger cohorts, and female workers of all cohorts, suggesting that the declining importance of the long-term employment relationship is a major cause for the increase of nonstandard workers.","[Asano, Hirokatsu] Asia Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Ito, Takahiro] Hiroshima Univ, Hiroshima 730, Japan; [Kawaguchi, Daiji] Hitotsubashi Univ, Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Tokyo, Japan; [Kawaguchi, Daiji] Tokyo Ctr Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan",Hiroshima University; Hitotsubashi University,"Asano, H (通讯作者)，Asia Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Ito, Takahiro/N-1471-2013","Ito, Takahiro/0000-0003-1002-2214; Kawaguchi, Daiji/0000-0002-0595-9443","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23330079, 21330058, 22243020, 23730237, 23330070] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,34,24,25,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

These findings highlight how dependence on the secondary market may cause amplification of financial shocks, and the potential value of capital requirements that are higher during periods of economic growth in mitigating the amplification effects.","[Calem, Paul] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA; [Covas, Francisco; Wu, Jason] Fed Reserve Board, Div Monetary Affairs, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Calem, P (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA.",Paul.Calem@phil.frb.org; Francisco.B.Covas@frb.gov; Jason.J.Wu@frb.gov,,,,,,,19,13,18,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Can asymmetries be predicted using financial and macroeconomic variables? To answer the first question, we provide evidence for asymmetry in government bond returns in particular for short maturities. This finding has important implications for modeling and forecasting government bond returns. For example, widely used models for yield curve analysis such as the affine term structure model assume symmetrically distributed innovations. To answer the second question, we find that liquidity in government bond markets predicts the coefficient of skewness with a positive sign, meaning that the probability of a large and negative excess return is more likely in a less liquid market. In addition, a positive realized return is associated with a negative coefficient of skewness, or a small probability of a large and negative return in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As investors' expectations about the potential of biotech have changed, funding options have opened up and closed down, leading firms to develop new business models and routes of technology development. After a favorable period, new constraints on stock market funding have forced UK biotech firms to compress their life cycles, constraining their ability to generate the late-stage drug candidates sought by large pharmaceutical firms. These changes are analyzed within a neo-Chandlerian framework in the context of a selection environment where rather than firms of varying inefficiencies being selected by an efficient market, we find entrepreneurs submitting themselves to an inefficient investment-selection process at the intersection of industries attempting to achieve their own scale economies. The article highlights the importance of the scale of investment at the firm and industry level, and suggests that decline in the size of the industry can have adverse consequences for investment and firm performance in this setting.","[Hopkins, Michael M.; Crane, Philippa A.; Nightingale, Paul] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Freeman Ctr, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England; [Baden-Fuller, Charles] Cass Business Sch, London EC 1Y 8TZ, England",University of Sussex,"Hopkins, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Freeman Ctr, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England.",m.m.hopkins@sussex.ac.uk; p.crane@sussex.ac.uk; p.nightingale@sussex.ac.uk; c.baden-fuller@city.ac.uk,,"Nightingale, Paul/0000-0002-4155-0880","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K039695/1, EP/E037208/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K039695/1, EP/E037208/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,102,35,37,1,65,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

It suggests that levels of (un)freedom can usefully be understood by analysing the various forms of control exercised over the movement of labour. More specifically, the article explores how unfreedom can be understood as a particular assemblage of spatial practices that simultaneously compel migration and enforce spatial confinement. With a focus on Mauritius, it is argued here that the coerced or manipulated nature of the transnational movements of indentured and contract migrant labour combined with their subsequent immobility on plantations and in factory compounds shapes the degree of their unfreedom. Additionally, the article extends the historical trajectory of much previous work on unfreedom by exploring the connections between the colonial regime of indentured labour and the contemporary recruitment of contract labour migrants.","Univ Manchester, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Kothari, U (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Uma.Kothari@manchester.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-451-26-0537] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [RES-451-26-0537] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,59,20,20,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Reallocation of factors across sectors contributes relatively little to the aggregate gains, but has large distributional effects. The aggregate gains to the rest of the world are only 0.065 percentage points lower when neither capital nor labor can move across sectors within a country. On the other hand, the distributional effects of the emerging giants' trade integration are an order of magnitude larger, with changes in real factor returns ranging from -5 percent to 5 percent across sectors in most countries.

The region is characterized by poverty, illiteracy, weak infrastructure, failed states, widespread conflict, and an abysmal status of women. Scenarios beyond 2050 demonstrate that, without urgent and significant action today, the Sahel could become the first part of planet earth that suffers large-scale starvation and escalating conflict as a growing human population outruns diminishing natural resources. National governments and the international community can do a great deal to ameliorate this unfolding disaster if they put in place immediate policies and investments to help communities adapt to climate change, make family planning realistically available, and improve the status of girls and women. Implementing evidence-based action now will be an order of magnitude more humane and cost-effective than confronting disaster later. However, action will challenge some long held development paradigms of economists, demographers, and humanitarian organizations. If the crisis unfolding in the Sahel can help bridge the current intellectual chasm between the economic commitment to seemingly endless growth and the threat seen by some biologists and ecologists that human activity is bringing about irreversible damage to the biosphere, then it may be possible also to begin to solve this same formidable problem at a global level.","[Potts, Malcolm; Henderson, Courtney; Campbell, Martha] Univ Calif Berkeley, Bixby Ctr Populat Hlth & Sustainabil, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Potts, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Bixby Ctr Populat Hlth & Sustainabil, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",potts@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,44,9,10,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

A conventional view of global imbalances considers them to primarily result from macroeconomic policies and cyclical forces that cause demand for goods to outstrip supply in the United States and other rich countries and that have the opposite effect in major emerging markets. An alternative view holds that global imbalances are the result of structural distortions and slow-changing factors that primarily affect assets markets. This paper reviews the analytical underpinnings of these two perspectives and the empirical evidence of their respective merits. The paper then assesses the outlook for global imbalances after the crisis, particularly in terms of policy action to reduce their magnitude. Policy intervention is warranted to the extent that the imbalances are driven by welfare-reducing distortions, but in this case, the primary target of policy intervention should be the distortions rather than the imbalances. Finally, the paper examines various forms of international spillovers that may call for multilateral action to limit global imbalances.",,,,,,,,,,,61,1,2,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Taking this into account, we propose a simple statistical model to identify speculative bubbles in financial markets. Through the estimates of the time varying parameters, including transition probabilities, we can identify when and how newly born bubbles grow and burst over time. The model can be estimated by recursive computations, which require a huge storage capacity for standard computers. For this reason, we introduce an approximation in the computation, maintaining the recursive nature of our estimation technique. We then apply this model to the stock markets of the United States, Japan, and China, estimate its parameters and the probabilities of a bubble crash, and obtain several interesting results: the time series data of the stock price bubble show an inherently non-stationary development and the probability of a bubble crash indeed increases as the stock price becomes too high or too low.

Lastly, we find that investors discount positive earnings surprises when accompanied by exclusions from GAAP earnings, suggesting that the market partially understands the opportunistic nature of these exclusions.

This paper extends existing theory by proposing a new concept of accessibility, termed the 'perceived activity set' (PAS). A person's PAS is defined as the set of out-of-home activities which they view as encompassing their potential travel needs when making decisions that structurally affect their accessibility. In other words, it is proposed that a person's mobility-linked choices such as, for instance, where to live or whether to own a car, are a function of how such choices affect their ability to access out-of-home activities they consider relevant. This paper first formalises the PAS and places it in the wider context of accessibility theory. It then presents an empirical study that makes use of the PAS concept, which analyses people's ownership of several mobility resources that each enable particular forms of travel. The PAS appears promising, as it unlocks a class of flexible techniques that relax restrictive assumptions regarding the drivers behind structural choices related to personal mobility. The techniques were found to be analytically tractable, and the empirical analysis based on the PAS yielded a number of insights. The advantages of using long-duration diaries with PAS-based techniques, rather than more-common one-day diaries, are shown to be large. It was found that the more 'substantial' a mobility resource is (in terms of expense and commitment) the better the PAS concept is at explaining patterns of ownership. The paper concludes with suggested directions for research to further develop the PAS concept, which include refinements to the quantitative techniques, extension to other structural mobility choices, and qualitative research into the nature of the relationship between people's perceived needs for mobility and their expected activity patterns over longer periods than are observed by most activity and travel surveys.

M.; Dougan, William R.",,,Efficiency in the provision of pure public goods by private citizens,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public goods; Voluntary provision; Non-cooperation; Voluntary providing group size,,"This paper raises an old question and proposes a new answer. The question is, Must public goods be produced by governments? The consensus answer is Yes, on the grounds that transaction costs related to group size prevent all potential consumers of a public good from entering into voluntary arrangements to produce efficient levels of that good. Government intervention thus is required to achieve efficiency. Yet many obvious examples of public goods are not financed or even subsidized by government. Conspicuous examples of this phenomenon include the development of important innovations in technique in fields such as music (Bach and Beethoven), literature (Defoe, Dickens and Shakespeare, not excepting Homer or Adam Smith), and the visual arts (Cezanne), not to mention many crucial scientific discoveries. Indeed, the obvious public-good aspects of scientific knowledge induced many private societies to offer prizes for particular innovations. Two questions are raised by the private, voluntary provision of nonrival outputs or inputs: (1) what conditions contribute to this phenomenon, and (2) can voluntary provision come close to efficient provision? We suggest in this paper that, under certain conditions, the gains from many public goods whose benefits reach nationwide populations are largely realized at group sizes far smaller than even county or municipal jurisdictions.","[Lindsay, C.

At the macro-level, we find that the increasing presence of mainland Chinese stocks in Hong Kong increases the size, trading volume, and its link with the China and world markets but reduces the overall volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. At the firm level, the increase affects the market quality, resulting in lower turnover rate, higher Amihud illiquidity ratio, and higher spread for non-mainland Chinese firms. Furthermore, such an increase in presence causes Hong Kong stocks to move in a more synchronized way and reduces these firms investment sensitivity to stock price movement, implying deterioration in the information environment. As a whole, the increasing presence of Chinese companies in Hong Kong brings benefits to the Hong Kong market, yet not without cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

According to the portfolio balance effect theory in periods of financial crisis there is a causal relationship from stock returns to exchange rate returns. Previous studies detect this relationship in short-run but not in long-run level. However, they use, for testing the long-run relationship, standard linear cointegrating regression models that suffer from biased estimations and cannot detect non-linear relationships. To overcome these problems, we examine the long-run relationship adopting a more advanced econometric model, the structural nonparametric cointegrating regression. The results exhibit a causal relationship from stock prices to exchange rates that is long-run in EU and short-run in USA. The finding of long-run relationship with this direction is particularly important because it is presented for first time in relative literature and shows the need for a new pattern of economic policy in EU.

We use DCC-MIDAS and kernel regression techniques as alternatives to the standard ex-post measures. We find betas to exhibit substantial persistence, time variation, ranking variability, and heterogeneity in their business cycle exposure. While we find only a limited amount of structural breaks in the betas of individual industries, we do identify a common structural break in March 1998. We propose two practical applications to understand the economic significance of these results. We find the cross-sectional dispersion in industry betas to be countercyclical and negatively related to future market returns. We also find DCC-MIDAS betas to outperform other beta measures in terms of limiting the downside risk and ex-post market exposure of a market-neutral minimum-variance strategy. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A multi-species and multi-fleet model integrating Lotka-Volterra trophic dynamics as well as production and profit assessments is developed and applied to the coastal fishery of French Guiana. This small-scale fishery constitutes a challenging example with high fish biodiversity, several non-selective fleets and a potentially increasing local food demand due to demographic growth. The dynamic model is calibrated with 13 species and four fleets using monthly catch and effort data from 2006 to 2009. Several contrasted fishing scenarios including status quo, total closure, economic and viable strategies are then simulated. They are compared from the viewpoints of both biodiversity preservation and socioeconomic performance, assuming fixed landing prices and fixed costs. We show that fishing outputs, including food supply and fleet profitability, can be sustained on average but a loss of species cannot be avoided.","[Cisse, A.

We find that the density of the global banking network defined by these flows is pro-cyclical, expanding and contracting with the global cycle of capital flows. We also find that country connectedness in the network tends to rise before banking and debt crises and to fall in their aftermath. Despite a historically unique build-up in aggregate flows prior to the global financial crisis, network density in 2007 was comparable to earlier peaks. This suggests that factors other than connectedness, such as the location of the initial shock to the core of the network, have contributed to the severity of the crisis. The global financial crisis stands out as an unusually large perturbation to the global banking network, with indicators of network density in 2008 reaching all-time lows. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The main findings are that the complete removal of tariffs leads to a decrease in overall poverty with rich household groups in a relatively better position. In the short run poverty incidence increases for rural landless, urban illiterate, and low-educated household groups whereas rural large farmer and urban medium household groups enjoy improvements in all poverty indicators. In terms of income distribution, trade liberalization enhances inequality slightly, but there is a tendency towards more equitable distribution in the long run.

We rank the measures using three criteria: (i) Granger causality tests, (ii) Gonzalo and Granger metric, and (iii) correlation with an index of systemic events and policy actions. We find that the best systemic measure in the macro group is the first principal component of a portfolio of Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads whereas the best measure in the micro group is the multivariate densities computed from CDS spreads.

We show that the firm's optimal production and hedging decisions depend crucially on the degree of forward market incompleteness, and on the correlation structure of the price and exchange rate risk. The separation theorem holds if there are complete forward markets for hedging purposes. Should the forward markets be incomplete, the firm employs operational hedging by adjusting its output so as to better cope with the residual risk that is unhedgeable by simply trading the existing forward contracts. In the case that the price risk cannot be directly managed by financial hedging, we construct a reasonable example in which the Firm optimally produces more, not less, than the benchmark output level under perfect hedging. Our results thus offer new insights into the interaction between financial and operational hedging in the context of multiple sources of uncertainty. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Yet our knowledge of the impacts of climate policy may not be of sufficient quality to be described by unique probabilistic beliefs. In such circumstances, it has been argued that the axioms of expected utility theory may not be the correct standard of rationality. By contrast, several axiomatic frameworks have recently been proposed that account for ambiguous knowledge. In this paper, we apply static and dynamic versions of a smooth ambiguity model to climate mitigation policy. We obtain a general result on the comparative statics of optimal abatement and ambiguity aversion, and then extend our analysis to a more realistic, dynamic setting, where we introduce scientific ambiguity into the well-known DICE model of the climate-economy system. For policy-relevant exogenous mitigation policies, we show that the value of emissions abatement increases as ambiguity aversion increases, and that this 'ambiguity premium' can in some plausible cases be very large. In these cases the effect of ambiguity aversion on welfare is comparable to that of other much studied welfare parameters. Thus ambiguity aversion may be an important neglected aspect of climate change economics, and seems likely to provide another argument for strong abatement policy.","[Millner, Antony] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Millner, Antony; Dietz, Simon] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Dietz, Simon] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Heal, Geoffrey] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Columbia University,"Millner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",A.Millner@lse.ac.uk; s.dietz@lse.ac.uk,"Dietz, Simon/AAX-9362-2020","Dietz, Simon/0000-0001-5002-018X",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,64,102,106,1,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Since exporters are more skill intensive than nonexporters, a decrease in trade barriers initially increases wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers, as a result of an increase in the relative demand for skilled labor. Over time, however, as agents respond to the change in relative wages by investing in skilled labor, the relative wage of skilled labor decreases.

Using a broad panel of large US bank holding companies over the period 1997-2011, we find that both board size and independent directors decrease bank performance. Although gender diversity improves bank performance in the pre-Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) period (1997-2002), the positive effect of gender diminishes in both the post-SOX (2003-2006) and the crisis periods (2007-2011). Finally, we show that board structure is particularly relevant for banks with low market power, if they are immune to the threat of external takeover and/or they are small.

Our study shows that if biofuel mandates and targets currently announced by more than 40 countries around the world are implemented by 2020 using crop feedstocks and if both forests and pasture lands are used to meet the new land demands for biofuel expansion, this would cause net release of GHG emissions to the atmosphere until 2043 as the GHG emissions released through land-use change exceeds the reduction of emissions due to replacement of gasoline and diesel. On the other hand, if the use of forest lands is avoided by channeling only pasture lands to meet the demand for new lands, the net release of GHG emissions would cease by 2021, a year after the full implementation of the mandates and targets.","[Timilsina, Govinda R.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Environm & Energy Unit, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Mevel, Simon] United Nations Econ Commiss Africa, Reg Integrat Infrastruct & Trade Div, Trade & Int Negotiat Sect, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",The World Bank,"Timilsina, GR (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Environm & Energy Unit, 1818 H St,Mail Drop MC3-308 NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gtimilsina@worldbank.org; smevel@uneca.org,,,,,,,24,24,24,0,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The first part of the paper asks whether drivers become acclimatized to weather conditions. This issue is addressed using data for 23 Canadian cities, based on the relationship between exposure to rain, heavy rain, snow, heavy snow, and icy pavement conditions vis-a-vis the risk of collision. The results do not provide strong evidence that drivers become acclimatized to local weather patterns, which underscores the need to look at driver adaptations on shorter time scales with a view to identifying situations or driver groups where risks are particularly elevated. The second part of the paper focuses on the issue of speed - both from the perspective of posted speed limits, and also in terms of driving speeds. The focus is narrowed to one part of Canada and to winter-weather conditions. The risk analysis confirms that days with snow, freezing rain, or other frozen forms of precipitation have elevated collision rates; and it provides evidence that relative risk is higher in rural areas than in nearby cities. The analysis also suggests that collision rates increase as the posted speed limit increases. These findings further highlight the importance of driving speed in weather-related collision occurrence, and that driving above posted speed limits occurs even during inclement weather.

We use the ICES model to estimate the reallocation of global demand and timber imports following the EU legislation. We aim to assess the economic impacts and measure the potential emission reduction resulting from the introduction of this policy. Results show that an EU ban targeting only log imports is not effective in reducing illegal logging, but its main effect is the removal of illegal logs from international-markets. Additionally, the unilateral EU ban increases secondary wood production in illegal logging countries as their exports become relatively more competitive. Through this mechanism, part of the banned illegal timber will re-enter international trade flows 'hidden' as processed wood. Extending the ban to timber processed products eliminates this effect and reinforces direct carbon emissions reduction from logging activities.","[Bosello, Francesco] Univ Milan, Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Parrado, Ramiro; Rosa, Renato] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, I-30124 Venice, Italy; [Parrado, Ramiro] CaFoscari Univ, Venice, Italy",University of Milan; Fondazione Mattei; Fondazione Mattei; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Bosello, F (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",francesco.bosello@feem.it; ramiro.parrado@feem.it; renato.rosa@novasbe.pt,"Bosello, Francesco/ABE-6686-2020","Rosa, Renato/0000-0002-1155-9681; Parrado, Ramiro/0000-0002-0951-1013",,,,,21,8,12,1,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

From the eye of the beholder, i.e. investor, entrepreneur or both, 11 conflict situations were analyzed for any perceived unethical behavior. Based on findings from within- and cross-case analysis, we propose that perceived unethical behavior among venture partners triggers conflicts between them through increased fault attribution or blaming. Further, we propose that perceived unethical behavior affects venture partners' choice of conflict management strategy and increases the likelihood of conflict escalation and of conflict having a negative partnership outcome such as failure or another form of involuntary exit. As such, this paper contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by addressing calls for more research on the darker sides of investor-investee relationships.","[Collewaert, Veroniek] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Ctr Entrepreneurship, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Fassin, Yves] Univ Ghent, Dept Management Innovat & Entrepreneurship, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Fassin, Yves] Vlerick Leuven Gent Management Sch, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Maastricht University; Ghent University; Vlerick Business School,"Collewaert, V (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Ctr Entrepreneurship, Tongersestr 49,POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",v.collewaert@maastrichtuniversity.nl; yves.fassin@ugent.be,"Fassin, Yves/AAL-9132-2020; Collewaert, Veroniek/AAE-6583-2019","Collewaert, Veroniek/0000-0002-4595-2940; Fassin, Yves/0000-0003-0111-415X",,,,,44,38,46,5,145,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

By controlling for selection effects, we focus on contract design differences which reflect differences in corporate governance approaches across VC types. To address this issue, we use a unique, hand-collected German data set consisting of all contractual details of VC investments into 290 entrepreneurial firms in the period 1990-2004. By employing various matching procedures, we show that VC types differ in their corporate governance approach vis-A -vis their portfolio firms. It turns out that independent VCs, when compared to captive VCs, use significantly more contract mechanisms which induce active intervention.","[Hirsch, Julia] Univ Iberoamer Mexico City, Mexico City 01219, DF, Mexico; [Walz, Uwe] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Ctr Financial Studies, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Walz, U (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Ctr Financial Studies, Postfach 54,Gruneburgpl 1, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.",julia.hirsch@uia.mx; uwalz@econ.uni-frankfurt.de,"Walz, Uwe/D-1926-2013",,,,,,37,9,11,1,68,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Building on collective action theory, it argues that a donor with a larger share of the aid market in a country has stronger incentives to maximize the development impact of its aid, by tying less of it. Empirical tests strongly and consistently support the prediction that higher donor aid shares will be associated with less aid tying. This finding is robust to recipient controls, donor fixed effects, and instrumental variables estimation. Furthermore, it contradicts other studies suggesting that when a small number of donors dominate the aid market in a country, they may exploit their monopoly power by tying more of their aid.

Our key conjecture is that politically active people follow political news more actively, which increases their chance of being exposed to financial news. Consequently, their information gathering costs are likely to be lower and the propensity to participate in the market would be higher. We find support for this hypothesis using multiple micro-level data sets, state-level data from the US, and cross-country data from Europe. Irrespective of their political affiliation, politically active individuals are 9-25% more likely to participate in the stock market. Using residence in battleground states and several other geographic instruments, we demonstrate that greater political activism reduces information gathering costs and causes higher market participation rates. Further, consistent with our conjecture, we find that politically active individuals spend about 30 minutes more on news daily and appear more knowledgeable about the economy and the markets.

We thereby contribute to the ongoing debate on the use of capital controls-market-based ones in particular. While the case for using market-based controls relies on the mixed evidence from the experience of Chile with unremunerated reserve requirements, testing for their effectiveness is hampered by the endogeneity of such a measure, which is typically imposed or intensified when inflows surge. We address this problem in the Japanese context by applying the method of propensity score matching, and find that an increase in marginal reserve requirements modestly reduced short-term capital inflows through non-resident free-yen accounts. The impact was not statistically significant, however, implying that the price elasticity of short-term capital flows was likely small. We conclude that market-based controls must be nearly prohibitive, perhaps combined with administrative measures, to be effective in a meaningful way.","[Esaka, Taro] Kobe City Univ Foreign Studies, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Takagi, Shinji] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Takagi, S (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",takagi@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,36,0,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Cooperation allows users to internalize the damages caused by their activities and reduce extractions. The paper develops a game theoretical framework to assess the value of cooperation in an aquifer that is divided into three sub-aquifers that are being overly exploited. Two types of externalities are modeled: first, water extractions in each sub-aquifer impact water levels in neighboring sub-aquifers (extraction externality). Second, the three sub-aquifers are also connected to an ecosystem and thus decisions in each sub-aquifer affect the health of the ecosystem (environmental externality). A cooperative game theory model is applied. The model empirically shows how the uncontrolled extractions in each sub-aquifer affects neighboring groundwater users but also cause severe impacts to the linked ecosystem. The model is tested empirically in one of the most important aquifers in Spain, the Eastern la Mancha aquifer. The results illustrate how both extraction and environmental externalities interact in affecting the likelihood of cooperation among the users. The paper estimates the value of cooperation and its stability with and without the environmental externality.","[Esteban, Encarna] Ctr Univ Def, Dept Business, Zaragoza, Spain; [Dinar, Ariel] Univ Calif Riverside, Water Sci & Policy Ctr, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Esteban, E (通讯作者)，Ctr Univ Def, Dept Business, Zaragoza, Spain.",encarnae@unizar.es; adinar@ucr.edu,"ESTEBAN, ENCARNA/ABF-8852-2020","Esteban Gracia, Encarna/0000-0002-4485-3158",,,,,71,36,39,2,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The paper contributes to the literature by providing the first evidence on the role of imports and two-way trading for firm survival in a highly developed country. The result indicate a strong positive link between firm survival on the one hand and imports and two-way trading on the other hand, while exporting alone does not play a role for exiting the market or not.","[Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Inst Econ, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany; [Wagner, Joachim] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Inst Econ, POB 2440, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany.",wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012; Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536;",,,,,49,56,60,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We analyze the role of path dependency in the socio-political process of long-term strategic port planning and the related requisite governance changes needed for effective implementation of large scale port projects. We mainly base ourselves on the most recent insights from stakeholder theory and the strategic planning literature, applied to the transport sector. Further, we take as a starting point one of the criticisms on path dependence that its proper application warrants more attention to temporal dynamics. We attempt to define these temporal dynamics and argue that (1) these are best identified by means of stakeholder-based analysis, and (2) long-term, strategic port planning based on real stakeholder inclusion can act as a driver for governance change in the broader port region or port system. We use a case-based, action-research type methodological approach, analyzing the strategic port planning process of the port of Antwerp to support our argument. We combine diachronic analysis of stakeholder inclusion in port planning, with an analysis of the general economic and infrastructural evolution of the port area and its impacts on stakeholders since 1960, and pay special attention to port governance changes during the period 1960-2010.

We show that over the 15-year period under study entry and exit dynamics substantially intensify, the level change in branch desert grows significantly, and bank choice markedly declines; and that between 1996 and 2001, these changes are robustly associated with the neighborhood average income. In doing so, we advance a new technique for generating spatial measures that both minimize the discretization bias and can be reliably linked to neighborhoods.

We collect and examine about 1,000 point estimates of impulse responses from 70 articles that use vector autoregressions to study monetary transmission in various countries. We find that the puzzle is created by model misspecifications: especially by the omission of commodity prices, neglect of potential output, and reliance on recursive identification.

This paper fills this gap by analyzing this relationship in the German mechanical engineering industry sector, which is both successful and increasingly dominated by SMEs. The analysis, using a large and representative dataset, finds that small and large firms are, on average, the most efficient ones, while medium-sized firms have, on average, the greatest inefficiencies. Thus, the size-efficiency relationship is U-shaped rather than monotonically increasing. Additionally, the analysis finds that companies with active owner(s) are significantly more efficient and that capital firms are less efficient than firms with personally liable owners.

Also we find that as stock prices increase, both bank capital and bank borrowing capacity increase that in turn decreases credit risk. Furthermore as banking sector liquidity increases banks tend to lend to less credit-worthy (subprime) borrowers that in turn increases credit risk in the banking sector.

Using data on German multinationals, it exploits differences in taxes in more than 100 countries over 10 years. The results confirm that internal debt is used more by multinationals with affiliates in low-tax countries and increases with the spread between the host-country tax rate and the lowest tax rate among all affiliates. However tax effects are small, suggesting that profit shifting by means of internal debt is rather unimportant for German firms. Further testing indicates that this is partly due to the German controlled foreign corporation (CPC) rule.","[Buettner, Thiess] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Nurnberg, Germany; [Wamser, Georg] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Buettner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Nurnberg, Germany.",Thiess.Buettner@wiso.uni-erlangen.de; georg.wamser@uni-tuebingen.de,,"Buettner, Thiess/0000-0001-7490-0122",German Science Foundation (DFG),German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"For comments on an earlier draft we are indebted to Harry Grubert, Gaetan Nicodeme, the editors Bill Gentry and George Zodrow, two anonymous referees, and seminar participants on various occasions.

We are focusing on these methods with a perspective that highlights the limits of both empiricism and the theoretical elements that underlie them. From an epistemological point of view we have considered the logical syntax of the two models, the semantics included in statements and the pragmatics of the scientific discourse: the use of models to demonstrate the risk assessment thesis, to solve the problems of risks in the human judgment versus mathematical calculus controversy. The major issues that we are discussing in this article imply various perspectives on scientific criteria, the choice among various theories and the structuring of problems proposed to be solved. We argue that the models that have been developed so far, the top-down approach (which involves well defined and well understood rules), as well as the demonstrations based on the induction method, cannot be applied in a lot of scenarios, because information systems, considered as a complex whole made up of various components, is primarily not a positivistic science solely described by mathematics. The main research question to be answered in this paper is: What are the limits of knowledge in probabilistic computations for information systems security risk assessment? Our purpose is to demonstrate the epistemological limits of the two models and the error of generalizing probability calculus using the interpretive approach.","[Devos, Jan] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,,Jang.Devos@Ugent.be; adrian.munteanu@feaa.uaic.ro; doina.fotache@feaa.uaic.ro,"Munteanu, Adrian/A-5245-2013","Fotache, Doina/0000-0003-4861-3642",,,,,69,0,0,0,75,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,45,57,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500003,0

To gain the required data, the authors of the present paper have analyzed the work of the CEE countries banks in the reporting period of 2006 - 2011. The financial indicators applied for the needs of the present research have been obtained from the data available on the web page of the Association of Latvian Commercial Banks, Eurostat, European Central Bank, as well as from the annual reports of the banks. Findings - Based on the two DEA models, the findings showed that banking systems most effectively operate in Lithuania and Slovenia, while the Latvian banking system is most inefficient. Research limitations/implications - The research performed has provided information on the efficiency rate of the banks operating in CEE countries, which allows making decisions considering future perspectives of each bank not only from the standpoint of a shareholder, but also from the standpoint of a client and bank personnel. Originality/value - Taking into consideration how important the efficiently developed banking system is, especially in the states with a high competitive dynamics (including Latvia), the banks should change the present strategy to constantly improve their efficiency rate.","[Erina, Jana; Erins, Ingars] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,,Jana.Erina@rtu.lv; Ingars.Erins@rtu.lv,,"Erins, Ingars/0000-0003-0138-2277",,,,,28,1,1,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1009,1016,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100109,0

The impacts of income tax progressivity on self-employment depend on the relative effects of taxing success and the presence of tax evasion opportunities. Empirical estimates using Canadian provincial data for the period 1979-2006 indicate that there is a negative association between income tax progressivity and self-employment. This suggests that the adverse impact of income tax on entrepreneurial risk-taking outweighs the tax evasion opportunities for the self-employed. An important implication of our results is that a reduction in income tax progressivity encourages self-employment.

Yet while the significance of dynamic capabilities is well recognised, there is less understanding of the mechanisms of how dynamic capabilities are created and actually operate. In addressing this issue, this study focuses on the internal dynamics of innovation in organisations. In particular, drawing on employee insights from a nationally representative survey of over 5,000 employees the study explores the role of innovative climate as a critical intermediary variable between employee perception's of innovative strategies and innovation outcomes. The study finds that a climate for creativity is indeed a key factor and micro-foundation in building dynamic capability for innovation. This contributes to the dynamic capabilities literature by explicating the source and basis of capabilities in the behaviours and intentions of employees, thereby offer a balance to managerialist accounts. The study also aligns with the emerging literature on micro-foundations which suggests that the basis for understanding macro-level concepts such as dynamic capabilities is likely to be found embeded at deeper levels within the organisation. As such, this holds much practical relevance as proximate variables are likely to be much more amenable to purposeful intervention and change.","[Harney, Brian; Fallon-Byrne, Lucy] Dublin City Univ, Sch Business, Dublin 9, Ireland",Dublin City University,,brian.harney@dcu.ie; lucy.fallonbyrne@dcu.ie; cafferkey@unirazak.edu.my,"Harney, Brian/AAH-3319-2020; Harney, Brian/AAQ-8910-2020","Harney, Brian/0000-0003-3252-563X",,,,,29,0,0,1,14,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,1246,1252,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200120,0

In this paper we analyze the labor market in Romania between 2005 and 2012 using the Beveridge curve to emphasize the efficiency or inefficiency of the matching process and to test the correlation between a set of factors and unemployment, factors that influence the structure of the labor market. Using and econometrical approach we tested a set of established hypothesis using 2 models: one at national level computed with time series and one panel with regional data. Our econometric approach underlines the relationship between unemployment and job vacancies and also the convexity of the U-V curve. The influence factors chosen for Romania were long term unemployment positively correlated with the endogenous variable, unemployment benefits as a percentage of GDP inconclusive since the coefficient value resulted to be insignificant and labor productivity negatively correlated as our hypothesis stated. Overall in the analyzed period the efficiency of the matching process in Romania slightly improved and the decreasing of long term unemployment and also the increasing of the labor productivity are correlated with it.","[Ioana, Bilbie] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,ionik_rareshik@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1553,1561,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100165,0

Despite the availability of niche markets, and various forms of support received by producers, Swaziland is still a net importer of locally consumed cultivated mushrooms. This study uses a value chain approach to identify the underlying factors constraining local production and producers' participation in mainstream markets. Understanding the nature of these constraints and how they can possibly be alleviated is very important from a policy perspective as this process will inform the formulation of improved market access strategies required to achieve the programme's overall objective. The results indicate that availability of marketable surplus is affected by production constraints emanating from lack of access to key inputs and services, which are centralised and fully controlled by the government. While producers currently attain higher gross margins (in absolute value and as a proportion of consumer price) compared with other actors in alternative marketing channels, their efforts to participate more profitably in mainstream markets are hampered by poor value chain governance and lack of vertical coordination, subjecting both producers and buyers to various forms of transaction costs. In attempting to address the identified constraints, this study calls for privatisation of key services, allowing the government to assume a monitoring role. Further recommendations are also made towards institutionalising and strengthening collective marketing under different options, which reflect producers' socio-economic status and the prevailing institutional environment in Swaziland.","[Mabuza, M.

This managerial control measure is not only obtainable in the industry but also, it attracts a lot of attention in the academic and government establishments. Widespread absence from work by employees can culminate in disruption, low efficiency and reduced productivity in any organisation. Also, absenteeism from school or class always has detrimental effects on the students' academic performance and attitudinal development. RFID technology is currently been adopted by researchers to implement absenteeism control for organisations. However, most existing technologies utilise single frequency RED reader with connection via USB to a PC that runs stand-alone software. This kind of framework usually imposes huge installation cost and all the inherent flaws in a stand-alone software architecture. In this work, we designed and constructed a dual band RFID module that incorporates 125kHz reader and 13.56MHz reader/writer. The module connects directly via a Wi-Fi network to an intranet PC which functions as the Server on which we installed the Web-based Attendance Management Software (WAMS) developed in this work. One of the primary objectives of developing WAMS is to achieve client-server architecture for electronic-based attendance management. Employees or Students with either low or high frequency RFID smart card can sign-in and out by placing the card close to our dual frequency module. We tested the newly developed platform and obtain very promising results. The hardware and software are fully ready for deployment to any organisation that desires a timely and efficient digital attendance management system.","[Matthews, Victor O.; Adetiba, Emmanuel; Akindele, Ayoola E.; John, Samuel N.] Covenant Univ, Elect & Informat Engn Dept, Coll Sci & Technol, Canaanland, Ota, Nigeria; [Osafehinti, Samuel] MtoM Technol Nigeria Ltd, Ikoyi, Lagos State, Nigeria",Covenant University,"Matthews, VO (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Elect & Informat Engn Dept, Coll Sci & Technol, Canaanland, Ota, Nigeria.",victor.matthews@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; emmanuel.adetiba@covenantuniversitv.edu.ng; designs@microddl.net; ayoola.akindele@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; samuel.john@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"John, Samuel Ndueso/AAV-4053-2020; Adetiba, Emmanuel/AAC-4129-2022; Akindele, Ayoola E./ABE-5323-2020; John, Samuel N./U-6294-2019","Akindele, Ayoola E./0000-0002-7183-5027; John, Samuel/0000-0002-7225-8823; Adetiba, Emmanuel/0000-0001-9227-7389",,,,,6,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1054,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500102,0

This study, therefore, investigated the influence of media awareness campaigns on breast cancer care among women in South-West Nigeria. This study was anchored on two theories: agenda setting theory and diffusion of innovation theory. It employed survey design, which made use of the questionnaire to achieve the objectives of the study. The total number of subjects examined in this study was 600 questionnaire respondents. The multi-stage sampling and simple random sampling techniques were used to select the questionnaire respondents in Lagos, Oyo and Ekiti States. Three hypotheses were tested using cross tabulation and correlation analysis to determine the strength, nature and direction between variables. The findings revealed that majority of the respondents (98.8%) were aware of breast cancer but many of these respondents were not sufficiently knowledgeable of the disease. It also reveals that information sources such as mass media and interpersonal channels are crucial health communication carriers for breast cancer interventions. It was suggested that mass media messages be included as key components of comprehensive approaches to improving breast cancer care among women. This is essential because mass media messages can directly and indirectly produce positive changes or prevent negative changes in health-related behaviours of women in South-West Nigeria. It was also recommended that the government should design programmes that offer free or subsidised health services and facilities for women to undertake mammogram screening and clinical breast examinations in primary health centres, general hospitals, university teaching hospitals and Federal Medical Centres.",,,,nelson.okorie@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; kehinde.oyesomi@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; olusola.oyero@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; rotimiolatunji@yahoo.com; eosoola1@yahoo.com,"Okorie, Nelson/AAZ-8148-2020; Oyero, Olusola/GQA-8578-2022","Oyesomi, Kehinde/0000-0002-5318-0442; Oyero, Olusola/0000-0001-7795-5516",,,,,36,4,4,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,2231,2243,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500218,0

(2) Do regional and local levels of government embed economic development policy into traditional land use planning to have a more integrated approach to urban regeneration? These two questions explore different levels of policy alignment in the US context as compared to Russia. The first question explores the level of vertical alignment or integration of federal-state-local economic development policy. The second question explores the degree of horizontal alignment or integration of economic development strategy into transition land use or spatial planning. In addition to a general assessment of the US context, a specific analysis is done on three case-studies: Washington, DC; Memphis, TN; and Miami, FL. The research is based on interviews with representatives of US federal departments, regional organizations, state, county and local jurisdictions. The paper identifies that the US has a decentralized approach to economic development planning, with weak vertical policy alignment between different levels of government, but growing horizontal alignment that leads to more sustainable, complex planning.","[Olga, Gerasimova] Leontief Ctr, St Petersburg, Russia",,,gerasimovaolga@bk.ru,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1527,1536,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500149,0

At the same time, it seeks to emphasize the way in which the agricultural lands lying inside and outside the settlement confines have more or less expanded or receded, or changed their land use, starting from 1991. The data employed have been provided by the Prahova County Department of statistics and Buzau County Department of statistics, which divides the lands into several categories: arable land, pastures, hayfields, vineyards and vine nurseries, orchards and fruit nurseries. The investigated territory lies in the Sub-Carpathian area of the Cricovul Sarat watershed, which for the most part overlaps the Buzau and the Prahova Sub-Carpathians, which in their turn are complex morphological divisions belonging to the Curvature Sub-Carpathians. The altitude range is more than 500 m, between about 180 m, at the border with the Istrita Plain, and 717 m, in the Salcia Hill. In general, the Sub-Carpathian hills have provided good conditions for the establishment and development of human settlements. This also stands true for the study area, which enjoys good natural conditions and is sheltered by forests. For this reason, in the Sub-Carpathian area of the Cricovul Sarat watershed the density of villages reaches about 16/100 km(2), i.e. about 40% higher than the average of the entire Sub-Carpathian region, which is 11.6 villages/100 km(2)[2].

Together, these administrative units cover 595 km2, which means an area larger by nearly 15% than the entire watershed. At present, agricultural lands account for about 57% of the investigated territory. The largest agricultural areas are found in the Gornet commune (85%), while the smallest ones belong to Cislau (34%).

Since then, the so-called 'Riester pension' has grown in popularity. Apart from subsidized pension plans, unsubsidized private pension insurances have - already in the past - been a very important instrument among old-age provision schemes. With data of the German SAVE study for the years 2005-2009, we analyze whether the decision for a 'Riester pension' is independent of the decision for unsubsidized private pension insurance using methods for simultaneous equations. Our estimates indicate that decisions on 'Riester' and private pensions are not independent and the proposed random parameters bivariate probit model results in efficiency gains compared to separate probit estimations. Regarding governmental subsidies, we find positive incentive effects of child subsidies, whereas low income earners are not seen to increase their old-age provisions. Further, there is strong evidence for a 'crowding-in' among alternative assets, i.e., that individuals holding various assets make additional investments in 'Riester pensions' or private pension insurances. Finally, when subsidies are given, these subsidies are a clearly stronger saving motive than the aim to make provisions for old age, a result confirmed by the additional fixed-effects estimations.","[Pfarr, Christian; Schneider, Udo] Univ Bayreuth, Inst Publ Finance, Dept Law & Econ, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Schneider, Udo] WINEG Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care, D-22305 Hamburg, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Pfarr, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Inst Publ Finance, Dept Law & Econ, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",christian.pfarr@uni-bayreuth.de; Dr.Udo.Schneider@wineg.de,,"Pfarr, Christian/0000-0003-4828-2732",,,,,39,7,7,2,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

This ambivalence can be perceived from practical proposals for introducing business ethics in big companies that codetermine the culture of society in general. The main characteristics of European approach to 'Corporate Social Responsibility` are (1) going over and above legal requirements by adopting voluntary measures; (2) linking to the European Union sustainable development concept; and (3) changing management approaches pursuing changes in the business model. Even though the goals seem to be well specified: going over and above the stated law and beyond duties, the practical incorporation of these ideas is somewhat lagging behind and does not reach the goal. We suggest that there may be a fundamental conflict between the deontological nature of sustainability movement and business goals, which mostly follow the practical short-term oriented best practices.

The model concludes that double taxation of savings has very little if any effect on GDP growth rates. This is true for all three settings of growth sensitivity to savings. Double taxation has basically no negative impact on economic growth in the short run and slightly bigger but still questionable impact in the long run. The final years of simulation also show that rather than small changes in tax system settings it is the future demographic change that deserves attention.,"[Rosenberg, Zdenek] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,zdenek.rosenberg@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6159-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,281,286,,,,,,6,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA4GP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335696100030,0

The aim of the research is to study the factors/drivers of change in the evolution of clusters in a region or more precisely in the specific cycles of life of a cluster. The subject of our research is the evolving concentration of various firms in the field of automotive industries in Moravia Silesia region with its core in Ostrava, which were subject to study by many researchers as well (Pavlinek, P. and Zenka, J., 2013 or Tuijl, E. at al. 2012). The methodology is a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods and techniques. First, we gathered the quantitative data regarding the changes and developments of regional economic structure, and automotive industry's firms especially. Second, the papers and documents on the topic of automotive industry development, clusters, regional innovation system and upgrading have been studied and in-depth interviews with various important regional actors in the period 2011-2013 conducted. The method of participative observation has been used during the sessions and workshops of Moravia-Silesia automotive cluster (as a policy initiative) and sessions on the regional innovation strategy for EU programming period 2014-2020. A new quality of the formation of automotive cluster in the broader Ostrava region has been identified. Thanks to strong leadership of the Moravia Silesia automotive cluster initiative many activities and measures towards strengthening the innovation potential of the firms in the cluster have been defined (Blezek, J. et al., 2013). However, despite the activity of the leader of the Moravia Silesia automotive cluster a certain division between automotive firms is evident. On the one hand there are firms organised in the cluster initiative. On the other hand there is a strong isolated cluster of Korean automotive companies in the region organised around assembly plant of Hyundai company in Nosovice, which does not have any important interactions with other actors of regional innovation system. The Hyundai company and its tierl Korean suppliers positively influenced the labour market in the region since 2008 as they created over 10000 jobs and contributed to the diversification of the labour market and regional ekonomy. However, the Korean companies are neither an integral part of the automotive cluster initiative nor directly of regional innovation system of Ostrava region.","[Rumpel, Petr] Univ Ostrava, Ctr City & Reg Management, Dept Human Geog & Reg Dev, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic",University of Ostrava,,rumpel@osu.cz,"Rumpel, Petr/D-6968-2014","Rumpel, Petr/0000-0003-1583-4983",,,,,21,0,0,1,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,941,945,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500089,0

Thus, theatre (together with museums and galleries) has a special position in creative industries and the navigation of customers (i.e. theatre-goers) becomes a key issue. As in any other market, customer's behaviour is dependent on availability of information about the quality of the offered goods. If the seller of a good knows more about the quality of a product (theatre performance) than both the customer and the deal are affected. Is there any possibility to face the information inequality in the theatre sphere? Based on the work of Alexander Dolgin and his notion of adverse selection in culture industries, this contribution deals with information asymmetry in the sphere of theatre. In the paper, so-far solutions of information asymmetry examples (such as moral hazard and adverse selection) are analyzed and alternative solutions are suggested.","[Sovova, Andrea] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Business Adm, Dept HR Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,xsova01@vse.cz,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1314,1323,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100132,0

The objective of this paper is to assess indicators, like the imports and exports in order to get a Picture on the dynamics of the Romanian flower trade. Therefore, in this study we will try to link the trade performance to other variables. In that sense, focusing on the flowers sector, we have paid great attention to the average rate of growth and correlations among trade figures from data series of the four main categories of flowers, through their destinations and the countries we import these products from. The time series have spread out for a period of 10 years (2002-2011) and have been provided by the Romanian National Institute of Statistics and the Ministry of Agriculture. The results have shown that average rate of growth has increased constantly, except for the USD / Lei exchange rate and for the total exports of flowers. Regarding the correlative analysis, we have found that the pairs of variables analyzed are relatively strongly correlated. The only variables that showed no significant correlation coefficients were the data series of exchange rate for Euros and exchange rate for the American dollars. The conclusion was that the exchange rates of major currencies have had their own dynamics and their influence was not found on the other variables considered in this study.","[Stoian, Elena; Vlad, Ionela Mituko; Dinu, Toma Adrian; Fintineru, Gina; Temocico, Georgeta] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,,stoian_ie@yahoo.com; bmitsouko@yahoo.fr; tomadinu@yahoo.fr; gina2007ro@yahoo.com; gtemocico@yahoo.com,"Vlad, Ionela/AAT-5057-2021; Fintineru, Gina/AAB-5711-2020; Stoian, Elena/HTM-4209-2023; VLAD, Ionela Mituko/HHC-1979-2022; Dinu, Toma Adrian/IQV-4799-2023","Vlad, Ionela/0000-0002-2776-0419; Fintineru, Gina/0000-0002-1742-0824; Stoian, Elena/0009-0001-6518-6649; Dinu, Toma Adrian/0009-0005-0994-2867; Temocico, Georgeta/0000-0002-3911-2718",,,,,12,1,1,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,157,166,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100016,0

This study investigates the influence of IT practitioners and management guidance on the extent of their participation in IT governance initiatives. Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour as the main guiding theory, a quantitative study was carried out among IT practitioners in Malaysia. Data analysis using Partial Least Squares suggests that subjective norms and perceived behavioural controls on IT practitioners result in greater participation in IT governance initiatives. However, attitudes do not have significant relationship with participation in IT governance initiatives, in contrast with prediction of the theory. Further analysis reveals that awareness and perceived importance of IT governance are the two most important factors from the practitioner perspective. As for management guidance, organisational processes and reward system are the most important, closely followed by organisational structure. The findings reaffirm that IT governance requires control in the form of organisational structures, processes, goal settings and reward system to encourage desirable behaviours in IT governance initiatives.","[Teo, Wil Ly; Abd Manaf, Azizah] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,,wlteo@israc.com; azizah07@ic.utm.my; lfchoong@yahoo.com,"Abdul Manaf, Azizah/M-5776-2015",,,,,,94,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1084,1098,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100116,0

Under this viewpoint, we argue that the cap options theory of corporate security valuation can be applied to the contingent claims of the synergy-banking firm. The equity holders of the bank own a cap option on the bank equity return which can be considered against their expected investment opportunity costs captured by the cap rates. We show that an increase in the cap rate increases the risky loans held by the bank at a lower interest margin, and then increases the equity risk and the default risk of equity. An increase in the capital-to-deposits ratio decreases the risky loans held by the bank at an increased margin, and decreases the bank's equity risk and the default probability in the bank's equity. Capital regulation as such makes the bank more prudent and less prone to risk-taking, thereby contributing to the stability of the banking system. Our findings may support increased capital requirements in the spirit of the Dodd-Frank Act of the Basel Accord (Eubanks, 2010). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Methodologically, the project is based on the identification, analysis and documentation of changes in the Czech cultural landscape recorded in the mental image of their population (questioning the population 65+ years). One of the outputs is a 'Modern chronicle of the village' - an electronic record of landscape dynamics in a particular time and space (the combination of graphics and audio tracks). A number of Czech and foreign authors are aimed to the research on the cultural landscape dynamics. But social and mental dimensions of these changes are applied very rarely. For the local identity formation and the rural population stabilization is often determining these mental ties to the landscape.

We compare the liberal, social-democratic, conservative and neo-liberal models of health care financing, mentioning the Communist model and the single-payer system as well. The National Health Service model may also today be considered as a viable, social-democratic model of the basic health protection. The social health insurance model was markedly modified by the transition to the universal health care provision to all residents and there are strengthening tendencies to the split-off of the health insurance from the social insurance system; the result might be a transition to the NHS model or, on the contrary, to the neo-liberal mandatory private insurance system. The choice of the health care financing is a question a political, economic and social choice and the particular solution is not seldom also substantially influenced by the stakeholders.

Since the adoption of the E- learning system in MARA University of Technology (UiTM) has been implemented for a few years, this study intends to measure the factors and the level of Faculty of Pharmacy's students' acceptance towards this technology. From the study, the effectiveness of the teaching and learning process among students and lecturers is expected to be increased and moreover helps to meet both their teaching and learning needs. There are three factors that contribute to the students' acceptance in using e learning applications, namely instructors' characteristics, students' characteristics and technology resources. A set of questionnaires were distributed to 150 respondents as an instrument for data collection. The findings revealed that the acceptance level of the students was relatively high due to the major factor of instructor's characteristics. The study however can be further discussed in other organizations of different industries to obtain the whole picture of e-learning acceptance in the country.","[Yusof, Marlita Mat; Izani, Nurizzati Atiqah; Majid, Nuraina Abdul; Daswar, Suhaibah] Univ Teknol MARA, Puncak Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,,marlita@puncakalam.uitm.edu.my,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,823,832,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200080,0

We use data augmentation to obtain intraday intervention amounts and estimate the efficacy of interventions using the augmented data. Applying this new method to Japanese data, we find that an intervention of 1 trillion yen moves the yen/dollar rate by 1.8%, which is more than twice as much as the magnitude reported in previous studies applying ordinary least squares to daily observations.

The reduction in cash holdings is greater for firms with weaker governance and firms facing more financial constraints prior to the reform. The reform also significantly reduced the average corporate savings rate, as measured by cash-to-cash-flow sensitivity. These findings are consistent with the premise that the reform removed a significant market friction, which led to better incentive alignment between controlling shareholders and minority shareholders and relaxed financial constraints.

For the quality effect, individuals in schools with smaller class sizes and a higher percentage of educators with advanced degrees have higher, more moderate levels of risk aversion.

By considering the weekly asset allocation among the five largest international stock markets, we find that distribution timing yields a gain of around 140 basis points per year over the last decade. To control for the parameter uncertainty of the model, we cast the model into a Bayesian setting. We also consider alternative preference structures and model specifications.

The current study looks at the impact of incentives to judge one's abilities accurately in a framed field experiment.

The program used a conditional cash transfer contract to encourage peer tutors to help their underperforming classmates. Incentivized peer-tutoring significantly improved the academic performance of the underperforming tutees over a semester. The impact persisted in the second semester when the intervention was removed. Our results suggest that nongovernment organizations and government agencies can increase their capacity of remedying education by incorporating incentivized peer-tutoring into their existing merit-based scholarship and conditional cash transfer programs.,"Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Macao, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Li, T (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Macao, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,20,3,5,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

First, I construct a measure of demand shocks to individual stocks by aggregating flow-induced trading across all mutual funds, and document a significant, temporary price impact of such uninformed trading. Next, given that mutual fund flows are highly predictable, I show that the expected part of flow-induced trading positively forecasts stock and mutual fund returns in the following year, which are then reversed in subsequent years. The main findings of the paper are that the flow-driven return effect can fully account for mutual fund performance persistence and the smart money effect, and can partially explain stock price momentum.","[Lou, Dong] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lou, D (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Finance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",d.lou@lse.ac.uk,"Lou, Dong/AAZ-5994-2021","Lou, Dong/0000-0002-5623-4338",,,,,50,207,275,4,68,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We construct a model that accommodates forecasts over multiple horizons from multiple surveys and Treasury real and nominal yields by allowing for differences between risk-neutral, subjective, and objective probability measures. We establish that model-based inflation expectations are driven by inflation, output, and one latent factor. We find that this factor affects inflation expectations at all horizons but has almost no effect on the nominal yields; that is, the latent factor is hidden. We show that this hidden factor is not related to either current and past inflation or the standard set of macro variables studied in the literature. Consistent with the theoretical property of a hidden factor, our model outperforms a standard macro-finance model in its forecasting of inflation and yields. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose to study the fluctuations around an inefficient natural output. We show that the cost of business cycles is usually underestimated. As monopolists, firms seek to preserve their expected mark-up: the interplay between the price setting by each firm and aggregate fluctuations leads to lower consumption and employment than their counterparts in an economy with flexible prices. The cost of fluctuations increases with the degree of the distortions at the steady state. However, when the utility function is iso-elastic, the optimal monetary policy is not changed: targeting zero inflation is still desirable and leads to replicate the flexible-price allocation.","[Fairise, Xavier] Univ Maine, GAINS, TEPP, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Hairault, Jean-Olivier] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Hairault, Jean-Olivier; Langot, Francois] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Langot, Francois] Univ Maine, GAINS, TEPP, Cepremap,Paris Sch Econ, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Fairise, X (通讯作者)，Univ Maine, GAINS, TEPP, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",xavier.fairise@univ-lemans.fr; joh@univ-paris1.fr; flangot@univ-lemans.fr,,"langot, francois/0000-0001-7737-5319",,,,,11,0,0,1,10,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We then add a real market to Model II, where the publicly-owned firm is a quantity-setting monopolist (Model III). The last model allows to investigate where does the real market interfere relatively to Model II.

We document that the state of a country's financial system and, since the beginning of the crisis, also the state of the world financial system have strong explanatory power for the behavior of CDS spreads, and the magnitude of this impact depends on the importance of a country's financial system pre-crisis. Furthermore, Economic and Monetary Union member countries exhibit higher sensitivities to the health of the financial system. Our results suggest the presence of a private-to-public risk transfer through which market participants incorporate their expectations about financial industry bailouts.","[Dieckmann, Stephan; Plank, Thomas] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Dieckmann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,13,97,106,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,,,REV FINANC,Rev.

The performance is assessed each year in a multi-dimensional risk-adjusted return framework using data envelopment analysis, and the trend in the performance is estimated in a fixed effects panel data model. The results reveal positive trends in only a small percentage of developed (9%) and emerging (11%) markets. A high percentage (45%) of developed markets show a gradual decline in performance, compared to emerging markets (11%). However, the developed markets outperformed the emerging markets from 2004 to 2008. Even though the emerging markets subsequently outperformed the developed markets in 2009 and 2010, their performance weakened from 2009 to 2010, whereas the performance of the developed markets improved. There is evidence of a positive association between equity market performance and market capitalisation and turnover. It appears that equity market performance is not related to inflation or gross domestic product per capita. According to the overall ranking, Malaysia is the best performer, followed by the USA, the Philippines, Israel and Switzerland. A discussion of the robustness of the results to three alternative performance measures (the Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio and average excess returns per unit of downside deviation) is provided.

After developing growth valuation premium measures, we document four main results consistent with catering theory. First, time periods of high growth premium are followed by higher-than-expected growth indicators. Second, catering to the premium is more pronounced for firms whose managers care more about maximizing short-term stock prices. Third, firms whose managers care more about short-term stock prices have higher time-series volatility of median sales, investment, and PPE growth.

A particular focus is on the effects of R&D investments and breadth in knowledge sourcing and innovation objectives. The results suggest that, contrary to earlier research, R&D investments play a statistically and economically significant role in service innovation. We suggest that this results from the growing engagement of service firms in regular R&D activity. Both service and manufacturing firms also benefit from breadth in external knowledge sourcing strategies. In contrast, breadth in terms of pursuing parallel innovation objectives appears to have detrimental effects on innovation in service industries. We interpret the latter results through reference to service firms' R&D management capabilities: Managing multiple innovation projects is challenging, and some service firms may not have accumulated the requisite managerial processes and capabilities to benefit from these strategies. The available data provide support for this conjecture. The detrimental effects of breadth in innovation objectives are significantly mitigated by regular R&D activities.","[Leiponen, Aija] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Leiponen, Aija] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Imperial College London; Cornell University,"Leiponen, A (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, London SW7 2AZ, England.",aija.leiponen@cornell.edu,"Leiponen, Aija/K-9920-2019",,,,,,55,80,88,1,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The approach applied in our analysis has high informational content as it differentiates between the sources of the diversification benefits in a statistically significant way. The results indicate that the diversification contribution varies greatly amongst the different commodities. Industrial metals, agriculturals and livestock contribute to the reduction of risk, while energy and precious metals contribute to both the reduction of the level of risk and to the improvement of return. The differentiation between bull and bear markets reveals that investors can enhance the portfolio performance by changing exposure into individual commodities. Investors can benefit from the diversification gains through financial instruments as the diversification gains hold both in the sample of physical commodity and commodity futures. Overall, the results confirm that commodities are valuable investments from the perspective of diversification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis relies on data from an international survey conducted by the European Patent Office. There are three main results. First, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) exhibit a much stronger reliance on 'monetary patents' than large companies and nearly half of the SMEs in the sample patent for monetary reasons. Second, SMEs tend to use their patents more actively than large firms. Third, smaller companies generally have a higher proportion of their portfolio that is licensed, but the licensing rate is significantly higher in the USA.

However, this would only be possible if the price of the emission permits in the different schemes converge to one price. Using a simple model-free structure, the paper first assesses how a unilateral link between two schemes or a bilateral link between schemes with restrictions on the amount of imported permits preempt a correct price convergence. Second, it shows under which conditions bilateral links between schemes with price containment mechanisms allows permit price convergence.","[Gruell, Georg] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Energy Trading & Financial Serv, Essen, Germany; [Taschini, Luca] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Duisburg Essen; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Taschini, L (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",georg.gruell@uni-due.de; l.taschinil@lse.ac.uk,,,University of Duisburg-Essen; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Munich Re; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish,University of Duisburg-Essen; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Munich Re; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Part of Grull's research was supported by the University of Duisburg-Essen.

Subsidies to the sector were justified on this basis, but analysis is required to determine real impacts. However, other potential impacts could offset any benefits biofuels may bring, and careful assessment and analysis of biofuels' impacts are necessary. These possible consequences involve food prices and food security, economic distortions of subsidies, and environmental impacts. Among the methodologies used to evaluate biofuels impacts, general equilibrium models (CGE) can be considered as the most comprehensive tool available to analyze governmental intervention at the aggregate level. The use of these tools is primarily to generate projections of future performance of the market (in terms of production, consumption, prices, international trade) on the basis of alternative scenarios The present paper applies a general equilibrium model, an extended version of the GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project) model developed by Hertel, Tyner and Birur in 2010, in which an alternative closure has been adopted in order to analyze the combined impacts of the US and EU biofuels programs considering in particular the socio-economic effects on prices, employment and welfare in the European Union in 2015.","[Padella, Monica; Finco, Adele] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept 3A, Agr & Resource Econ Sect, Ancona, Italy; [Tyner, Wallace E.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Marche Polytechnic University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Padella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept 3A, Agr & Resource Econ Sect, Ancona, Italy.",m.padella@univpm.it; a.finco@univpm.it; wtyner@purdue.edu,,,,,,,36,9,9,1,33,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

This policy note describes how the revised rules were developed, how they will be applied in practice, and what they imply for operators of installations subject to the system. It highlights the rationale for changing the rules prevailing under the system's first two trading periods, explains the principles applied in devising the new allocation methodology, and illustrates the impacts on operators' business decisions. The author concludes that in a policy setting where free allocation is the chosen means to safeguard the competitiveness of industries subject to emissions trading, basing free allocation on greenhouse gas performance benchmarks supports the polluter pays principle by allowing appropriate price signals from differences in emission intensity, forms an equitable way of distributing emission allowances free of charge, and strengthens incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","[Pauer, Stefan] Univ British Columbia, Fac Law, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Pauer, Stefan] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Climate Act, Brussels, Belgium",University of British Columbia,"Pauer, S (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Fac Law, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",stefan.pauer@alumni.ubc.ca,,"Pauer, Stefan/0000-0003-1080-5550",,,,,7,1,1,1,15,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

A kidney patient can receive a transplant either from live donors or from deceased donors. A transplant is possible only if there is no medical incompatibility between the patient and the donor, otherwise the kidney of the donor is not utilized and the patient goes to the waiting list for cadaveric kidneys. Since there are not enough donors, the priority of the transplantation centers is to develop mechanisms in order to avoid such loss of kidney resources. We focus on a particular mechanism, priority mechanism, by analyzing it in the context of kidney exchange in Turkey. We theoretically compare this mechanism under the current system of independent transplantation centers and the system of centralized exchange. We argue that a centralized exchange mechanism increases the welfare of the patients and it is crucial to switch to the centralized system.","Koc Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey",Koc University,"Yilmaz, O (通讯作者)，Koc Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey.",ozyilmaz@ku.edu.tr,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,5,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

One potential rational explanation is that adverse selection drives up life annuity prices, which drives down demand. We study the choice between life annuities and lump sums made by 32,000 retiring public employees. These unique data allow us to extend the existing literature by exploiting economically significant cross-sectional and time-series variation in life annuity pricing. We find little evidence that retiree demand for life annuities rises when life annuity prices fall. We find strong evidence that demand responds to salient variation in individual characteristics, such as health, and to measures of investor sentiment, such as recent equity returns.","[Reuter, Jonathan] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Reuter, Jonathan] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chalmers, John] Univ Oregon, Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Boston College; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Oregon,"Reuter, J (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",reuterj@bc.edu,"Chalmers, John/G-4557-2013","Reuter, Jonathan/0000-0002-5344-9501",,,,,31,44,51,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

To protect their own vulnerable and politically influential consumers, key exporters restricted supplies in 2007, exacerbating the price rise. Understandably, vulnerable importers are now building strategic reserves. To reduce costs and disincentive effects, reserves should have quantitative goals related to targeted distribution to the most vulnerable in severe emergencies. For countries with significant animal feeding or biofuels industries, options contracts to protect the consumption of the most vulnerable from harvest shocks are likely to be more cost-effective than emergency reserves.",,,,,,"Wright, Brian/0000-0002-6440-8596",,,,,64,32,36,0,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

This is discussed from a biographical perspective where experiences in his everyday life and scientific investigations are linked into a theoretical whole. The theoretical approach of Hagerstrand can be traced to experiences several years before he presented his time-geographic approach. He studied conditions for individuals' existence in different geographic, social, and ecological contexts by engaging new methods and cross-fertilizing research fields; he developed precise concepts and a notation system general enough to describe any kind of individual and applicable at different levels of aggregation. He combined theoretical and methodological developments in science with active involvement in the Swedish planning model in various sectors, not least urban and transport planning - at the same time as he criticized the fragmentation of society into separate sectors for policy and planning purposes. The article shows that Hagerstrand's early sources of inspiration were in his struggle to develop both a precise and general time-geographic approach. The activity approach in transport research is ingrained in time-geography since the extension of and distance between locations of resources make transport inevitable. Hence, the human needs of transport are generated from activities in people's everyday lives. Hagerstrand's activity approach was developed in an era when transport prognoses based on the development of demand for transportation as such prevailed. Today, the activity approach is a dominant strand in transportation research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Applying a dynamic generalized method of moments panel estimator to a 1961-2005 cross-country panel dataset, three major insights emerge. First, disasters do affect economic growth but not always negatively, with effects that differ across types of disasters and economic sectors. Second, although moderate disasters (such as moderate floods) can have a positive growth effect in some sectors, severe disasters do not. Third, growth in developing countries is more sensitive to natural disasters than in developed ones, with more sectors affected and the effects larger and economically meaningful.

The effects of money activation on social preferences and social behavior in young children,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Money; Children; Interpersonal relations; Social preferences,CONCEPTIONS; PSYCHOLOGY; MEANINGS; PAIN,"The research presented in this paper shows that merely activating the idea of money affects the social behavior and social preferences of young children who do not understand the economic functions of money. From an economic point of view, money is universal, instrumental, and can be defined by the functions that it provides. From the psychological point of view, money is more symbolic and emotional than instrumental, and can serve as social resource in interpersonal and intrapersonal regulation. These effects of money are connected with its symbolic, rather than its instrumental, nature. To test whether the symbolic and instrumental meanings of money are developing at appropriate ages, we conducted two experiments on 5-8 year olds. After money activation, children were more selfish in economic games, revealing less prosocial preferences and were less prone to help the experimenter than children from the control group. Even if children at this stage do not understand the economic mechanisms of money and are not able to use money properly in the instrumental context, they react to symbolic activation. This might imply that the symbolic meaning of money is more primal than the instrumental meaning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Acquisition of domestic banks by foreign investors has lowered rates of firm creation, decreased the average size of entrants, and increased firm exit in industries with greater informational opacity, while entry of greenfield foreign banks appears to have spurred firm creation and exit. We modify the view in earlier studies that informational opacity equates with firm size, defining opacity in terms of technological characteristics for a given industry. We find the economic significance of foreign bank entry is larger for opaque industries than industries with large shares of small firms. The study provides evidence of increased credit constraints for start-ups in Central and Eastern Europe which is consistent with the theoretical proposition that the presence of foreign banks exacerbates informational asymmetries.

VPIN is updated in volume time, making it applicable to the high-frequency world, and it does not require the intermediate estimation of non-observable parameters or the application of numerical methods. It does require trades classified as buys or sells, and we develop a new bulk volume classification procedure that we argue is more useful in high-frequency markets than standard classification procedures. We show that the VPIN metric is a useful indicator of short-term, toxicity-induced volatility.","[O'Hara, Maureen] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Easley, David] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [de Prado, Marcos M.

We adopt a dual approach where production technology is represented by a cost function, approximated by a translog form. Pollution is considered as a negative by-product that can be modified trough using either formal regulation (inspections or sanctions) or informal regulation (community pressure). A simultaneous equation model is estimated by three-stage least squares on a sample of 404 industrial establishments located in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We show that pollution abatement costs for the Brazilian manufacturing sector are different from zero which suggests that pollution emissions are affected by environmental regulation. We also demonstrate that environmental performance of firms is jointly affected by formal and informal regulation. Lastly, formal regulation is largely influenced by informal regulation and more specifically by community pressure.","[Reynaud, Arnaud] Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA INRA, F-31042 Toulouse, France; [Feres, Jose] Inst Appl Econ Res IPEA, BR-20020010 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (IPEA),"Reynaud, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA INRA, Manufacture Tabacs Bat F,21Allee Brienne, F-31042 Toulouse, France.",jose.feres@ipea.gov.br; areynaud@toulouse.inra.fr,"Feres, Jose/C-4139-2013",,,,,,33,76,80,18,117,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

A poor connection can cause some passengers to stop using the transit service. This work analyzes the performance of public-transit networks in terms of the attributes involved with coordination and connectivity. These attributes are primarily concerned with passenger transfers, and include ride, wait and walk times and type of transfers made, that is, with street-crossing, sidewalk, non-walk and one-leg trip. Based on these attributes, transit-connectivity measures are established as a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of each defined zone of transit lines from a connectivity perspective. The zone of transit lines can be associated with small or large transit networks from which two types of analyses can be made: (i) detecting the inefficiency of connectivity-related issues for the zone, and (ii) comparing the measures between different zones to arrive to the conclusion of which zone is more worthy of improvements. This will allow, for instance, the comparison between cities and between zones in the city. In this work a model is developed to integrate spatial and non-spatial data for the construction of a public-transit network spatial repository, which in turn, is used to classify transfers, and calculate the developed connectivity measures. A case study in Auckland, New Zealand, demonstrates the benefits of the model and connectivity measures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Data are collected at monthly intervals for transit ridership, service, gasoline price, and price variability for 33 metropolitan areas. These data are analyzed using time-series regression to estimate the presence of lagged effects of price and service on transit patronage. The results indicate a small but consistently significant amount of transit ridership fluctuation is due to gasoline prices. Repeated lags of gasoline prices of up to 13 months are influential on ridership. Every 10% increase in gasoline prices can lead to ridership increases of up to 4% per significant lag for bus and 8% for rail. There is considerable variability across cities in the magnitude of the effect on transit ridership, the impact by mode, and temporal variability. The results are discussed in light of their implications for transit operations, using cost to influence travel behavior, and transportation sustainability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally, direct investment flowed from developed to developing countries, bringing with it superior technology, organizational capital, and access to international capital markets, yet increasingly there is a trend toward capital flowing uphill with emerging market investors acquiring a broad range of assets in developed countries. Using transaction-specific information and firm-level accounting data, the paper evaluates the operating performance of publicly traded U. S. firms that have been acquired by firms from emerging markets over the period 1980-2006. The empirical methodology uses a difference-in-differences approach combined with propensity score matching to create an appropriate control group of nonacquired firms. The results suggest that emerging country acquirers tend to choose U. S. targets that are larger in size (measured as sales, total assets, and employment) relative to matched nonacquired firms. In the years following the acquisition target firm sales and employment decline while profitability rises compared with matched nonacquired firms, suggesting significant restructuring of the target firms.

This time to think (TTT) effect could explain much of the gap between real and hypothetical WTP observed in experimental studies. Yet giving time to think is still rare in binary or multinomial discrete choice studies. We review the literature on increasing survey respondents' opportunities to reflect on their answers and synthesize results from parallel TTT studies on private vaccine demand in four countries. Across all four countries, we find robust and consistent evidence from both raw data and multivariate models for a TTT effect: giving respondents overnight to think reduced the probability that a respondent said he or she would buy the hypothetical vaccines. Average WTP fell approximately 40%. Respondents with time to think were also more certain of their answers, and a majority said they used the opportunity to consult with their spouse or family.

Our results indicate that globalization does not affect firm exit significantly but it is an important factor explaining why firms choose a different core product. Previous studies on industrial countries have shown that product switching has been a defensive strategy against low-cost imports.

Based on a longitudinal dataset of 720 patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 1990 and 2003 to firms in the automatic packaging machinery industrial district in Northern Italy, and controlling for the uneven geographical distribution of patenting activities, we show that: (i) firms within the district use local knowledge to a greater extent and more rapidly than knowledge from outside the district, (ii) focal firms use external knowledge to a greater extent than other firms operating in the district, and (iii) other (nonfocal) firms within the district rely on knowledge generated by focal firms to a greater extent than would be expected, given the geographic distribution of innovative activity in the industry.

The sections that are viewed first are the photo of the home, the quantitative description section, distantly followed by the real estate agent remarks section. Finally, charm pricing, the marketing technique where agents list properties at slightly less than round numbers, works in opposition to its intended effect. Given that homebuyers dwell significantly longer on the first home they view, and since charm pricing typically causes a property to appear towards the end of a search when sorted by price from low to high, we question the wisdom of using a charm pricing marketing strategy.","[Seiler, Michael J.; Madhavan, Poornima; Liechty, Molly] Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Seiler, MJ (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",mseiler@odu.edu; pmadhava@odu.edu; mdacliechty@verizon.net,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,30,27,32,0,15,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

Competition is between heterogeneous players in a contest game where heterogeneity might be due to past discrimination. Two policy options are analyzed that tackle the underlying asymmetry: either it is ignored and the contestants are treated equally, or affirmative action is implemented to neutralize the disadvantages of discriminated players. Comparing the induced effort exertion under the two policies reveals that in a two-player contest game the normative neutralization objective of affirmative action coincides with higher effort exertion. However, in the multi-player contest affirmative action might have adverse incentive effects as the participation of additional weak players detrimentally affects effort incentives of other players. These results also obtain under imperfect information of the contest organizer. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores physical and mobile communication connectivity by developing further our understanding of the complex interactions of transport provision and the social practice of walking and encountering, meeting others and keeping in touch, and particularly the competencies, resources and strategies involved in walking and mobile communication technology use. The work is informed by the premise that (in)equity is both a social construct and a lived experience and that travel is an embodied social practice situated in time-spaces that are complex and inform, enable and constrain us and that as one travels the structures of opportunity to meet others, access services changes. Furthermore these patterns of opportunity cannot be presumed to be the same for every community. The competencies, resource and strategies used to achieve connectivity are dynamic and situated and it can be argued that competencies for negotiating mobilities (Hannam et al., 2006) are developing and changing as mobility patterns, communication technologies and social organisation are changing. Yet it is not clear what policy directions are needed to meet the changing social practices and ensure processes of social inclusion. Using mixed methods 24 people were recruited within a neighbourhood and interviewed over a period of weeks during which time they participated in a mobile interview which involved walking around their neighbourhood and keeping a 3 day diary of communication with others. The study findings allow us to draw conclusions about the character of connectivity competencies, transport provision and social inequity. They show a disjunct in planners' provision and policy, in the maps that are used and in the understanding of time-space organisation among different communities resulting in an exacerbation of existing patterns of inequality, imposing burdens on some communities and not others. Finally the work allows us to ask questions about the potential of user generated internet content, particularly whilst on the move and in interaction with Web2.0 technologies and applications, can impact on governance and social equity.

However, the driving forces underlying the cash pattern are not uniform across countries. While the evolution in firm characteristics necessitated elevated cash balances, the time-varying firm attributes explain the cash trend only in Canada, France, UK and the US. The agency motive plays a role in the rise in cash balances in Germany. Our analysis highlights that the functioning of the financial system is crucial to corporate cash policy as Australia's cash pattern is driven by shallow private credit markets that curbed cash reserves earlier on and the decelerating cash trend in Japan is ascribed to financial reforms. While there is a degree of commonality in the determinants of cash policies, we find some divergence in cash practices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These individuals have the lowest fall-back positions and, hence, the highest incentives to succeed in career contests. This detrimental incentive effect exists irrespective of whether effort and talent are substitutes or complements in the underlying contest-success function. However, in case of complements the incentive effect can be outweighed by a productivity effect that favors high effort choices by the more talented individuals.

But equal rates of growth often deliver unequal rates of poverty reduction and absolute deprivation is more clearly relevant. Using state-level panel data for India, we contribute the first estimates of the impact of changes in poverty on infant survival. We identify a significant within-state relationship which persists conditional upon state income, indicating the size of survival gains from redistribution in favour of households below the poverty line. The poverty elasticity declines over time after 1981. It is invariant to controlling for income inequality but diminished upon controlling for education, fertility and state health expenditure, and eliminated once we introduce controls for omitted trends.","[Bhalotra, Sonia] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England; [Bhalotra, Sonia] Univ Bristol, CMPO, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England",University of Bristol; University of Bristol,"Bhalotra, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England.",s.bhalotra@bristol.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,51,0,0,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

However, these improvements can only be fully effective when they are complemented with a favorable investment climate. This study focuses on a particular aspect of investment climate, namely labor regulations, and shows how these regulations can be discouraging from exporting. Using firm level data from 26 countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia region, the paper empirically shows that firms that cannot create new jobs due to stringent labor regulations are less likely to export. Firms that plan to export expand their sizes before they start to export. However, the rigidities in labor markets make this adjustment process costly. Higher costs of employment decrease operating profits and lead to a higher productivity threshold level required for entering export markets. As a result, a smaller fraction of firms can afford to export. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines how the bank lending channel operates when this short-term indicator is endogenously determined by the target rate the central bank sets through a monetary policy rule. Furthermore, it examines whether different bank-specific characteristics affect the way banks react to a monetary shock. We investigate the effect of such a rule on the bank lending channel in European banking institutions spanning 2000 through 2009. The expectations, concerning both inflation and output, affect the decision of the central bank for the target rate, which, in turn, affect the private sector's expectations banks-by altering their loan supply.

In the course of this development, chain-wide communication has gained importance in agribusiness. Nonetheless, existing approaches focus primarily on information supply, whereas the use of information for managerial decision-making has only rarely been highlighted. This research gap is addressed in this paper on the basis of a large-scale empirical study of animal health management on German pig farms. By applying factor and multinomial logistic regression analyses, this study identifies determinants of the use of information as well as ways to improve information use on farms. It shows that factors like intrinsic motivation and farmer's competence have a significant influence on information use.","[Arens, Ludwig] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, D-37075 Gottingen, Niedersachsen, Germany; [Plumeyer, Cord-Herwig] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokono & Rurale Entwicklung, D-37073 Gottingen, Niedersachsen, Germany; [Theuvsen, Ludwig] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, D-370735 Gottingen, Niedersachsen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Arens, L (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37075 Gottingen, Niedersachsen, Germany.",larens@uni-goettingen.de; cplumey@gwdg.de; theuvsen@uni-goettingen.de,,,INTERREG IVA Project SafeGuard,INTERREG IVA Project SafeGuard,This study was undertaken with the support of the INTERREG IVA Project SafeGuard.

A current professional and especially political discussion looks for the solution of this short term fiscal imbalance through revenue side of the state budget - in the increased tax incomes. There is an identical basic argument for the increasing of the tax groups in all three different approaches (increasing of selected excised taxes, increasing of property taxes, increasing of income tax of legal entities - millionaire tax): to decrease state budget deficit.

The necessity to study and knowledge both the process itself and its effects on financial markets came as a result of a small number of studies and the inconclusive results regarding the impact of financial liberalization on developing countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Than rejected, financial liberalization must be accompanied by an increase in prudential policy. Too rapid liberalization in a country does not mean speed problems in an absolute sense, but in a relative sense: in many cases instability occurred because of the difference between impressive speeds of financial liberalization and very slow adjustment of the prudential provisions, banking and financial regulations, respectively monetary policy actions.

We explore how gains from trade have been distributed in the two minor trade partners of Mercosur, Uruguay and Paraguay, by analysing the impact of trade liberalisation on poverty and inequality through two main transmission channels: prices and income. In the case of Uruguay, trade liberalisation favoured a reduction in poverty indicators but had an almost zero effect on income inequality. In the case of Paraguay, trade liberalisation had a markedly negative impact in terms of poverty yet income distribution improved. We conclude that in the case of Mercosur, the effect of trade on poverty and income inequality varies per country and per region. In particular, we conclude that trade integration policies cannot be regarded as poverty-alleviating per se.","[Borraz, Fernando] Banco Cent Uruguay, Montevideo 11100, Uruguay; [Borraz, Fernando] Univ Republica, Dept Econ, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Montevideo 11100, Uruguay; [Ferres, Daniel] Univ Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad de Montevideo","Borraz, F (通讯作者)，Banco Cent Uruguay, Diagonal Fabini 777, Montevideo 11100, Uruguay.",fborraz@bcu.gub.uy,,,,,,,16,5,5,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This period is interesting because the exchange rate was seasonal, because transactions costs were high, and because occasions when uncovered interest rate speculation did not occur can be identified. The paper shows UIP speculation frequently did not occur, that speculation was most active in response to expected exchange rate changes not interest differentials when it did occur, and that profitability varied systematically with interest rate differentials.

The model allows for different types of uncertainty and considers different uses of the toll revenues. The following results are obtained. First, we show that individual uncertainty with respect to modal substitution costs may imply that a majority votes against road pricing ex ante, although a majority would have been in favor after its introduction ex post. Moreover, if a majority is against road pricing ex ante, there will also be no majority for organizing an experiment that would take away the individual uncertainty. Second, political uncertainty with respect to the use of the revenues corroborates the finding that ex ante more voters will be against the introduction of tolls. Third, both types of uncertainty suggest that fewer voters are against road pricing when toll revenues are used to subsidize public transport than when they are redistributed to all voters. Importantly, the results of this paper are consistent with a number of recent empirical observations on efforts to introduce road pricing, including the systematic rejection of road pricing in referenda, the more favorable attitudes towards road pricing after than before its introduction, and tying the toll revenues to support public transport.

It evaluates the impacts on the living standards both for the VAT reform that was actually approved in 2011, as well as for alternative reform proposals that were discussed during 2011 and that also considered a reduction in payroll tax rates. The estimates reflect the recent empirical findings about the incidence of consumption and payroll taxes. Unifying the VAT at a single tax rate has an almost proportional impact on the households from the 2nd to impact 10th income decile while having a disproportionately larger impact on the poorest decile. A reduction in the payroll tax would have reduced the progressivity of the tax system across the entire income range.","[Dusek, Libor] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Econ Res & Grad Educ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Dusek, Libor; Jansky, Petr] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Jansky, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Dusek, L (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Econ Res & Grad Educ, Prague, Czech Republic.",libor.dusek@cerge-ei.cz; petr.jansky@fsv.cuni.cz,"Dušek, Libor/AHD-6685-2022; Dušek, Libor/G-3205-2013; Jansky, Petr/H-4782-2014","Dušek, Libor/0000-0001-8054-3002; Jansky, Petr/0000-0001-6499-9923",,,,,23,9,9,2,22,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We assume that there is a positive externality from student achievement to the local economy. Comparing the case of regulated tuition fees with an unregulated market, we identify the following inefficiencies: Under regulated tuition fees schools will set up inefficiently lax curricula in an attempt to please low-quality students even if schools internalize some of the externality. On the other hand, unregulated schools set up excessively differentiated curricula in order to relax competition in tuition fees. Deregulation gets more attractive if a larger fraction of the externality is internalized. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, nonmeanreverting dynamism in financial markets may be produced by mass psychological dynamics in the patterns of human aggregate behavior, which result from nonrational herding impulses sensed by market participants in complex and uncertain situations. Based on a literature review and the analysis of several case studies, this paper elucidates postulated mechanisms behind, and characteristics of, herding in financial markets. The main goal is to raise awareness of the often little-understood point that collective behavior does not simply sum up preexisting individual motives and preferences. Thus, the paper focuses on the mechanism of how individually unintended aggregate outcomes such as financial market booms and panics are shaped by collective dynamics and social interactions between traders and their social environment.","[Fenzl, Thomas] Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Econ Psychol, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria",University of Klagenfurt,"Fenzl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Econ Psychol, Univ Str 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria.",Thomas.Fenzl@uni-klu.ac.at,,"Fenzl, Thomas/0000-0002-9310-3601",,,,,68,30,36,3,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Three output and 10 input types were used to calculate the efficiency score for each farm. A two-stage analysis was conducted to measure and explain the efficiency scores. Firstly, the efficiency scores were measured by a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach, which was implemented using a linear programming (LP) method. About 18 per cent of the farms were fully productive, each with an efficiency score of unity, which means this group is currently operating on the production possibility frontier. About 32 per cent of the farms had efficiency scores below 0.25, which means that about a third of the dairy farms would need to expand their dairy production by at least 75 per cent from the current level without any increase in the level of inputs. Secondly, a fractional regression method was used to explain the efficiency scores by relating them to a range of explanatory variables. The findings indicate that technology adoption factors, such as the existence of improved breeds, and feed and fodder innovations (e.g., growing legumes), have positive and statistically significant effects on the level of efficiency. Similarly, zero-grazing seems to have positive and highly significant effects. As far as marketing variables are concerned, selling milk to individual consumers or organisations seems to contribute positively and more significantly to dairy efficiency than other marketing outlets such as traders or chilling plants. Membership of a dairy cooperative has a positive effect but is not statistically significant.","[Gelan, A.] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Muriithi, B.

This work, I believe, will also fill the knowledge gap in the area of foreign direct investment (FDI) research on Georgia. The analysis focuses on major obstacles faced by investors. I first identify and then quantify the major obstacles for both foreign and domestic investors using the case studies of investors in Georgia and the statistics obtained from these data. The study results indicate that the most serious problem for investors is the political instability. I also found that the issues such as government regulations (regulatory burden), infrastructure, safety or corruption do not act as major deterrents of FDI inflows, especially after the successful reforms of the Saakashvili government.

The results show that overall dynamic cost inefficiency is very high with technical inefficiency being the largest component, followed by allocative and scale inefficiency. Moreover, overall dynamic cost inefficiency is significantly larger before the beginning of the financial crisis than during the financial crisis. Results also show that larger firms are on average less technically and scale inefficient than smaller firms, but have more problems in choosing the mix of inputs that minimizes their long-term costs. Firms that went bankrupt, on average have a higher overall dynamic cost inefficiency and scale inefficiency than firms that did not go bankrupt.","[Kapelko, Magdalena] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, Calle Madrid 126, Getafe 28903, Madrid, Spain; [Lansink, Alfons Oude; Stefanou, Spiro] Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Stefanou, Spiro] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Wageningen University & Research; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Kapelko, M (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, Calle Madrid 126, Getafe 28903, Madrid, Spain.",mkapelko@emp.uc3m.es; Alfons.OudeLansink@wur.nl; ttc@psu.edu,"Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/H-8840-2012; Stefanou, Spiro/V-5770-2017; Kapelko, Magdalena/F-3788-2016","Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/0000-0002-9273-6044;",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,5,17,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800001,0

The research found that there is no consistent interpretation or application of IAS 39 by the respondents.

Despite that there is still rather wide space for influencing exchange rates developments through management of the real exchange rates which affect countries' international competitiveness. The real exchange rate can be influenced by national authorities with other than monetary policy measures. Recent developments in Eurozone show that there are extensive balance-of-payments imbalances in individual countries caused also by a misalignment of real exchange rates. The analysis suggests that influencing real exchange rates could contribute to the solution of the balance-of-payments problem. At the same time, the possibility of rebalancing through real exchange rates adjustments is limited. Therefore structural reforms are needed and there might be also an action from the side of the ECB in the area of the nominal exchange rate management which could help to improve external performance of some Eurozone member countries.","[Nemec, Marian] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Banking & Int Finance, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,,nemec@euba.sk,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3527-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,233,244,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEZ44,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318886500017,0

We hypothesize that mangers anticipate the ultimate share price reversals and use high accruals to temporarily sustain overvaluation, while at the same time sell their shares. There is no incentive to deflate earnings of undervalued firms, leading to the prediction of an asymmetric relationship between trading and accruals. Our results support an agency explanation. Quadratic and binary regressions confirm that relationship between trades and accruals is concentrated on the selling side. The relationship between accruals and trading is only significant within the overvalued, low book-to-market (BM) firms. There is also evidence that low BM firms manage their earnings upward compared to high BM firms. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Referring to Purnandam and Swaminathan [2004], we gauge the IPO intrinsic values with respect to the offer price and the initial price. The portion that real offer (initial) price is above the intrinsic offer (initial) price is defined as offer premium (overreaction). Using 287 Taiwan's IPOs in sampling period 2004-2008, we find that most IPO firms were overpriced rather than underpriced. The offer premium is neither affected by earnings management nor managerial optimism, which is probably due to the greater scrutiny by the associated underwriters who are less gullible to managerial optimism or earnings management. In contrast, in initial market price valuation investors are cautious to take the face value of earnings management when IPO managers are perceived of moderate optimism. However, investors directly discipline overoptimistic managers with a lower initial valuation. Managerial overoptimism is the dominant factor in explaining long-run underperformance. We find that offer premium is positively associated with overreaction. Moreover, earnings management, albeit unrelated to overoptimism and offer premium, is positively related with initial overreaction and long-run underperformance.","[Chiang, Sue-Jane] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Business Adm, New Taipei City, Taiwan",Fu Jen Catholic University,"Chiang, SJ (通讯作者)，Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Business Adm, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",054399@mail.fju.edu.tw,"LIN, HSIN-YU/GWV-0327-2022",,,,,,74,7,8,5,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

I incorporate renewable resources and endogenous decisions on property rights into a convex growth model with the formal and informal sectors. I find that along the transition path to steady state, property rights enforcement is not constant but improves with time as well as involves intermediate property rights specification (between open access and perfect property rights). International trade and labor market are driving these endogenous changes. Property rights improve with favorable terms of trade when the economy exports resource services and stronger property rights help maintain the resource stock by deterring illegal harvest. This pushes labor away from the informal harvest sector toward greater participation in the formal sector of the economy. In turn, more labor participation in the formal sector along with capital formation increase the country's output and consumption. Overall, with an open economy and well-functioning institutions, renewable resources have a positive impact on economic growth.","Ryerson Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University,"Tajibaeva, LS (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Dept Econ, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.",ltajibaeva@economics.ryerson.ca,,,,,,,28,7,8,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In more or less paradoxically, many studies show that the regions have a decisive role and becoming more important in promoting economic growth based on innovation and entrepreneurship, through interaction and close ties that can arise between different stakeholders. Regional economies of Romania and other countries that have experienced profound economic restructuring processes face the problem of identifying new pathways and models of economic development, able to reducing the significant gap that separates them from developed EU regions. This study aims to explore the possibilities of promoting a development model able to use as the driving element the capacity of Romanian regions, and in particular the North East region, to gain competitive advantage and sustainable development through innovation, developing leading technology and stimulating entrepreneurship. For this we will try to find answer to some questions: Can be developed regional networks and clusters able to gather innovation and stimulate entrepreneurship?

We found that youth in rural south have limited access to agricultural land because of land scarcity and land market restrictions. We hypothesize that this forces the youth to abandon agriculture in search of other livelihoods. Our study shows that only 9% of the rural youth plan to pursue agriculture as their livelihood. We also found a sharp increase in youth outmigration in the past six years. Our econometric analyses confirm that lack of land access is forcing the youth away from an agricultural livelihood.

We demonstrate that the model can approximately match the volatility of the price-rent ratio in the data if near-rational agents continually update their estimates for the mean, persistence and volatility of fundamental rent growth using only recent data (i.e., the past 4 years), or if agents employ a simple moving-average forecast rule for the price-rent ratio that places a large weight on the most recent observation. These two versions of the model can be distinguished by their predictions for the correlation between expected future returns on housing and the price-rent ratio. Only the moving-average model predicts a positive correlation such that agents tend to expect high future returns when prices are high relative to fundamentals a feature that is consistent with a wide variety of survey evidence from real estate and stock markets.

We find evidence of both types in 2008. Moreover, we show that the likelihood of voting strategically is related to the electoral and institutional context.

Insurers increase premiums to adjust for higher surrender rates of customers and optimized surrender behavior by investors acquiring the policies on secondary markets. Hence, the existence of secondary markets is not necessarily profitable for the primary policyholders.

The repeated claims of the theorem's irrelevance and its dismissive treatment in the literature raise the question of why environmental economists were so interested in the Coase theorem in the first place. Several explanations are offered here including the roots of environmental economic theory in the theory of externalities, economists' fascination with the interesting and challenging theoretical puzzle posed by the theorem, and the normative and ideological thrust that permeated discussions of the theorem, both within and outside the field of environmental economics.

PBSPs are managed and operated by the private sector; by local community groups, including non-profit organisations (NPOs); and by local governments. In many Japanese cities where private bicycle sharing is high, the scale of PBSPs is relatively small, leading to challenges such as difficulty in securing funding and appointing operators. This paper proposes that NPOs may have the capacity to operate and effectively manage PBSPs in conjunction with other non-profit activities to promote community development. Using a case study approach and implementing a user perception survey, this study examines the experience of a small-scale, NPO-run PBSP in Kitakyushu City, Japan. Findings show that NPO management and operation added value to the PBSP. In addition, some users were interested in the PBSP beyond its role as a means of transport. These users tend to engage in local activities more frequently than other users. Finally, almost all of the users were satisfied with the bicycle-sharing service, regardless of their reasons for using the programme. The insights gained from these results may help improve small-scale PBSP implementation, policy, and planning, both in Japan and beyond. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Previous empirical studies demonstrate that tax evasion reduces the effects of tariffs on equilibrium prices, but admit an alternative explanation: traders bore the incidence. This paper aims to refine the price disparity analysis to allow for that explanation. An application considers the market for imported pork parts in Japan to,exploit the variation in tariff rates over time and across products. Using novel data on monthly wholesale prices on narrowly-defined pork products from 2001 through 2012, I find that a widespread evasion nullified safeguard tariffs almost fully. An alternative identification strategy corroborates the evidence on widespread evasion: An upper bound estimate on the total amount of tariffs evaded is 5.5 times as much as the collected revenue. Additionally, the result indicates that a tougher enforcement reduces evasions. J. Japanese Int. Economies 34 (2014) 1-23.

Plausible explanations come to light, and we find that an empirically testable method for the a priori prediction of clinical research subjects who are prone to the placebo effect or response shift appears when we apply dual information processing systems theory to those problems. This theory may well have significant implications for health care research within the areas of the placebo effect, response shift, patient-reported outcomes, and health utilities, as well as for whether the terms quality of life and well-being should be equally valued from a perceptual viewpoint as from a conceptual one. The use of both views would permit a greater understanding of the reliability and validity of assessments that rest on subjective valuations.

We describe what is known about abatement options and cost-effective policy design, and then focus on the large seasonally recurring hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. We offer a simple econometric model to estimate the relationship between pollutants (nutrients) and the size of the hypoxic zone. This production function relationship suggests that both instantaneous and historical nutrient contributions affect the size of the zone. Our results support concerns that ecologists have raised about lags in the recovery of the ecosystem and confirm the importance of multiple nutrients as target pollutants. We conclude with a discussion of the types of research and cooperation across disciplines that are needed to support the development of policies to address this important ecological and economic issue.

We hypothesize that the accessibility benefits of light rail transit (LRT) and highways accrue at nodes (stations and highway exits specifically), while disamenities emanate from rail and highway links as well as from nodes. Distance decay of amenities and disamenities is captured using multiple distance bands, and hypotheses are tested using a spatial hedonic model using generalized spatial two-stage least-squares estimation. Results show that proximity to transport nodes was associated significantly and positively with single-family detached home values. As a function of distance from highway exits and LRT stations, the distance-band coefficients form an inverted-U pattern consistent with a positive longer-range distance-decay accessibility effect minus a smaller and shorter-range distance-decay disamenity effect. The positive accessibility effect for highway exits extends farther than for LRT stations. Coefficients for the distance from highway and LRT links, however, were not significant. We also test the effect of highway design on home values and find that below-grade highways have relatively positive impacts on nearby houses compared to those at ground level or above.

Using the exogenous shock of the 1989 Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, we find that duality firms outperform non-duality firms by 3-4% when their competitive environments change. Further, the performance difference is larger for firms with higher information costs and better corporate governance. Our results underscore the benefits of CEO duality in saving information costs and making speedy decisions. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A good cross-training plan can encourage employees to learn more about all sides of the business and is able to jump in to help anytime, anywhere when other departments need to be supported. The tourism industry is a labor-intensive service industry dependent for survival and competitive advantage on the availability of good quality personnel to deliver, operate and manage the tourist product. Cross-training is presented as a learning opportunity whose main purpose is to build employee motivation, reduce turnover and increase productivity for industries. The interaction between tourist and tourism industry personnel is an integral part of the total tourist experience. Generally speaking, hospitality industry has one of the highest levels of skill shortages and Libya is no exception. This paper focuses on skills relating to cross training in hotels industry. The paper considers the key arguments from Libya's perspective in the context of hotels industry regarding cross training and its effect on labor turnover. Three hotels have been selected for the study by distributing and collecting questionnaire on 91 employees. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze the data. Both hypothesis of the study were tested. The first one indicated that there is a negative relationship between the level of per capita income and labor turnover and the other one tested if cross training has an effect on labor turnover rates. The effect of employee's income on labor turnover has been tested, in order to find out if employees' income is the only factor effects labor turnover, or cross training is another factor which has its effect on labor turnover too. Labor turnover average in selected hotels illustrated. Justifications of labor turnover will be tested and solutions for reducing labor turn over will be presented.","Libyan Acad, Tripoli, Libya",,"Abuharris, AT (通讯作者)，Libyan Acad, Tripoli, Libya.",atiyaharris@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,1,3,0,11,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1269,1278,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900017,0

The improvement is largely due to an expansion of international markets through various bilateral trade agreements and the structural changes in Korean exchange rates. This article investigates the exchange rate-trade balance dynamics, popularly known as the J-Curve phenomenon. Employing the bounds-testing approach to cointegration and error-correction modeling on Korean bilateral trade for the pre- and post-Asian crisis periods, the study finds that support for the strict version of the J-Curves has been fading after the crisis. While the weaker version of J-Curve is generally supported in both pre-and post-crisis sample periods, we also notice patterns such as M, N, or W-Curves. There exists a long-run relationship among the Korean exchange rates, domestic income, foreign income, and Korean trading balances.","[Ratha, Artatrana; Kang, Eungmin] St Cloud State Univ, Dept Econ, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA",Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Saint Cloud State University,"Ratha, A (通讯作者)，St Cloud State Univ, Dept Econ, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA.",aratha@stcloudstate.edu; ekang@stcloudstate.edu,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

In particular, we focus on the role of the time-varying jump risk premia. Particle filters are used to estimate the model-implied spot volatilities. We also propose the beta transformation approach for recursive parameter updating. Our empirical analysis shows that the inconsistencies between options & returns and only returns are resolved by the introduction of the time-varying jump risk premia. For density forecasts, the time-varying jump risk premia models dominate the other models in terms of likelihood criteria. We also find that for medium-term horizons, the beta transformation can weaken the systematic effect of misspecified AJD models using options & returns. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find that, subject to efficient use of interconnectors between the two markets and constant imports from France and the Netherlands, a carbon price floor will lead to carbon leakage, with associated emissions in the Republic of Ireland increasing by 8% and electricity prices increasing by 2.4%. Howeven across the combined Irish and British electricity markets total emissions decline: high carbon prices drive decarbonisation in electricity generation. The UK's now implemented policy, which is a mechanism to directly manage carbon prices, substantially differs with the yet to be agreed EU policy response to postpone auctions of Emissions Trading Scheme allowances with the intention of indirectly increasing the price of carbon. The analysis suggests that the EU proposal will have only negligible additional effect on emissions from the combined Irish and UK electricity sectors.","[Curtis, John; Di Cosmo, Valeria] Sir John Rogersons Quay, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Curtis, John; Di Cosmo, Valeria] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Deane, Paul] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, Energy Policy & Modelling Grp, Cork, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; University College Cork,"Curtis, J (通讯作者)，Sir John Rogersons Quay, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland.",john.curtis@esri.ie,"Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684; Deane, Paul/0000-0002-4681-7791",Energy Policy Research Centre at the Economic and Social Research Institute; Science Foundation Ireland; Environmental Protection Agency,Energy Policy Research Centre at the Economic and Social Research Institute; Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland); Environmental Protection Agency,"Funding from the Energy Policy Research Centre at the Economic and Social Research Institute is gratefully acknowledged.

Permitting risk classification may reduce informational asymmetry-induced adverse selection and improve insurance market efficiency. It may also have undesirable equity consequences and undermine the implicit insurance against reclassification risk, which legislated restrictions on risk classification could provide. We use a canonical insurance market screening model to survey and to extend the risk classification literature.

However, these IEAs reduce total emissions and raise welfare only slightly compared to business as usual. This paper investigates whether that poor mitigation performance can be improved upon, when governments have at their disposal a fossil-fuel supply tax in addition to the cap policy. If signatories can use the mixed policy, they choose a higher fuel supply tax than nonsignatories and thus succeed in shifting a larger share of the mitigation burden to nonsignatories. Although the number of signatories of self-enforcing IEAs is smaller with mixed than with stand-alone cap policy, the smaller IEAs achieve larger global emission reductions and higher welfare gains for all countries.","[Eichner, Thomas] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany; [Pethig, Ruediger] Univ Siegen, Dept Econ, D-57068 Siegen, Germany",Fern University Hagen; Universitat Siegen,"Eichner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany.",,,,,,,,20,5,5,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Specifically, we find that the decline in companies' valuation during the financial crisis of 2007-2009 was more sensitive to firm-level transparency in countries with stronger investor protection. We propose a theoretical model that reconciles our findings with the results in the literature. In our model, during normal times strong firm-level governance is crucial to attract outside financing in countries with weak investor protection, but is less important in countries with good investor protection. During a crisis, however, investment opportunities decline even in countries with strong investor protection, and, as a result, relative importance of firm-level governance increases in such places.

We combine the survey data with investors' actual trading data and portfolio holdings. We find that investor beliefs have little predictive power for immediate trading behavior. The exception is a positive effect of increases in return expectation on buying activity. Portfolio risk levels and changes are more systematically related to return and risk expectations. In line with financial theory, risk taking increases with return expectations and decreases with risk expectations.

To identify the effect of this spread on loan length, we rely on a unique institutional feature in China-the dual-track mortgage scheme. We observe two types of mortgagors in this setting: normal mortgagors, who face floating mortgage-rate spreads, and special mortgagors, who are entitled to a fixed mortgage rate spread. Using the latter as a comparison group to address the confounding effects of omitted factors, we find that the change in interest rates significantly affects the mortgage decisions of normal mortgagors.

Overall HFTs facilitate price efficiency by trading in the direction of permanent price changes and in the opposite direction of transitory pricing errors, both on average and on the highest volatility days. This is done through their liquidity demanding orders. In contrast, HFTs' liquidity supplying orders are adversely selected. The direction of HFTs' trading predicts price changes over short horizons measured in seconds. The direction of HFTs' trading is correlated with public information, such as macro news announcements, market-wide price movements, and limit order book imbalances.","[Brogaard, Jonathan] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hendershott, Terrence] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Riordan, Ryan] Univ Western Ontario, Inst Technol, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Brogaard, J (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Foster Sch Business, Box 353226, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",brogaard@uw.edu,"Riordan, Ryan/AAN-9850-2021","Riordan, Ryan/0000-0003-4538-1241",Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1440415] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),,,44,455,515,13,196,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Conservation interventions which relax constraints may be both cost effective and poverty reducing. A simulation using data from an intervention in Madagascar to relax the technological constraints of forest honey production investigates this possibility. Cost-effectively achieving dual environment-development goals is shown to depend on the severity of constraints, relative prices, along with the nature and efficiency in use of technology. Success is more likely for technologies exhibiting close to constant returns to scale or high-input complementarity. Forest honey does not meet these requirements. Ultimately, where market or institutional constraints are present, knowledge of the recipient technology is required for more informed, efficient and perhaps more politically acceptable conservation policy.","[Groom, Ben; Palmer, Charles] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Groom, B (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",b.groom@lse.ac.uk; c.palmer1@lse.ac.uk,"Groom, Ben/AAP-9305-2021","Groom, Ben/0000-0003-0729-143X",,,,,34,7,7,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Multinational banks can benefit from portfolio diversification, reducing their overall riskiness, but this effect can be offset by incentives going in the opposite direction, leading them to take on excessive risks. Since both effects are grounded on solid theoretical arguments, the answer of what is the actual relationship between bank internationalization and risk is left to the empirical analysis. In this paper, we study such relationship in the period leading to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. For a sample of 384 listed banks from 56 countries, we calculate two measures of risk for the period from 2001 to 2007 - the expected default frequency (EDF), a market-based and forward-looking indicator, and the Z-score, a balance-sheet-based and backward-looking measure - and relate them to the degree of banks' internationalization. We find robust evidence that international diversification increases bank risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Gulamhussen, M.

TBTF resolutions protect some in-the-money counterparties of a targeted insolvent firm from losses that they would suffer if the usual bankruptcy resolution regimes used in resolving other firms in the industry were applied. Although special TBTF resolution regimes may reduce the collateral spill-over costs of the failure, the combined direct and indirect costs from such bailouts may be large and often financed in part or in total by taxpayers. Thus, TBTF has become a major public policy issue that has not been resolved in part because of disagreements about definitions and thereby the estimates of the benefits and costs. This paper explores these differences and develops a framework for standardizing the definitions and evaluating the desirability of TBTF resolutions more accurately. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

But when do weak players actually do this? And which fields do they give up when the fields differ in their likelihood of being assessed? We report an experimental study of resource allocation in which asymmetric pairs of players compete over asymmetric fields. Symmetric players and symmetric fields are used for control. We find that players behave as follows: (1) Average wins are the same in the symmetric and asymmetric fields conditions and correspond to relative player strength. (2) The proportion of fields given up on decreases with a player's greater relative strength, increases for asymmetric field likelihoods, and increases when competitions are framed in meaningful context; this proportion is related to wins. (3) When field likelihoods are asymmetric, players' resource allocation is correlated with likelihood. Wins generally increase with that correlation but the relation is different for players of different strength. (4) The proportion of fields given up on and the correlation with likelihood change with experience towards the values corresponding to higher wins. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using recent movers from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and borrowing constraint definitions commonly used in the literature, we examine the impact of these constraints on the probability of homeownership during the housing market boom between 2003 and 2007. We show that whereas the pool of financially constrained households expanded, the marginal impact of borrowing constraints associated with income and credit quality declined during this period. The constraint associated with wealth, however, continued to have a negative impact on homeownership status, all else equal. The fact that lending standards became less strict is accepted; however the impact of this on homeownership has not been previously studied. Here we find that less restrictive underwriting does appear to have reduced the impact of income and credit quality on homeownership but the impact of the wealth constraint persists.

In contrast to emission cuts, geoengineering is expected to be cheap, quick to lower temperature, and feasible through the use of a single intervention. However, geoengineering is an imperfect substitute for emission reductions and will likely have undesirable side effects, only some of which can be anticipated before geoengineering is deployed. Most importantly, because geoengineering can be undertaken unilaterally, it creates issues of governance: Who gets to decide if, when, and how geoengineering should be attempted? This article provides an introduction to the key issues surrounding the governance of this unprecedented technology.","[Barrett, Scott] Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Barrett, Scott] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Barrett, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA.",sb3116@columbia.edu,,,,,,,65,42,49,1,32,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

This article examines property rights to a common-pool resource (CPR) that are asymmetrically allocated among users, and presents a theoretical argument that property rights affect the allocation of resource benefits in two important ways. First, users with extensive property rights receive more benefits than users with limited property rights. Second, users with the power to influence how community rules are enforcedfor example, landholders and ethnic majoritiesmore effectively define and defend their property and thus receive disproportionate CPR benefits compared to users with similar levels of property rights, but with less power. Using household-level survey data in Bolivia, Kenya, Mexico, and Uganda, collected after a period of property rights decentralization, the empirical analysis finds support for these propositions. We conclude that power critically moderates the effects of property rights on the commons.","[Coleman, Eric A.; Liebertz, Scott S.] Florida State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Coleman, EA (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 543 Bellamy,POB 3062230, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",ecoleman@fsu.edu; ss109@fsu.edu,,"Coleman, Eric/0000-0002-5315-7111",,,,,54,4,5,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Moreover, research pays scant attention to how far Canadians transition out of poverty. For example, some may exit poverty only marginally, while others exit much further above the poverty line. We investigate the determinants of poverty duration among women and men in Canada. A major contribution of this article is the examination of poverty duration across different exit destinations (competing risks): exits to just above the poverty line versus exits to further above the poverty line. We find that nearly one-quarter of poverty spells end within 110 percent of the poverty line (near poverty). Many of those who exit to near poverty experience multiple spells. As expected, we find that higher education increases the probability of transitioning further out of poverty, but very little is correlated with exits to near poverty relative to remaining in poverty. The longer the poverty spell, the lower the probability of exit, particularly to higher income levels. We find few significant gender differences in the coefficient estimates. Differences are present in the characteristics associated with exits close to or further away from the poverty line.","[Curtis, Lori J.; Rybczynski, Kate] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Curtis, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",,,,,,,,52,2,2,0,18,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The paper revives the electricity consumption approach to measuring such activity with a new functional form, a larger sample of countries, a longer time span of 25 years, and the use of instrumental variables. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the CIT rate increases the size of the shadow economy by 2.3 percent, which implies a tax elasticity of shadow economic activity of 0.78 at the mean CIT rate.

The main driving force for these results is the response of the intensity of tax competition. The increased (decreased) intensity of tax competition makes partial tax coordination more (less) sustainable.

We find that differences in riskiness among portfolios of bonds belonging to different rating classes are seldom statistically significant. We instead find significant time variation in riskiness, driven mainly by return volatility, inflation, and average bond yields. In particular, we find that increases in average bond yields have historically tended to reduce the riskiness of portfolios of corporate bonds by increasing their expected return and by lowering the probability of portfolio losses.","Bank Italy, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Taboga, M (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Rome, Italy.",marco.taboga@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,49,2,2,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The framework is intended to help researchersboth those who focus mainly on studying program implementation and those who focus mainly on estimating program effectssee how their respective pieces fit together in a way that helps to identify factors that explain variation in program effects, and thereby support more systematic data collection. The ultimate goal of the framework is to enable researchers to offer better guidance to policymakers and program operators on the conditions and practices that are associated with larger and more positive effects.","[Weiss, Michael J.; Bloom, Howard S.] MDRC, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Brock, Thomas] Inst Sci Educ, Natl Ctr Educ Res, Washington, DC 20208 USA",US Department of Education,"Weiss, MJ (通讯作者)，MDRC, 16 East 34th St, New York, NY 10016 USA.",michael.weiss@mdrc.org; howard.bloom@mdrc.org; Thomas.Brock@ed.gov,,"Weiss, Michael/0000-0003-0665-3478",,,,,82,77,102,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

The first one concerns the consequences of the prevailing intellectual compartmentalization between questions related to energy and climate on the one hand, and to the viability of social security systems on the other (the viability of those systems is challenged by the increasing exposure to international competition and the ageing of the population). The second issue is about the fact that expertise on the funding of pensions are conducted under partial equilibrium analysis and ignore the general equilibrium effects of the various funding options on competitiveness, employment and wages. We take the methodological venture of building a general equilibrium vision of France for 2020 that is consistent with a scenario of the Conseil d'Orientation des Retraites. We first emphasize the limitations of policies that either i) use only one of the present instruments of the pension system (social contributions, retirement age), or ii) look for new resources by only considering an increase of income tax or VAT. Then we present a way to remove those limitations by introducing a carbon tax as a component of a policy package designed to absorb the deficits of the social accounts. We show that the current compartmentalization of expertise is dangerous, both for the funding of the pension system as well as for removing the obstacles to an ambitious climate policy.","[Combet, Emmanuel; Hourcade, Jean Charles] Ecole Ponts ParisTech, EHESS, CNRS, CIRED, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay,"Combet, E (通讯作者)，Ecole Ponts ParisTech, EHESS, CNRS, CIRED, 45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,9,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

This is often related to the distance between policy and governance structures, and, the realities of life in AIDS affected communities. This article unpacks the specifics of this 'distance' in the context of the HIV/AIDS response in the Kingdom of Swaziland. A framework applies the notions of 'order and disjuncture' to structure a discussion of policy documents and a thematic analysis of focus group data with participants who 'live' the outputs of policies enabled by global-local partnerships. Findings uncover that programming and community difficulties emerge around assumptions about responsibility (which link back to international discourses on volunteerism) and actual requirements for supporting community life in the context of the pandemic.","[Burgess, Rochelle A.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Inst Social Psychol, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Burgess, Rochelle A.] Hlth Econ & HIV AIDS Res Div HEARD, Durban, South Africa",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Burgess, RA (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Inst Social Psychol, St Clements Bldg,Room 317,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.a.burgess@lse.ac.uk,,"Burgess, Rochelle/0000-0001-9749-7065",,,,,49,5,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Most quantitative analyses conducted by academic researchers and practitioners focus only on the return distribution. However, the return distribution itself hardly helps to determine whether the price of a winner stock picked by using the momentum strategy reaches the level where the risk incurred from the falling of prices is imminent. Therefore, we construct an implied price risk index to quantify the downside risk of a stock and use it to manage the tail risk of the momentum strategy.

As individuals who claim later can, on average, expect to receive benefits for a shorter period, an actuarial adjustment is made to the monthly benefit to reflect the age at which benefits are claimed. We investigate the actuarial fairness of that adjustment in light of recent improvements in mortality and historically low interest rates. We show that delaying is actuarially advantageous for a large number of people, even for individuals with mortality rates that are twice the average. At real interest rates closer to their historical average, singles with mortality that is substantially greater than average do not benefit from delay, although primary earners with high mortality can still improve the present value of the household's benefits through delay. We also investigate the extent to which the actuarial advantage of delay has grown since the early 1960s, when the choice of when to claim first became available, and we decompose this growth into three effects: (1) the effect of changes in Social Security's rules, (2) the effect of changes in the real interest rate, and (3) the effect of changes in life expectancy. Finally, we quantify the extent to which the gains from delay can be expected to increase in the future as a result of mortality improvements.","[Shoven, John B.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shoven, John B.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Slavov, Sita Nataraj] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Shoven, JB (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",shoven@stanford.edu; sita.slavov@aei.org,,,,,,,28,42,50,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

The empirical results show that institutional investors are effective monitors of corporate risk management to enhance the probability and extent of hedging. In addition, the monitoring function from institutional investors is effective for mitigating the risk-shifting problem of high leveraged firms. Moreover, local institutional investors play more important role in monitoring distressed firm's magnitude of hedging than foreign institutional investors. These results are robust to the consideration of endogeneity, selection bias, and industrial difference.

Time-changed L,vy processes are attractive to use for a driving factor of underlying prices because the processes provide a flexible framework for generating jumps, capturing stochastic volatility as the random time change, and introducing the leverage effect. There have been very few studies dealing with pricing problems of exotic derivatives on time-changed L,vy processes in contrast to standard European derivatives. Our pricing formula is based on the Gram-Charlier expansion and the key of the formula is to find analytic treatments for computing the moments of the normalized average asset price. In numerical examples, we demonstrate that our formula give accurate values of average call options when adopting Heston's stochastic volatility model, VG-CIR, and NIG-CIR models.","Hosei Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Sinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1620843, Japan",Hosei University,"Yamazaki, A (通讯作者)，Hosei Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Sinjuku Ku, 2-16 Tamachi, Tokyo 1620843, Japan.",akira2yamazaki@gmail.com,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24830087] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,39,18,18,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Our approach is based on mixtures of Gaussian distributions, explicitly conditioned on borrower characteristics, debt instrument characteristics and credit conditions at the time of default. Using Moody's Ultimate Recovery Database, we show that our mixture specification yields more accurate forecasts of ultimate recoveries on portfolios of defaulted loans and bonds on an out-of-sample basis than popular regression-based estimates. Further, the economically interpretable outputs of our model provide a richer characterization of how conditioning variables affect recovery outcomes than competing approaches. The latter benefit is of particular importance in understanding shifts in the relative likelihood of extreme recovery outcomes that tend to be realized more frequently than observations near the distributional mean.

A Monte Carlo simulations exercise is used to investigate the implications for the accuracy of the estimated inefficiency scores of estimation using either an under-parameterized, over-parameterized or correctly specified cost function. On average, the estimated mean efficiencies obtained from random parameters models tend to be higher than those obtained using fixed or random effects, because random parameters models do not confound parameter heterogeneity with inefficiency. Using a random parameters model, we analyse the evolution of the average rank cost efficiency for Latin American banks between 1985 and 2010. Cost efficiency deteriorated during the 1990s, particularly for state-owned banks, before improving during the 2000s but prior to the sub-prime crisis.

We empirically estimate the key model parameters from a data set of the operation of coal-fired generating units over 25 years. We find that a 10% increase in coal prices causes a 0.1%-0.4% improvement in efficiency (electricity production per ton of coal), which is broadly consistent with engineering assessments of the cost of improving efficiency. We also find that coal prices have a significant effect on utilization. Using the estimates to compare alternative policies, we find performance standards are less efficient than a tax because they cause greater utilization.","[Linn, Joshua; Burtraw, Dallas] Darius Gaskins Chair Resources Future, Washington, DC USA; [Mastrangelo, Erin] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Linn, J (通讯作者)，Darius Gaskins Chair Resources Future, Washington, DC USA.",linn@rff.org; ekmastrangelo@gmail.com; burtraw@rff.org,"Linn, Joshua/AAT-6768-2021",,,,,,19,31,45,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

In contrast, firms cannot rely on this knowledge source for realizing more sophisticated, knowledge-intensive innovation outcomes, such as product innovation and patenting, for which their own R&D engagement is more significant.","Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Liu, WH (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",wan-hsin.liu@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,40,1,1,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

First, we discuss two recent lines of research on the effects of UI, one of which argues that UI is more welfare enhancing than previously thought, and a second that suggests that its distortions are often larger than previously argued. We point out limitations in each research program, but conclude that both significantly advance our knowledge. Second, we summarize the evidence on the effect of UI on claim duration from a 36 percent increase in the maximum weekly benefit in New York State. This policy change sharply increased benefits for a large group of claimants, while leaving them unchanged for a large share of claimants who provide a natural comparison group. The New York benefit increase has the special features that it was unexpected and applied to in-progress spells. These features allow the effects on duration to be more convincingly separated from effects on incidence. The results show a fall in the hazard of leaving UI that coincides with the increase in benefits. The estimated unemployment duration elasticities with respect to the UI benefit range from 0.1-0.2, towards the low end of past estimates. We do not find larger effects for those who are more likely to be liquidity constrained. We also examine the extent of bias in standard methods that identify duration effects through nonlinearities in the benefit schedule, finding mixed results.","[Meyer, Bruce D.] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Meyer, Bruce D.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mok, Wallace K.

In the full sample, a 1% unexpected increase in the policy rate leads to an about 1.8% depreciation of the baht against the Japanese yen. During periods of high interest rate differentials, an unexpected increase in the policy rate leads to a substantial depreciation of the baht against the US dollar (about 1%) and the British pound (about 2.6%). While Thai monetary policy surprises have no effect on the baht against the dollar in the spot market, they have a significant effect on the baht against the dollar in the forwards market. During the non-financial crisis period, an unexpected increase in the policy rate on average results in a large depreciation of the baht/dollar forward rates: 6.6% and 13.7% for two-month and three-month forward rates, respectively.

Other important factors for SME exporting activities are productivity-enhancing spillovers from industry-especially vertical-linkages, firm size, ownership type, type of activity, the availability of external finance, networking through business associations, and market share. In addition, significant period and country differences are identified.

Empirical analyses at the market level support these predictions. Furthermore, the results indicate that removing the information flow significantly reduces the return volatility persistence and the extent of the reduction exhibits a size pattern.","[He, Xiaojun] Yeshiva Univ, Syms Sch Business, New York, NY 10033 USA; [Velu, Raja] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Yeshiva University; Syracuse University,"He, XJ (通讯作者)，Yeshiva Univ, Syms Sch Business, 500 W 185th St, New York, NY 10033 USA.",xihe@yu.edu; rpvelu@syr.edu,"HE, Xiaojun/D-8511-2012",,,,,,28,11,13,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

In a weak contracting environment characteristic of developing countries, vertically integrated firms are vulnerable to employee spinouts: managers of input divisions can start their own firms, making customized inputs formerly provided internally subject to hold-up and capturing the profits formerly made from external sales of generic inputs. This vulnerability is shown to lead to inefficiently low entry. Vertically integrated firms can fight back by hiring managers for their input divisions who are members of networks that informally sanction hold-ups or children who keep profits in the family even if they spin out. This is shown to predict the association of co-ethnic networks with high rates of entrepreneurship and the prominence of family-owned business groups in developing country manufacturing.","[Rauch, James E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Rauch, James E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rauch, James E.] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; Ifo Institut,"Rauch, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",jrauch@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,32,2,2,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

It also reflects the importance of which biotechnology institutional support may encourage the successes and failures of family businesses. This supports the challenges of long gestation period in biotechnology ventures which requires strong financial and policy supports from various governments and institutional agencies to facilitate resources limitation.","[Ahamat, Amiruddin] Univ Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, Durian Tunggal, Melaka, Malaysia; [Chong, Siong Choy] Finance Accreditat Agcy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",University Teknikal Malaysia Melaka; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Ahamat, A (通讯作者)，Univ Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, Durian Tunggal, Melaka, Malaysia.",amiruddin@utem.edu.my; eddychong@faa.org.my,"Ahamat, Amiruddin/G-9284-2019; Chong, Siong Choy/ABD-4021-2020; Chong, Siong Choy/KBA-4836-2024","Chong, Siong Choy/0000-0003-4519-2301; Ahamat, Amiruddin/0000-0002-4237-8015",,,,,61,5,5,1,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,2171,2177,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300219,0

The fiscal policy of the state in conditions of financial and economic crisis is analyzed. The crisis has clearly demonstrated the inefficiency of standard macroeconomic regulators for preventing the accumulation of system contradictions. The crisis has revealed the typical and atypical economic imbalances in the country. The inability to restore the appropriate rate of economic growth leads to the spread of negative consequences for the filling of the state budget, ensuring the stability of the banking system, exchange rate, a stable increase of the population incomes. The growth of the deficit of the state budget is determined as one of the most important issues. The deficit is due to the inconsistency of the government's commitments and budget incomes. There is the increasing of the fiscal burden on the economy of the state. The total amount of external and internal government debt has significantly increased recently. There is a contradiction between the fiscal and regulatory functions of the state tax policy. The tax policy is viewed mainly as a tool for mobilization of incomes of the budget. It is determined that the need of a fundamental updates of the sources of economic and social development of Ukraine, which is possible on the basis of new model of development is obvious. The features of the macroeconomic situation in Ukraine are scrutinized by the authors, conclusions about the special features of fiscal policy in modern conditions are drawn. The risks and prospects are priced, and the main trends of the further fiscal policy in Ukraine are formulated. The main priorities of fiscal policy are the following directions: the introduction of elements of the market model of public finance management, rationalization and regulation of the system of social spending, reducing the extent of usage of fiscal instruments to support economic activity in favor of tax instruments. The strengthening of fiscal efficiency and social equity of the tax system are also defined as the priority directions.",,,,OsadchukS1@yandex.ru,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,3,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-021-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,21,28,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346752000002,0

Nevertheless, at certain years the extent of flood can be huge. The surface drainage may be broadly divided into sub-catchments according to drainage namely; Wadi Als-Sader, Wadi Jelwakh with Wadi Khaleel, Wadi Al-Maghir. Wadi Zarraba is the confluence of the three sub-catchments. The study covers an area of 53.3 km(2) and comprises a high semi -arid infrequent flash floods generated by heavy rainstorm over the catchment and flows to Wadi Araba. Average annual rainfall of Wadi Mousa was calculated of 178 mm, and average annual evapotranspiration is 1300 mm per year.

However, at the same time these innovation contracts have likewise created the prospect for market participants to destabilize the whole economic system. Over the last years, international financial markets have suffered disastrous disruptions caused by various factors.

In response, using the Resources-Dependency-Theory (RDT) and Diffusion-Innovation-Theory (DIT), this paper argues on the interaction between the influence of innovation characteristics and power exercise, so as to explain B2B EC adoption.

In our opinion, maximum span of control is the result of multiplying two independent variables: company individual managing index (k(ind) index) by index that estimates how many managers control single operation independently (k(im) index). So a company should try to maximize span of control while at the same time minimizing the number of managers. Definition of these independent variables implies identification of the number of managers who manage one operation independently (for instance, k(ind) for matrix organizational structure would be 2). The second independent variable is proposed to be defined on the basis of estimation of company primary leader's type, coincidence of formal and informal leadership, employee participation in decision-making, correlation by employees their own results with the company results, predictability of environment, level of disturbance in organizational communications, coincidence of job to the types of employee personality. The said approach allows to reveal if organizational function is misperformed in case span of control seems to be low in comparison to other companies of the same size and complexity of environment.

Outlicensing provides a legal mechanism through which to protect intellectual property in the form of an innovation, secure supplemental revenue by granting licensees defined rights to use the innovation, and draw new ideas through relationships with other innovators in the industry. Outlicensing takes several forms, ranging from the standard variety of restrictive license to open-source licensing. The different forms of outlicensing may fit different strategies, governed by a combination of the company's vision and the dynamics of the industry. While the consensus in the literature is that innovative companies should integrate licensing activities into their marketing and engineering functions, rather than considering the outlicensing option only after the creation of the innovation, the problem remains that fewer companies currently exploit the benefits of outlicensing than have the opportunity to do so.","Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Bagherzadeh, G (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",g.bagherzadeh@student.unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,10,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,561,569,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300060,0

We find that, in advanced economies, stronger planned fiscal consolidation has been associated with lower growth than expected, with the relation being particularly strong, both statistically and economically, early in the crisis. A natural interpretation is that fiscal multipliers were substantially higher than implicitly assumed by forecasters. The weaker relation in more recent years may reflect in part learning by forecasters and in part smaller multipliers than in the early years of the crisis.","[Blanchard, Olivier J.; Leigh, Daniel] IMF, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Blanchard, OJ (通讯作者)，IMF, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,39,38,40,1,9,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

It motivates the development of GGIG (Gams Graphical Interface Generator) by reviewing existing approaches. In opposite to frameworks available for environmental and Agent Based Modelling, GUI generators for more classical economic models seem to be scarce. GGIG aims at a fast development process not requiring programming skills where simple user operable controls are defined in an XML file such that GAMS based projects can add easily a GUI. It comprises quite versatile exploitation tools for interactive reporting (tables, graphs and maps) including a machine learning package plus useful utilities, e.g. to generate a HTML based GAMS code documentation or batch execution. In opposite to other approaches, GGIG strictly separates the GUI and GAMS code, but does not offer IDE functionality. Applications to CAPRI, a rather complex model, and some smaller projects seem to show that researchers without formal programming training are able to develop and modify a GUI for their models, while model users can be quickly trained in GGIG based GUIs.","[Britz, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, D-53229 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Britz, W (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Lebensmittel & Ressourcenokonom, Nussallee 21, D-53229 Bonn, Germany.",wolfgang.britz@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823",,,,,56,9,9,0,2,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Furthermore, the consumption of water buffalo milk products (WBMPs) has been rising, due to a large extent to the full taste and the health benefits of these products. This paper investigates the consumers' purchasing intentions towards WBMPs in the greater area of Thessaloniki, Greece, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). According to the TPB theory, a) attitude towards the behavior, b) subjective norms and c) perceived behavioral control, jointly influence the intention to a specific behavior. Furthermore, the stronger the intention, the more likely the expected behavior is. In this paper we propose a model of behavioral intention based on the TPB theory and we investigate the impact of behavioral and normative beliefs on the WBMPs purchasing intention of consumers in the greater area of Thessaloniki, Greece. More specifically, we have examined consumers' knowledge, nutritional benefits, general attitudes and social contacts. The quantitative analytical approach is used to test the above model and hypotheses, based on empirical data gathered from 247 questionnaires. The findings indicate that, product knowledge, nutritional benefits, attitudes and social contacts positively affect WBMPs purchasing intention of residents in the greater area of Thessaloniki, as argued in the TPB model. The study reveals that the factors which are found to positively influence the intention to purchase WBMPs are similar to the ones that affect dairy milk purchase intention. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Using a unique sample of 141 Russian banks with less than a $10 million in assets, I trace performance, survival, recapitalization and growth patterns of these dwarf banks in response to the sharp increase in the minimum capital requirements. I find that dwarf banks are, on average, low-risk financial intermediaries that perform simple operations and have significantly higher survival rates in local markets with poor economic and banking services outreach characteristics. I also find that the average dwarf banks withstand the regulatory capital shock surprisingly well by securing fresh capital injection followed by a twofold asset size increase. The results of this study contribute to the literature on the relationship between the small bank business model, local banking markets characteristics and long-term viability. They also provide new evidence on the expected and unexpected outcomes of the too small to survive regulatory intervention into the banking market size structures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

One  typical in-depth case study of an R&D project in the oyster sector provide empirical evidence for cross-case comparison and structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings highlight the provision of R&D market information on estimated prices and quantities, end users' lower initial capabilities and higher discipline clarity, and the absence of industry associations undertaking marketing roles for farmers to enhance the impact of public R&D on small farmers' market sensing.","[Dentoni, Domenico] Management Studies Grp, NL-6707 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [English, Francis] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Schwarz, Daniela] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Dentoni, D (通讯作者)，Management Studies Grp, POB 8130,6700 EW,Hollandsweg 1, NL-6707 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",domenico.dentoni@wur.nl,,"Dentoni, Domenico/0000-0003-0637-0101",,,,,47,4,4,1,31,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Specialized literature stressed very little or no growth poles role in economic integration, although the development of national economies depend on connecting major urban centers in regional economic system, continental and global levels. Conversely, integration and globalization of economic, social, political, cultural, and moving towards a knowledge economy seem to be major factors in the transformation and restructuring of growth poles and urban systems dependent. If growth poles better realize their vocation integrating and implementing the innovative collaborative networks in a polycentric territory when they create conditions that allow people to make best use valences economic integration for developing areas. Also, growth poles using these integrative cooperation between areas and between small and medium-sized cities, both at internal borders and beyond the external frontiers of integrative area concerned. Grouping theories emitted mainly by economists and sociologists, in theory first, second and third generation, the study demonstrates basis on the assumption that economic growth poles stimulates and enhances economic integration in those areas, being with free economic zones, true core of economic integration.

The results of the analysis indicate that the workforce cluster (e. g. skills and experiences of the workforce) and the work management cluster (e. g. communication between parties) have greater impact than the financial management cluster (e. g. reworks) and logistics (e. g. delivery on time). This research focuses on the qualitative perspective of customers on productivity and perceived service quality. Although the process of translating qualitative opinions into quantitative data is a matter for debate, the result of this research, when compared to other quantitative studies, can be used to establish a strategy and an action plan for managing productivity and perceived service quality.

The first, shorter part of the paper provides a number of reflections of the existing methods of the examinations of intertemporal change of spatial differences of various socio-economic indicators, mainly the per capita income. The diverse growth rate of spatial income level of various spatial units (regions, countries, provinces, counties etc.) is a historical-statistical fact which refers to an unrepeatable, unique and particular historical situation. The descriptions of the convergence or divergence of various spatial units in various time periods contribute to our historical knowledge and help to evaluate the effectiveness of regional policy. The subject of the second, larger part of our study is the regional disparities in Hungary. Our approach is mainly historical-descriptive, but by the help of Hungarian case study many theoretical issues will be presented also. The regional comparison includes the economic development of Central Hungary, Central Transdanubia, Western Transdanubia, Southern Transdanubia, Northern Hungary, Northern Great Plain, Southern Great Plain. Our study primarily analyses the macrostructure of the seven Hungarian regions between 1990 and 2010. It includes the social factors of Hungary such as the population allocation, the labour market situation, income and living conditions and some general economic indicators. These indicators are all the essential indices for the analysis of the economy of a country. If we examine a longer period, we can observe the changes whether the inequalities have grown or decreased and how large the changes are. With the help of these indicators we have tried to prove that the regional inequalities have grown in the last twenty years. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

A new technique based on fuzzy logic and exhaustive search optimisation is used to combine vulnerability attributes with different weights into a single vulnerability index for network links, which may be used to measure the impact of disruptive events. The network vulnerability index is then calculated using two different aggregations: an aggregated vulnerability index based on physical characteristics and an aggregated vulnerability index based on operational characteristics. The former uses link physical properties such as its length and number of lanes, whilst the latter reflects aspects of the network flow. The application of the methodology on a synthetic network (based on Delft city, Netherlands) demonstrates the ability of the technique to estimate variation in the level of vulnerability under different scenarios. The method also allows exploration of how variation in demand and supply impact on overall network vulnerability, providing a new tool for decision makers to understand the dynamic nature of vulnerability under various events. The method could also be used as an evaluation tool to gauge the impact of particular policies on the level of vulnerability for the highway network and highlight weaknesses in the network.

The need to evaluate the amount of intellectual capital in an organization has grown in importance, because knowledge and innovation play an increasingly important within organizations and to meet development is essential for the organization to work with competent employees, representing the kernel of the organization. However, knowing the international organizations that work in the same field with the same types of equipment, it may be noted that although the net book value of organization is the same, but the market value of companies is much higher. What is the difference in value? Of course, the difference in value is the value of intellectual capital in organizations. This paper aims to evaluation of intellectual capital in organizations; intellectual capital is the most important resource in organizations today. The solution proposed for the evaluation of intellectual capital in this research is the evaluation platform of intellectual capital, designed specifically for the analysis of intellectual capital indicators, a qualitative and quantitative index system of intellectual capital, so as to provide a good tool for enterprises to manage their intellectual capital. The platform has been realized using the latest technologies in cloud system can be accessed from all devices, is a solution that reduces resource consumption associated with an evaluation of intellectual capital. The solution developed shows the basic functionality used in evaluating IC, easy to use and adaptable to any field. This makes the access and transfer of information to achieve fast and transparent. Platform developed has the principal role the identification of intellectual capital that exist within the organization, and then, based on identified intellectual capital, the computer system will provide to the manager and stakeholders report on intellectual capital and plus the value it bring to the organization.

This phenomenon has its roots in the frameworks being used to promote broadband growth and adoption among other things in the member states. The research argues that traditional broadband frameworks used across the world are economic in nature and quite similar in their design though they may be implemented differently. As a point of departure, this research submits that broadband frameworks may share similar structures but these structures need to be permeated and influenced by the uniqueness of the people group among which they intend be implemented. As a result, each framework needs to reflect a certain degree of this uniqueness both in structure and implementation. Using Socio-Technical Theory (STT) as a lens, this research aims to propose a framework for enhancing broadband growth and penetration in SADC. The research seeks to present an adaptive framework for broadband growth and penetration by integrating the major determinants in our reality space which are Society, Technology and their Environment. This Socio-technical environment is going to be studied in bid to establish the relationships that exist and should exist between the mentioned determinants. The resulting framework will articulate principles that should underpin and guide efforts of task teams and/or governments as they thrive to achieve broadband growth and penetration within the region. The research outcome, which is a socially constructed artefact; a framework for broadband growth and penetration in SADC will be tested using focus groups.","[Gorejena, Karikoga] North West Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Mahikeng, South Africa; Univ Limpopo, Dept Comp Sci, Polokwane, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; University of Limpopo,"Gorejena, K (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Mahikeng, South Africa.",,"Velempini, Mthulisi/AAU-3338-2020","Velempini, Mthulisi/0000-0003-1619-7429; Mavetera, Nehemiah/0000-0003-0420-1742",,,,,20,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,975,989,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300102,0

Agents delay abandonment attempting to signal quality. When a public common shock forces abandonment of a small fraction of projects irrespective of agents' quality, many agents abandon their projects strategically even if they are unaffected by the shock. Such blending in with the crowd effect creates an additional incentive to delay abandonment ahead of the shock, leading to accumulation of living dead projects, which further amplifies the shock. The potential for moderate public common shocks often improves agents' values. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These outcomes emerged from how the U.S. federal government financed three wars: the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Civil War. In the beginning, the U.S. government discriminated greatly in the returns it paid to different classes of creditors; but that pattern of discrimination diminished over time in ways that eventually rehabilitated the reputation of federal paper money as a store of value.

Moreover, we focus our attention particularly on effective and statutory corporate tax rates and their impact on FDI. On the one hand, our results suggest that there is no statistically significant effect of corporate taxes on FDI. On the other hand, we find a significant effect of labour costs, openness of the economy, firing costs, GDP per capita and public debt in the country.

In contrast to Lazear's assumptions, however, self-employed individuals do not just need more basic but also more expert skills than employees. Our results also provide rather limited support for the idea that human capital investment patterns differ between those who become self-employed and those ending up in paid employment.","[Lechmann, Daniel S.

However, resilience is interpreted in a variety of ways that can seem inconsistent and there is significant academic debate over definition of the term. This paper summarises the problems of resilience definitions, highlighting the key aspects where there are differences in interpretation. In light of these differences, a conceptual framework for examining multiple interpretations of resilience in DRM is presented. The paper suggests that a strict consensus on the definition of resilience is not practical or perhaps not even possible. Adopting the concept of resilience in a range of contexts inherently requires some flexibility in meaning. The proposed framework encourages an acceptance that there are multiple, valid interpretations of resilience. It is designed to promote cross-disciplinary understanding of resilience in DRM.

We use this approach for real one-minute high frequency data of the most traded currency pairs worldwide: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, USD/CHF, and USD/CAD. The STGP performance is compared with that of parametric and non-parametric models and validated by two formal empirical tests. We perform in-sample and out-of-sample comparisons between all models on the basis of forecast performance and investment return. Furthermore, our paper shows the relative strength of these models with respect to the actual trading profit generated by their forecasts. Empirical experiments suggest that the STGP forecasting technique significantly outperforms the traditional econometric models. We find evidence that the excess returns are both statistically and economically significant, even when appropriate transaction costs are taken into account. We also find evidence that HFT has a beneficial role in the price discovery process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the last twenty years, several catastrophe models have been developed for measuring economic losses. Nevertheless, due to the lack of data and the complexity of the problem, significant levels of uncertainties are still present. In fact, the factors that drive the economic recovery process before, during, and after natural disasters needs to be determined to select the optimal resources allocation and preparedness measures right after an extreme event. In most of the previous catastrophe models interdependencies between physical and nonphysical infrastructures are mostly neglected. This paper is proposing a model that describes the economic effects and characteristics that should be taken into account to predict the monetary impact of natural disasters, focusing in particular on the economic interdependencies of industries and lifelines. Different types of losses are considered using real economic data provided by surveys on natural disasters such as Northridge earthquake, Des Moines flood, etc. The data associated with the physical damages are obtained from HAZUS database. The Economic Resilience Index provided in the PEOPLES framework is adopted and applied to the specific case study of the San Francisco Bay Area. Sensitivity analysis is performed for each economic sector considered in the analysis. (C) 2014 The Authors.

As a quite new concept, promoted by the supporters of the new public management, good administration is a fundamental right of the European Union and, at the same time, a principle established by the European Court of Justice or a concept used in the administrative sciences. To characterize the way an administration works, good administration is an indicator of performance in public administration. For this reason, as a concept, it was developed by the doctrine. As a concept, good administration is a model of administration. As a principle, good administration outlines the boundaries inside which the public administration activity should take place, by establishing, on the one hand, a set of ethical rules of behaviour, and on the other hand, standards to be taken into account by the public administration activity. Thus, the public administration activity should be developed efficiently, effectively and economically. This article aims to analyse all the three aspects, which the good administration is found in - concept, principle, and right. In analysing the good administration, we shall use the experience of the European countries - Sweden, Great Britain, and other countries in the European Community.

However, these works did not differentiate between the different types of vulnerabilities and threats affecting an information system, and did not take into consideration the dynamic aspects of vulnerabilities and their potential variation over the period of investment. We propose in this work to use the utility theory to compute the optimal security investment, considering the variation of the vulnerabilities rate over time and the characteristics of each type of them. Predicting and forecasting of the evolution of vulnerabilities over time are conducted using regressions over a 14-year statistics available in the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD). A methodology is proposed to compute the total amount of optimal investment protecting against all types of vulnerabilities. An analysis of the different obtained expressions is conducted to assess the variation of the optimal investment and breach probability with respect to the investment horizon for the different types of vulnerabilities.","[Miaoui, Yosra; Boudriga, Noureddine] Univ Carthage, Commun Networks & Secur Res Lab, Carthage, Tunisia; [Abaoub, Ezzeddine] Univ Tunis El Manar, Fac Econ Sci & Management Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar,"Miaoui, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Carthage, Commun Networks & Secur Res Lab, Carthage, Tunisia.",yosra.miaoui@gmail.com; noure.boudriga2@gmail.com; abaoub.ezzeddine@planet.tn,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,632,650,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300069,0

Moreover, as the Vietnamese stock market operates in a market oriented economy originating from a central planned economy, we further investigate the origins of the largest owners, private vs. state ownership. Accordingly, the impact of ownership structure on information disclosure is only engaged with wholly private firms but not significant when the largest owner is related to the state.","[Pham Thi Bich Ngoc] Hoa Sen Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Quach Manh Hung] Univ Econ HCMC, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Hoa Sen University,,ngoc.phamthibich@hoasen.edu.vn; hung.qm@vnp.edu.vn,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,617,+,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200045,0

For example, Brazil and Russia are mainly based on huge reserves of mineral resources and speculations made in international markets. China has an advantage of cheap labor and resources at low prices. India is also based on low-cost workforce. And last but not least, all the BRICS countries, except Brazil, show very high rates of investment.

To help organizations adopt and institutionalize effective KM strategies, this study aims to highlight the effects of national and organizational cultural differences among operating environments of different firms, and to identify how these differences translate into varying knowledge management behaviors and use of E2.0 technologies for KM in firms. The study utilized a quantitative empirical research design to collect and analyze quantitative data from employees of various organizations in different countries and industries. A web-based survey data was collected from various countries including Canada, USA, and Saudi Arabia. Exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques were used to estimate a structural model among factors impacting the use of E2.0 technologies for KM. The key findings from this study validate the role of technology perceptions including ease of use, usefulness, media richness and technology sophistication in improving the use of enterprise 2.0 technologies in the workplace. Furthermore, the use of these technologies was shown to have a positive effect on the knowledge management environment of the organization. In terms of cultural differences, the knowledge management environment of firms was shown to be affected by long-term orientation of the national culture. This study offers recommendations for companies operating in global cultural contexts on how to approach KM strategies differently according to national culture and organizational environments of firms.","[Ruhi, Umar] Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [AlMohsen, Dina] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa,"Ruhi, U (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",umar.ruhi@uottawa.ca; dina.almohsen@gmail.com,,"Ruhi, Umar/0000-0002-8232-6121",,,,,47,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1567,1585,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300155,0

The easy access to finance is a vital problem for the firms because it affects their development but also their survival. Also, the existence and activity of the firms appears in an interdependent relationship with the economic situation of the country in which they operate. So, if the economy of the country is affected by the financial crisis then this interdependent relationship leads to problems related to firms financing. Through this paper we analyze 245 firms from seven countries in Central and Eastern Europe member of the European Union (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Hungary). Using an econometric model we observe the changes that appear in the financing decision of these firms under the impact of the financial crisis. The results show that the current financial crisis had a significant influence on the financing decision of the analyzed firms causing significant changes of their level of indebtedness, especially a decrease.","[Rusu, Valentina Diana] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,Valentinadiana.ig@gmail.com,"Rusu, Valentina/T-2252-2018",,,,,,11,0,0,0,10,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-020-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,391,397,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346751900055,0

Pitch events are events where representatives, usually founders, of young innovative companies, which are well known as startups at these days, present their idea or product in front of the audience consisting mostly of investors, journalists and people from other startups. The main purpose of these presentations is to find investors who would provide venture capital for financing of pitching companies. Startups in order to attract investors describe their product, its features, solutions it provides to its customers. These products are supposed to be innovative and presenting enterpreneurs should proove its potential. But there appears an issue how to convince investors that the product or the idea is sufficiently innovative in front of hundreds of people and do not risk that somebody from the audience would use this idea on his behalf. Because of their nature, it is not always possible to patent these ideas. Moreover these startups are often in the earliest stage and they have been dealing yet with this topic or their knowledge of intelectual capital protection is often very low at this stage. For examining this issue, we have executed qualitative research based on semi-structured interviews. Respondents were representatives of different groups from experts on intelectual capital, through pitch event organizers, emloyees of various institutions supporting entrepreneures (e.g. incubators) to participants who have already pitched or are going to pitch in near future their business ideas. The research was held in September 2013. Secondary analysis of literature was also selected as one of the research methods. Startup founders and pitch event organizers can find in this paper answers for questions: what are possible options for increasing the level of protection of the idea at pitch event, whether organizer can increase the protection of pitched ideas and whether pitching enterpreneurs consider the risk of presenting their ideas in front of the audience and how they try protect them.","[Snircova, Jana; Petras, Rastislav] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Mat Sci & Technol Trnava, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Mrva, Milos] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Slovak University of Technology Bratislava; Comenius University Bratislava,"Snircová, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Mat Sci & Technol Trnava, Bratislava, Slovakia.",jana.snircova@stuba.sk; rastislav.petras@stuba.sk; milos.mrva@fm.uniba.sk,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,233,239,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000029,0

This article aims to present a background of the Shanghai FTZ and some reflections on it. China's economic reconstruction has made a major impact on its port cities. Competitions between ports are gradually evolving into competitions between supply chains, with ports no longer considered as isolated links in the transport chain but rather as integral links in the supply chain. Ports are transitioning into fourth-generation ports with the establishment of logistics and value-added activities, which are developed in conjunction with local industrial and service businesses. In this trend, China's port cities can provide a wide range of value-added services and become centers of commodity flow, capital flow, and information flow. Specifically, the combined effects of driving the development of peripheral industries and actively coordinating the activities of relevant parties help regulate the operations of the entire supply chain to obtain potential value-added benefits. The implementation of the Shanghai FTZ will not only stimulate trade but will also bring increased shipping and finance opportunities to the city. With free trade as the new direction and focus of the country's economic initiatives, the Shanghai FTZ will hopefully lay the groundwork for a new round of reforms and restructuring of the Chinese economy.

Such disasters impose threats on populous coastal urban areas, and therefore, understanding and predicting human movements plays a critical role in disaster evacuation, response and relief. Despite its critical roles, limited research has focused on tropical cyclones and their influence on human mobility. Here, we studied how severe tropical storms could influence human mobility patterns in coastal urban populations using individuals' movement data collected from Twitter. We selected three significant tropical storms, including Hurricane Sandy, Typhoon Wipha, and Typhoon Haiyan. We analyzed the human movement data before, during, and after each event, comparing the perturbed movement data to movement data from steady states. We also used different statistical analysis approaches to quantify the strength and duration of human mobility perturbation. The results suggest that tropical cyclones can significantly perturb human movements by changing travel frequencies and displacement probability distributions; however, the nature-derived Levy Walk model still predominantly governs human mobility. Also, human mobility exhibits a surprisingly mild and brief perturbation for Hurricane Sandy and Typhoon Wipha, while the duration of disturbance was much longer for Typhoon Haiyan. Our finding that the Levy Walk model can still predict human mobility suggests that bio-inspired examinations of human mobility patterns may uncover solutions to improve disaster evacuation, response and relief plans.

Moreover high quality study requires high quality lecturing/teaching that creates an environment in which deep learning outcomes are made possible for students. The aim was to identify the characteristics of the academic teacher working at business schools, according to the expectations of Polish students from a 21st century perspective. A qualitative survey design was used in the form of a letter questionnaire. 144 second-year bachelor students of Gdansk University from the Faculty of Management were asked to list a maximum of five, most preferred characteristics, and to comment their answers. Finally, 109 students participated in the study, and 471 characteristics were proposed, analyzed and put into five categories, like: tangibles (T), reliability (Rel), responsiveness (Res), assurance (A) and empathy (E). Content analysis and Pareto-Lorenzo analysis was used and the most preferable characteristics were identified. The conclusions, proposals and recommendations were presented. The academic teacher has to be well prepared and teach in an interesting, innovative way with a use of modern techniques and methods. Very important is to apply not only the lecture-style methods but also on-the job teaching, project-based teaching, team work-based teaching, action teaching, experiential teaching, small groups teaching, case studies, simulations, e-teaching, and even volunteering teaching. Nor without the signifcance are coaching and mentoring and the features referring to the style of teaching, like charisma, creativity, passion, and engagement, which characterise good managers and business leaders.","[Wisniewska, Malgorzata] Univ Gdansk, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland; [Grudowski, Piotr] Gdansk Univ Technol, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Wisniewska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland.",wis@wzr.pl,"Grudowski, Piotr/N-3925-2013","Grudowski, Piotr/0000-0003-0283-7544; Wisniewska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5193-2153",,,,,17,0,0,0,7,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,431,438,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500040,0

The adjustment is an extension of the estimator proposed in Christensen et al. (2009). We relax the assumption that all intraday high (low) transaction prices are at the ask (bid) quote. Using data-based simulations we obtain estimates of the probability that a given intraday range is (upward or downward) biased or not, which we use for a more refined bias-adjustment of the realized range estimator. Both Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application involving a liquid and a relatively illiquid S82P500 constituent demonstrate that ex post measures and ex ante forecasts based on the heuristically adjusted realized range compare favorably to existing bias-adjusted (two time scales) realized range and (two time scales) realized variance estimators.

During the recent crisis, for the first time since the transition, foreign parent companies were frequently in a worse financial condition than their subsidiaries. This situation created a unique opportunity to study new aspects of market discipline exercised by non-financial depositors. Using a comprehensive data set, we find that the recent crisis did not change the sensitivity of deposit growth rates to accounting risk measures. We establish that depositors' actions were more strongly influenced by negative press rumors concerning parent companies than by fundamentals. The impact of rumors was especially perceptible when rumors turned out ex post to be founded. Additionally, we document that public aid announcements were primarily interpreted by depositors as confirmation of a parent company's financial distress. Our results indicate that depositors react rationally to sources of information other than financial statements; this discovery has policy implications, as depositor discipline is usually the only viable and universal source of market discipline for banks in emerging economies.

By applying quarterly data of Chinese listed companies, we further find the existence of balance sheet effect on the firm-level, which suggests that the changes in asset prices and risk affect the net asset value, and consequently influence corporate investment decisions. More importantly, the balance sheet effect appears to be much more significant after the implementation of new fair value accounting standards in 2007.

The model highlights the role of openness to trade and the dynamics of the terms of trade in the international transmission mechanism of banking sector shocks: spillovers from foreign banking sector shocks are greater the more open the home economy is to trade and the less the terms of trade respond to foreign shocks.","[Thoenissen, Christoph] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,,Gunes.Kamber@rbnz.govt.nz; Christoph.Thoenissen@vuw.ac.nz,,"Thoenissen, Christoph/0000-0002-7843-8219",,,,,24,17,17,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Observed refueling choices of alternative-fuel drivers in Southern California,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Station; Infrastructure; Convenience; Deviation; Location; Alternative fuel vehicle,HYDROGEN; VEHICLE; TRANSPORTATION; TRANSITION; MODEL,"Limited refueling infrastructure is an oft-cited barrier to alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) adoption, but empirical data on AFV driver refueling behavior are rare. To address this need, we surveyed 259 drivers of compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles in Southern California at five stations across the metropolitan area. The key survey questions concerned the stops immediately before and after refueling and the driver's home location. Using GIS, we analyze the least travel-time routes and the station chosen to provide insight into what drivers consider to be their most convenient refueling location. Specifically, we focus on whether they select stations nearest to home or on routes that require the least deviation. When faced with a choice between the two that is, when no station satisfies both criteria-we found that ten times as many CNG drivers selected the station most on their way between their origin and destination than chose the station closest to their home. This finding supports the notion that optimal location models for planning early AFV refueling infrastructures should maximize convenience by serving the routes that drivers use frequently rather than their home locations, and that locations near high-volume roads may be ideal candidates for early station sites.

The resulting estimator, which is represented as a specific quadratic form of returns, is simple and their properties have been investigated by Kunitomo and Sato (2008a, 2008b, 2010, 2011). We show that the SIML estimator has reasonable asymptotic properties; it is consistent and it has the asymptotic normality when the sample size is large and the integrated volatility is deterministic under general conditions including some non-Gaussian and volatility models. Based on simulations, we find that the SIML estimator has reasonable finite sample properties and it would be useful for practice. The SIML estimator has the asymptotic robustness properties in the sense it is consistent when the noise terms are weakly dependent and they are endogenously correlated with the efficient market price process. We illustrate the use of SIML by analyzing Nikkei-225 futures, which are the derivatives of the major stock index in Japan. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Firstly, an indicator defined as passenger attraction is introduced to describe the attraction level of a transit node to passengers. A selection model based on passenger attraction is built to choose several candidate nodes from all the transit nodes. Secondly, a mathematical model, aiming at maximizing served populations per construction cost, is proposed to optimize multi-hub location based on the selected candidate nodes. At last, the data of Dalian city, China is used for testing the validity of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the candidate node selection model according to passenger attraction can provide an appropriate searching space for hub location optimization and the selected candidate nodes can almost cover all the passenger flow collection and distribution centers in the urban area of Dalian. Furthermore, the optimized hub location in the case study is consistent with the practice situation in Dalian. This indicates that the proposed two-phase optimization approach is a competitive method for transit hub location. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Accounting for differences in size and risk and comparing only firms in the same industry, we find that stockholder-owned firms do not outperform nonprofit firms.

The term born local, as opposed to born global, describes how new ventures are created from knowledge spillovers and other resources in a geographically bounded environment. The theory suggests that the greater the number of value chain activities and the greater the number of countries involved, the more likely that the new venture will pursue the intermediated mode of internationalization. We suggest that new ventures frequently specialize and use existing MNEs as conduits for international expansion; however the greater the perceived ex-post costs of protecting intellectual property, transaction costs, and extraction costs related to hold-up, agency, and monopoly rents, the more likely the new venture will pursue a direct mode of internationalization.","[Acs, Zoltan J.] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Acs, Zoltan J.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, London, England; [Terjesen, Siri] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Dept Management & Entrepreneurship, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",George Mason University; Imperial College London; Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington,"Terjesen, S (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Dept Management & Entrepreneurship, 1309 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",zacs@gmu.edu; terjesen@indiana.edu,"acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013",,,,,,52,33,37,4,82,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using the VAR-based spillover index approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and impulse response analyses, we find that: (i) on average, BYS shocks tend to increase future BYS, and are related to news announcements and policy changes; (ii) BYS spillovers between Euro zone countries are highly intertwined, however, BYS shocks from the periphery have, on average, three times the destabilizing force on other countries than shocks coming from the core. (iii) The within-effect of BYS spillovers is of greater magnitude within the periphery than that within the core; (iv) The between-effect (core vs periphery) of BYS spillovers suggests directional spillovers of greater magnitude from the periphery to the Euro zone core than vice versa. (v) Finally, joint shocks in the periphery and the core reveal decoupling effects between these two groups of countries. Overall, our findings highlight the increased vulnerability of the Euro zone from the destabilizing shocks originating mostly from the Euro zone countries in the periphery and to a lesser extent from the Euro zone core.

This paper examines the hypothesis that international wars accelerated democratization by fostering political inclusion. Employing survival analysis, I find that during the 20th century, nations engaging in external conflict were more than twice as likely to extend the franchise to women in the post-conflict period, even after controlling for other commonly cited determinants of suffrage adoption. I explore several potential mechanisms for this association and find evidence consistent with stories which connect war with increased national unity, ideological fervor, and international posturing. Finally, examining conflict-induced changes in sex ratios and female labor force participation suggests that the underlying determinants of suffrage expansion at the national and sub-national level differ.

We hypothesize that individual investors' local bias is not limited to the domestic sphere but instead also determines their international investment decisions. Our results confirm the presence of a cross-border local bias. Specifically, we show (i) that the stockholdings of individual investors living within regional proximity to a foreign country display a significantly lower foreign investment bias towards investment opportunities in that country and (ii) that this drop in foreign investment bias levels is disproportionately driven by investments in regionally close neighbor-country companies. The impact of cross-border local bias on investors' bilateral foreign equity investments is economically significant and holds even after controlling for previously identified explanations of international asset allocation.

It finds that in the four years since the tax was introduced, British Columbia's per capita consumption of fuels subject to the tax has declined by 19 percent compared to the rest of Canada. At the same time, its economy has kept pace with the rest of Canada. British Columbia's experience mirrors the European experience with carbon tax shifting and should inform the federal debate on climate change policy.","[Elgie, Stewart; McClay, Jessica] Univ Ottawa, Fac Law, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Elgie, Stewart] Inst Environm, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Elgie, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Fac Law, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,,,,,,19,51,56,7,60,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

In contrast to the popular two-pass regression method, this approach relies on a novel GMM-type estimation procedure that uses only a single cross-section of return observations to obtain consistent estimates. Also, it enables a comparison of idiosyncratic volatility premia estimated using stock returns with different holding periods. The approach is empirically illustrated by applying it to daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual US stock return data over the course of 2000-2011. The results suggest that the idiosyncratic volatility premium tends to be positive on daily return data, but negative on monthly, quarterly, and annual data. They also indicate the presence of a January effect. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Benefits resulting from higher prices of export goods as well as losses incurred from greater import competition are considered. First, relating NAFTA cuts in trade restrictions to border prices of Mexican exports and imports, it is found that NAFTA-induced tariff reductions decreased the border price of corn, Mexico's main agricultural import, and increased the border prices of tomatoes and melons, Mexico's main agricultural exports. Then, it is shown that the rise in fruit and vegetable prices benefited small farmers more than large farmers; while the drop in corn prices hurt large farmers more. Finally, the results from the regional-level analysis suggests that the effects are stronger in the central states than in the northern and southern states.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Prina, S (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, 11119 Bellflower Rd,Room 273, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",silvia.prina@case.edu,"Prina, Silvia/HLX-2155-2023",,,,,,21,6,8,1,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

However, recent surveys suggest that company hedging can be substantially influenced by the accounting for financial instruments. In this study, we illustrate not only why but also how the accounting regulations may affect hedging behavior. We find that under mark-to-market accounting, most firms concerned with earnings smoothness adopt myopic hedging strategies relative to the benchmark, cash flow hedging. The specific influence of the accounting regulations depends on market and firm-specific characteristics, but, in general, the firms dramatically reduce the extent of hedging addressing price risk in future accounting periods. We illustrate that the change in hedging behavior significantly dampens the increase in earnings volatility stemming from fair value accounting of derivatives. However, the adjusted hedging strategies may substantially increase the firms' cash flow volatility.","[Beisland, Leif Atle; Frestad, Dennis] Univ Agder, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway",University of Agder,"Beisland, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, POB 422, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway.",leif.a.beisland@uia.no,,,,,,,46,6,6,0,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Such a threshold, when strictly positive, allows organic producers to keep the organic label in case of a small GM contamination. However, it may bring discredit on the organic agriculture which can no more be understood as GMO-free. The European Commission in its recommendation 2003/556/CE proposes that GM-producers-should bear the cost of the measures decided to limit the dissemination of the GM gene the so-called newcomer principle. European countries are however free to adopt such a principle and can proceed differently. This article presents an economic analysis of the determination of the optimal GMO threshold maximizing society's wellbeing when the newcomer principle is implemented and when it is not. This optimal GMO threshold in both cases is decided by an impartial regulator facing heterogeneous consumers, and is intended to ensure the coexistence between GM and organic agricultures, taking into account of the potential discredit it implies on organic agriculture and the flexibility it allows for the preservation of the organic label. We first establish the conditions for coexistence.

This article analyzes the channels of default risk transmission within the EU countries using the information content in the sovereign Credit Default Swap (CDS) market. We proceed in two directions. First, we test the existence of cross-border volatility effects between the central and the peripheral EU countries. Second, we explore the effect of distressed economies on the default and risk premium constituents of sovereign default swaps. We show a significant volatility spillover from distressed to central European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) economies. This causality pattern leads to a significant impact on the default swap risk premia. On average, the risk premium accounts for approximately 42% of central EMU spreads and 56% of the spreads for those countries outside of the EMU. The peripheral risk also affects the default component of central economies, although its impact is lower. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This means that countries with higher shadow economic activity contribute less than they should contribute in a system based on actual GDP and therefore could reduce their incentive to fight against such activities. In this paper we investigate if the EU financing system really has an influence on the intensity with which governments in EU member states fight against shadow economic activity. We find that the EU net contributors significantly fight more intensively against shadow economic activity while EU net receivers fight less. As a result, shadow economic activity is higher in net receiver and lower in net contributor countries than it were in comparison with a scenario of nationally balanced EU funding. Quantitatively and averaged over the time period 2001-2007, the diagnosed effect amounts to a stimulation of hidden economic activity by almost 10% for particular economies.","[Herwartz, Helmut] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, E-43204 Reus, Spain",University of Gottingen; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Theilen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Av Univ 1, E-43204 Reus, Spain.",bernd.theilen@urv.net,"Theilen, Bernd/Z-1589-2019","Theilen, Bernd/0000-0001-7141-2780",,,,,36,2,2,0,15,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The small existing empirical microeconomic literature has found evidence both for and against poverty traps. Using household panel data from rural Pakistan and Ethiopia, this article examines whether these different results are likely driven by differences in estimation methods or whether they reflect actual differences across settings. It applies the estimation methods from the existing literature to the same two datasets and also proposes a novel semiparametric panel data estimator that combines the advantages of the previous fully parametric and nonparametric approaches. The results suggest that absent any dynamic poverty trap thresholds the effect of using different estimation methods is secondary, having a small influence on the estimated long-term level of household well-being but not the identification of multiple dynamic welfare equilibria and associated dynamic poverty thresholds. Households in rural Pakistan and Ethiopia seem to be stuck in a static, structural-type poverty trap facing an expected level of long-term well-being that places them squarely in poverty.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Naschold, F (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",fnaschol@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,27,23,28,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Our survey reveals that about a quarter of SMEs self-report high levels of these ethics-focused dynamic capabilities. We use hierarchical OLS to analyze the survey data to find that the general effect of these capabilities is positive on an SME's ethical performance, and that the performance effects are contingent on an SME's degree of entrepreneurial orientation and sensitivity to changes in the business context. The main implication is that the extent of heterogeneity in types, roles, and performance effects of 'higher-than-operations-level' capabilities is likely underestimated in current dynamic capabilities theory and application.","Univ Missouri, Inst Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Henry W Bloch Sch Management, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Arend, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Inst Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Henry W Bloch Sch Management, 5110 Cherry St 208 Bloch Sch, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",arendr@umkc.edu,,,,,,,100,47,67,2,150,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Under the unit-subsidy policy, in contrast to the results of the short-run analysis with exogenous entry, the optimal subsidy level in a mixed market is not higher than that in a private market, and privatization affects welfare. Under the entry-license-tax policy, the optimal entry-tax level in a mixed market is lower than that in a private market. Finally, we show that the privatization neutrality theorem holds under a two-part tax-subsidy policy: the first-best outcome is achieved in both mixed and private markets, and the optimal tax-subsidy rate is the same across the two regimes.","[Cato, Susumu] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan; [Matsumura, Toshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",Tokyo Metropolitan University; University of Tokyo,"Cato, S (通讯作者)，Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan.",susumu.cato@gmail.com; matsumur@iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Matsumura, Toshihiro/F-3997-2010","Matsumura, Toshihiro/0000-0003-0572-6516","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530248, 22243022, 23730185, 22530175, 23330099] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,63,26,26,1,15,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2013,69.0,2,,,,,215,240,,10.1628/001522113X666944,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,170FH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320835300005,0

Evidence from State and Local-Level Mandates,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PHYSICIAN FEES; HEALTH-CARE; PROGRAMS; ACCESS; IMPACT; TRENDS,"From 1991 to 2009, the fraction of Medicaid recipients enrolled in HMOs and other forms of Medicaid managed care (MMC) increased from 11 percent to 71 percent. This increase was largely driven by state and local mandates that required most Medicaid recipients to enroll in an MMC plan. Theoretically, it is ambiguous whether the shift from fee-for-service into managed care would lead to an increase or a reduction in Medicaid spending. This paper investigates this effect using a data set on state- and local-level MMC mandates and detailed data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on state Medicaid expenditures. The findings suggest that shifting Medicaid recipients from fee-for-service into MMC did not on average reduce Medicaid spending. If anything, our results suggest that the shift to MMC increased Medicaid spending and that this effect was especially present for risk-based HMOs. However, the effects of the shift to MMC on Medicaid spending varied significantly across states as a function of the generosity of the state's baseline Medicaid provider reimbursement rates.

Yet ever since the birth of the euro, members have postponed painful adjustment. Wishful thinking has played an important role in this failure. We find that governments' forecasts are biased in the optimistic direction, especially during booms. Eurozone governments are especially over-optimistic when the budget deficit is over the 3 % of GDP ceiling at the time the forecasts are made. Those exceeding this cap systematically but falsely forecast a rapid future improvement. The new fiscal compact among the euro countries is supposed to make budget rules more binding by putting them into laws and constitutions at the national level. But biased forecasts can defeat budget rules. What is the record in Europe with national rules? The bias is less among eurozone countries that have adopted certain rules at the national level, particularly creating an independent fiscal institution that provides independent forecasts.","[Frankel, Jeffrey; Schreger, Jesse] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Frankel, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jeffrey_frankel@harvard.edu,,,,,,,32,63,66,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We calculate the ex ante cost of equity capital for constituent companies of the S&P/ASX 200 Index. The bid-ask spread of the companies is decomposed to find the adverse selection component, which is used to measure the information asymmetry of the company. We control for factors generally known to influence the required return on equity, such as sector, beta, firm size, book-to-market, analyst coverage and analyst earnings forecast dispersion. This study documents a significant and positive relation between information asymmetry and ex ante investor's required rate of return. We also find that earnings forecast dispersion increases ex ante cost of equity capital, while analyst coverage tends to decrease the return required by investors. This is consistent with the expectation that cost of capital increases with higher levels of information uncertainty and asymmetry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Spending reversals are incorporated as a policy option available to policy-makers for stabilizing public debt. Results show that a spending reversal rule can be welfare-improving and that there exists an optimal degree of spending reversal. An optimal spending reversal rule can lower both the tax rate volatility and interest rate volatility compared with the case without the reversal rule. Results also suggest that, as friction in foreign borrowing becomes greater (because of a higher country-specific interest rate premium), the welfare benefit of the reversal rule will be increasingly important.

In contrast, this paper examines how external account imbalances and real long term interest rates are determined in smaller open economies. It first derives the proposition that external imbalances and long term interest rates move together whenever saving-investment shocks are predominantly domestically sourced, but move oppositely when saving-investment shocks mainly emanate abroad. It then shows that in the case of Australia, an Asia-Pacific economy that has borrowed heavily from abroad since the mid 1980's, rising net capital inflow has had a statistically significant negative impact on domestic real interest rates. This suggests that over that time net international lending rather than net foreign borrowing was mainly responsible for the variation in its external imbalance and real interest rates.

The conducted research is descriptive and its main focus is on the study of the field literature, aiming at aspects such as identifying the historic evolution of the electric energy and natural gas markets in Romania, the behaviour of companies operating on these markets and their impact on the consumers' rights. The research methodology has been established starting from a synthetic analysis of the most recent published studies on the observation of the European policy in the energy field and EU's efforts to build up a single, competitive market, including two sectors that not long ago were dominated by monopolistic national actors: electric energy and gas. The research methods imply study monitoring and reports as well as forecast analyses regarding the capacity of the Three Energy Packages, once implemented, to support the creation of competitive, transparent and uniformly regulated energy markets within the EU countries, in order to ensure the protection of the consumers of these general interest services. The research has a dual approach, combining quantitative and qualitative elements as well as conducting the analysis of the correlations between the efforts and effects registered in the field of consumer protection. The first section of the article offers conceptual clarifications regarding both the European policy in the energy field and the consumers of general economic services. The second section gives an insight into the energy and gas markets in Romania as well as the main obstacles in the way of their liberalization. The third section presents the efforts made with respect to consumer protection in the field of energy, analyzing the European Directives' fundamental ideas regarding the protection of consumers and the phase of their embedment into our legislation in order to achieve a full legislative harmonization.","[Pirvu, Ramona; Badircea, Roxana] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Pîrvu, R (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania.",pirvu_ramona@yahoo.com,"PIRVU, RAMONA/K-2221-2019; Bădîrcea, Roxana/IZE-4389-2023; Bădîrcea, Roxana/AAK-4487-2021","PIRVU, RAMONA/0000-0002-6973-6521;",,,,,14,5,5,0,13,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2013,15.0,34,,,,,385,399,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,156XV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319858100007,0

Recent research suggests that consumers may desire and obtain certain outcomes from investments that have not been anticipated in mainstream finance and economics literature. These benefits might be hedonistic or altruistic, self-expressive or emotional and experiential. Yet, while an increasing amount of attention has been paid to this topic, little effort has been made to develop an appropriate measurement scale for the subjective consumer perceptions of investments. To address this gap in the literature, this study introduces the concept of Perceived Investment Value (Ply), and develops and validates a measurement scale for the concept. The ultimate 18-item PIV scale parsimoniously represents six Perceived Investment Value dimensions: Economic value Monetary savings; Economic value Efficiency; Functional value Convenience; Emotional value Emotions and Experiences; Symbolic value Altruism; and Symbolic value Esteem. The final measurement scale demonstrates acceptable reliability and validity. Implications related to the developed scale are discussed in terms of their potential to inform a future research agenda.

We use a firm-level panel containing production data together with detailed information on the geographic location of employment, covering a high proportion of the New Zealand economy. We are able to control for heterogeneity along firm, region, and industry dimensions, and to estimate separate agglomeration elasticities across industries and regions. Sorting leads to upward biased elasticity estimates but using firm fixed effects can lead to downward bias due to the highly persistent nature of agglomeration variables. Our preferred estimates control for sorting across regions and industries. Overall, we find a positive agglomeration elasticity of 0.066. Within industries and, to a lesser extent within regions, there is pronounced variation in the strength of agglomeration effects, and evidence of decreasing returns to agglomeration. High density areas attract firms that benefit most from agglomeration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We use these data to evaluate the underlying assumptions and predictions of models of boards of directors. These models generally fall into two categories: managerial models that assume boards play a direct role in managing the firm, and supervisory models that assume that boards monitor top management but do not make business decisions themselves. Consistent with the supervisory models, our minutes-based data suggest that boards spend most of their time monitoring management: approximately two-thirds of the issues boards discussed were of a supervisory nature, they were presented with only a single option in 99% of the issues discussed, and they disagreed with the CEO only 2.5% of the time. Nevertheless, at times boards do play a managerial role: Boards requested to receive further information or an update for 8% of the issues discussed, and they took an initiative with respect to 8.1% of them.

Flows are triggered by changes in fund managers' efficiency, which investors either observe directly or infer from past performance. Momentum arises if flows exhibit inertia, and because rational prices underreact to expected future flows. Reversal arises because flows push prices away from fundamental values. Besides momentum and reversal, flows generate comovement, lead-lag effects, and amplification, with these being larger for high idiosyncratic risk assets. A calibration of our model using evidence on mutual fund returns and flows generates sizeable Sharpe ratios for momentum and value strategies.","[Vayanos, Dimitri; Woolley, Paul] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Vayanos, Dimitri] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Vayanos, D (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Finance OLD 3 41, London WC2A 2AE, England.",d.vayanos@lse.ac.uk,"Vayanos, Dimitri/AAW-9373-2021","Vayanos, Dimitri/0000-0002-0944-4914",,,,,48,124,163,3,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We show that extreme reliance on short-term financing may be the outcome of a maturity rat race: a borrower may have an incentive to shorten the maturity of an individual creditor's debt contract because this dilutes other creditors. In response, other creditors opt for shorter maturity contracts as well. This dynamic toward short maturities is present whenever interim information is mostly about the probability of default rather than the recovery in default. For borrowers that cannot commit to a maturity structure, equilibrium financing is inefficiently short-term.","[Brunnermeier, Markus K.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Brunnermeier, Markus K.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Oehmke, Martin] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,"Brunnermeier, MK (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,"Brunnermeier, Markus K/C-4473-2012",,,,,,33,123,144,2,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Based on our analysis of 206 VC-backed UK start-ups, we find that both trade sale experience of the VC and learning from syndicate partners with trade sale experience significantly increase the trade sale hazard. The routines and procedures learned from experienced syndicate partners complement experience accumulated through trial and error.

A large opportunity to reduce CO2 emissions is identified by thus decreasing 'drop off and pick up' users. The total cost of the damage caused by CO2 produced by passengers' surface access is estimated to be approximately 10.9 pound million at 2009 prices.

Such an analysis is relevant for both decision makers within logistics firms and regional policy makers, as co-located logistics establishments as well as society as a whole can benefit from co-location of logistics establishments. For this analysis, longitudinal empirical data on logistics establishments in a Dutch province are used. Six general conclusions are drawn on spatial concentration and location decisions of logistic firms. First, logistics employment spatially concentrates in particular areas, called Absolute and Relative Concentration areas (AREC areas). Second, larger logistics establishments locate relatively often in AREC areas. Third, logistics establishments that relocate within the province locate relatively more in AREC areas than in other areas, while new logistics establishments do not. Fourth, logistics establishments from AREC areas are more likely to relocate in AREC areas than establishments from non-AREC areas. Hence, experience matters in location decisions of logistics firms. Fifth, transport establishments locate relatively often in emerging AREC areas. Finally, data on employment growth show that intermodal container terminals attract logistics employment, in their direct vicinity as well as on a municipal level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicate, first, that omitting bilateral tariff rates presents no serious issue related to the omitted variable bias because coefficients for the usual gravity variables remain unchanged before and after their inclusion. Second, the widely used dummy variable for regional trade agreements is not a statistical substitute for tariff rates because the coefficient for bilateral tariff rates remains significant even if it is included.

Theory predicts that high marginal tax rates incentivize investors to realize taxable losses. In contrast, the propensity to realize taxable short-term capital gains decreases in the marginal tax rate. Using two stratified 10% random samples of all German income tax declarations filed in 2001 and 2004, the paper provides robust evidence for this prediction. The marginal tax rate has a significant and positive (negative) effect on the investor's propensity to realize capital losses (gains).","WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, D-56179 Vallender, Germany",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Jacob, M (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallender, Germany.",martin.jacob@whu.edu,,"Jacob, Martin/0000-0003-0020-4882",,,,,32,3,4,2,18,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2013,69.0,1,,,,,30,56,,10.1628/001522113X663460,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,115VH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316839500002,0

A positive vacancy rate provides landlords an incentive to invest in maintenance because if they fail to do so, some tenants will leave and the unit will sit vacant for a finite period of time. The resulting foregone rent will penalize landlords' failure to maintain. Habitability laws, which have been enacted by states since the 1960s, provide a non-market penalty which lessens the need for market enforcement. Variation in these laws by state offers an opportunity to test the theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, female farmers typically have lower output per unit of land and are much less likely to be active in commercial farming than their male counterparts. These gender differences in land productivity and participation between male and female farmers are due to gender differences in access to inputs, resources, and services. In this paper, we review the evidence on productivity differences and access to resources. We discuss some of the reasons for these differences, such as differences in property rights, education, control over resources (e.g., land), access to inputs and services (e.g., fertilizer, extension, and credit), and social norms. Although women are less active in commercial farming and are largely excluded from contract farming, they often provide the bulk of wage labor in the nontraditional export sector. In general, gender gaps do not appear to fall systematically with growth, and they appear to rise with GDP per capita and with greater access to resources and inputs. Active policies that support womens access and participation, not just greater overall access, are essential if these gaps are to be closed. The gains in terms of greater productivity of land and overall production are likely to be large.","[Goldstein, Markus] World Bank, Africa Reg Gender Practice & Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC USA; [Rosas, Nina] World Bank, World Dev Report 2012, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,,andre.croppenstedt@fao.org,,,,,,,72,89,104,0,93,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Procyclicality occurs when financial institutions actively manage their balance sheets and use non-equity funding to finance change in assets. Since wholesale funding allows financial institutions to adjust their financial leverage quickly, we investigate whether financial institutions that rely more on wholesale funding (traditional deposit funding) show a higher (lower) degree of leverage procyclicality. Using balance sheet data for financial institutions of 49 countries, this study identifies a positive link between assets growth and leverage growth. In addition, we show that the positive impact of wholesale funding on procyclicality varies across market condition and national risk attitude. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We first develop a real-options-based structural model in a homogeneous oligopoly and show that credit spreads are positively related to the number of firms in an industry. The disparity of firm size in an industry is relevant to both product market competition and credit risk, and we therefore extend the model to an asymmetric duopoly case. In particular, we demonstrate that credit spreads of relatively small (large) firms within an industry are positively (negatively) related to Herfindahl-Hirschman index, and the relative firm size in an industry is an important determinant of credit risk. The models' implications are empirically scrutinized by a reduced-form hazard model and generally supported. By performing out-of-sample analyses, the results demonstrate that firm size together with the interaction terms between intra-industry firm size dummies and competition intensity can effectively predict default.

A central notion in this respect is lock-in. Economic geographers have recently started to reconsider the deterministic perspective on lock-in and developed the concept of institutional plasticity. Such plasticity is the result of actions of actors to purposefully 'recombine and convert or reinterpret institutions for their new objectives or transfer institutions to different contexts' (Strambach, 2010). This concept is applied to seaports, where so far, path dependence and lock-in have not been studied in detail. Our main conclusion is that a process of institutional stretching takes place when port authorities see a need to develop new capabilities and activities. In this process new layers are added to existing arrangements, gradually leading to a formalised governance reform but without breaking out of the existing path of development. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering these asymmetries simultaneously yields large stable coalitions, also without the option of transfers between signatories. However, these large stable coalitions are only possible if they include countries that have relatively high marginal benefits and a relatively low marginal environmental damage. This type of countries hardly contributes to the common good and the gains of cooperation from including this type of countries in the stable coalition are small. This confirms a persistent result in this literature that large stable coalitions usually go hand in hand with low gains of cooperation. Without the option of transfers it is always better to have a small stable coalition with countries that matter than a large stable coalition with countries that do not matter. Only with transfers might a large stable coalition be able to perform better.","[Pavlova, Yulia] MTT Agrifood Res, Helsinki, Finland; [De Zeeuw, Aart] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [De Zeeuw, Aart] Tilburg Univ, TSC, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Pavlova, Y (通讯作者)，MTT Agrifood Res, Helsinki, Finland.",yulia.pavlova@mtt.fi; a.j.dezeeuw@uvt.nl,,,,,,,15,42,44,2,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The South African component focused on Limpopo province, and investigated land reform processes, trajectories of change and outcomes in thirteen detailed case studies. This paper summarizes some of the main findings from the South African study, and briefly compares them with findings from Namibia and Zimbabwe. The paper argues that a fundamental problem affecting land reform in both South Africa and Namibia is the uncritical application of the Large-Scale Commercial Farming (LSCF) model, which has led to unworkable project design and/or projects that are irrelevant to the circumstances of the rural poor.

Since the global economic and financial crisis began in 2009, the problems the shipping industry faces have multiplied, generating a high volatility of prices. With the global expansion of the maritime sector, marine insurance is on the forefront nowadays, more than ever before. As the marine insurance premiums vary according to the value of insured assets and their number, the marine insurance market can be examined through the forecast of ships price in the context of deteriorating economic conditions.","[Batrinca, Ghiorghe] Constanta Maritime Univ, Constanta, Romania; [Burca, Ana-Maria] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Constanta Maritime University; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Batrînca, G (通讯作者)，Constanta Maritime Univ, Constanta, Romania.",gbatrinca@imc.ro; burca.anamaria@yahoo.com,"Batrinca, Ghiorghe/IRZ-8224-2023; Batrinca, Ghiorghe/A-1866-2014","Batrinca, Ghiorghe/0000-0002-8216-4855",,,,,16,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,574,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100061,0

In this paper we empirically investigate the link between the macroeconomic fundamentals and sovereign credit risk for particular countries in the Euro-zone, namely: France, Germany, Spain and Portugal. The studied sample was affected by disadvantageous economic conditions. Thus, the identification of credit risk determinants is necessary for a better understanding of financial crisis. Using Autoregressive Distributed Lag Modeling, we didn't retain the same macroeconomic factors to explain the risk of default for the selected countries. The retained models, in addition to explaining to which extent credit risk reacts to the changes of the explanatory variables, serve as tools to stress testing. The results, reinforced by back tests, indicate that the creditworthiness of the studied entities depends largely on macroeconomic fundamentals with various elasticities that require a different economic policy for each country. Furthermore, the assessment of the results shows that an increase in debt has opposite effects on the sovereign credit risk which depend on the country's economic situation. Finally, the study finds that the Treasury Bond Yield follows a mean-reverting process with dissimilar speed of return for each country.","[Ben Yahya, Amina] Univ Paris 13, CEPN Econ Ctr, Paris North Univ, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",Universite Paris 13,,benyahyaamina@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,99,108,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100011,0

This paper develops a dynamic stochastic model to analyze the macroeconomic effects of investing resource revenues, making explicit the role of public investment inefficiency, absorptive capacity constraints, Dutch disease, and financing needs to sustain capital. Revenue exhaustibility raises medium-term issues of how to sustain capital built during a windfall, while revenue volatility raises short-term concerns about macroeconomic instability. Using the model, country applications show how combining public investment with a resource fund a sustainable investing approach can address the problems associated with exhaustibility and volatility. The applications also demonstrate how the model can be used to determine the appropriate magnitude of the investment scaling-up (accounting for the financing needs to sustain capital) and the adequate size of a stabilization fund (buffer).

We propose a new specification to study market timing. Instead of considering an average market exposure for mutual funds, we allow mutual fund market betas to follow a random walk in the absence of market timing ability. As a consequence, we capture market exposure dynamics which is really due to manager market timing skills while allowing dynamics to come from other sources than market timing. We find that on average 6% of mutual funds display return market timing abilities while this percentage amounts to respectively 13% and 14% for volatility and liquidity market timing. We also analyze market timing by investment strategies and for surviving and dead funds. Dead funds exhibit lower volatility and liquidity timing skills than live funds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Comparing the precedence can be analyzed otherwise incomparable value. This principle is applicable to economic systems. You can determine the effects of changes in parameters of the area.

This often leads to theories and models which establish a causal link between human capital and economic performance. However, we should ask whether there is really a direct link between human capital and economic performance or whether the economic structure is not the real basis which the differences are based on. Especially in relation to current economic downturn in many countries it seems that the human capital alone is not a guarantee of economic stability and growth and it is necessary to have human capital which is related to the economic structure - it does not work the other way round.

The samples are Malaysian listed non-real estate companies that conducted D&A during the 2008 financial crisis. Event study methodology is used to determine AR surrounding D&A announcements within (-10day, +10day) event window. Results show that both D&A announcements bring insignificant AR on and near the announcement date (-1 to +1). Prior to announcement, divesting (acquiring) companies incur negative (positive) AR, indicating that any leakage of information on divestiture (acquisition) is not favored (favored) by the market. Post-announcement results show that divesting companies continued to experience negative ARs even though majority of such companies divested at premium prices. However, acquiring companies experience significant and negative post-announcement AR. This is plausibly due to the majority of acquiring companies paid a premium above valuation for their acquisitions. In summary, the market frowns upon divestitures in general and acquisitions of real estate assets above their valuations during economic recessions.","[Eng, Annie Wong Ping; Mei, Janice Lee Yim; Muthuveerappan, Chitrakala] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Ctr Real Estate Studies, Fac Geoinformat Real Estate, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,,janicelee@utm.my,,"lee, ym/0000-0002-2779-1311; Muthuveerappan, Chitrakala/0000-0003-4460-1193",,,,,27,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,990,1003,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200096,0

In this paper we model this substitution process by incorporating both, a non-renewable resource and a renewable resource, which can both serve for producing transport fuels, into a conventional Romer-type endogenous growth model. Moreover, as a prominent feature of the modeling we also capture the fact that biofuels production may compete with food production for arable land. The main results of the paper, the Keynes-Ramsey rule, the modified Hotelling rules for the renewable and non-renewable resource, and the fuel versus food trade-off are discussed in some detail.

With securitization contracts optimally designed, we find securitization improves the intermediary's screening incentives. Furthermore, the equilibrium effort level and the surplus converge to their first best levels with sufficiently many assets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, the aim of our research is to analyse the changes occurred in the productivity of the banks operating in Romania, a new European Union member country. In order to achieve this we have chosen a sample of 25 commercial banks that together own over 90% of the total banking assets from Romania, the analysed period being 2003-2010. We employed a two stage approach, estimating in the first stage the efficiency scores for the banks from our sample using a non-parametric approach, namely the Data Envelopment Analysis, while in the second stage we estimated the changes in productivity with the help of the Malmquist index. By correlating the obtained results we were able to better understand the evolutions of the Romanian banks productivity before the crisis, while also underling the impact that the first wave of the international crisis had on it.","[Roman, Angela; Sargu, Alina Camelia] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance Money & Publ Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,aboariu@uaic.ro; s_alina_camelia@yahoo.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,11,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,606,618,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200062,0

We understand fiscal discipline as a compliance with targets for budgetary aggregates. We performed estimation on three different panels (EU24, EURO, nonEURO) with the goal to find differences between euro and non-euro countries. We used next variables for testing the impact on sovereign bond spread: German Bunds' interest, budget balance, debt and the fiscal rules index. Correlation analysis identified the strong correlation between sovereign yield spread and budget balance. This is the common trend for all panels. Likewise, fiscal rules index is strong correlated with spread and it is more noticeable in EURO panel. The improvement of fiscal discipline reduces sovereign yield spreads. The biggest difference between panels was found for the debt and German interest rate. These variables are strong correlated only in EURO countries. Surprisingly, there is no correlation in nonEURO and EURO24 panels. We investigated also relationship between spread and fiscal discipline variables using Granger causality methodology.

The classical analysis of longitudinal studies is based on parametric models including marginal models, random effects modals and transition models. Nevertheless, in the recent years, functional data analysis provides a nonparametric approach for the analysis of longitudinal data which observations of the same subject are viewed as a sample from a functional space. In a longitudinal data analysis, one mostly deals with sparsely and irregularly observed data that also corrupted with noise. In contrast, classical functional data analysis requires a large number of regularly spaced measurements per subject. Adjustments of functional data analysis techniques which take these particular features into account are needed to use them for longitudinal data. We review some techniques that have been recently proposed to connect functional data analysis with longitudinal data such as, functional principal components and functional linear regression models.

In this paper we investigate the method based on two-stage estimation of the expected amount of loss to emerge: the estimation of the ultimate loss by year and the estimation of the pattern of loss emergence through growth curve modelling, in which few restricted assumptions are adopted. Firstly, the method assumes that the actual incremental loss emergence follows an over-dispersed Poisson distribution and the coefficient of variance is constant. Secondly, as the pattern of loss to emerge, log-logistic and Weilbull growth curves are assumed. The aim of this paper is to assess the loss reserves applying the nonlinear model to fit the pattern of loss emergence, in which different form of growth curve is adopted as well as nonparametric spline fitting.","[Wolny-Dominiak, Alicja] Univ Econ Katowice, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,,alicja.wolny-dominiak@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1565,1572,,,,,,8,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100157,0

Second, relative to a single-equation prediction, panel predictions are generally able to enhance the statistical significance of beating the random walk. Third, combining forecasts from different fundamentals that have relatively strong out-predictability at a specific horizon does enhance both the statistical and economic significances of beating the random walk for the PBW period at short horizons.

According to the results, relative impact of adults' weights is stronger than relative impact of children's weights in most of the EU countries.

We find that the hypothesis of a negative military expenditure-growth relationship is not supported for both LDCs and in general, while a positive effect of military expenditure on economic growth is supported for developed countries. The hypothesis of a non-linear military expenditure-growth relationship is confirmed.

We show that arbitraging stock-ADR pairs extracts small per-trade profits which accumulate to a substantial aggregate return. The observed strong tendency of pricing disequilibria to mean-revert, along with the two-way convertibility between stocks and ADRs, mean that arbitrageurs face minimal risks toward price divergence. They do, however, face uncertainty about the duration of individual trades. The magnitude of this uncertainty relates directly to the profit target arbitrageurs set after a long/short position is established. This fact can explain why some disequilibria go unexploited. Overall, our work provides evidence against automatically efficient prices, and supports the view that mispricings incentivize arbitrageurs to enforce market efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Finally, we demonstrate that even in cases with no clear-cut decision concerning the stationarity of the spread, it is better to allow for mean reversion of the spread rather than to neglect it.","[Ankirchner, Stefan] Univ Bonn, Inst Appl Math, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Dimitroff, Georgi] DZ Bank AG, D-60265 Frankfurt, Germany; [Heyne, Gregor] Humboldt Univ, Dept Math, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Pigorsch, Christian] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Bonn,"Ankirchner, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Appl Math, Endenicher Allee 60, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",ankirchner@hcm.uni-bonn.de; dimitroff@gmail.com; heyne@math.hu-berlin.de; christian.pigorsch@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,32,6,6,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

The federal government initiated the aged exemption in part to address the high post-war cost of living, and the states followed.

Using an unbalanced panel of 154 countries from 1980 to 2006, the paper shows that banking crises are associated with a significant and long-lasting increase in government debt. The effect is a function of the severity of the crisis. In particular, for severe crises, comparable to the most recent one in terms of output losses, banking crises are followed by a medium-term increase of about 37 percentage points in the government gross debt-to-GDP ratio. In addition, the debt ratio increased more in countries with a higher initial gross debt-to-GDP ratio, with a higher share of foreign debt, and with a lower quality of institutions. The increase in government debt is also a function of the size of the fiscal stimuli implemented to counter the economic downturns and varies with the type of banking intervention policy used.","[Furceri, Davide] Univ Palermo, Int Monetary Fund, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Furceri, Davide; Zdzienicka, Aleksandra] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of Palermo; International Monetary Fund,"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dfurceri@imf.org,,,,,,,50,19,21,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

State mandates requiring that health insurance plans cover infertility treatment raise the relative cost of insuring older women of child-bearing age. Empirically, wages in this group are unaffected, but their total labor input decreases. Workers do not value infertility mandates at cost, and so will not take wage cuts in exchange, leading employers to decrease their demand for this affected and identifiable group. Differences in the empirical effects of mandates found in the literature are explained by a model including variations in the elasticity of demand, moral hazard, ability to identify a group, and adverse selection.

Considering the coexistence of various R&D project schemes, we take an aggregate view and analyze the determinants of the receipt of (any) R&D subsidies within the first three business years of the start-ups. We argue that policymakers and funding authorities follow a strategy of picking the winner. Analyzing start-ups in the East German state of Thuringia, we conduct logistic regressions and find ambiguous support. R&D subsidies are given to start-ups with innovative business ideas, especially academic spin-offs. Although the ambitions and patent stock of the founder(s) do not decide the receipt of R&D subsidies, team start-ups and the initial capital of a start-up tend to affect this decision positively. Hence, we cannot exclude a picking the winner strategy in targeting R&D subsidies to start-ups.

In this paper we examine the impact of accessibility improvements on municipal population growth in the Netherlands between 1840 and 1930, using census data. By mapping a multimodal transport network and calculating the shortest travel time between all municipalities, we generate an accessibility indicator which is strongly influenced by railway connections. The regressions show that high rail accessibility levels are positively related to municipal population growth from 1880 onwards. The impact of rail accessibility was stronger at the end of the 19th century, as industrialization took off. The overall impact of rail on population growth has been modest, however. In our model, crowding and urbanization effects dominate.

Despite the network focus of services and delays which are often focused spatially, little research has examined the spatial pattern of operational performance of urban public transport. This paper explores the operational performance of on-road public transport using spatial and historical analysis at a network wide level. Operational performance is investigated through analysis of stop level Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data and utilizes visualization techniques in geographical information systems (GISs) to explore spatial and temporal patterns of change. The network in question is the Melbourne tram (streetcar) network, which has a large historical dataset of AVL data since 2001 providing information on scheduled arrival times, actual arrival times, times of departure, and more. Statistical analysis is undertaken to determine average travel times and the standard deviation of travel times. The statistical analysis is then imported into a GIS package for further analysis; the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) methodology is used to explore spatial variations in data. Outputs include observation of travel times across the network, a reliability analysis investigating actual vs. scheduled travel times and coefficients of variation, and trend analyses to observe the change in tram travel time and change in coefficient of variation. Through this analysis, various changes in travel time and reliability were observed between 2001 and 2010. Vast areas saw improvements in travel time and reliability, while some areas were identified to have deteriorated performance. This paper identifies that the spatial representation of large datasets is of great value in an ongoing monitoring of the network and a powerful reporting tool on a network level basis. Moreover, the results identify transit issues for the Melbourne tram network planners for further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We obtain three different measures of the perceived corruption severity from a 2005 survey among 741 private firms and 133 SOEs. We find that corruption hampers the growth of Vietnam's private sector, but is not detrimental for growth in the state sector. We document significant differences in the corruption severity across 24 provinces in Vietnam that can be explained by the quality of provincial public governance (such as the costs of new business entry, land access, and private sector development policies). Our results suggest that corruption may harm economic growth because it favors the state sector at the expense of the private sector and that improving the quality of local public governance can help to mitigate corruption and stimulate economic growth.

When competing against a big bank, rural one-county banks operate at lower levels of profit efficiency, but with higher ROA and increased levels of interest and fee income from loans. Lower profit efficiency and higher returns in the rural markets suggest that big banks possess market power in rural markets and that they can extract rents to earn higher returns with lower than average profit efficiency. Therefore, small banks in rural markets should not fear large competitors.

Two important characteristics of the geography of the logistics industry are analyzed: (1) Logistics sprawl, i.e. the spatial deconcentration of logistics facilities and distribution centers in metropolitan areas, and (2) the polarization of logistics activities, i.e. the concentration of logistics activities in very large metropolitan areas. The paper focuses on Atlanta, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States (US). Like other very large cities in the US, in recent years logistics activities have increased considerably in Atlanta. The paper also examines the Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion (PAM), which has a total population of 15 million and includes Birmingham, Atlanta, Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte. PAM contains many distribution centers with a national and international market area, and is one of the country's fastest growing locations for logistics hubs. The megaregion concept is particularly well-suited to the analysis of freight transport systems, because freight transport's market areas, driven by global supply chains, are largely disconnected from a single city and spatially organized on a regional and multicity basis. Another focus of the paper is the question of planning for a more efficient locational pattern of freight facilities across metropolitan areas and within megaregions. Local governments compete for jobs and activities that generate tax revenues, and logistics has become a significant activity for many US metropolitan areas. The megaregion concept can contribute to a more collaborative regional planning approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These adjustments are difficult to explain by likely determinants, but exhibit a clear pattern: CDOs with smaller model-implied AAA sizes receive larger adjustments. CDOs with larger adjustments experience more severe subsequent downgrading. Additionally, prior to April 2007, 91.2% of AAA-rated CDOs only comply with the credit rating agency's own AA default rate standard.

We document that Term Loan B facilities, facilities of B-rated firms, and facilities originated by banks that originate CLOs are securitized more frequently than other facilities. Spreads on facilities estimated to be more likely to be subsequently securitized have lower spreads than otherwise similar facilities.

In the model, fund managers choose whether to specialize in domestic or foreign assets. Individual investors are uncertain about managers' abilities, and they are more informed about domestic markets. This makes domestic investments less risky and generates home bias. Home bias is magnified because higher-ability managers specialize in domestic assets, making them even more attractive to the investors.","[Mondria, Jordi] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Mondria, Jordi] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of Toronto; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Mondria, J (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",jordi.mondria@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,71,28,36,0,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Each treatment generates the theoretically predicted coalition size more often than not. The shares of the potential gains to cooperation achieved by each rule are: 51, 36, 40 and 13%, respectively.

There are robust arguments in favour of monetary policy reacting in a state-contingent fashion to a measure at the private-sector credit gap, not only because of financial stability considerations but also because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding real-time estimates of the output gap in MICs. Nevertheless, monetary policy is not a substitute for macroprudential regulation; in particular, it cannot address the cross-section dimension of systemic risk.","[Agenor, Pierre-Richard] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Agénor, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",pierre-richard.agenor@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,19,21,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

This paper argues that central bank communication will play a central role for that purpose, and makes the point that it should be generally geared towards clarity, transparency and predictability, in order to enhance the effectiveness of macroprudential policies and ensure central bank accountability. Moreover, central banks must manage expectations by clearly communicating what macroprudential policy can achieve, and what its limitations are, to counteract reputational risks. This paper also provides empirical evidence showing that financial markets react significantly and systematically to central bank communication about financial stability issues. However, some forms of communication such as through speeches may at times raise volatility and uncertainty, in particular during crises, thus underlining the importance of choosing carefully a communication strategy on macroprudential policy which is suited for a given market environment.","[Ehrmann, Michael; Fratzscher, Marcel] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Ehrmann, M (通讯作者)，Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",michael.ehrmann@ecb.int,,,,,,,47,26,28,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Drawing on a dataset that contains extensive information on a large and diverse panel of low-income families for up to 5 years following voucher receipt, we isolate the effects of voucher receipt using propensity score matching techniques together with regression adjustment. Full-sample results show voucher receipt to have little effect on neighborhood quality in the short-term, but some positive long-term effects. We also find that voucher receipt is tied to a higher probability of change in household composition in the year of voucher receipt, but greater stability in subsequent years. Our large sample allows us to explore differential responses of geographic and socioeconomic subgroups. Our findings have several implications for both research and policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Subsequent debt reductions are neither rapid, nor the result of proactive attempts to rebalance the firm's capital structure toward a long-run target. Instead, the evolution of the firm's leverage ratio depends primarily on whether or not the firm produces a financial surplus. In fact, firms that generate subsequent deficits tend to cover these deficits predominantly with more debt even though they exhibit leverage ratios that are well above estimated target levels. Our findings are broadly consistent with a capital structure theory in which financial flexibility, in the form of unused debt capacity, plays an important role in capital structure choices.","[Denis, David J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Katz Grad Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [McKeon, Stephen B.] Univ Oregon, Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Oregon,"Denis, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Katz Grad Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",djdenis@katz.pitt.edu,"Michielsen, Peter/D-7088-2017",", Stephen/0000-0002-3202-2728",,,,,43,137,164,11,107,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The existing literature has come up with different answers, in part as data coverage has varied and often been limited. Studying the performance of foreign relative to domestic banks in many countries between 1999 and 2006, we find that the answer importantly depends on a number of factors. Specifically, foreign banks tend to perform better when from a high income country and when regulation in the host country is relatively weak. They also perform better when larger and having a bigger market share. Foreign banks from home countries with the same language and similar regulation as the host country also perform better. Geographical closeness, however, does not improve performance. These findings show that it is important to control for heterogeneity among foreign banks when studying their performance and help reconcile some contradictory results found in the literature.

Our results indicate that entrepreneurs intend to pursue different exit paths based on previous entrepreneurial experience, industry experience, age, and education level. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that differences between intended exit and failure are underspecified in the literature, since exit consists of many unique paths.

In an empirical application to international stock return indexes, we show that the direct approach to estimating portfolio weights clearly beats a naive regression-based approach that models the conditional mean. However, a portfolio based on equal weights of the single-characteristic strategies performs about as well, and sometimes better, than the direct estimation approach, highlighting again the difficulties in beating the equal-weighted case in mean-variance analysis. The empirical results also highlight the potential for 'stock-picking' in international indexes using characteristics such as value and momentum with the characteristic-based portfolios obtaining Sharpe ratios approximately three times larger than the world market.

The different parties included in this potential corridor constitute a complex, intermodal transport corridor network. In this paper our aim is not to focus on the infrastructure itself; rather, it is to discuss potential business models for this corridor based on a combination of three modes of transport: road, sea and rail. In this study the potential corridor is referred to as the 3ModeCorridor, and the study examines potential business models for this type of corridor. We use four business model options from the literature for intermodal transport and describe their content. Then, based on the case study findings, we describe which of the business models are realistic and which can exist at the same time. We also analyze the starting model with the most potential and the possible evolution of the business models in a 5-year time frame. For the analysis we use results from in-depth interviews conducted in 51 companies from Norway, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece. The interviewed companies represent potential service buyers and transport service operators for the potential corridor. Based on the results, most of the interviewees believe a balanced model (the Operator-3PL Model) will be the starting business model with the most potential. In this model, the logistics service providers (LSPs) and operators have a rather equal relationship and there are few customers using the service. Concerning evolution, the results indicate that the models with the most potential will be those that cater for the needs of different clients. As a consequence, the role of LSP would seem to grow over time. It seems that in this type of business model the operators (rail, shipping and trucking companies) will increasingly focus on their basic function, transport. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A Markov regime-switching model with error correction terms is used to quantify the impact of monetary shocks on seven specialized REIT indices in a sample of daily returns from 1997 to 2008. The relationship between monetary shocks and REIT returns is negative, but this relationship is significant primarily during periods of high variance. Furthermore, monetary shocks have about twice as much effect on REITs as they do on the S&P 500 Index during high-variance regimes. This asymmetric response can be attributed to the Federal Reserve's recession avoidance tactics, downward price rigidity, and the external financing premium. REITs are an important and independent test case for research into the impact of monetary shocks.","[Anderson, Randy I.] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Boney, Vaneesha] Univ Denver, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Guirguis, Hany] Manhattan Coll, Riverdale, NY 10471 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; University of Denver; Manhattan College,"Anderson, RI (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",randerson@bus.ucl.edu; vboney@du.edu; Hany.Guirguis@Manhattan.edu,,,,,,,59,18,21,0,21,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

We measure governance quality using broad-based comprehensive governance metrics provided by the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). The empirical evidence reveals a robust inverse association between leverage and governance quality. Firms with poor governance are significantly more leveraged. It appears that leverage substitutes for corporate governance in alleviating agency conflicts. Further, we utilize empirical methods that control for endogeneity and show that poor governance quality likely brings about, and does not merely reflect, higher leverage.

Asymmetries are also revealed by choices regarding the inflation indexation of benefits and changing real (defined) benefits. Asymmetry is not visible in the policy responses to demographic shocks: increases in life expectancy are reflected by taking structural measures for a defined benefit contract: raising pension premiums and the pension age. Furthermore, trustees allow their choices to be affected by the forces of social comparison: the reserve position of their fund compared to the position of other funds has a significant influence in choosing pension fund policy instruments.","[van Dalen, Hendrik P.] Tilburg Univ, NIDI, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management & CentER, The Hague, Netherlands; [Henkens, Kene] Tilburg Univ, Dept Sociol & Netspar, The Hague, Netherlands; [Koedijk, Kees] CEPR, London, England; [Slager, Alfred] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, TiasNimbas Business Sch & CentER, The Hague, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Tilburg University,"van Dalen, HP (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, NIDI, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management & CentER, The Hague, Netherlands.",h.p.vandalen@uvt.nl,"van Dalen, Hendrik P./A-1736-2008; van Dalen, Harry/AAR-5621-2020; Henkens, Kène/F-6010-2013","van Dalen, Hendrik P./0000-0002-1628-9764; Henkens, Kene/0000-0002-3416-5191",,,,,31,4,4,2,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

The conventional wisdom before 2007 was that fiscal policy intervention as a stabilization tool had little to recommend it, mostly due to political constraints and to the unlikely effectiveness of many types of temporary fiscal policy actions. However, with short-term nominal interest rates near zero, attention turned again toward fiscal stabilization policy. The author describes and critiques two theories of how fiscal policy might be viewed as effective in such circumstances. One, heavily studied, is that a tax-financed increase in government expenditures would temporarily increase total output in the economy. The other, lightly studied but rhetorically forceful, is that increased government expenditures may inspire confidence. Both theories have drawbacks, but the author argues the first is dying because of three considerations: (i) actual political systems are ill-suited to implement the advice from the theory; (ii) monetary stabilization policy has been quite effective, making fiscal experiments redundant; and (iii) governments pushed distortionary taxes into the future, which in the theory reduces or eliminates the desired effects.

We solve a life-cycle model with longevity risk, which can be hedged through endogenous saving and retirement decisions. We investigate the benefits of financial assets designed to hedge the shocks to survival probabilities. When longevity risk is calibrated to match forward-looking projections, those benefits are substantial. This lends support to the idea that such hedging should be pursued by defined benefit pension plans on behalf of their beneficiaries. Finally, we draw implications for optimal security design.

Of particular concern, is whether there is a stigma foreclosure discount whereby REO properties sell at lower prices simply because they have been involved in foreclosure proceedings. To the extent that such a discount exists, arbitrage opportunities exist and the associated market failure has significant policy implications. We examine the foreclosure discount from a different perspective than prior researchers by comparing holding period returns earned by purchasers of REOs with those earned by purchasers of similar non-distressed properties. Our results show that the majority of REO purchasers do not earn economically significant excess returns. On average, the implied market discount is less than typical transaction costs. We also find evidence that REO properties and buyers vary systematically from their counterparts in the non-distressed market segment and that REO attribute prices differ from those of non-distressed properties. Overall, our evidence suggests that the market for REOs operates efficiently: lenders are not irrationally dumping RED properties and REO investors are not reaping extraordinary profits.

In addition, the rating process of securitizations provides capital arbitrage incentives for financial institutions and may further reduce regulatory capital requirements.

The farsightedness assumption for players in a coalitional game acknowledges the fact that a deviation from a single player will lead to the formation of a new coalition structure as the result of possibly successive moves of her rivals in order to improve their payoffs. It departs from mainstream game theory in that it relies on the so-called rational conjectures, as opposed to the traditional Nash conjectures formed by players on the behavior of their rivals. For values of the biological parameter and the discount factor more plausible than the ones used in the current literature, the farsightedness assumption predicts a wide scope for cooperation in non-trivial coalitions, sustained by credible threats of successive deviations that defeat the shortsighted payoff of any prospective deviator. Compliance or deterrence of deviations may also be addressed by acknowledging that information on the fish stock or on the catch policies actually implemented may be available only with a delay (dynamic farsightedness). In that case, the requirements are stronger and the sizes and number of possible farsighted stable coalitions are different. In the sequential move version, which could mimic some characteristics of fishery models, the results are not less appealing, even if the dominant player or dominant coalition with first move advantage assumption provides a case for cooperation with the traditional Nash conjectures.","[Breton, Michele; Keoula, Michel Y.] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Breton, M (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",michele.breton@hec.ca; michel-yevenunye.keoula@hec.ca,,"Breton, Michele/0000-0001-8264-8350",,,,,21,15,16,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In a model in which banks are subject to shocks but can exert effort to affect the likelihood of these shocks, we show that the validity of this argument crucially relies on banks always remaining solvent. The reason is that when banks become insolvent, Bagehots prescription dictates to let them fail. Penalty rates charged when banks are illiquid (but solvent) then reduce banks incentives to avoid insolvency ex ante and thus increase bank moral hazard. We derive a condition which shows precisely when this effect on ex ante incentives outweighs the traditional one and show that it is fulfilled under plausible scenarios.","[Castiglionesi, Fabio] Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, European Banking Ctr, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Wagner, Wolf] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, European Banking Ctr, TILEC, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Castiglionesi, F (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, European Banking Ctr, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands.",fabio.castiglionesi@uvt.nl; wagner@uvt.nl,,"Castiglionesi, Fabio/0000-0003-2963-7147; Wagner, Wolf/0000-0002-0355-3263",,,,,24,9,9,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The results hold after controlling for other potential influences.

This is done by examining the empirical relationships between FFS participation and increased well-being; as well as FFS participation and empowerment; and finally between empowerment and enhanced well-being. Data analysis from the two thousand household questionnaires show a relationship between these aspects, despite contextual differences in the three countries studied. It is thereby argued that there could be scope to talk about an empowerment route to well-being. The paper further suggests that the most significant impact of FFS could be viewed in terms of building the capacity of local people to make choices and make decisions that ultimately lead to increased uptake of agricultural innovations, access to services, and market access as well as collective action. A major conclusion of the study is that agricultural development programs should focus more on processes of empowering farmers as opposed to technical solutions that characterize most programs, in order to create an appropriate mix of technological and social advancement for a development process that is sustainable in nature.

The negative relation between diversification and labor productivity is not stronger in countries with more burdensome employment regulation, but it is significantly stronger in countries with better financial development. In addition, the negative relation is stronger in industries with high capital/labor ratios.

I develop a New Keynesian model, where households are jealous and the central bank follows the Taylor rule. I show that the welfare effects of monetary policy over time depend significantly on the relative strength of the consumption externality caused by jealousy and the monopolistic distortion. When a first-order approximation of the utility function is used, then the main result is the following: If jealousy (the monopolistic distortion) dominates, then a decrease in the interest rate reduces (increases) welfare in the short run, but increases (reduces) welfare in the medium run. However, the use of a second-order approximation changes the sign of the overall welfare effect of monetary policy if the initial level of employment is at the optimal level or just below it.

Why WTA-WTP discrepancies arise is not well understood. We generalize models of reference dependence to identify separate reference dependence effects for increases and decreases in environmental health risk probabilities, for increases and decreases in costs, and reference dependence effects embodying the interaction of two changes. We estimate separate reference dependence effects for the four possible cost and health risk change combinations using data from our choice-based experiment for a nationally representative sample of 4,745 households. The WTA-WTP gap is due largely to the reference dependence effects related to costs. Standard models of reference dependence are not consistent with the results, as there is an interactive effect.

A major agricultural business in central South Africa took part in this quantitative research study of which the target population was all active customers providing income above R100 000 to the agricultural business. The response rate was 35.8 per cent. The results indicated that customer satisfaction towards retail shops has the biggest impact on overall satisfaction of all the business units. Almost 99 per cent of the respondents make use of this business unit and retail shops are generally considered to be the window through which customers view the agricultural business. The best performing business unit was grain storage, while mechanisation (workshops) was considered to be the worst performing business unit for the participating business. When these two business units were tested separately from the other business units, it was found that mechanisation (workshops) had the biggest impact on customer satisfaction, indicating that if the participating business were to consider improving customer satisfaction of the agricultural business as a whole, it should rather focus on the worst performing business unit, because a small improvement in the customer satisfaction of this business unit could increase customer satisfaction substantially for the business as a whole.",,,,Alsemgeestl@ufs.ac.za; smitava@ufs.ac.za,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2012,51.0,1,,,,,83,95,,10.1080/03031853.2012.649536,0.0,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,973BE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306325200005,0

However, relatively little research attention has been devoted to the consideration of relations between green product innovation, firm performance and competitive capability. Hence, this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing empirical evidence to encourage companies to implement green product innovation in order to improve their firm performance and to enhance their competitive capability. It also includes the moderating role of managerial environmental concern in this relation. A model is constructed to link the aforementioned constructs. Data, which are collected through a questionnaire-based survey across 140 Turkish manufacturer firms from various sectors, are analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. According to statistical results, green product innovation significantly positively affects both firm performance and competitive capability. On the other hand, managerial environmental concern only moderates the relationship between green product innovation and firm performance. The results also provide various implications for managers and present some suggestions for future researches. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on the period after 1998, when the CNB's inflation targeting policy is implemented and the repo rate (14 days) plays the role of the monetary policy rate. In the paper we discuss some methodological problems associated with the ex post empirical verification of the central bank monetary rule. We construct an empirical model of the monetary rule, justify the choice and the inclusion of explanatory variables, we analyze the statistical properties of time series and verify the alternative forms of econometric models. Our analysis showed that the development of CNB repo rate in the reporting period can be explained by the past and present evolution of three explanatory variables: the yearly inflation rate, the exchange rate and the ECB repo rate. The annualized inflation rate proved to be statistically insignificant in the model. We find interesting that the statistical quality of the estimated model was further increased after a six-month delay of the yearly inflation rate. The obtained results indicate that in determining the CNB repo rate the expected future level of the yearly inflation rate does not play important role and the last yearly inflation rate is more important than its present level.","[Arlt, Josef; Mandel, Martin] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Arlt, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",arlt@vse.cz; mandel@vse.cz,"Arlt, Josef/E-3008-2019",,,,,,33,7,7,0,4,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Nevertheless, migration's influence on other income sources and household re-ranking substantially alter distributional impacts. We find significant impacts of migration on non-remittance income, as well as changes in the effects of non-migration activities on inequality over time.

This article provides a brief description of the basic characteristics of both these approaches and summarizes the main arguments presented by their proponents and opponents.

Yet, managers and policy-makers often do not recognize that these problems are wicked. Wicked problems have cause-effect relationships that are difficult or impossible to define, cannot be framed and solved without creating controversies among stakeholders and require collective action among societal groups with strongly held, conflicting beliefs and values. In contrast to past research, this Special Issue takes an organizational perspective by tackling three key managerial questions: what is the value of managing wicked problems and engaging with multiple stakeholders? What are the human and organizational resources and the strategic conditions needed to engage with multiple stakeholders effectively? How can multi-stakeholder engagements be undertaken? A world collection of empirical case studies conducted by business, NGO and university leaders tackle these questions. For managers, the Issue offers recent and thought-provoking insights on how to recognize and deal with wicked problems. For academics, it proposes an agenda for addressing the topic and promises to fuel a research and education debate for years to come.","[Dentoni, Domenico] Wageningen Univ, Sch Social Sci, Management Studies Grp, NL-6707 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hospes, Otto] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ross, R.

Consumption in OECD countries has likely peaked; the growth in global oil use will be entirely due to continued growth in emerging economies, most importantly China. Oil supply growth will be dominated by OPEC, although non-OPEC supply should continue rising modestly due to biofuels and other 'unconventional' supplies. This outlook suggests that the centers of gravity for both consumption and production will shift to Asia for consumption and to Middle-East OPEC for production. Continued investment will be required for supply to meet expected demand growth; energy security will remain an important driver of policy (though US. import dependence should improve); and CO, emissions appear likely to continue rising.

Wages and employment are determined by the intersection of demand curves and wage-setting schedules. The wage curve is derived from the Shapiro-Stiglitz efficiency-wage model. Employment subsidy programmes decrease the risk of being unemployed and tend to keep the welfare of workers. Training programmes upgrade labour skill and tend to transfer labour from a low-productivity to a high-productivity sector. Both programmes tend to increase the welfare of workers. However, the macroeconomic impacts of these two programmes on wages and labour productivity are different. The paper investigates and compares the macroeconomic influences of subsidised employment programmes and training/education programmes in a dual labourmarket framework.

A better understanding of agency and change, in relation to marriage, matters for both the conceptualisation of intrahousehold relations, and for a range of policy initiatives, for example gender equity, or indeed HIV/AIDS, where the ability of women to instigate change in conjugality and sexual cultures is significant. This article makes no claim to represent contemporary Shona gender relations in Zimbabwe, hut offers a temporal analysis of changing conjugality in south-central Zimbabwe from the colonial period into the late 1980s(1) to critique the theoretical stance of contractual approaches, through revealing the ways in which marriage has been reformulated through women's agency.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Jackson, C (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",cecile.jackson@uea.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/D003431/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/D003431/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,42,14,15,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In particular, we seek to analyze whether the incentives for the state governments to observe a prudent spending behavior have not been undermined by the fact that they have been able to influence relevant central government decisions regarding their finance. Our estimations results show that states that are overrepresented at the executive level tend to have higher spending and deficits. However, we don't find any correlation between overrepresentation at the Parliament and states governments' fiscal outcomes. This can be explained by the fact that in Malaysia as is frequently the case in developing nations, the legislature is peripheral to the executive in terms of decision making power. The results also show that ideological belonging does not have any impact on the state governments' level of expenditures and deficits. We do not find any significant correlation between the level of support obtained by the ruling party in state elections and the level of the state governments' expenditures and deficits.

This seasonality is explained by a joint effect of the change in the number of daylight hours and the latitude of the area zone under consideration. Notably, latitude affects real estate prices above and beyond the effect of the change in the number of daylight hours, which by itself is a function of latitude. This joint effect is robust to the two explanations for seasonality given in the literature: the Matching Theory and the Bargaining Power Hypothesis, as well as to several macroeconomic variables. The effect also conforms to the well-known Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which has been found in other studies to affect people's health, their risk attitude, and consequently their risk perception and investment decisions which, in turn, affect asset prices.

(2) Has it also reduced poverty and improved rural incomes? The paper identifies conditions under which irrigation has greater anti-poverty impacts. The analysis of data suggests that there are strong linkages between irrigation, crop productivity and poverty alleviation. The linkages between irrigation and poverty alleviation are both direct and indirect. Irrigation has benefited the poor through higher agricultural productivity; higher yields increased cropping intensity, increased income, consumption and savings as well as higher farm and offfarm employment.

However, a range of factors such as inappropriate structures and institutional or capabilities barriers may negatively influence the spread or direction of processes of innovation and knowledge exchange (Klein-Woolthuis et al., 2005). These problems are often referred to as systemic weaknesses or failures, and highlight the need to focus on the innovation system (IS) as a whole (Smiths and Kuhlmann, 2004; Raven et al., 2010). The purpose of the paper, using a comprehensive innovation systems failure framework, is to assess and he performance of agrifood innovation systems of Scotland and the Netherlands, through analysis of the key innovation actors (organisations, networks or influential individuals), and their key functions (research provider, intermediary etc), and those mechanisms that either facilitate or hinder the operation of the IS (known as inducing and blocking mechanisms, respectively). This framework was drawn up based on literature research and a series of semi-structured interviews and/or workshops with experts involved in the agrifood innovation systems in the two countries. The findings confirm the appropriateness of considering actors, functions, inducing or blocking mechanisms and governance instruments as analytical tools to evaluate the performance of agrifood innovation systems. In both countries, blocking mechanisms in terms of actors' interactions and competencies as well as market and incentive structure were revealed. The proposed mix of governance mechanisms in each country offers actors a better chance to influence the direction and speed of innovation in agrifood systems.",,,,Chrysa.Lamprinopoulou@sac.ac.uk; Alan.Renwick@sac.ac.uk; Laurens.Klerkx@wur.nl; Frans.Hermans@wur.nl; Mofakkarul.Islam@sac.ac.uk; Dirk.Roep@wur.nl,"Renwick, Alan/AAS-6588-2021; Klerkx, Laurens/ABD-4957-2021; Hermans, Frans/G-6161-2018","Hermans, Frans/0000-0003-3394-9012",,,,,48,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,281,300,,,,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800020,0

For the second objective, which is to examine the impact of non farm income to income inequality, we used Gini decomposition techniques. Our result indicate that non farm income can improve the level of poverty or non farm income sources contributed towards poverty reduction among agricultural household. All of the poverty measures show that the inclusion of non-farm income into the agricultural household income reduce the level, depth and severity of poverty. But on the other hand, non farm income increased income inequality among agricultural household in Kedah. As expected agricultural income is the main source of income for rural people in the study area. The policy implication of this study is to encourage non-farm income activities among agricultural households as this would raise their income and hence, reduce poverty among them.

In fact it is commonly known that in the recent days the traditional entrepreneurial paradigma undertakes among researchers and practitioners a shifting from the more classical to a more knowledge (intellectual capital) based paradigma. It is obviously a shifting from plutocratic concept of possessing to a gnosiocratic human determined value added growth model, whereby intellective / cognitive (episteme, logos) and agentive (praxis, techne) entrepreneurial elements confound the new potential for the firm's source of competitive edge. Through the above mentioned syncrasis of human centered technology (= techne and logos) elements (intellective and agentive) the entrepreneurial corporate becomes a non-imitational, learning (perceptive), adaptive (modulating), creative (demodulating) and cooperative (transferring) intellectual entrepreneur. In this way the entrepreneurial syncrasis of the firm's tangible resources like physical, technological and financial capital with the firm's intangible (Learning Capital - LC, Modulation Capital - MC, Demodulation Capital - DC, Transfer Capital - TC) resources, the intellectual entrepreneurial capital (IEC), produces not just tangible products but endogenous determined teleological-intellective-agentive entrepreneurial competence and expertise system, which leaves its fingerprints into the firm's intellectual statements in form of intellectual or knowledge based entrepreneurial performance indicators.(dagger) (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of a covariate shock such as severe rainfall failure, this smoothing mechanism may be ineffective and rainfall insurance or drought-triggered safety nets could provide further protection.","Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Porter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",catherine.porter@economics.ox.ac.uk,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020","Porter, Catherine/0000-0002-8578-1744",,,,,54,62,69,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Innovation is often mentioned as an important pillar of the development of rural areas. One part of Rural Development Programmes, which explicitly addresses innovation, is LEADER: a bottom up-oriented, participatory approach with cooperation by local actors in rural areas. In LEADER, a Local Action Group (LAG) with stakeholders of different institutions and origins comes together as a kind of a public-private partnership and decides about the financial support for regional projects. The LAG can be seen as a kind of new network of practice. In this context it is important for the LAGs to assemble people with various backgrounds and to foster a good communication and cooperative climate. A survey of LAG-members shows positive results: there are improvements in the cooperation beyond administrative borders (respectively, narrow village boundaries), in the improving of understanding views from other groups and in the, cooperation between different groups. Thus LEADER is an example of how an external programme can connect actors from different interest groups who would, without this programme, in part not have met. In addition, LEADER offers the possibility to try out new approaches, as the regions have access to their own funding budget to implement their ideas. But in practice the possibilities of funding experimental or innovative projects via LEADER depend very much on the extent to which the RDPs are able to provide a suitable framework to fund projects outside the standard menu of measures. The assessments of the LAG-managers show that the real possibilities are limited, particularly compared with the former funding period (LEADER+). But despite these limitations, we found LEADER-projects fostering innovation in very different fields.","[Schnaut, Gitta; Pollermann, Kim; Raue, Petra] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst vTI, Forestry & Fisheries Inst Rural Studies, Fed Res Inst Rural Areas, Braunschweig, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Schnaut, G (通讯作者)，Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst vTI, Forestry & Fisheries Inst Rural Studies, Fed Res Inst Rural Areas, Braunschweig, Germany.",Gitta.Schnaut@vti.bund.de,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,319,333,,,,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800022,0

First, investigation of the time series properties of the forward premium reveals either four or five breaks in the last twenty three years and evidence of long memory within each sub period. In fact the forward premium is highly nonlinear and appears to defy classification as a process with a constant order of integration. The second aspect of the paper is concerned with the time varying nature of the estimate of the slope parameter when spot returns are regressed on the lagged forward premium. We compare rolling type regression estimates, with Bayesian estimation and also a new Time Varying Parameter (TVP) method that is motivated by the TVP autoregression of Giraitis et al. (2014). The procedure is a form of kernel weighted regression and delivers relatively tight standard errors on the parameter estimates. We find the existence of the forward premium anomaly with large negative beta coefficients in the 1980s and 1990s. For some currencies there is also evidence of large positive coefficients and a reversal of the forward premium anomaly after the financial crisis of 2008. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper considers evidence for rising financial fragility during the 1984-2007 Great Moderation in the U.S. The literature suggests that macroeconomic stability combined with strong growth of credit to asset markets, in asset prices and in credit relative to output are all indicators of rising financial fragility. We show each of these trends in the Great Moderation. We derive the testable implication that in the Great Moderation credit growth is driven more by past credit growth and less by output growth (Allen and Gale, 2000), relative to pre-Great Moderation years. Results from a VAR model estimated on quarterly data for 1955-2007 are consistent with the hypothesis. This invites a reinterpretation of the Great Moderation. Our methodology may help understand when a credit boom turns into a credit bubble, and contributes to the development of methods of measuring financial fragility. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides a survey of the empirical literature on this topic. Its emphasis is on reviewing and elucidating what is known about the magnitude of BEPS. The paper discusses different empirical approaches to identifying income shifting, describes existing data sources, and summarises the findings of the empirical literature. A major theme that emerges from this survey is that in the more recent empirical literature, which uses new and richer sources of data, the estimated magnitude of BEPS is typically much smaller than that found in earlier studies. The paper seeks to provide a framework within which to conceptualise this magnitude and its implications for policy. It concludes by highlighting the importance of existing legal and economic frictions as constraints on BEPS and by discussing possible ways in which future research might model these frictions more precisely.","Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Dharmapala, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",dharmap@uchicago.edu,"Dharmapala, Dhammika/GPF-9205-2022","Dharmapala, Dhammika/0000-0001-9858-0565",,,,,44,140,160,8,103,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Based on an alternative approach of free associations instead of a standardised scale of behaviour, this question is included in a quantitative survey and allows us to obtain meaningful words. These exploratory results show first that beliefs about energy can be considered as general representations like a cost, a power or even an environmental issue. These beliefs are included in a logit model of mode choice that also considers more conventional factors representing socio-demographic characteristics, socio-economic aspects, as well as territorial structure and function. The final results demonstrate that energy beliefs influence mode choice if they include an environmental component, which expresses the negative effects of energy.

We compare three scenarios: if Canadian financial markets (a) never experienced the financial crisis of 2008 (i.e., continued on their pre-2008 path); (b) experienced the crisis and return to historical trends; or (c) enter a new low normal of depressed stock market returns and continued low interest rates. Using a population microsimulation model, we model the first order impacts that is, before behavioural responses such as delayed retirement or increased savings on the retirement income flows of Baby Boom retirees. While annual income from private savings of the median Canadian baby-boom senior drops by over half in the event of continuing low financial market returns, median financial welfare drops by only just over a fifth. Rising social transfers and stable income sources (such as Canada/Quebec Pension Plan and implicit income from home ownership) partially shield Canadian seniors from financial market risk. Canadian research has long recognized that the Canadian social pension system protects poorer Canadian seniors from destitution. Our results indicate that it also helps shield the Canadian elderly population as a whole from financial market risk.","[MacDonald, Bonnie-Jeanne; Osberg, Lars] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"MacDonald, BJ (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS, Canada.",,,"Osberg, Lars/0000-0001-9643-9269",,,,,47,2,2,0,11,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

However, to date there exists little evidence as to the empirical relevance of this proposition in terms of the accuracy or efficiency of predicted benefits. Using Bayesian Model Search techniques we examine whether different portions of metadata, distinguished by underlying welfare construct, share common willingness-to-pay distributions. Applying our algorithm to two separate meta-datasets we find strong evidence of information sharing across welfare categories for a large subset of contexts. For cases where information sharing is indicated, substantial efficiency gains in predicted benefits can be achieved by pooling the underlying data.","[Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Moeltner, Klaus] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Clark University; Clark University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Moeltner, K (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 208 Hutcheson Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",rjohnston@clarku.edu; moeltner@vt.edu,,"Johnston, Robert/0000-0001-7523-2701",,,,,30,27,29,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

To this end, a measure of relative rating inflation (Rating Bias) observable at issuance is proposed. The way Rating Bias is priced changes significantly between Investment Grade (IG) and Speculative Grade (SG) securities. Rating Bias is only partially discounted for IG tranches, whereas it is correctly priced for SG ones. Less sophisticated institutional investors are often restrained from investing in securities rated lower than triple-A, double-A or A; however, these alternative thresholds do not appear to play a role as relevant as that of the IG-SG boundary. Rating Bias is also found to have an asymmetric impact on spreads: the relevance of actual over expected ratings is greater for tranches receiving evaluations that are higher (rather than lower) than expected. Taken together, these pieces of empirical evidence point toward ratings-based regulation as an important explanation for the observed mispricing of structured finance products. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Conditioned on a strictly positive WTP, we use Lee's selectivity-corrected model to determine the magnitude of their WTP in the second stage. Using CV survey data from Norway we find significant distance decay in the first stage classification of respondents as 'protesters', 'true zero' WTP, or positive WTP. In the second stage model for positive WTP responses, we find little or no significant relationships when correcting for selection. Results suggest that previous findings of significant distance decay in contingent valuation of lake and river water in Europe may be driven by the definition of 'protest' and 'true zero' respondents.

This model captures the interactions and dynamics among four players (developer, buyer, mortgage lender, and construction loan lender) involved in the presale market. We find that the use of the presale method together with an increase in leverage (by using construction loan or mortgage) have risk-shifting effects to other players in the market.

In this paper we argue that the development of IWT on the Yangtze River is strongly influenced by institutional changes at different levels of government in line with the path dependent transformation of the Chinese centrally planned economy. This paper deduces how institutional change of IWT on the Yangtze fails to fulfil its purposes because of institutional legacies and conflicts of interests among the various levels of government and the persistent interwovenness of the state with private enterprises (via SOEs). In order to further stimulate IWT on the Yangtze more institutional changes are on the cards, in particular a need for more (foreign) private involvement and more independent SOEs, but these changes will not necessarily break out of the development path.

Yet, the spatial mismatch between production centers (inland Northwest) and consumption centers (coastal region) within China fostered the emergence of dedicated coal transport corridors with limited alternatives. Serious problems of energy shortage and power rationing have already affected southeastern China. At the same time, enormous interregional coal transfers face a lack of transport capacity along the transport system. Based on first-hand statistics, a disaggregated analysis of coal distribution patterns since the late 1970s provides novel evidences about the local effects of macroscopic trends, such as the shift from dominant exports to dominant imports in terms of changing traffic concentration levels and distribution patterns among routes and ports. The spatial evolution of coal distribution is also discussed in terms of related industry linkages and local influences, coal trade policies and market pricing, port system evolution, and transport network planning. The paper also discusses possible improvements of the current situation through enhancing multimodal transport based on a review of current policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It compares selected excess-commuting indicators of Xi'an with those in selected Chinese and foreign cities. It finds that (a) Xi'an has a short theoretical minimum commute, which indicates a good relative numerical balance of jobs with respect to housing; (b) Xi'an has a relatively low commuting efficiency as compared to most of the foreign cities and other Chinese cities but this can be caused by differences in the size of units of analysis across studies; (c) jobs-residents ratios would not significantly reduce the average commuting distance at the subarea level; (d) job density and migrant ratio are significantly correlated to the average commuting distance at the subarea level; (e) the jobs-housing balance has bigger impacts on bus commutes than on car commutes. This manuscript re-confirms the importance of conducting separate studies of the jobs-housing balance and related issues in the Chinese context.

President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, has emphasised the importance of strong economic growth and rising living standards. But he faces significant, broad-ranging economic challenges and, perhaps not surprisingly, serious discussion of these issues did not feature during the election campaigns. In many respects the economy is at a crossroads, facing the choice between a business-asusual scenario of no reform and consequently sluggish economic growth, and a politically difficult reform agenda that would set it on a higher growth path. Economic policymakers regard the events of 2013 as a mini economic crisis, and they feel vindicated in their explicit preference for stability over growth-that is, for slowing the economy through tighter fiscal and monetary policy and letting the currency decline. For now, the economy is slowing but holding up quite well, especially by comparative international norms and considering foreign and domestic headwinds, including possible macroeconomic and financial fragilities. Here we examine these headwinds-from global economic volatility and declining commodity prices, particularly in the wake of the so-called Bernanke shock of May 2013, to the continuing policy drift at home. We investigate whether there is evidence of an emerging adjustment from the commodity-driven growth of the past decade to some of the traditional tradables sectors, especially manufacturing. While the commodity boom is almost certainly a thing of the past-at least at levels witnessed since 2005-the country's political narratives and the government's microeconomic policies appear to be still premised on an era of plenty funded by a disappearing boom. We speculate on likely options and directions for what in all likelihood will be a 'Jokowi decade'.","[Aswicahyono, Haryo] Ctr Strateg & Int Studies, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Hill, Hal] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Aswicahyono, H (通讯作者)，Ctr Strateg & Int Studies, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,9,5,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The literature suggests that the announcement of straight equity issues has a negative impact. However, the outcome for convertible preference share issues (CPS) remains unknown. We selected those CPS deemed to be equity-like under the 2001 tax classification framework for this study, as only such convertibles may attach franking credits to their dividends. In line with the straight equity studies, we found significant and abnormal negative returns during the announcement periods. We initially report no statistical significance between the issuing firm's available franking credit levels and market reaction. When we controlled for ownership concentration, however, we found a positive and statistical association. This is the first study to report such an association within the CPS market, suggesting that equity-like CPS resident investors may seek franking credits and so react positively to an issuing firm's level of available franking credits.

This methodology allows us to treat all variables in the model as endogenously determined. Our approach allows us to address the endogeneity problem inherent in fiscal policy research as well as to obtain results for both the short term and intermediate term (up to six years). Consistent with prevailing wisdom, taxes are shown to have a negative effect on economic growth, but the effect only is present in the short run.

Results suggest that, for most of the cities in our sample, changes in fundamental factors can account for a major proportion of the actual housing price appreciation.

At the aggregate level, we find that total factor productivity growth (TFP) has been quite respectable in the last decade, both in comparison to earlier decades as well as in international comparison. In fact, it is higher growth in aggregate TFP, rather than higher growth in factor inputs, that accounts for higher GDP growth in the 2000s. The paper also derives TFP at the sectoral (agriculture, industry and services) level. We find that in the last decade TFP growth has been relatively high in all three sectors, with the greatest contrast appearing in agriculture. The 2000s was unique in the sense that this was the only decade since the 1970s where TFP growth in agriculture was not only positive but also higher than industry and services. This high TFP growth in agriculture seems to have ended in recent years.","[Atiyas, Izak] Sabanci Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Atiyas, Izak; Bakis, Ozan] TUSIAD Sabanci Univ Competitiveness Forum, Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University; Sabanci University,"Atiyas, I (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",izak@sabanciuniv.edu; bakis@sabanciuniv.edu,"Bakis, Ozan/AAE-4941-2019","Bakis, Ozan/0000-0001-9785-1992",,,,,33,8,11,1,13,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Alternatively it has been suggested this is not a general relationship since it was found that inequality had no bearing on crises in 14 advanced countries over 19202008; instead, low interest rates and business cycle expansions are found to be the only two robust determinants of credit booms leading to crises. Using a similar dataset, this paper provides no support for the generality of the above findings by embracing country heterogeneity. The paper shows that real evidence still points back to the inequality-leverage-crisis nexus for financialized economies.

The potential GDP growth rates calculated using the Cobb Douglas production function and Hodrick-Prescott methodology, decelerated substantially across the board in the countries studied once the international economic and financial crisis hit, recording even negative rates of growth in Cyprus, Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain. In addition to the specific factors that characterise each country, there is a series of common features that will affect the developments of the potential GDP on a long-term basis, such as the increase of global risk aversion correlated with the reduction of the banking exposures, the slow economic recovery in the EU, and last but not least the incoming ageing process, which will exert an additional negative impact on the growth potential of the EU member states.

The model predicts that the ranking of these countries in terms of GDP per capita would follow this order until convergence occurs.

Using a regime-switching, smooth transition regression model (STR), we find significant evidence of herding in all Gulf Arab stock markets, with the market volatility being the more paramount factor governing the switches between the extreme states of non-herding and herding. The global variables comprised of the U.S. stock market performance, the price of oil and the US interest rate as well as the risk indexes including the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) and the St. Louis Fed's Financial Stress Index (FSI) are found to be significant factors governing the transition to herding states.

I analyze the discrepancies between Mexicans' intention to migrate and their subsequent migration behavior using the two waves of the Mexican Family Life Survey panel (2002 and 2005-06). I first provide evidence that intentions contain behavioral information. Controlling for various shocks likely to affect the migration decision, I find that women's probability to carry out their migration plans is systematically lower than men's. Different interpretations are investigated, but empirical evidence suggests that women's unrealized migration plans are due to female-specific costs and constraints. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It presents the crew demographics and structure on-board the cruisers along Danube throughout Central and South Eastern Europe. Its goal is to answer the following questions: What are the gender and ages of the ships' crews? Are they structured according to the country of origin? Is there interdependence between the employment rank of the crew members and the degree of the economic development of the country they come from? The data has been collected from the manifests of the cruise vessels which docked in Serbia over the 9 month research period during the 2007 cruise season. Firstly, data from the 2218 employees on-board the 54 cruisers was collected. Secondly, in-depth interviews with a small sample of cruisers officers, staff and crews (2007-2010) were conducted. The findings of the study have several theoretical and practical implications. Namely, previous related studies have been mainly focused on the ocean cruisers and neglect the rising importance of the river cruisers, especially for the European region. The study also discusses the possibilities for improvement of the human resources management and strategic development management of the European countries, which already have and those which have not yet positioned themselves on the river cruising market. Finally, key demographic employment data and characteristics (e.g. gender, average age, occupational groups, etc.) are important factors to consider when conducting a comprehensive labour force analysis, for they provide the organization a chance to build on its strengths and to minimize challenges and risks.

The model is then applied to the Catholic Church's reaction to the Protestant Reformation. It is argued that the model provides a better fit to the historical data of the Counter-Reformation than the price-cutting model proposed by economists Ekelund, Hebert and Tollison (2004, 2006).","Univ Piemonte Orientale, Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Ferrero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Alessandria, Italy.",,,,,,,,23,4,5,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

This article consequently has a starting point in the notion of 'path dependency' (Schwanen et al., 2011) and an observed 'implementation gap' (Banister and Hickman, 2013), suggesting that significant mitigation policies for transport do not emerge in the European Union because of various interlinked 'transport taboos', i.e. barriers to the design, acceptance and implementation of such transport policies that remain unaddressed as they constitute political risk. The paper argues that without addressing transport taboos, such as highly unequal individual contributions to transport volumes and emissions, social inequality of planned market-based measures, the role of lobbyism, and the various social and psychological functions of mobility, it will remain difficult to achieve significant emission reductions in passenger transport. Yet, transport taboos remain largely ignored among EU policy makers because their discussion would violate 'order', i.e. harm specific interests within neoliberal governance structures and the societal foundations and structures of transport systems built on these.

Projections suggest that this proportion will continue to increase as a result of the large number of children born after the World War II (1946-1964).

The aim of the paper is to develop and apply a new measure of accessibility to train stations at a fine spatial scale, justified by the special circumstance of the elderly using a case study in Perth, Western Australia. Intercept surveys are used to collect data on factors affecting train station accessibility for patrons aged 60 years or older, at seven highly dispersed train stations. Overall accessibility is measured separately using a composite index based on three travel modes (walk-and-ride, park-and-ride and bus-and-ride). The results illustrate that key variables, such as distance from an origin to a station, walking or driving route directness, land-use diversity, service and facility quality, bus connection to train stations, all affect the accessibility to train stations for the elderly. This implies that improvements to these factors will improve accessibility for this population group. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the political arrangements that have emerged out of these changes fall short of the idealized standards of civil society, various commentators have argued that they nevertheless benefit subordinate classes. Partha Chatterjee even argues that the ad hoc and extra-legal nature of these political arrangements - which he terms political society' - actually serve popular enfranchisement better than the law-bound activities of civil society, which he sees as captive to capital. On the basis of village ethnography from the Pakistani Punjab, I argue that political society is in fact integral to processes that dispossess people of their rights and to the reproduction of elite power.

The final PEI is bound between 0 and 1, and uses data that typically are readily available to planners and metropolitan planning organizations (MPO). The results of this method are region-specific; they are comparable only between the zones within the given study area. As a case study, the city of Chicago is analyzed at the sub-traffic analysis zone (sub-TAZ) level. The results agree closely with the expectation of pedestrian friendliness across different parts of the city.

Licensure regulations ostensibly serve the public interest by certifying competence, but they can simultaneously be formidable barriers to entry by skilled migrants. From a collective action perspective, skilled natives can more easily secure sub-national, occupation-specific policies than influence national immigration policy. We exploit the unique structure of the American medical profession that allows us to distinguish between public interest and protectionist motives for migrant physician licensure regulations. We show that over the 1973-2010 period states with greater physician control over licensure requirements imposed more stringent requirements for migrant physician licensure and, as a consequence, received fewer new migrant physicians. By our estimates over a third of all US states could reduce their physician shortages by at least 10 percent within 5 years just by equalizing migrant and native licensure requirements. This article advances research on the political economy of immigration and highlights an overlooked dimension of international economic integration: regulatory rent-seeking as a barrier to the cross-national mobility of human capital, and the public policy implications of such barriers.","[Peterson, Brenton D.; Pandya, Sonal S.; Leblang, David] Univ Virginia, Dept Polit, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Pandya, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Polit, POB 400787, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",bdp3wh@virginia.edu; spandya@virginia.edu; leblang@virginia.edu,"Leblang, David/AAS-4131-2020","Leblang, David/0000-0003-1315-3092; Peterson, Brenton/0000-0003-2431-041X",,,,,59,39,50,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2014,160.0,1-2,,,,,45,63,,10.1007/s11127-014-0152-8,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AW7ZY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346481600004,0

Empirically, we find that firms with CEOs holding trade association directorships enjoy larger loans, lower rates and longer loan maturities from both privately-owned and government-owned banks. Moreover, firms with CEOs holding directorships in major trade associations enjoy better privileges. These benefits expand during financial crisis.

For instance, prior research shows that both the Put-Call Ratio (P/C) and the Option-to-Stock Volume Ratio (O/S) predict negative future stock returns. In this paper, we compare the level of information contained in these two commonly used option volume ratios. First, we find that P/C ratios contain more predictability about future stock returns at the daily level than O/S ratios. Second, in contrast to our first set of results, O/S ratios contain more predictability about future returns at the weekly and monthly levels than P/C ratios. In fact, our tests show that while P/C ratios contain predictability about future daily returns and, to some extent, future weekly returns, the return predictability in P/C ratios is fleeting. O/S ratios, on the other hand, significantly predict negative returns at all levels: daily, weekly, and monthly. While Pan and Poteshman (2006) show that signed P/C ratios, which require proprietary data, have predictive power, we find that unsigned P/C ratios, which do not require proprietary data, also have predictive power.

We also show that a demographic effect and a debt effect may drive fiscal sustainability measures over time, and establish a routine to control for these effects in the generational accounting framework. An empirical application for Spain illustrates that our proposed decomposition of indicators is empirically relevant. Standard generational accounting suggests that fiscal sustainability in Spain improved substantially in preparing for EMU.

The evidence indicates that presidential regimes are associated with a less equal distribution of disposable incomes, while electoral systems have no significant effects. Fiscal competition is associated with less income redistribution and a less equal distribution of disposable incomes, but also with a more equal primary income distribution.

In this article we aimed to analyze the most important issues related to the level and quality of consumer protection in European Union 27 countries in the period 2008-2012. For this scope, we have chosen the most important five consumer indicators, which are the components of the Consumer Conditions Index, which provide information on both the level and the quality of consumer protection: the protection perceived by consumers (feeling protected as a consumer), illicit commercial practices, the product safety, the consumer complaints, and the redress measures. Initial data were collected from the European Commission for each Member State of the European Union 27, for the last five years, from 2008 to 2012. We have used statistical and econometric methods. For the year 2012, using the selected indicators, we have presented the descriptive statistics in order to observe their caracteristics, we have analysed the correlation matrix and we have determined the structure of four clusters, which reveals common features of countries in each cluster. In order to capture the impact of the variables illegal commercial practices and redress measures on the dependent variable protection perceived by the consumers, we have realized panel regressions with cross-section fixed effects, using data for the period 2008- 2012. Also for this period, comparative statistical analyzes were performed (average, minimum, maximum, trend) between Member States.

We analyse short-term intermodal shifts as a reaction to sudden changes in air transport availability. The question addressed is whether, and in what capacity, air passengers used railways when Prague International Airport was closed. To compare the degree of intermodal shift in Prague for particular European destinations during the closure, we calculated an InterModal Shift Index. We concluded that approximately 20% of passengers travelling to neighbouring countries and 6% of passengers travelling to more distant European destinations chose rail as an alternative. Following the airport closure, travellers were willing to choose rail transport as an alternative, but this willingness varies for different countries and areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper addresses one of the current problems caused by globalization, namely the obvious tendency of young people to choose food products based on organoleptic features and to disregard nutritional quality, with negative consequences on health. An exploratory marketing research was conducted among students for identifying the perceived importance of the sensorial dimension of food products and understanding key dimensions of buying decision process among youth. SAIN-LIM method was used to determine the nutritional profile of foodstuffs with special organoleptic features. Research results clearly show that in industrial foodstuff there is a gap between product attractiveness, which is based on exceptional sensorial properties, perceived by young consumers and real nutritional value of foods, which frequently translates into unbalanced nutritional profiles. To have a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle, young consumers need to be informed that a tasty and good looking foodstuff is not necessarily healthy. Youth need to be properly educated in order to understand the close relationship between diet, weight and health and to develop a responsible food consumption behavior.","[Onete, Bogdan Cristian; Voinea, Lelia; Filip, Alina; Dina, Razvan] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Voinea, L (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",lelia.voinea@gmail.com,"Filip, Alina/AAR-8642-2021; Dina, Razvan/I-5139-2017; Voinea, Lelia/AAD-5088-2019; Onete, Cristian Bogdan/E-6579-2017","Filip, Alina/0000-0002-4753-9244; Dina, Razvan/0000-0002-9360-4756; Voinea, Lelia/0000-0002-6164-426X;",,,,,23,6,6,1,22,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2014,16.0,36,,,,,470,482,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AT0DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344607400003,0

We test this hypothesis in Bangladesh by examining the creation of industrial policy in the Ready Made Garment (RMG) sector.

The vast majority of these journeys are made by private cars, which has led to traffic congestion and raised levels of air pollution in and around airports. Subsequently, airports are re-evaluating their approach to ground access mode choice and considering how to reduce the reliance on private cars. Based on a survey of passengers at Manchester Airport in the UK, attitude statements pertaining to psychological constructs from the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Norm-Activation Theory, combined with key factors relating to the passenger's trip, are used to identify eight behaviourally distinct groups of passengers with varying potential to reduce their private car use. Two of these groups, described as the Conflicted Greens and the Pessimistic Lift Seekers, are identified as having the greatest potential to reduce private car use to airports. Analysis reveals the need for decision makers to address the existing attitude-behaviour 'gap' that can prevent positive environmental attitudes being translated into the use of more sustainable modes, as well as tackling the perceived difficulty some passengers associate with using these modes.

This paper explores school travel behavior of 11-year old children in Toronto, Canada. In particular, the effects of the neighborhood environment and caregiver-child travel interactions on travel mode choice were studied. Results indicate that the built environment near both home and school locations was associated with the odds of walking. However, predicted built environment effects were less accurate in some neighborhoods. Availability of adults at the time of school travel likely encouraged driving. School transportation interventions that broadly consider school and neighborhood-oriented policies and enable independent mobility may increase walking rates. Presence of spatial autocorrelation in the prevalence of walking suggests that more research is required to understand inter-household similarities in behaviors that are spatially structured.

We combine longitudinal data from the 1996 Survey of Income and Program Participation with data on state-level welfare program rules from the Urban Institute and data on state-level controls to test whether these single mothers were more likely to (1) own a car, (2) be employed, and (3) be off of welfare, depending on the welfare asset rules instituted in their state. We find evidence that, taken as a group, the asset rules have a statistically significant effect on the probability of car ownership. Ordinary least squares results and cross-sectional two-stage least squares (2SLS) results using the asset rules to instrument for car ownership show a large, positive, statistically significant effect of car ownership on employment. However, in 2SLS models controlling for prior car ownership and prior employment, the asset instruments are weaker and we do not find an effect of car ownership on employment. Of significance for policy makers, we find that the asset rules do not have a statistically significant joint effect on welfare participation, even after addressing possible endogeneity.

However, the set of fairness rules is considerably smaller when we control for consistency. Only selfishness and strict egalitarianism seem to survive the stricter consistency requirements. We observe that this result is mainly explained by a self-serving bias. Additionally, we observe that faster decisions are self-interested and decisions dealing with moral trade-off are slower.

We present results from a multisite, mixed-method longitudinal study of the impact of out-of-school time (OST) tutoring on student reading and mathematics achievement that link provider attributes and policy and program administration variables to tutoring program effectiveness. We find that many students are not getting enough hours of high-quality, differentiated instruction to produce significant gains in their learning, in part because of high hourly rates charged by providers for tutoring.

Taking this into account, we estimate the deforestation impacts of these protection types that feature different levels of restrictions. To avoid bias, we compare these protected locations with unprotected locations that are similar in their characteristics relevant for deforestation. We find that sustainable use protection, whose governance permits some local deforestation, is found on sites with high clearing threat. That allows more avoided deforestation than from integral protection, which bans clearing but seems feasible only further from deforestation threats. Based on our results, it seems that the political economy involved in siting such restrictions on production is likely to affect the ability of protected areas to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation.

Using Taylor series expansion of the average marginal utility of consumption, we show that the risk in the consumption of stock market participants can be decomposed into two components, insurable (hedgeable using financial assets) and uninsurable (caused by incomplete consumption insurance) consumption risks. We argue that the growth rate of average consumption may be viewed as a proxy for the insurable component of consumption risk, while the growth rates of the rescaled higher-order cross-sectional consumption distribution moments may be regarded as a multivariate proxy for uninsurable risk in consumption. Exploiting microlevel household quarterly consumption data from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey, we find that both components of consumption risk are significantly priced when the limited stock market participation is taken into account. Neither the insurable and uninsurable components of consumption risk nor the Fama-French risk factors are rejected as capturing important components of systematic risk when tested against each other in an integrated multifactor asset pricing model.

For this purpose, we analyze gazelles in The Netherlands over a 12-year period, annually from 1997 until 2008, and relate them to the dynamics of industry employment. We use a panel vector autoregressive model to explore the relationship between the prevalence of gazelles in an industry and industry employment growth, in an economy-wide dataset including 43 two-digit industries. An increase in the prevalence of gazelles in an industry appears to have a positive effect on subsequent industry growth. We do not find evidence of an inverse causal relationship: there are no long-run positive effects of increases in industry growth on the prevalence of gazelles. There is also no relationship between overrepresentation of gazelles and subsequent industry growth.","[Bos, Jaap W.

The credit default swap (CDS) market was undoubtedly one of the salient new markets of the past decade. In this paper we examine whether the advent of CDS trading was beneficial to the underlying secondary market for corporate bonds. We employ econometric specifications that account for information across CDS, bond, equity, and volatility markets. We also develop a novel methodology to utilize all observations in our data set even when continuous daily trading is not evidenced, because bonds trade much less frequently than equities. Using an extensive sample of CDS and bond trades over 2002-2008, we find that the advent of CDS was largely detrimental. Bond markets became less efficient, evidenced no reduction in pricing errors, and experienced no improvement in liquidity. These findings are robust to various slices of the data set and specifications of our tests. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It develops a model in which taxpayers possess a range of individual characteristics including attitude to risk, potential for success in self-employment, and the weight attached to the social custom for honesty and make an occupational choice based on these characteristics. Occupations differ in the possibility for evading tax. The social network determines which taxpayers are linked, and information about auditing and compliance is transmitted at meetings between linked taxpayers. Using agent-based simulations, the analysis demonstrates how attitudes and beliefs endogenously emerge that differ across sub-groups of the population. Compliance behaviour is different across occupational groups, and this is reinforced by the development of group-specific attitudes and beliefs. Taxpayers self-select into occupations according to the degree of risk aversion, the subjective probability of audit is sustained above the objective probability, and the weight attached to the social custom differs across occupations. These factors combine to lead to compliance levels that differ across occupations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This article positions the increased interest in entrepreneurship since the 1980s within its historical context and highlights the significant methodological problems with its analysis. Taking these problems into account it reevaluates the performance of entrepreneurial firms in terms of innovation, job creation, economic growth, productivity growth, and happiness to show how both positive and negative interpretations can emerge. A pattern of increasingly positive interpretation is observed as one moves from analysis to policy. To address this bias, the article suggests the single category entrepreneurial firms be broken up along a continuum from the large number of economically marginal, undersized, poor performance enterprises to the small number of high performance gazelles that drive most positive impact on the economy. This would allow a more realistic evaluation of the impact of entrepreneurs by avoiding a composition fallacy that assigns the benefits of entrepreneurship to the average firm.","[Nightingale, Paul] Univ Sussex, BMEC, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Coad, Alex] Univ Sussex, Sci & Technol Policy Res SPRU, Jubilee Bldg 379, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Coad, Alex] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark; [Coad, Alex] Ratio Inst, SE-10364 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Sussex; University of Sussex; Aalborg University,"Coad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sci & Technol Policy Res SPRU, Jubilee Bldg 379, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",P.Nightingale@sussex.ac.uk; A.Coad@sussex.ac.uk,"Coad, Alex/H-8938-2012","Coad, Alex/0000-0002-5706-0528; Nightingale, Paul/0000-0002-4155-0880",ESRC [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,124,164,185,2,86,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

To address these challenges and to position for a global RE development, cooperation between the Government, private institutions and civil society, remains imperative. The Tunisian Government tries to develop a larger and an accurate vision to engage Civil Society Associations (CSAs) in the debate of the energy futures of Tunisia. The promotion of RE remains an important purpose, especially as the current situation is marked by the continued surge in oil prices on the international market and the increase of domestic consumption. This research describes CSAs' actions to promote RE and identifies motivations and barriers to their activities. Indeed, despite the increasing literature on RE, the empirical research on it remains scarce. This paper relies on a qualitative research to explore the actions, motivations and barriers to Tunisian CSAs. The results show that the increasing emphasis given recently by Tunisian CSAs to promote RE sources, through a rich variety of activities, is related to a wide range of aspects: environmental, economical, industrial, employability, social and scientific. In light of these aspects, the CSAs show a real motivation to catalyze change towards adoption of these energies. However, Tunisian CSAs face a range of barriers that require timely actions. They are internal, external and related to technology.","[Akermi, Raja; Triki, Abdelfattah] Univ Tunis, Inst Super Gest, Appl Res Business Relationships & Econ Lab, Tunis, Tunisia; [Ben Yahia, Imene] Univ Sousse, High Inst Finance & Taxat, Sousse, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis; Universite de Sousse,"Akermi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis, Inst Super Gest, Appl Res Business Relationships & Econ Lab, Tunis, Tunisia.",rajaakermi@yahoo.fr; imenebenyahia@yahoo.fr; abdel.triki@gmail.com,"yahia, imene ben/AAT-3658-2021","yahia, imene ben/0000-0002-6616-4425",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1994,1999,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300202,0

Many wireless sensor network applications are used in gathering information for military, industrial, and environmental issues. These sensors for example may be deployed in hostile when they collect precise information about the enemy. This deployment introduces several security issues to apply to the sensor network. This encourages researchers to start developing dependable routing protocols, which are suitable for the network sensor. In other words, if the sensors are deployed in a hostile area without protection against attacks, the enemy can attack the network and may start using it for his/her own benefit. Therefore, achieving secure communication paradigm for sensor networks becomes an important issue. This paper develops a new simulator that is used for key management in WSN depending on the development of two other protocols: Trusted BS and pair wise key redistributions. The results show that our protocol outperforms a couple wise key redistributions, and slightly outperforms trusted base station.","[Alkhalaileh, Mohammad Nour Ahmad] Cent Queensland Univ, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia; [Mestarihi, Mohammed] Najran Univ, Najran, Saudi Arabia; [Mohamad, Ibrahim] AL Jouf Univ, Departmen Informat Technol, Preparaty Year Program, Sakaka, Saudi Arabia",Central Queensland University; Najran University; Al Jouf University,"Alkhalaileh, A (通讯作者)，Cent Queensland Univ, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia.",M.ALKHALAILEH@CQUMAIL.COM; MAMESTARIHI@NU.EDU.SA; ibrahimdalabeeh@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,804,812,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300085,0

It is, therefore, possible that financial flexibility - as the farm's debt capacity - will also decrease. The question arises to what extent decision makers consider the effects on the financial flexibility of the individual farm when making their investment decisions. In the present study, farmers are faced with hypothetical investment alternatives in a discrete choice experiment. The investment alternatives presented to the farmers differ in their profitability, risk and effect on the financial flexibility of the individual farm. The results show that financial flexibility is relevant in their investment decisions. The importance farmers attach to the financial flexibility depends, among others, on their risk attitude and the profitability of the farm.","[Anastassiadis, Friederike; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Anastassiadis, F (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fak Agrarwissensch, Dept Agrarokonomie & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",friederike.anastassiadis@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,70,2,2,0,15,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In this respect, the bounds are estimated as stochastic frontiers, where observable industry characteristics, entry barriers and export intensity are allowed to affect the mean and variance of the deviations from the frontier. In accordance with the theory, Type 2 industries have a lower bound for concentration, which is higher than that for Type 1. Besides that, tough price competition leads to a decrease in the lower bound for concentration in both Type industries contrary to the theory. This finding shows that as price competition gets tougher, entry barriers by Type 1, Type 2A and 2R (therefore the relevant non-price competition) are substantially not important. Another finding shows that Custom Union decreases concentration in both types of industries.","[Arvas, M.

Province of Potenza has territorial coordination competences over 100 Municipalities and is mostly characterized by all the mayor natural risks whose potential impacts on the community are very serious in case of disasters. For this reason, an important section of the TCP is dedicated to the risk assessment/management and to the mitigation activities as important actions to be performed also at the urban level. An innovative aspect developed in the TCP is the implementation of the resilience of communities policy in territorial planning, by introducing risks-mitigation directives and recommendations to be applied to the local and urban planning and strategic actions in order to involve the local actors, the private sector and the community itself in the resilience's implementation processes. The TCP gives some inputs to be followed by the Municipalities in their urban planning activities and Municipalities are asked to demonstrate how the urban planning proposals are resilient. For risks active mitigation at local level (namely the structural prevention), the Province will contribute - among the national/regional institutional framework - in seeking to promote or facilitate programs of territorial extraordinary maintenance to be implemented by the local governments, through the identification of possible financial mechanisms and procedural facilitation. The resilience process is accompanied by other territorial policy actions acting on the natural and built environment systems, such as strategies for adaptation to climate change and environmental protection, and by the technical, organizational and knowledge support provided to municipalities in the implementation process over the provincial territory.
