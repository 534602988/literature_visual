We then estimate a simple term structure model under the assumption that investor risk attitude is driven by near-term expectations of the three state variables. When we allow for evolving beliefs about the macroeconomy, the resulting term structure model provides a better fit to the cross section of yields than the benchmark model, especially at longer maturities, and exhibits better performance in out-of-sample predictions of future yield movements.

There are three main points. First, from a normative perspective, the model defines the fundamental market failure to be addressed, namely, that unregulated private money creation can lead to an externality in which intermediaries issue too much short-term debt and leave the system excessively vulnerable to costly financial crises. Second, it shows how in a simple economy where commercial banks are the only lenders, conventional monetary policy tools such as open-market operations can be used to regulate this externality, whereas in more advanced economies it may be helpful to supplement monetary policy with other measures. Third, from a positive perspective, the model provides an account of how monetary policy can influence bank lending and real activity, even in a world where prices adjust frictionlessly and there are other transactions media besides bank-created money that are outside the control of the central bank.","[Stein, Jeremy C.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stein, Jeremy C.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Stein, JC (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Stein, Jeremy/AAA-4003-2019",,,,,,68,255,314,3,118,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The first is the balance of payments concept that is to be adjusted. The candidates are the overall balance of payments, the basic balance, and the current account balance. The latter is the preferred concept; specifically, all countries should aim to keep their current balances within a range of +/- 3% of GDP. The second are the instruments to be used to adjust a payments imbalance. The basic analyses are due to Hume and Meade, for the cases in which the country respectively does not and does use variations in the exchange rate as an instrument to facilitate the adjustment process. The third relates to the question of whether the international community should build some mechanism, besides the threat of reserve depletion, that will encourage its members to pursue adjustment. Most deficit countries already have an incentive to adjust. In contrast, the incentives for surplus countries to adjust are weak and need strengthening, perhaps by permitting trade retaliation for an undervalued exchange rate through the WTO or perhaps by taxation. The United States are the most difficult case because the construction of a suitable incentive for this country would probably be dependent on reform of the reserve supply mechanism.","Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics,"Williamson, J (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC USA.",JWilliamson@PIIE.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

On the contrary, exploratory data analysis suggests that, to the extent that financial reform has made any contribution to developmental outcomes, domestic financial development is unlikely to have been the mediating channel.

Static and accounting micro-simulations are used to build synthetic populations in 2025 and 2050. The main findings of the work are, firstly, that, in spite of the critical increase in the elderly population share predicted by the main national and international economic institutions, the level of income dispersion is not likely to dramatically increase in the coming decades. On the contrary, inequality might be reduced in the next few decades because of the higher educational attainment and female activity rates observed among young cohorts at the present moment. Secondly, an upward shift in pension coverage either through an increase in the share of the population receiving contributory pensions or the establishment of non-contributory old-age benefits could be an effective tool to achieve improvements in income distribution figures.","Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Antón, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.",janton@usal.es,"Antón, José-Ignacio/L-6469-2014","Antón, José-Ignacio/0000-0001-9623-3121",,,,,29,3,4,1,6,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

Although it seems clear that consumers would benefit from referrals, it is not at all clear whether firms would unilaterally provide information about competing offers since such information could encourage consumers to purchase the product elsewhere. In a model of a horizontally differentiated product market with sequential consumer search, we show that valuable referrals can arise in the equilibrium: a firm will give referrals to consumers whose ideal product is sufficiently far away from the firm's offering. We allow firms to price-discriminate among consumers, and consumers to misrepresent their tastes. We found that the equilibrium profits tend to be higher in markets with referrals than in markets without. Consumers tend to be better off in the presence of referrals when search costs are not too low, and under a certain parameter range, referrals lead to a Pareto improvement. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Fueled in part by demographic transitions, unchecked increases in entitlement spending will necessitate some combination of substantial tax increases, elimination of other public spending, or unsustainable public debt. This massive increase in health spending might be warranted if each dollar devoted to the health care sector yielded real health benefits, but this does not seem to be the case. Although we have seen remarkable gains in life expectancy and functioning over the past several decades, there is substantial variation in the health benefits associated with different types of spending. Some treatments, such as aspirin, beta blockers, and flu shots, produce a large health benefit per dollar spent. Other more expensive treatments, such as stents for cardiovascular disease, are high value for some patients but poor value for others. Finally, a large and expanding set of treatments, such as proton-beam therapy or robotic surgery, contributes to rapid increases in spending despite questionable health benefits. Moving resources toward more productive uses requires encouraging providers to deliver and patients to consume high-value care, a daunting task in the current political landscape. But widespread inefficiency also offers hope: Given the current distribution of resources in the US health care system, there is tremendous potential to improve the productivity of health care spending and the fiscal health of the United States.","[Baicker, Katherine] Harvard Univ, Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chandra, Amitabh] Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Skinner, Jonathan S.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Baicker, Katherine; Chandra, Amitabh; Skinner, Jonathan S.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Our analysis also suggests that the level of parent support is important (with a marginal effect larger than that for teacher encouragement) and this level of support may be linked to the parent's level of educational attainment.

In particular, the negative association between the US and NATO average military expenditure on the Italian one suggests a free-rider behaviour of Italy. Eventually, we focus on the relationship between productivity and military expenditure. The results suggest that there is a negative association between productivity and military expenditures in the long run. Namely, if military expenditures were substituted by civilian expenditures, the Italian overall productivity would be expected to improve.","[Caruso, Raul] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Econ Policy, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Francesco, Addesa] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ Sci & Stat DISES, Fisciano, SA, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Salerno,"Caruso, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Econ Policy, Via Necchi 5, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",raul.caruso@unicatt.it,,"Caruso, Raul/0000-0002-9307-5460",,,,,43,17,18,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

While there are institutional explanations for the situation, enterprises and workers' motivations are not clear. Do employers withhold social security contributions for their own profit or do they pay them in higher wages to their workers? Using the variation in the share of social security contributions in wages across enterprises, the study first verifies that in Vietnam, as in many countries, enterprises can shift the burden of social security contributions on wages. In a second step, it searches for evidence that, within a same branch of industry, evading enterprises make higher profits or revenues per worker. While it is clear that enterprises that evade and under-report wages pay higher wages, there is no evidence of employers' appropriation of the unpaid social security contributions. Taking five key policy implications, the conclusion explains that enforcement policies and information campaigns in Vietnam will marginally help expand social security and shrink informal employment and the business practice of under-reporting wages. Consensus-building activities conducive to regulatory changes and coordinated action among policymakers, enterprises and employees are required.","[Trung-Thanh To] Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Ctr Anal & Forecasting, Hanoi, Vietnam",,,paulettecastel@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,7,7,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Questioning that argument, recent evidence suggests that the practice of soccer reveals national cultures of violence prevailing in players' countries of origin. We model violent behaviour in the soccer pitch as a function of game specific controls as well as socioeconomic, political, cultural and conflict variables characterizing players' home countries. We construct a database for the Latin American 2008 Libertadores Cup Competition and find that across multiple specifications and estimating techniques, only game specific variables determine sanctions to violent actions. There are three compatible explanations for this result: highly skilled soccer players may not be representative average citizens; violent conflicts may not necessarily cause a violent culture affecting all corners of society; and even when violent cultures are transmitted to individual players, those values do not condition significantly their behaviour during games. After all, sports may not be a pernicious activity that intrinsically transmits violent values to youths.","[Cuesta, Jose] World Bank, Poverty Reduct & Equity Sect, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Cuesta, Jose] Georgetown Univ, Publ Policy Inst, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Bohorquez, Camilo] World Bank, Latin Amer Social Protect Sect, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; Georgetown University; The World Bank,"Cuesta, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, Poverty Reduct & Equity Sect, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jcuesta@worldbank.org,,"Bohorquez, Camilo/0000-0002-9626-9412",,,,,41,9,10,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To date, SCIC has had to grapple mainly with facilitating the 'equitization' (that is privatization) of large numbers of state-owned enterprises. As yet it is still too early to make a firm assessment of SCIC's performance with regard to either of the above objectives.

In this article, these macro-level estimates are used to explore bivariate cross-country 'wealth-happiness' relationships, focussing on issues of appropriate functional form, parameter stability and outliers. For comparative purposes, 'income-happiness' relationships are also explored. Total wealth turns out to be strongly related to Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, due to the importance of produced and intangible capital, but not to natural capital. In contrast, when the most natural capital intensive countries are excluded as outliers, a strong relationship emerges between Subjective Well-Being (SWB) and natural capital, especially amongst high income countries. In these countries, natural capital seems to be an important wealth correlate of SWB, despite accounting for only a very small proportion of total wealth.","Massey Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Coll Business, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Massey University,"Engelbrecht, HJ (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Coll Business, Turitea Campus,Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",h.engelbrecht@massey.ac.nz,"Engelbrecht, Hans-Jurgen/I-7143-2019","Engelbrecht, Hans-Jurgen/0000-0002-0209-1087",,,,,36,4,4,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

China's nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 3.25 trillion US dollars in 2007, making it the fourth largest economy in the world. At the same time, income inequality has become quite skewed in China, inviting considerable criticism. Moreover, the trend towards greater income inequality persists. Of particular public policy relevance is the effect of income inequality on health disparities in China, particularly for low-income households. This study addresses this issue using a longitudinal dataset from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) over the period 1997 to 2006. Our central finding is that income inequality affects health differently by socioeconomic status: income inequality harms individual health among low income households by more than it does among high income households. More specifically, health is more adversely affected by greater income inequality for households with low incomes. China's central government is committed to making further investments in the health care system. As part of that effort, attention should be directed at low income households to reduce health inequality, possibly providing them with a health insurance safety net similar to Medicaid in USA.","[Fang, Hai] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Hlth Syst Management & Policy, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Prevent Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",Colorado School of Public Health; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Children's Hospital Colorado; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Fang, H (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Hlth Syst Management & Policy, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, 13001 E 17th Pl,Room E3312,Campus Box B119, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",hai.fang@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,,47,10,11,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A sponsor (e.g. the US Department of Defense or the World Health Organization) wants to improve the quality of the winning products. To do so, it partitions its budget between two schemes: an inducement prize and efficiency-enhancing subsidies to the firms competing in the contest. Prizes and subsidies have different functions, and they provide complementary incentives. In the optimally designed contest, subsidies increase while the prize decreases, if the innovation process is more challenging. Further, sensible conditions are identified under which the optimal contest implements either a handicapping scheme (by preferentially subsidizing the underdog) or a national champion scheme (by favoring the favorite).

The models estimated here range from single-equation models, such as those of Engel and Rothbarth, to a complete demand system approach with fixed price effects. The results found in this study favor the generalization of the complete demand system equivalence scales over the other models. Despite the differences in the alternative models, the ranking of households with children and overall populations is insensitive to different equivalence scales and poverty lines used. However, variation in the composition of poor households with children has a different effect depending on the particular choice of equivalence scale. We found that, for households with more than the country's average number of children, poverty incidence is considerably higher than in the population as a whole.","[Garcia-Diaz, Rocio] Tecnol Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Garcia-Diaz, R (通讯作者)，Tecnol Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico.",rociogarcia@itesm.mx,,"Garcia-Diaz, Rocio/0000-0003-1726-2456",,,,,58,0,0,0,21,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Second, the relationship between South Korea and the United States is a true military alliance for all time periods, but the nature of the alliance has changed since the 1970s. Third, although Japan began to form an alliance relationship with the United States in the 1990s, Japan is considered a more significant ally by the United States.

Several consumer groups and non-government organizations (NGOs) in South Korea initiated anti-GM food campaigns. South Korean consumers are reported to be more concerned about potential risk associated with GM food compared to counterpart consumers in the U. S and Europe (KFDA, 2009). Many South Korean food processors and marketers are responding to this consumer concern by ignoring the labeling requirement of GM contents in their products. There is apparent lack of coordination in the South Korean food supply chain regarding GM food management with South Korean consumers' negative attitude toward GM foods and South Korean food suppliers' avoidance of GM food labeling. Despite the apparent benefits of GM food, GM food may not have sufficient market value in the market if consumers have distrust and insecurity toward such product. This paper develops a quantitative model which identifies major determinants of South Korean consumers' choice behavior for GM foods. The proposed model elicit constructs which form South Korean consumers' attitude which in turn affect their willingness to purchase GM foods. Our study developed a socio-cognitive model of South Korean consumers' behavior, using Fishbein's framework, which has two attitudinal constructs (Perceived Benefits and Perceived Risk) and one construct that capture effect of individual respondent's socioeconomic variance (Socio-Economic Status (SES). Consumers' beliefs and attitudes regarding the risks and benefits of GM foods and their individual socio-demographic status are hypothesized to be linked to consumers' choice behavior of GM foods. A sample of 360 consumers was drawn from a survey study in the capital city, Seoul. Results reveal that consumers' Socio-Economic Status (SES) and their Perceived Benefits associated GM food were found to be strong indicators of consumers' GM food purchase intention. This implies that consumer's background and diversity in South Korean demographic may have significant effect on their purchase intention for GM food. This suggests that further extensive study on South Korean consumer market need to be conducted in order to fully understand the difference among various South Korean consumer market segments in terms of how they respond to GM food issues. Comprehensive market segmentation on South Korean consumer market should be done in terms of their GM risk appetite, GM food knowledge, information search behavior and food consumption pattern. Our results show that favorable attributes of GM food such as medical benefits and nutritional enhancement were found to have significant influence on consumers' attitude toward GM food positively. Results show potentials for second generation GM food in South Korea, if specific of consumer benefits can be effectively developed and promoted to South Korean consumers. Regarding Perceived Risk of GM food, uncertainty/ lack of understanding on GM food and potential environmental hazard of GM food were found to affect consumers' attitude toward GM food negatively. Educating consumers about GM food may be a viable strategy to mitigate their concerns about unknown health risks and adverse environmental effects and the communication of scientific uncertainty is critical to improving consumers' negative attitude toward GM foods.","Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 133791, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Kim, RB (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, 17 Haengdang Dong, Seoul 133791, South Korea.",kimrby@gmail.com,"KIM, BOYOUNG RENEE/B-9861-2018",,,,,,60,24,26,3,102,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The impact at national level is assessed using a calorie intake distribution curve. The results demonstrate that the percentage of undernourished population in Sri Lanka is expected to rise rapidly with food inflation on the basis that there is no income increase during the period under consideration.

Examination indicates strong support for the hypotheses that taxed sales in Massachusetts declined due to price increases, changes in income and smuggling. There is very limited support for the hypothesis that tobacco control spending or smoking bans contributed to falling cigarette sales. Possibilities are discussed that may explain why this study does not support most previous studies. These include failure to control for numerous factors that probably also influenced sales, that effects of tobacco control programmes might differ between states and that previous studies examined shorter time periods. It is hoped that this article will foster further examination of these issues so that we can better understand effectiveness of comprehensive tobacco control programmes when formulating recommendations about how governments should allocate their scarce resources towards such programmes.","Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Coll Business, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Marlow, ML (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Coll Business, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",mmarlow@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The use of different network centrality measures allows us to collect evidence in line with so far only conjectured views on the functioning of the Mafia. In particular, we shed light on the extent to which family relationships, community roots and ties, legal and illegal activities predict the criminal ranking of the men of honor,suggesting the main characteristics that can be used to detect criminal leaders.

However this decomposition is not univocally determined, but as it can be calculated after having gathered incomes into groups of close equals, de facto it depends on the bandwidth chosen to split the income parade into contiguous income groups; this means that the bandwidth has to be chosen according to proper criteria: Van de Ven, Greedy, Lambert (VCL criterion) propose to choose the bandwidths where potential redistributive indexes are maxima. However the literature proposes more than one index to measure the potential redistribution of a tax system and the maxima associated to each of them do not necessarily coincide and, moreover, they do not generally show a regular sequence of values leading to the global maxima. The main aim of this paper is to contribute to the problem of defining a proper bandwidth which can split the income parade into close equal groups: VCL criterion is considered together with a minimum criterion recently proposed by Vernizzi and Pellegino (VP criterion). Empirical evidence is obtained by a data set of incomes and taxes collected by two Lower-Silesian revenue offices.

The model predicts that (1) a higher cost of faking lowers the probability of faking; (2) middle-aged and old men are more likely to fake than young men; (3) young and old women are more likely to fake than middle-aged women; and (4) love, formally defined as a mixture of altruism and demand for togetherness, increases the likelihood of faking. The predictions are tested with data from the 2000 Orgasm Survey. Besides supporting the model's predictions, the data also reveal an interesting positive relationship between education and the tendency to fake in both men and women.

J,"Mullins, SD",,,,"Mullins, Steven D.",,,The Unemployment Impact of the 2008 Extension of Unemployment Insurance: As High as Robert Barro Suggested?,ECON JOURNAL WATCH,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,unemployment rate; unemployment insurance,REGRESSION; DURATION; BENEFITS,"The Emergency Unemployment Compensation program created in the summer of 2008 provided for unprecedented extensions in the duration of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. Combined with persistent high unemployment and historically long durations of unemployment during the 2008 and 2009 recession, this extension of UI has prompted renewed interest in the impact of UI benefits on job search, the duration of unemployment, and the unemployment rate. In a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Robert Barro contributed to this discussion by comparing the duration of unemployment observed in the current recession with that of 1982 and estimating how much lower the unemployment rate would have been in the summer of 2010 if it had not been for the extension of the duration of UI benefits. His conclusion, that the unemployment rate would have been 2.7 points lower in the absence of UI extensions, is based on a questionable assumption-that the severity of the 2008-09 recession could not be responsible. This paper uses multiple regression analysis to estimate the impact of extended UI benefits on the unemployment rate after controlling for the severity of the recent recession. The extension of UI is found to have a positive and significant impact on the national unemployment rate, but the impact is not as large as Barro suggests. The UI benefit extensions that have occurred between the summer of 2008 and the end of 2010 are estimated to have had a cumulative effect of raising the unemployment rate by .77 to 1.54 percentage points.","Drury Univ, Breech Sch Business Adm, Springfield, MO 65802 USA",,"Mullins, SD (通讯作者)，Drury Univ, Breech Sch Business Adm, Springfield, MO 65802 USA.",smullins@drury.edu,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,10,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

The paper measures the impact of the economic freedom on the liquidity of stock market of the country. We use the data for 77 countries from 1996 to 2009. The analysis reveals that some of the components of economic freedom have significant positive impact on the liquidity of stock market. When the data is separately taken for the period 2007-2009 (crisis), the results show that the index of economic freedom has significant impact on the liquidity of stock market.

However, a large body of evidence in the medical community suggests that bio-equivalence does not guarantee therapeutic equivalence; in some instances the lack of therapeutic equivalence can lead to fatal consequences for patients switching to generic products. In this paper, we construct a simple model to analyze the implications of therapeutic non-equivalence between branded and generic drugs.

However, the effect can be quite different. The financial indicators of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian listed companies published in their annual reports have been used in order to investigate the impact of capital structure on performance efficiency of the companies. The research included data of only non-financial companies, because the capital structure of financial institutions is specific and the performance efficiency of these companies is affected in completely different way. The research covers the period of 2002 - 2011. Data of 70 companies were used in this research: 28 Lithuanian companies, 14 Estonian companies, and 28 Latvian companies. In order to examine the interaction of capital structure with the companies' performance efficiency, the correlation analysis between the indicators of indebtedness level (long-term financial debt ratio, short-term financial debt ratio, financial debt ratio, non-financial debt ratio) and the following performance indicators: operating profit margin, net profit margin, return on equity, return on assets, liquidity ratio, capital asset turnover and total asset turnover was performed. The p-value was used to verify the reliability of observed correlation. In order to estimate the strength of the influence of indebtedness on performance efficiency of the companies, the multivariate regression analysis was performed. During the regression analysis, the indicators describing performance efficiency of the companies were used as dependent variables and financial and non-financial debt ratios were used as independent variables. The research evidenced that the higher financial indebtedness level affects negatively the profitability ratios of companies in the Baltic countries; also both financial and non-financial debts reduce the liquidity of the companies. It was also found that influence of the debts on the efficiency of asset management is ambivalent: financial debt has a negative impact on capital asset turnover and total asset turnover, but higher level of non-financial debts leads to higher level of the turnover indicators.","Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Norvaisiene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rasa@norvaisiene.org,,,,,,,39,16,19,3,76,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It is shown that the global impact of a small probability event (i.e., its propensity to affect strategic behavior at all states in the state space) has an upper bound that is an increasing function of a measure of discrepancy from the common prior assumption. In particular, its global impact can be arbitrarily large under non-common priors, but is bounded from above under common priors.

The object is analysed from the interdisciplinary viewpoint, i.e. from the perspectives of marketing and public administration. Client motivation is analysed as one of the activities of managing client participation which is essential in seeking client active co-production of public services. A necessity to manage client participation has been in focus of research works but the managing process itself has been scarcely analysed. Research, where managing client participation has been analysed as a purposefully influencing and behaviour-oriented activity, has been lacking. From the marketing viewpoint clients must be motivated to participate actively in co-production of services. Summing up research findings, it is stated that studies, where client motivation has been systematically analysed, are scarce. The influence of the ways of motivating clients to participate actively in co-production of services has not been evaluated either (active participation is understood as productive and beneficial public service clients' activities by providing the necessary resources). Problem question raised: How (in what ways) to motivate clients so that they became active co-producers of services? Research object: Ways of motivating clients employed by the public service providers. Aim of the research: Having defined the concept of motivating clients to participate in public services to identify the ways of motivation employed by the public service providers and to rank these ways by the strength of influence on activeness in participation. In the first part of the paper managing of client participation in public services is defined and the role of client motivation in it is showed. Further, the concept of motivating clients is defined and clients` motives to participate in public services are identified. Research methodology is presented. The research field, neighbourhoods of Lithuania, was chosen. Personal purposeful interviews were conducted to identify the ways of motivating. Employees only of those neighbourhoods, where population participation in services is of a relatively high level, were drawn to the sample. Real clients of public services were surveyed to establish the relationship between the ways of motivating and activeness in participation. The paper is concluded by presenting the identified material and non-material ways of motivating employed in practice in Lithuanian neighbourhoods and the findings of qualitative research - the relationship among particular variables. Ranks of the ways of motivating by the strength of influence on a dependent variable, i.e. client activeness in participation, are presented. The following conclusions are drawn: motivation is established as identification of motives for client behaviour and employment of suitable material and non-material ways seeking to motivate clients to participate as the co-producers of public services. Material and non-material ways of motivating clients employed in practice in the neighbourhoods have been identified. Most often employed ways of motivating: appreciation expressed by the elder in person; appreciation/congratulation in public events; events as a reward for participating in co-production of public services, etc are presented. It has been identified that non-material ways of motivating more strongly correlate with the level of client participation in services than the material ones.","[Petukiene, Evandzelina; Tijunaitiene, Rigita; Damkuviene, Milda] Siauliai Univ, LT-76285 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Petukiene, E (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Vilniaus Str 88, LT-76285 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",eva@smf.su.lt; rigita@smf.su.lt; milda.d@smf.su.lt,"Damkuvienė, Milda/JKS-3202-2023","Damkuvienė, Milda/0000-0002-8104-9337; Petukiene, Evandzelina/0000-0002-0557-5343",,,,,32,4,4,4,41,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The findings are in line with the ideas of the classical economist Thomas Malthus, who envisioned a society in which environmental limits crucial for livelihood bind, leading to a Malthusian trap for the society. It is easy to dismiss Malthus as painting an unrealistic global future or to say that his forecast has so far not materialized, but the evolving problem of global warming provides reasons for concern. If our biosphere were to decline drastically due to global warming, no substitute could soon take our biosphere's place. If only to be prudent, it is incumbent upon us to take stock of Malthus. We can gain insight by considering the modeling literature on collapse in resource economics. The literature explains the evolution of the historical societies and attempts to solve their problem. This literature offers a gloomy outlook, although the situation is not hopeless. There are things we can do to avoid a Malthusian outcome for the global society.","Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Reuveny, R (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rreuveny@indiana.edu,,,,,,,112,16,18,0,52,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4704-8,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

While most states have passed laws restricting deficits, the nature and strictness of these laws vary greatly. States with more stringent balanced budget restrictions run more procyclical fiscal policy. We use the diversity in these laws as an instrument for the cyclicality of policy. We find evidence that a more counter-cyclical primary deficit increases a state's average growth rate per capita. This effect is robust to a number of alternative specifications.

The analysis of potential benefits from education is extended beyond the traditional approach by taking into consideration, apart from wage premium, also non-financial factors, e.g. social status or the lifestyle combined with the job. Inclusion of both financial and non-financial return to education allows for a comprehensive explanation of educational decisions taken by individual agents. The proposed way of modelling educational decisions is an extension to the model proposed by Mahseredjian, Cannings, Montmarquette (2002), by including a vector representing the expected non-financial return to education, weighted by the probability of being employed. The decomposition of the individual expected return to higher education into a financial and a non-financial part allows to avoid the bias in the estimation of the parameter representing the remuneration increase attributable to the subsequent years of studies. For the purposes of the empirical verification of the proposed model, typology of the major fields of study in the Polish educational market was prepared, based on the literature review and available database. The model was partly tested by the application of Mincerian equation, and the hypothesis about the influence of college majors on the financial return to education was confirmed. Estimations show that the highest future financial benefits are yielded by science and engineering, which is a good hint both for university candidates and policymakers. The initial analysis of the results has confirmed the expectations of the authors. It is the first step towards a full econometric verification of the proposed model.","[Szreder, Malgorzata] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,,malgorzataszreder@gmail.com; k.kalisiak@gmail.com; bialowas.kaja@gmail.com; tszapiro@sgh.waw.pl,"Szapiro, Tomasz/J-8020-2017",,,,,,16,2,2,0,10,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2012,,5,,,,,555,576,,,,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,063TQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313025300003,0

By sorting themselves into firms with homogeneous work forces, workers can ensure that they suffer less from social comparisons. Competition promotes choice and thus facilitates sorting. However, competition also boosts rent differences in the labor market, because firms cannot curb internal inequity among its employees without losing workers to competitors. To reduce their exposure to social comparisons, workers might engage in inefficient sorting into unemployment. Consequently, social preferences can have strong effects (i.e., unemployment) in a competitive labor market, whereas they only have a slight impact on labor-market outcomes in a monopsony.","Univ Amsterdam, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"von Siemens, FA (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Kruislaan 403, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",f.a.vonsiemens@uva.nl,,,,,,,44,17,18,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

That this is not an idle question is shown by the fact that we spend an enormous amount of time in our lives following stories: telling and listening to them; reading them; watching them on television or in films or on stage. Despite their recurrent similarity and even predictability, we continue to enjoy them. The paper brings to bear on this question two different strands of current literature in experimental psychology: the literature on aesthetic preferences, and the literature on curiosity and interest. The paper discusses how, in the case of storytelling in particular, though also of creative activities in general, there are two types of curiosity at work: explorative curiosity - associated with investigating new ideas for the simple joy of it and regardless of source - and specific curiosity, corresponding to focused exploration and aimed at solving problems for which the accuracy and relevance of information is of importance. In both cases curiosity is felt as an intensely pleasant experience, which is affected not only by external, but also by the internal stimuli of novelty and challenge. But how does interest/curiosity solidify into preferences that have stability enough to guarantee guidance yet sufficient flexibility to allow for change? The answer explored here highlights the distinction between comfort goods and activities and creative goods and activities. The latter, which allow for complexity, variety and multiplicity of dimensions have a transformative power that allows also for sustained stimulation and interest. The broader aim is to analyze the behavior of individual preferences - how they form, how they stabilize, how they change - in the consumption not only of art, the usual focus in discussion of aesthetic preferences, but also of all those goods and activities that can be called creative.","Univ Cassino, Cassino, Italy",University of Cassino,"Bianchi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino, Cassino, Italy.",marina.bianchi@unicas.it,,,,,,,98,2,3,3,36,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,DEC 22,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201444.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-44,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CL4AX,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356895700001,0

A high sacrifice ratio means a large loss of gross domestic product (GDP) or employment for a given reduction in inflation. In order to estimate the cost of adjustments in inflation rates by the sacrifice ratio, we apply, firstly, a structural vector autoregressive technique following Cecchetti and Rich and, secondly, one by Ball based on historical disinflationary episodes. Our findings indicate that most countries have sacrifice ratios of between -1 and 2 per cent of real GDP for a reduction in inflation of one percentage point. In some cases, these estimates deliver negative sacrifice ratios.","[Belke, Ansgar] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Business Adm & Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] Inst Study Labor, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] Monetary Experts Panel European Parliament, B-1047 Brussels, Belgium; [Boeing, Tobias] European Univ Viadrina, Fac Business Adm & Econ, D-15234 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; IZA Institute Labor Economics; European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder,"Belke, A (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Business Adm & Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",ansgar.belke@uni-due.de,,,,,,,22,5,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

First, we employ micro-level data on individual scores on the Big Five personality test and personal financial real estate preferences to evaluate the role of personality in individual real estate market-related preferences. Empirical results provide solid evidence for an association between personality traits and individual preferences on a series of housing tenure, mortgage, and real estate investment attributes. Moreover, based on cross-sectional state-level aggregate personality scores and macro real estate market indicators, we find evidence indicating that the detected micro-level personality-preferences association conveys macro consequences on real estate market equilibrium outcomes. Research findings thus provide a new perspective for understanding individual preferences and equilibrium outcomes in the real estate market. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The most important was undoubtedly the institutional, political, and economic transformation of countries and the world economy, due to globalisation, the transformation in Central and Eastern Europe, and the international financial and economic crisis. The other factors were developments in economics as a discipline in general and comparative economics in particular. Of particular interest in the latter case was the appearance of the so-called new comparative economics (NCE) at the beginning of the century. The NCE approach was originally applied to the analysis of an extensive international database related primarily to fundamental economic institutions such as ownership, finance, law, government, and regulation. These changes interacted in fostering the evolution of the traditional approach and research issues of comparative economics.","[Dallago, Bruno] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy; [Dallago, Bruno] Res Unit Local Dev & Global Governance, New York, NY USA",University of Trento,"Dallago, B (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Trento, Italy.",bruno.dallago@unitn.it,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Using data on 2677 pairs of father and children from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), we construct the counterfactual income of children from poor families if they had the same characteristics as children from rich families. We propose an instrumental variable quantile regression-based method to solve the endogeneity problem and decompose the rich dad effect on income inequality into the composition effect and the income structure effect We find that the composition effect explains at least 80% of the income difference at any quantile, and it explains all the income difference at the top four deciles. Income structure effect has a significant impact only at quantiles between 20% and 40%, where it explains about 20% of the income difference. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This article briefly reviews two main theories of tax compliance ('deterrence' and 'non-deterrence'), before discussing the recent rapid rise of natural field experiments (NFEs) in this area. These NFEs represent a 'win-win' for policy-makers and academics, since they can test theories while also evaluating the impact of a specific intervention in the real world. The evidence from NFEs shows that deterrence approaches improve compliance, while the case for non-deterrence approaches is less conclusive at the moment. NFEs could be improved by paying more attention to findings from behavioural science that apparently incidental factors, such as timing, framing, and complexity, substantially affect whether compliance occurs or not. New directions for future studies include: network effects, tax payments (in addition to declarations), the behaviour of firms, the provision of public goods, and the relationship between attitudes and behaviour.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Hallsworth, M (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England.",m.hallsworth11@imperial.ac.uk,,"Hallsworth, Michael/0000-0002-7868-4727",,,,,101,76,83,1,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of parental job loss on their children's health, using six waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey covering the period from 1991 to 2006. We find that paternal job loss has a significant negative effect on children's health, while maternal job loss has no significant effect. The rationale behind the findings is that the income loss resulting from maternal job loss is much smaller; meanwhile, the unemployed mothers are likely to increase their time inputs to child care, and this may alleviate the negative effect of maternal job loss. Our findings from a fixed effects model are robust to various specifications and alternative approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Between 1987 and 2008, French firms laying off workers aged over 50 had to pay a tax to the unemployment insurance system, known as the Delalande tax. In 1999, the measure was subjected to a reform that increased the tax, but only for large firms. We find that this exogenous increase substantially raised firms' incentives to train workers aged 45-49 but had no impact on the training rates among workers aged over 50. From a simple model with endogenous firing and training decisions, we give a theoretical illustration of these results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this article I discuss how experimentation can be used to shape education policy moving forward. I first discuss how well-designed experiments can both build upon and inform a general framework for the education production function. Experiments within this framework can be particularly powerful when they draw on a wide range of disciplines including child development, psychology, and behavioural economics. Insights from these areas can help identify underlying mechanisms of the education production function and inform the design of interventions in ways that increase (cost-) effectiveness. Additionally, I argue that there should be a rich array of experiments in education, ranging from lab-like basic research to policy-level efficacy trials. Finally, I discuss the policy-maker's role in integrating experimentation into policy decision-making, including how to address concerns commonly raised with experimentation in education.","Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Sadoff, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",ssadoff@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,99,13,14,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We use high frequency daily position data for NYMEX crude oil, heating oil, RBOB gasoline, and natural gas that are available from a representative large commodity index fund (the Fund) from February 13, 2007 through May 30, 2012. Simple correlation tests, difference-in-means tests, and Granger causality tests generally fail to reject the null hypothesis that changes in Fund positions are unrelated to subsequent returns in all four energy futures markets. We also fail to find any evidence that Fund positions are related to price movements in the WTI crude oil futures market using Singleton's (2014) long-horizon regression specification. Our results suggest Singleton's original finding of significant impacts and high levels of predictability may be simply an artifact of the method used to impute crude oil positions of index investors in a particular sample period.

Their analysis focuses on (i) assessing the dependence structure of the markets when extreme events occur, and (ii) checking the validity of the conclusion by Merton (On the Pricing of Corporate Debt: The Risk Structure of Interest Rates, 1974) and other similar structural models that there is an intensification of the relationship between stock prices and credit spreads after large negative shocks in the value of firms' assets. The authors show that there is a large tail dependence between the two portfolios. However, the dependence structure seems to be similar with respect to positive and negative innovations in the indexes. Their findings suggest that credit models' implications do not apply to financial firms, likely because the implicit subsidies from governments to financial institutions are distorting the dependency structure.","[da Silva, Paulo Pereira] Portuguese Secur Commiss, Lisbon, Portugal; [Rebelo, Paulo Tomaz; Afonso, Cristina] Bank Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal,"da Silva, PP (通讯作者)，Portuguese Secur Commiss, Lisbon, Portugal.",paulosilva@cmvm.pt; ptrebelo@bportugal.pt; cmafonso@bportugal.pt,"da Silva, Paulo Pereira/P-4634-2019; da Silva, Paulo Miguel Pereira/L-2349-2018","da Silva, Paulo Pereira/0000-0003-4774-128X;",,,,,26,0,0,0,15,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 11,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201439.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-39,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CL4AK,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356894200001,0

As a result, it is urgent that the business operating bottleneck be overcome and some strategies be implemented. These include dumping the conventional operating model, reducing basic operating costs, increasing the profit margin, and seeking alliances with companies from the same sector, relevant sectors, or even different sectors. In fact, exhibition and travel markets have originally been separate but with the booming of travel activities, more convenient transportation, greater accommodation and food options and the flourishing of local cultural attractions, the distinction between exhibition and travel has become less apparent. For the travel industry to compete for the market, providing simple travel-related services is no longer enough. Nowadays, travel agencies have to provide custom-tailored travel packages for companies or even pluralistic travel service consultations to attract clients. The study randomly sampled 500 subjects from the Taipei Travel Exhibition and asked them to complete a questionnaire. Of these, 342 valid responses were returned (68% response rate). The study found that the most emphasized aspects are the exhibition environment, followed by professional capacity, market demand, and the exhibition industry. The results of the survey clearly show that the environment is the most important aspect for holding an International Travel Fair. Of the 13 evaluation indicators, the top five most valued, in descending order, are software and hardware facilities, public relations and marketing, government's planning policy, visibility, and knowledge and skills.","Chung Hua Univ, Dept Tourism & MICE Management, Hsinchu 30012, Taiwan",Chung Hua University,"Chang, IY (通讯作者)，Chung Hua Univ, Dept Tourism & MICE Management, 707,Sec 2,Wu Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30012, Taiwan.",bomplady@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,1,1,1,16,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Bubbles and crashes are a quite robust phenomenon in experimental settings. Motivated by demand-control policies employed in the Chinese real-estate market, we explore the effects of permanent and short-term caps on individual asset holdings. We find that permanent caps greatly reduce positive bubbles, but tend to generate negative bubbles in later periods. Under short-term caps, on the other hand, neither positive nor negative bubbles are observed.

Adopting the capability approach, which Amartya Sen developed to address concerns such as poverty, inequality and development, we shift the focus of analysis and discussion around evaluating academic research and academics in the social sciences from measures of so-called quality', impact' or excellence' to the capabilities of academics. For us, the conceptualization and evaluation of academic research is a question about what academics have reasons to value, and about their ability to achieve valuable beings and doings. It is also about determining what might constitute academic poverty, and what academics are required to do in order to avoid that poverty. Relating our analysis to debates around universities, in particular about quasi-market pressures, we identify the possibility of basic capabilities in academic research, namely: the capabilities that are necessary to fulfill basic academic needs. Our proposition is that there is academic poverty when an academic researcher is not capable of fulfilling basic academic needs, such as: adhering to standards of coherence, robustness and rigour; searching for and disseminating the spirit of the truth. Moreover, if the academic has the capabilities to fulfill those basic academic needs and yet chooses not to do so, she renders herself in a state akin to academic poverty.","[Mooken, Malida] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Sugden, Roger] Univ British Columbia, Fac Management, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada",University of Stirling; University of British Columbia,"Mooken, M (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",malida.mooken@stir.ac.uk; roger.sugden@stir.ac.uk,"Mooken, Malida/AAO-2193-2021","Mooken, Malida/0000-0003-1567-3825",,,,,93,5,6,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2014,67.0,4,,,,,588,614,,10.1111/kykl.12069,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AR8AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343797400006,0

Cuts in the public investment programme crowd in private investment, but are associated negatively with the net exports ratio.

Despite this relationship, several international assessments have highlighted that in every country there are a relevant number of resilient students, i.e. students from a disadvantaged socio-economic background who achieve relatively high levels of performance in terms of education. In this paper, the determinants of resilience in the Italian educational system are investigated through the analysis of data from the OECD-PISA 2009 cycle, with a specific focus on the role of school-level variables that could help more students perform to a higher standard. The aim is to target a specific category of resilient students, namely those from a low socio-economic background at both family and school level, proposing an innovative statistical procedure to derive a sample of disadvantaged students attending disadvantaged schools. After this, a multilevel logistic approach is adopted to determine which specific characteristics of students, families and schools tend to give disadvantaged students a higher probability of becoming resilient students. Our results confirm that individual-level characteristics play a role, but also that some school factors (i.e. extra-curricular activities and school leadership) are equally involved, suggesting policy- and management-related implications.

Data from 135 Israeli companies over a five-year period confirm the model's main prediction. Our empirical analysis shows that when the CEO is the chairman of the board of directors and thus is more powerful in affecting his compensation scheme, he achieves a high PPS in good periods (in terms of corporate performance), compared to similar powerful CEOs in periods of bad performance, and also compared to less powerful CEOs in good periods.

We show that international tax coordination is more likely to prevail if the degree of asymmetry in terms of productivity differences between countries is smaller, or if concealment costs of profit shifting are larger when the tax authorities adopt grim-trigger strategies. Allowing for renegotiation in the tax harmonization process requires more patient tax authorities to implement tax harmonization as a weakly renegotiation-proof equilibrium. In this case, we find somewhat paradoxical situations where higher costs of profit shifting make tax harmonization less sustainable.","[Eggert, Wolfgang] Univ Freiburg, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Eggert, Wolfgang] Univ Munich, Inst Econ Res, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Itaya, Jun-ichi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan",University of Freiburg; University of Munich; Hokkaido University,"Eggert, W (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Bertoldstr 17, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany.",wolfgang.eggert@vwl.uni-freiburg.de; itaya@econ.hokudai.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25285089, 22243004] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,21,4,4,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Models of ambiguity aversion suggest that, under ambiguity, comparative compensation schemes may become more attractive than independent wage contracts. We test this by presenting agents with a choice between comparative reward schemes and independent contracts, which are designed such that under uncertainty about output distributions (that is, under ambiguity), ambiguity averse agents should typically prefer comparative reward schemes, independent of their degree of risk aversion.

First the existence of the unique equilibrium state is proved under general price and cost function forms. Conditions are derived for its local asymptotical stability with both continuous and discrete time scales. The global dynamic behavior of the systems is then numerically examined, demonstrating that the continuous system is globally asymptotically stable without delay and in the presence of delay if the delay is sufficiently small. Then stability of the continuous system is lost via Hopf bifurcation. In the discrete case without delay, the steady state is locally asymptotically stable if the speed of adjustment is small enough, then stability is lost via period-doubling bifurcation. If the delay is one or two steps, then stability loss occurs via Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, this study confirmed the view of bidirectional relationship between credit and economic growth.

We also find that: i) breaking down net external debt into its gross asset and liability counterparts does not add significant explanatory power to crisis prediction; ii) the current account is a powerful predictor; iii) foreign exchange reserves reduce the likelihood of crisis more than other foreign asset holdings; and iv) a parsimonious probit containing those and a handful of other variables has good predictive performance in- and out-of-sample.

We investigate whether distance still matters for online trade in physical goods. We use data from an online consumer survey panel on online cross-border trade in goods in a linguistically fragmented EU market. The analysis confirms that distance-related trade costs are greatly reduced compared to offline trade in the same goods. However, language-related trade costs increase. Moreover, online trade introduces new sources of trade costs such as parcel delivery and online payments systems. On balance, there are no indications that online trade is less biased in favour of home market products than offline trade. We examine options available to policy makers to boost cross-border e-commerce in the EU Digital Single Market. A 1% increase in the use of efficient and flexible cross-border payment systems could increase cross-border e-commerce by as much as 7%. We also show that online trade gives a comparative advantage to English-language exporting countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Comparing heterodox models of firm-level capital expenditures across the advanced and largest developing economies,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Internal/external finance; Capital formation; Financialisation,RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; CASH FLOW; FIXED INVESTMENT; INTERNAL FINANCE; FINANCIALISATION; PANEL; CHOICE,"Smith, Ricardo, Marx and Keynes never claimed that stock markets were critical funding conduits for a firm's capital expenditures. While Adam Smith had a rather poor opinion of the joint-stock form of business organisation, classical economists generally saw accumulated profits as the primary source of funding for capital investment. Keynes famously remarked in the General Theory that the 'capital investment needs of a nation' would likely be 'ill served' by stock markets. Prior empirical studies of financialisation found a deleterious impact from stock buybacks on capital investment; however, they did not match buybacks against new stock issuances. Using an unbalanced panel of firms located in China, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan and the USA from 1998 to 2008, classical, post-Keynesian and financialisation models of firm-level investment were specified and estimated across the seven economies as well as individual countries. Net stock issuance is found to have a positive impact on real investment when estimated across all models and observations. Between the classical and post-Keynesian models, profitability, internal and external finance, macroeconomic demand as well as net stock issuance were positively related to capital expenditures; capital intensity in the classical model exhibited a negative association across all countries. For the financialisation model, interest and dividend payments were inversely associated with capital expenditures but not consistently so for individual countries. Macroeconomic growth had a consistently positive impact for most advanced economies, affirming the critical role played by aggregate demand in heterodox theories of business investment.","[Hecht, Jason] Ramapo Coll, Mahwah, NJ 07430 USA",Ramapo College New Jersey (RCNJ),"Hecht, J (通讯作者)，Ramapo Coll, Anisfield Sch Business, Mahwah, NJ 07430 USA.",jhecht@ramapo.edu,,,Anisfield Research Fellowship Award,Anisfield Research Fellowship Award,"Ramapo College of New Jersey.

The analysis shows that, while there is no case for BTA when all instruments can be freely deployed, Pareto-efficiency does require a form of BTA when carbon taxes in some countries are constrained: its purpose then is to partly counteract the impact on emissions of inappropriate carbon pricing there, or, equivalently, to undo the trade distortions such pricing creates. The required form of BTA is generally complex, but a special case is identified in which it optimally has the simple structure envisaged in practical policy discussions. It is also shown that the efficiency case for BTA depends critically on whether climate policies are pursued by carbon taxation or by cap-and-trade. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

China, as the world's biggest food producer, has the fastest growing share of fish and shellfish exports to these countries. While there have been an increasing number of studies conducted on consumer demand for various food product attributes, little research has focused on producer behavior, and studies on Chinese food producers are especially absent in the literature. The objective of this study is to assess Chinese aquaculture producers' willingness-to-change (WTC) and adopt certain production practices related to food safety. Producer preferences for enhanced food safety measures, and sustainable/eco-friendly production practices are assessed using a choice experiment. Primary data was collected in the leading aquaculture producing provinces of southern China. The average net income per farmer of our sample was 81,286 RMB/year of which approximately 72% originated from their aquaculture operation. Derived WTC estimates from a random parameters logit model suggest that the representative Chinese producer would require a 2.49% premium per jin of fish to adopt enhanced food safety practices such as those required for China GAP, and No Public Harm voluntary certifications and they would accept a 3.22% discount before being indifferent between having an antibiotic-free facility and using antibiotics. WTC estimates of sustainable eco-friendly practices and verification by various entities were also assessed. A latent class model (LCM) is used to segregate producers into groups with similar underlying characteristics to develop policies to improve producer practices and ultimately product safety and quality.

We show that a model which incorporates market power can rationalize observed prices and trade flows. We highlight how different features of the LNG market limit the ability and/or incentive of other players to engage in arbitrage, including constraints in LNG shipping.

We experiment with four of the most important global MRIO systems available, analyzing the sensitivity of a set of aggregate CO2 multipliers to aggregations in the MRIO tables used to calculate them. Across databases, we find (a) significant sensitivity to background system detail and (b) that sub-sectors contained within the same aggregate MRIO sector may exhibit highly different carbon multipliers. We conclude that the additional information provided by the extra sector detail may warrant the additional costs of compilation, due to the heterogeneous nature of economic sectors in terms of their environmental characteristics.","[Steen-Olsen, Kjartan; Hertwich, Edgar G.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway; [Steen-Olsen, Kjartan; Hertwich, Edgar G.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Owen, Anne] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Lenzen, Manfred] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys A28, Ctr Integrated Sustainabil Anal, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Leeds; University of Sydney,"Steen-Olsen, K (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway.",kjartan.steen-olsen@ntnu.no,"Lenzen, Manfred/D-3161-2013","Lenzen, Manfred/0000-0002-0828-5288; Hertwich, Edgar/0000-0002-4934-3421; Owen, Anne/0000-0002-3872-9900",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,29,115,121,1,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

This paper hypothesizes that the secular shift in land tenure was an adaptation to the change in land utilization system towards more intensive cropping. To test the hypothesis we exploit a dataset gathered from the rent collection archives of Confucius' Lineage in the Qing Dynasty. We estimate the effect of the adoption of wheat-soybean double cropping on the choice of tenancy contract, share contract versus fixed-rent contract. We find that double cropped plots were 23.7% more likely to be managed under fixed-rent contracts than annually cropped plots. Our findings are consistent with the implications of the factor endowment theory. The adoption of double cropping made farming more complex and placed greater demands on managerial inputs of tenants. In the absence of a factor market for managerial ability, optimal tenancy contract had adapted to provide tenants with a greater incentive to supply managerial inputs than had been the case in sharecropping arrangements.

Using weekly data for the period 2005 to 2010, our results reveal that the wavelet MRA is able to reconstruct the effects of major extreme shocks on stock returns of studied markets, such as the Asian financial crisis, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Moreover, the wavelet-based global Hurst exponent indicates the presence of long-term dependencies in stock returns of all the considered markets, except for France where the anti-persistent behaviour is detected.

Conventional wisdom suggests that the depreciation of the exchange rate, inflation and economic turmoil are the suspects. Nonetheless, while these factors cease, why does the gold price still stay around hikes? The gold market belongs to a global arena. Different from other commodities, its participants include the national central banks worldwide. However, surprisingly, the role played by these tremendous market participants' gold holdings on the gold price has been ignored in past empirical works. This research focuses on central banks' gold holdings to explore who upholds the surging gold price. Several interesting outcomes are derived. First, our empirical evidence shows an inverse phenomenon relative to news reports from the mass media that the gold holdings of central banks worldwide in fact continuously descend. Second, the mainstream countries of the world have not played a main role in the rising trend of the gold price in the recent decade; instead, newly emerging industrialized countries' central banks' gold holdings show their significant power in explaining causality to gold price fluctuations. Third, the reason for the persistent gold buying behaviour of emerging economies may be because the increase in the gold price delivers a kind of short squeeze effect to the central banks of emerging countries.","[Chen, Ku-Hsieh; Lee, Joe-Ming; You, Cheng-Huan] Fo Guang Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Jiaosi Township, Taiwan",,"Chen, KH (通讯作者)，Fo Guang Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Jiaosi Township, Taiwan.",khchen@mail.fgu.edu.tw,"Chen, Ku Hsieh/IJF-6060-2023",,,,,,42,2,2,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

During our 1990-2003 sample period, PERS calculates each member's retirement benefit using up to three different formulas (defined benefit (DB), defined contribution (DC), and a combination of DB and DC), and PERS pays the maximum benefit for which the member is eligible. We show that this maximum benefit calculation results in average ex post retirement benefits that are 54% higher than if they had been calculated using only the DB formula and that employees receiving DC benefits are significantly more likely than employees receiving DB benefits to retire before the plan's normal retirement age. Monte Carlo simulations verify that the higher costs could have been predicted at the start of our sample period. Exploiting exogenous plan changes, we show that employees respond to within-year variation in their retirement incentives and, consistent with peer effects, that they respond more strongly to these incentives when more of their coworkers face similar incentives. Finally, consistent with the emerging literature on financial mistakes by households, we show that a small but noteworthy fraction of retirees would have benefited from shifting their retirements by as little as one month.

In tests for differences in risk of bankruptcy and of breaching regulatory standards, risk is found to be greater for credit unions with broader field-of-membership types. These differences in risk appear to derive from greater earnings volatility and lower ROA and net-worth ratios at community and multiple-bond credit unions. These differences in risk decline with greater asset size.

The proposed models are different from the Holmstrom and Milgrom's models (1987) because of the consideration of equity preference, which emphasize the material utility and equitable distribution of customers. By assuming that the incentives that firms pay to customers have the same effect on monetary incentives, the optimal incentives are discussed, in which the equilibrium solutions are explored and the respective impact of horizontal equity preference and vertical equity preference on CP incentives are compared. The proposed models are validated by numerical experiments in the product enhancement project of a large software enterprise in Guangzhou. It can be demonstrated that 1) asymmetric information induces lazy behaviors of customers concerning vertical equity preference; 2) horizontal equity preference promotes the work enthusiasm of customers in CP more than self-interest does; and 3) it is more conducive to obtain a much bigger expected income when firms employ customers with horizontal equity preference to participate in innovation process.

Gilboa and Schmeidler axiomatized the maxmin decision rule in an environment where acts map states of nature into simple lotteries over a set of consequences. This approach presumes that objective probabilities exist, and, furthermore, that the decision maker is an expected utility maximizer when faced with risky choices (involving only objective probabilities). This paper presents axioms for a derivation of the maxmin decision rule in a purely subjective setting, where acts map states to points in a connected topological space. This derivation does not rely on a pre-existing notion of probabilities, and, importantly, does not assume the von Neumann and Morgenstern (vNM) expected utility model for decision under risk. The axioms employed are simple and each refers to a bounded number of variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, this study uses survival analysis to show that being in jobs with a performance pay element increases the likelihood of health deterioration, ceteris paribus.","[Bender, Keith A.; Theodossiou, Ioannis] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland; [Bender, Keith A.; Theodossiou, Ioannis] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr European Labour Market Res, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"Bender, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Edward Wright Bldg,Dunbar St, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.",kabender@abdn.ac.uk; theod@abdn.ac.uk,"Bender, Keith/AAF-6225-2020","Bender, Keith/0000-0001-9409-3129",,,,,39,24,25,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We construct 7651 dynamic multivariate networks, where the nodes correspond to different EU countries and the links weight the Granger-causality between the variations of the respective electricity prices. Global connectivity is then characterized by the system's density, or the total quantity of causal interactivity sustained by the network system, which informs about the occurrence of abnormal changes in connectivity. We report a considerably large peak lasting from October 2011 to April 2012, where the graph's density over-basal jump reached a magnitude of 2.4 times, suggesting an improved degree of connectivity of electricity markets during this period. By applying the Markov regime-switching model on the network density we find that this change coincides with the implementation of the European Commission's Third Energy Package. At the local level, the in-strength values quantifying the dependence of the electricity price variation of an EU country on other countries, validate the reliability of our technique by verifying historical events such as the occurrence of interconnectors commissioning and market coupling. On the path to full market integration, market networks should be periodically monitored. Our model, which is able to create a time-varying network describing the evolving influences between the European electricity prices, is able to detect important changes in market integration and can be considered a suitable and promising approach for this task.

It is meant to unify evaluations and comparisons of welfare (living standards) for individuals and populations of possibly different sizes and preferences. It can be used for policy evaluation, international comparisons, growth assessment, and inequality measurement. It even makes it possible to evaluate policy options that affect the size of the population or the preferences of its members. We study how to extend the theory of social choice in order to select such orderings on a rigorous axiomatic basis. We provide foundations for leximin as well as additively separable criteria. Key ingredients in this analysis are fairness principles in social aggregation, attitudes with respect to population size, and the bases of interpersonal comparisons. We discuss how this sheds light on recent developments in the empirical literature on international comparisons.","[Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Tadenuma, Koichi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Princeton University; Hitotsubashi University,"Fleurbaey, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,"Fleurbaey, Marc/HHS-9231-2022",,,,,,64,16,16,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In the basic setting, the underlying risky asset is assumed to evolve according to geometric Brownian motion, but this is generalised to the case of a Markov regime switching process. A similarity transformation is used to reduce a pricing problem with K regimes to the solution of K coupled one dimensional PDEs, resulting in a considerable gain in computational efficiency. The methodology developed is flexible in the sense that it can calculate the cost of hedging for a variety of different withdrawal strategies by investors. Cases considered here include both optimal withdrawal strategies (i.e. strategies which generate the highest possible cost of hedging for the insurer) and sub-optimal withdrawal strategies in which the policy holder's decisions depend on the moneyness of the embedded options. Numerical results are presented which demonstrate the sensitivity of the cost of hedging (given the withdrawal specification) to various economic and contractual assumptions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Trend increases in productivity reinforced by process innovation are an important source of reduction of employment requirements for a given output, but the growth of demand for the old products tends to overcompensate these displacement effects. The switch of production towards new products does not reduce employment requirements, and the growth of the demand for the new products is the strongest force behind employment creation. Reallocation due to business stealing is estimated at a maximum of one third of the net employment created by product innovators.

However, using disaggregated, employer-employee level data, and allowing for the endogenous assignment of workers to firms due to match-specific productivity, we find that the premium paid to workers at exporting firms is economically and statistically insignificant, as is the differential impact of trade openness on the wages of workers at exporting firms relative to otherwise identical workers at domestic firms. We also find that workforce composition improves systematically in exporting firms, in terms of the combination of worker ability and the quality of worker-firm matches, post-liberalization.

When economic integration is low and local connectivity is high, informal norms control entrepreneurial behavior and more integration mainly improves search for investment opportunities. At a higher level of economic integration neighborhood enforcement deteriorates and formal institutions are needed to keep entrepreneurs in check. A gradual take-off to perpetual growth is explained by a feedback effect from investment to the formation of long-distance links and the diffusion of knowledge. If formal institutions are weak, however, the economy does not take off but stagnates at an intermediate income level. Structurally, the equilibrium of stagnation differs from balanced growth by the presence of many small firms with low productivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

China has been provoked into speeding RMB internationalization; that is, opening up domestic financial markets to reduce its dependence on the US dollar for invoicing trade and making international payments. However, despite rapid percentage growth in offshore financial markets in RMB, the Chinese authorities are essentially trapped into maintaining exchange controls (reinforced by financial repression in domestic interest rates) to avoid an avalanche of foreign capital inflows that would threaten inflation and asset price bubbles by driving nominal interest rates on RMB assets down further. Because a floating (appreciating) exchange rate could attract even more hot money inflows, the People's Bank of China should focus on keeping the yuan/dollar rate stable so as to encourage naturally high wage increases to help balance China's international competitiveness. However, further internationalization of the RMB, as with the proposed Shanghai pilot free trade zone, is best deferred until world interest rates rise to more normal levels.","[McKinnon, Ronald] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Schnabl, Gunther] Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Stanford University; Leipzig University,"McKinnon, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mckinnon@stanford.edu; schnabl@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,25,24,26,5,142,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2014,22.0,3,,,,,1,35,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12066.x,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AH6ZI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336281000001,0

This study contributes to the decomposition literature in three ways. First, it disaggregates drivers of energy demand into technological progress and demand for energy services, represented in terms of useful energy, allowing us to estimate their contributions independently - an improvement over other economy-wide decomposition studies. Secondly, this approach reduces the ambiguity present in many previous measures of structural change. We delineate structural shifts into two separate measures: changes in fuel mix within a given resource or service pathway; and changes in mix among distinct energy resources or end-use services. Finally, this study applies decomposition methods to energy and emission trajectories from two mutually informing perspectives: (i) primary energy resources - crude oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear, and renewables; and (ii) end-uses of energy services - residential and commercial buildings, industry, and transportation. Our results show that technological improvements and energy conservation are important in meeting climate goals in the first half of the coming century; and that nuclear and renewable energy and CCS technology are crucial in meeting more stringent goals in the second half of the century. We examine the relative roles of the drivers in reducing CO2 emissions separately for developed and developing regions. Although the majority of energy and emission growth - and by extension the greatest opportunities for mitigation - will occur in developing countries, the decomposition shows that the relative roles of the five drivers are broadly consistent between these two regions.

Results for the countries democratizing during the Third Wave suggest that democratization has a negative overall effect on conflicts. Democratization does not affect conflicts for territories, but significantly reduces internal civil conflict over the control of the government. The effect sets in after democratization and appears to be persistent. The democratization scenario in terms of violence during the transition has an effect on subsequent conflict for government. Countries with a violent transition to democracy experience shorter spells of peace than countries with a peaceful transition to democracy.

How can China successfully make the shift from the current dollar peg regime to a more desirable regime, whether a basket peg or a floating regime? To answer this question, we develop a dynamic small open economy general equilibrium model. We construct four transition policies based on a basket peg or a floating regime and compare the welfare gains of these policies relative to maintaining the dollar peg regime. Two main results are derived from the quantitative analysis using Chinese data from 1999Q1 to 2010Q4. First, following a gradual adjustment to a basket peg regime is the most appropriate path for China to take, with minimal welfare losses associated with the shift in the exchange rate regime. Second, a sudden shift to the basket peg is the second best solution, and is superior to a sudden shift to floating because the monetary authority can efficiently determine optimal weights to attach to currencies in the basket to achieve policy goals once they adopt a basket peg regime.","[Yoshino, Naoyuki] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Kaji, Sahoko] Keio Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo 108, Japan; [Asonuma, Tamon] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Keio University; International Monetary Fund,"Yoshino, N (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan.",nyoshino@adbi.org; tasonuma@imf.org,,"Yoshino, Naoyuki/0000-0001-8060-5314",,,,,28,8,8,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2014,22.0,3,,,,,36,55,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12067.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AH6ZI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336281000002,0

We pay particular attention to issues of unobserved heterogeneity bias in our estimations. We find that both general experience and occupational tenure have statistically and numerically significant effects on wage outcomes, even after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. Job tenure on the other hand only seems to matter in OLS regressions that do not control for heterogeneity biases. Once these biases are controlled for, only a modest effect from job tenure remains. The inclusion of occupational tenure in the estimating equation tends to negate even this modest job tenure effect. The only exception to this is for workers in large organizations. For these workers a small but statistically significant effect from job tenure remains, even once we have controlled for heterogeneity and included occupational tenure in the estimating equation.

Since the end of the Second World War, trade has tended to be concentrated among developed countries, breaking the pattern of complementarity among industrialized countries and developing countries from the first wave of globalization. Elsewhere, agricultural exports from developing countries to countries of similar income have significantly increased since the 1990s. To compare and explain the evolution of different trade directions, the present article estimates the gravity equation for the bilateral volume of agri-food trade, analyzed separately in four categories of trade flows based on the development level of countries. Specifically, we have used the UN-COMTRADE database to construct a data panel for bilateral trade among 30 reporting countries and 39 partner countries with a significant presence in international markets for the period 1963-2000. The following conclusions can be extracted from the present study. Firstly, while other types of trade, such as manufactures, enjoyed greater multilateral liberalization of their markets, strong market intervention caused them to base their growth on the proliferation and success of regional trade agreements in the North. As a result, agri-food trade concentrated progressively on developed economies. Secondly, the latest liberalization of some preferential trade agreements gave rise to new increases in agricultural trade, this time in South-South flows. Finally, the negative sign of income demand elasticity for imports of agricultural products from Southern countries demonstrates that the latter behaved like inferior goods and also explains why the export growth of such countries suffered a brake on such expansion.","[Serrano, Raul] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Business Adm, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Pinilla, Vicente] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Appl Econ & Econ Hist, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Serrano, R (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Business Adm, Gran Via 4, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",raser@unizar.es; vpinilla@unizar.es,"Serrano, Raul/H-7441-2015; Pinilla, Vicente/H-4331-2015","Pinilla, Vicente/0000-0003-2256-8898",,,,,62,8,8,0,27,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

Cross-sectional patterns are driven by biases from declining arrival cohort skill level and departures of negatively selected return migrants. We show that assimilation patterns vary substantially across sending countries and persist in the second generation.","[Abramitzky, Ran] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Abramitzky, Ran; Boustan, Leah Platt] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Boustan, Leah Platt] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Eriksson, Katherine] California Polytech State Univ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Abramitzky, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041022] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,65,184,242,4,62,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

Another study argued that if monetary volatility could impact the demand for money, so can output volatility (as a measure of economic uncertainty). Both measures of uncertainty can cause people to reallocate their assets between cash and real assets that are less risky. If public become more cautious about the future, they will hold more cash today. However, if they chose to hedge against uncertain prices, they may hold more real assets and less cash. These two hypotheses are tested for Asian countries using bounds testing approach. While both measures are found to have short-run significant effects on the demand for money in almost all countries, the short-run effects last into the long run in half of the countries. Furthermore, we find positive and negative effects of both measures which are in line with previous research related to a few developed countries.","[Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen] Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Xi, Dan] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of International Business & Economics,"Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",bahmani@uwm.edu,,,,,,,41,8,9,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

This paper examines this issue for Tunisia by applying the bounds testing (ARDL) approach to cointegration for the period from 1970 to 2008. The bounds tests suggest that the variables of interest are bound together in the long run when foreign direct investment is the dependent variable. The associated equilibrium correction is also significant, confirming the existence of a long-run relationship. The results also indicate that there is no significant Granger causality from FDI to economic growth, from economic growth to FDI, from trade to economic growth and from economic growth to trade in the short run. Even though there is a widespread belief that FDI can generate positive spillover externalities for the host country, our empirical results fail to confirm this belief for the case of Tunisia. They go against the generally accepted idea considering the positive impact of FDI on economic growth to be automatic. The results found for Tunisia can be generalized and compared to other developing countries which share a common experience in attracting FDI and trade liberalization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Rather, improvements in institutional quality are hypothesized to increase income mobility by allowing entrepreneurs the freedom to pursue their dreams. This paper is the first to empirically analyze the institutional determinants behind entrepreneurship, and their effect on income mobility. The findings from a cross-country analysis suggest that secure property rights and less corruption are associated with less income persistence, leading to higher income mobility, independent of the Great Gatsby effect. This suggests that reducing corruption and protection of property rights increase income mobility through the channels of entrepreneurship.","Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Boudreaux, CJ (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, 113 Collegiate Loop, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",cjb09f@my.fsu.edu,,"Boudreaux, Christopher/0000-0002-7098-7184",,,,,58,27,30,0,34,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

One would therefore expect that charitable organizations could benefit from peer-to-peer fundraising if they were able to persuade donors to do so for them. However, little is known on the costs and benefits of asking donors to fundraise. We investigate this by implementing a field experiment embedded in an online giving organization's web page. In our experiment, donors who have completed an online transaction were randomly asked to share having donated by posting on their Facebook (FB) wall or by sending a private message to a friend on FB. To further explore the impact of incentives on the willingness to fundraise, donors were also assigned to one of three treatments in which the organization added either $0, $1 or $5 in the donor's name in exchange for sharing the information. We have several findings: (1) Donors respond to incentives: larger add-on donations increase the willingness to post having made a donation. (2) Nuisance costs may be important: willingness to post is over two times higher among those already logged into FB. (3) The type of ask matters: willingness to post via one's wall or via a private message is different. (4) There are benefits to incentivizing peer-to-peer fundraising in increased new donations.

We pay particular attention to distinguishing the roles of residential and non-residential, biological fathers as well as stepfathers. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that adolescent boys engage in more delinquent behavior if there is no father figure in their lives. However, adolescent girls' behavior is largely independent of the presence (or absence) of their fathers. The strong effect of family structure is not explained by the lack of paternal involvement that generally comes with fathers' absence, even though adolescents, especially boys, who spend time doing things with their fathers usually have better outcomes. There is also a link between adult delinquent behavior and adolescent family structure that cannot be explained by fathers' involvement with their adolescent sons and is only partially explained by fathers' involvement with their adolescent daughters. Finally, the strong link between adolescent family structure and delinquent behavior is not accounted for by the income differentials associated with fathers' absence. Our results suggest that the presence of a father figure during adolescence is likely to have protective effects, particularly for males, in both adolescence and young adulthood.","[Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] IZA, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Tekin, Erdal] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, IZA, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Tekin, Erdal] NBER, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University of Melbourne; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Tekin, E (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, IZA, POB 3992, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",tekin@gsu.edu,"Cobb-Clark, Deborah/H-1153-2013","Cobb-Clark, Deborah/0000-0003-2895-7886",,,,,34,23,41,8,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Fixed transaction-costs influence firms' decision to participate in the permits market, while variable transaction-costs affect firms' output choice by creating a wedge between buyers' and sellers' opportunity cost of using permits. Thus, permit grandfathering can be used as a strategic trade instrument even when firms are price takers in the permit markets.

The paper provides a rigorous empirical analysis of this relationship in a comprehensive cross-country panel by decomposing the emissions and GDP series into their growth and cyclical components using the HP filter. Focusing on the cyclical components, four robust facts emerge: (1) Emissions are procyclical. (2) Procyclicality of emissions is positively correlated with GDP per capita. (3) Emissions are cyclically more volatile than GDP. (4) Cyclical volatility of emissions is negatively correlated with GDP per capita.

Our empirical results suggest that home-country IPA tend to be more effective in promoting outward FDI in politically risky host countries. However, this finding depends on whether the home-country firm is listed or unlisted. More specifically, we find that the positive effect of home-country IPA on outward FDI in politically risky countries is limited to unlisted home-country firms, which tend to be less productive.","[Hayakawa, Kazunobu] Bangkok Res Ctr, Inst Dev Econ, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Lee, Hyun-Hoon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Chunchon 200701, South Korea; [Park, Donghyun] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines",Kangwon National University; Asian Development Bank,"Hayakawa, K (通讯作者)，Bangkok Res Ctr, Inst Dev Econ, 16th Floor,Nantawan Bldg,161 Rajadamri Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",kazunobu_hayakawa@ide-jetro.org,"Hayakawa, Kazunobu/T-9427-2019; Hayakawa, Kazunobu/HZM-4324-2023","Hayakawa, Kazunobu/0000-0003-0032-9060",,,,,38,6,6,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Next, we endogenously detect the shifts in these dynamic correlation levels using a penalized contrast methodology. Accordingly, we find positive level shifts in all correlations following the US crisis. The upward trend in all CDS correlations holds during the eurozone debt crisis, but positive changes in correlations are not flagged as level shifts by the model, except in a few cases.

The main contribution of this paper is that we develop an analytical framework motivating the firm-market volatility relationship. We present three new findings on volatility. First, we discover significant evidence of common volatility; for 12 out of 14 sectors, market volatility has a statistically significant effect on firm volatility for at least 50 percent of firms. Second, we discover significant evidence of size effects: for small-sized firms, there is weak evidence of commonality in volatility, while for large-sized firms there is high evidence (for as much as 75 percent of firms) of commonality in volatility. Third, we find that market volatility predicts firm volatility for firms belonging to five of the 14 sectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Money's role in monetary policy has been tertiary, at best. Indeed, several influential economists suggest that money is irrelevant for monetary policy because central banks affect economic activity and inflation by (i) controlling a very short-term nominal interest rate and (ii) influencing financial market participants' expectation of the future policy rate. I offer an alternative perspective: Money is essential for monetary policy because it is essential for controlling the price level, and the monetary authority's ability to control interest rates is greatly exaggerated.

We find that except for the price of rice which is stable and the price of wheat flour which slightly increases, all other food prices including soybean oil, poultry meat, pork, beef and mutton, decline in response to money expansion. This mainly results from a relatively larger stimulating effect of money expansion on supply to that on demand.

We took fear of failing as a proxy for risk aversion and applied our analysis to the most important Latin American economies. We observed that being male, having more years of formal education and believing to have the necessary skills to develop a new venture decreased the probability of feeling a fear of failing and, thus, eventually increased the probability of developing a new venture. Age affects risk quadratically (first positively, but after some point, negatively), and if there is a prior experience of having shut down a business, risk aversion increases, that is, the probability of feeling a fear of failing, which reduces the probability of becoming an entrepreneur.","[Sepulveda, Jean P.] Univ Desarrollo, Sch Business & Econ, Concepcion, Chile; [Bonilla, Claudio A.] Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad del Desarrollo; Universidad de Chile,"Sepúlveda, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Desarrollo, Sch Business & Econ, Concepcion, Chile.",jeansepulveda@udd.cl,"Bonilla, Claudio A./P-4777-2016","Sepulveda, Jean/0000-0001-6826-9477",,,,,39,21,26,1,88,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Different scenarios of a sender-receiver game allow us to show not only that disclosing conflicts of interest ex post does not induce more deception but also that a 50% chance of subsequent disclosure significantly reduces deception in the case in which the sender obtains a small gain at the expense of a comparatively big loss for her counterpart.

We propose new measures for the aggregate economic (in)security related to employment risk, that take into account the household composition: a per-earner amount corresponding to the aggregate equivalent expected loss, and the inactive-unemployed dependency rate (IUDR), i.e. the average number of persons not in the labor force that each unemployed has to provide for (beyond herself). Both have a simple interpretation but the latter has an advantage in terms of data-requirement. Our results suggest that the overall level of insecurity associated with similar unemployment and replacement rates increases if we consider all the individuals in the households that are potentially affected by this risk.

We estimated the potential disequilibrium between demand and supply under the construction-size-limitation policy, demonstrated that the efficient movers' subsidy increases along with the household income, and simulated the changes in housing demand when tax policy is changed.

The number of cases filed to the ICC Court of Arbitration in connection with Korea outweighs those of Japan and China during last decade. For the understanding of Korean commercial arbitration, authors construct the conceptual model of arbitration, where two types of intentions, the intention of dispute resolution and resolution intention by arbitration, are closely related to sustainable transactions in the context of Korean trade. The conceptual model of arbitration also includes the speed of arbitration and the fairness of the arbitral award as moderating variables, since both variables are expected to have a non-negligible effect on the trader's intentions of dispute resolution and the intention related with the choice of arbitration. Our findings show that two types of intentions have an impact on the intention of sustainable transactions. Furthermore, the fairness of the arbitral award has moderating effects on the relationship between the two types of intentions of dispute resolution and the intention of sustainable transaction decreases as the fairness of the arbitral award increases. On the other hand, the speed of arbitration does not influence the relationship between the two types of intentions of dispute resolution and the intention of sustainable transactions. These results have important implications for Korean traders. First, Korean traders perceive that arbitration is an effective resolution device. Second, unlike the usual argument of the rapidity of arbitration, Korean traders do not perceive that the arbitration is speedy.","[Chung, Yongky-Un] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Chunchon, South Korea; [Ha, Hong-Youl] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Int Trade, 30 Pildong Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Kwang-Soo] Soongsil Univ, Dept Global Commerce, Seoul, South Korea",Kangwon National University; Dongguk University; Soongsil University,"Ha, HY (通讯作者)，Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Int Trade, 30 Pildong Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",ykchung@kangwon.ac.kr; hyha@dongguk.edu,"Kim, Kyung Sik/I-5501-2015; Ha, Hong-Youl/F-3445-2018",,,,,,41,1,1,0,11,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Numerous explanations of the dynamic growth in Asia have been put forward, including the 'new structuralist' approach proposed by Lin (2012). This paper examines the various explanations of what these countries did to unleash their growth potential. Industrial policy and market intervention are two such explanations. While the dynamic Asian economies did not flout the Washington Consensus, they adapted it in different ways. The policies that they followed under the Beijing Consensus allowed them to proactively follow pro-business policies. They also exploited the concepts of economic statism or state capitalism, which became an integral part of what became known as the 'Asia model'.","Woosong Univ, Inst Asian Business, Solbridge Int Sch Business, Taejon, South Korea",Woosong University,"Das, DK (通讯作者)，Woosong Univ, Inst Asian Business, Solbridge Int Sch Business, Taejon, South Korea.",Dilip.Das@solbridge.ac.kr,,,,,,,29,2,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

It consists in introducing general specifications for the elasticities of the crucial functions defining the aggregate equilibrium dynamics of the model. This allows us to study how market distortions influence the range of values for the elasticity of input substitution under which local indeterminacy and bifurcations occur, highlighting the main channels and classes of distortions responsible for indeterminacy. Most of the specific market imperfections considered in the related literature are particular cases of our framework. Comparing them we obtain several equivalence results in terms of local dynamic properties. Applying this methodology to the Woodford [30] framework we find that distortions in the capital market, per se, do not play a major role. We further show that, for empirically plausible values of elasticity of substitution between inputs, indeterminacy requires a minimal degree of distortions. This degree seems to be high under output market distortions, while with labor market distortions the required degree is empirically plausible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We derive a simple sufficient condition for which the optimal retirement age always increases with life expectancy. Numerical assessment reveals that for realistic parameter values that reflect the situation in industrialized countries, the optimal retirement age indeed increases with life expectancy and the sufficient condition tends to be fulfilled. Together with the fact that the actual retirement age did not increase in industrialized countries over the last decades, while there have been large improvements in longevity, this leads us to conclude that strong monetary and institutional incentives for early retirement exist and these counteract the effects of increasing life expectancy. Our policy conclusion is that the retirement age should be partially linked to life expectancy and that incentives for early retirement should be removed.","[Prettner, Klaus; Canning, David] Harvard Univ, Ctr Populat & Dev Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Prettner, K (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",klaus.prettner@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,"Canning, David/A-1917-2008","Canning, David/0000-0003-4041-1229; Prettner, Klaus/0000-0002-8971-8750",,,,,59,26,31,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Still, prima facie evidence of beta-convergence is often found in the CEE data. To reconcile this seeming paradox, we sketch out and test empirically a hybrid model of regional growth that draws on the regional Kuznets curve and incorporates aspects of cumulative causation and neoclassical convergence. In both CEE and the 'old' EU15, regional convergence is strongly linked to the level of national development, non-linearly. But while in the EU15 convergence speeds-up at intermediate/high levels of development, in CEE we find divergence at intermediate levels of national development and no significant return to convergence thereafter. Although this may show that overall development levels are not sufficient yet to mobilise regional convergence, it is also possible that non-convergence is attributable to centripetal forces instigated by the process of transition.","LSE, European Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Monastiriotis, V (通讯作者)，LSE, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",v.monastiriotis@lse.ac.uk,", Vassilis/AAI-9243-2021",", Vassilis/0000-0003-3709-3119",,,,,50,31,32,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

(ii) Turnout in elections is positively related to the importance of social interactions. (iii) Voting may exhibit bandwagon effects and small changes in the electoral incentives may generate large changes in turnout due to signaling effects. (iv) Signaling incentives increase the sensitivity of turnout to voting incentives in communities with low opportunity cost of social interaction, while the opposite is true for communities with high cost of social interaction.

Several well-known tests are applied to identify nonlinearity in the current account time series. The analysis reveals that while the classical unit root tests based on linear specification give rise to conflicting results as to the nonstationarity of the current account deficit series, a threshold unit root test due to Caner and Hansen (2001) fails to reject the null of nonstationarity, implying that the intertemporal budget constraint would not be satisfied in the long run.

Through the use of Explanatory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA), we aim to present an original study in a spatial context, in which the empirical analysis considers recently available firm-level geo-referenced data, as well as data from the Economic Census of 2009. We use global and local spatial statistics in order to identify, quantify, and locate spatial clusters of firms and their employment composition. By doing so, we aim to show the existence of hot-spot areas with strong dynamics of innovation activities. The analysis identifies the most innovative regions based on seven spatial clusters of large-size establishments across the country distributed primarily in urban and metropolitan areas. This study contributes to a better understanding of the prevailing conditions of innovation clusters in the country and may help in the design of specific innovation policies tailored to firm size and for specific sectors aiming to accelerate the regional innovation process. It also provides guidance to policymakers eager to promote the development of local economies and identify where regional innovation systems need to be developed, financed, and designed.","[Flores Segovia, Miguel Alejandro; Villarreal Gonzalez, Amado] EGAP Gobierno & Polit Publ, Tecnol Monterrey, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Segovia, MAF (通讯作者)，EGAP Gobierno & Polit Publ, Tecnol Monterrey, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",miguelflores@itesm.mx; amado.villarreal@itesm.mx,,,,,,,62,0,0,0,29,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

In this article I present and analyse a new data set for the average height of adult male birth cohorts, from the mid-nineteenth century to 1980, in 15 European countries. In little more than a century average height increased by 11 cm-representing a dramatic improvement in health. Interestingly, there was some acceleration in the period spanning the two world wars and the Great Depression. The evidence suggests that the most important proximate source of increasing height was the improving disease environment as reflected by the fall in infant mortality. Rising income and education and falling family size had more modest effects. Improvements in health care are hard to identify, and the effects of welfare state spending seem to have been small.","[Hatton, Timothy J.] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Hatton, Timothy J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Essex; Australian National University,"Hatton, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",hatton@essex.ac.uk,,,,,,,73,69,78,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

For this, we consider a general rule that depending on the coalition, a signal (or an information partition) is assigned to each member of the coalition. We set examples showing that Grodal's (Econometrica 40:581-583, 1972), Schmeidler's (Econometrica 40:579-580, 1972) and Vind's (Econometrica 40:585-586, 1972) core characterizations of a continuum economy may fail in this general informational setting. However, under mild assumptions on the rule, we extend Schmeidler's and Vind's results to economies that allocate information to agents in each coalition according to the rule.

An important part of this discussion can be summarized in three mutually exclusive hypotheses: the constant trend, the level shift, and the slope shift hypotheses. In this article we propose the characterization of a country's economic growth path according to these break hypotheses. We address the problem in two steps. First, the number and timing of trend breaks is determined using new structural change tests that are robust to the presence, or not, of unit roots, surpassing technical and methodological concerns of previous empirical studies. Second, conditional on the estimated number of breaks and break dates, a statistical framework is introduced to test for general linear restrictions on the coefficients of the suggested linear disjoint broken trend model. We further show how the aforementioned hypotheses, regarding the economic growth path, can be analyzed by a test of linear restrictions on the parameters of the breaking trend model. We apply the methodology to historical per capita gross domestic product for an extensive list of countries. The results support the three alternative hypotheses for different sets of countries.

This study builds on this knowledge and explores how prescription behaviour is affected when choices are made in different contexts, where the conflicting roles as agents for the patient and agents for society are stressed. A total of 309 Danish GPs were randomly allocated to one of three versions of a web-based questionnaire, which included a discrete choice experiment. Mixed logit models in willingness to pay (WTP) space were estimated with and without accounting for stated attribute non-attendance. Results show that the GP's role as agent for his patients is clearly strengthened in the presence of national recommendations. In contrast, when recommendations are not present and when GPs face a patient who is currently taking an expensive albeit effective medication, the GP takes on his role as agent for society. We find no evidence of status quo bias in such a setting, with a majority of GPs opting for a medication which offers less certainty about effectiveness at lower cost.","[Pedersen, Line Bjornskov; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Business & Econ, Ctr Hlth Econ Res COHERE, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Pedersen, Line Bjornskov] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, Res Unit Gen Practice, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Riise, Julie] Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Hole, Arne Risa] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England; [Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ Queensland, Australian Ctr Econ Res Hlth, Herston Q, Qld 4006, Australia",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; University of Bergen; University of Sheffield; University of Queensland,"Pedersen, LB (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Business & Econ, Ctr Hlth Econ Res COHERE, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark.",lib@sam.sdu.dk,"Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/A-3161-2011; Hole, Arne Risa/JNE-2362-2023","Hole, Arne Risa/0000-0002-9413-8101; Pedersen, Line Bjornskov/0000-0001-6804-2045; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/0000-0003-1137-2304",,,,,28,10,11,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We also test whether this association varies according to a father's educational level. We find that the number of parental leave weeks available to fathers and high rates of benefit are positively associated with fathers' childcare time. This is generally robust when taking into account country and year as fixed effects, and other country-specific variables such as female employment rates. The magnitudes of the coefficients are economically significant. For example, high parental leave benefits compared to none are associated with an increase of almost 1 h per week in paternal childcare time. This relationship between benefit rate and time spent on childcare is strongest for highly educated fathers. They also benefit the most from exclusive 'daddy weeks' whereas the positive association of transferable leave to paternal childcare is solely driven by lowly educated fathers.","[Boll, Christina; Leppin, Julian; Reich, Nora] Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Leppin, Julian] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Reich, Nora] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",University of Kiel; University of Hamburg,"Boll, C (通讯作者)，Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Heimhuder Str 71, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",boll@hwwi.org,,,,,,,103,43,49,4,71,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Yet, the remunerations of capital and labor are not affected by these taxes similarly, and their shares in earned incomes are not uniform across households. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the incidence of carbon taxes on inequality by considering simultaneously the commodity and the income channels. We propose a decompositicin of the change in individual welfare metrics. Then, we develop a general equilibrium model to assess the impact of carbon taxes on factor and commodity prices, and subsequently their distributional impact on households, using the Lorenz and concentration curves and the Gini index. Our results suggest that changes in factor prices and changes in commodity prices (especially those of energy commodities) have opposing effects on inequality. Carbon taxes tend to reduce inequality through the changes in factor prices and tend to increase inequality through the changes in commodity prices. Hence, we find a non-monotonic (U-shaped) relationship between carbon taxes and inequality. Our results suggest that the traditional approach of assessing the impact of carbon taxes on inequality through changes in commodity prices alone may be misleading. The findings cast light on the desirability of using both channels in the assessment of carbon taxes on inequality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates this question by focusing on a key economic right for women: property rights. The basic hypothesis is that the process of development (i.e., capital accumulation and declining fertility) exacerbated the tension in men's conflicting interests as husbands versus fathers, ultimately resolving them in favor of the latter. As husbands, men stood to gain from their privileged position in a patriarchal world whereas, as fathers, they were hurt by a system that afforded few rights to their daughters. The model predicts that declining fertility would hasten reform of women's property rights whereas legal systems that were initially more favorable to women would delay them. The theoretical relationship between capital and the relative attractiveness of reform is non-monotonic but growth inevitably leads to reform. I explore the empirical validity of the theoretical predictions by using cross-state variation in the US in the timing of married women obtaining property and earning rights between 1850 and 1920.","[Fernandez, Raquel] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Fernandez, Raquel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fernandez, Raquel] CEPR, London, England; [Fernandez, Raquel] Univ Oslo, ESOP, Oslo, Norway; [Fernandez, Raquel] IZA, Bonn, Germany",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Oslo; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Fernández, R (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA.",Raquel.fernandez@nyu.edu,,,,,,,48,43,48,7,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

In a second phase (1990-1992), external political actors initiated an extensive exchange of academic personnel. Finally, the third phase (1990-1995) consisted in a simultaneous transfer of West German academic structures and personnel to East German universities. The result was the integration of East German higher education institutions into the West German academic system without many of their academics. Excluded from the university, a few middle-aged East German scholars established an active parallel scholarly structure and thereby created what could be considered as the only institutional innovation during the transformation process. But due to the obvious need for reforms of the adopted West German academic system, the end of the transfer process to East Germany in 1995 did not mean a return to routine. The transfer process was only a prelude to further reforms like New Public Management and finally the Bologna Process, but these reforms showed no traces of the vanished communist academic system. This article reconstructs this unique transformation process following its structural, personal and cognitive dimensions.","[Hechler, Daniel; Pasternack, Peer] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Higher Educ Res, Halle, Saale, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Hechler, D (通讯作者)，Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Higher Educ Res, Halle, Saale, Germany.",daniel.hechler@hof.uni-halle.de; peer.pasternack@hof.uni-halle.edu,"Hechler, Daniel/G-9206-2019",,,,,,37,2,2,2,7,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Moreover, consent interacts with other moral values, including consequences, in a pluralistic system of morals that depends on the context.

Both static and dynamic panel data regressions are used by applying fixed effects and generalized method of moments (GMM) methods. In addition, non-linear regressions, LAD regressions, and split-sample regressions are employed. The empirical analysis finds that profit affects growth negatively, but growth affects profit positively. The negative effect of profit on growth has not been reported previously. We interpret the result to imply that institutional environment has effects on the relationship between firm growth and profit. Another noteworthy finding is that the effect of growth on profit is found to be positive only in the case of old firms, not in the case of young firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

With Asian countries not wanting to rely solely on the IMF again, the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) was created in 2000. When the CMI also proved inadequate following the global financial crisis, it was first multilateralized (CMIM), and then doubled in size to US$240bn, while the IMF de-linked portion was increased to 30 percent of the available country quotas. A surveillance unit, the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office, was set up in 2001. These are impressive developments, but are they enough to make the CMIM workable? Without clear and rapid-response procedures to handle a fast-developing financial emergency, we argue that it is unlikely that the CMIM will be used even as a complement to the IMF. To serve as a stand-alone option, however, its size or the IMF de-linked portion of funds needs to be further increased, as does its membership, to add diversity. Only if the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office can develop into an independent and credible surveillance authority would it then perhaps be in a position to lead the next rescue.","[Menon, Jayant] Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Hill, Hal] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Asia & Pacific, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Asian Development Bank; Australian National University,"Menon, J (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines.",jmenon@adb.org; Hal.Hill@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,10,6,7,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Using data from a national stated preference survey, this paper presents a study of the potential consumer demand for V2G electric vehicles. In a choice experiment, 3029 respondents compared their preferred gasoline vehicle with two V2G electric vehicles. The V2G vehicles were described by a set of electric vehicle attributes and V2G contract requirements such as required plug-in time and guaranteed minimum driving range. The contract requirements specify a contract between drivers and a power aggregator for providing reserve power to the grid. Our findings suggest that the V2G concept is most likely to help EVs on the market if power aggregators operate either on pay-as-you-go basis (more pay for more service provided) or provide consumers with advanced cash payment (upfront discounts on the price of EVs), rather than imposing fixed requirements on participants.

In this regard, the paper quantifies the impact of debt on the real standard of living whether we define it merely as the ability to consume, or broadly as the sum of multiple criteria including, for instance, the quality of the environment. This quantification uses data from the economy of the Czech Republic; however, this method can be in principle used for other national economies, but must be adjusted to reflect the specific features of their development. Using the analysis of time series, the paper investigates some other aspects of the debt situation of families in the Czech Republic, especially the development of the relationship between families' savings and debt, and finds that debt prevails over savings in the long run. Several conclusions for the future can be derived from these results. These conclusions can be summarized in a statement that future political representations will have to continuously bridge the gap between the need to reduce the standard of living of large groups of the population on the one hand, and the need to make sure that the necessary reforms are politically viable on the other hand.","[Smrcka, Lubos; Arltova, Marketa] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Smrcka, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",smrckal@vse.cz; arltova@vse.cz,"Smrcka, Lubos/AFV-1635-2022; Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018","Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171; Arltova, Marketa/0000-0001-7313-6927",,,,,14,1,1,0,11,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

We consider optimal mitigation policy when climate damages follow a geometric Brownian motion process with positive drift and mitigation is lumpy. Climate damages can be affected by adaptation in two main ways: 1) reduced proportionately for given climate impact; or 2) their growth path down-shifted. In either case expectation and variance of the climate damage are both reduced by adaptation. In case 1, the variance effect (which leads to more rapid mitigation as the option value of waiting is reduced) may dominate over the expectation effect (which reduces mitigation), thus on balance increasing mitigation when damages are reduced. Mitigation and adaptation are then complements. A family of functions relating climate damage to adaptation cost in this way includes the Cobb-Douglas specification.

Conventional statistical and econometric techniques such as regression often work well, but there are issues unique to big datasets that may require different tools. First, the sheer size of the data involved may require more powerful data manipulation tools. Second, we may have more potential predictors than appropriate for estimation, so we need to do some kind of variable selection. Third, large datasets may allow for more flexible relationships than simple linear models. Machine learning techniques such as decision trees, support vector machines, neural nets, deep learning, and so on may allow for more effective ways to model complex relationships.

We distinguish between measures of both the belief (e. g., the frequency of prayer) and belonging (e. g., church attendance) that have been stressed by authors such as Barro and McCleary (2003).

To get round the difficulty related to the specification of private agents' preferences in empirical analysis, Bohn (1998) suggests to estimate fiscal reaction functions describing how primary surplus reacts to indebtedness. After having solved the econometric issues arising when primary surplus and debt have a very different persistence (with a nonparametric approach) or are both integrated (with parametric tests), we estimate fiscal reaction functions for France and Greece.

Recognizing that housing is a major cost associated with child rearing, and assuming that children are normal goods, we hypothesize that an increase in house prices will have a negative price effect on current period fertility. This applies to both potential first-time homeowners and current homeowners who might upgrade to a bigger house with the addition of a child. On the other hand, for current homeowners, an increase in MSA-level house prices will increase home equity, leading to a positive effect on birth rates. Our results suggest that indeed, short-term increases in house prices lead to a decline in births among non-owners and a net increase among owners. The estimates imply that a $10,000 increase leads to a 5% increase in fertility rates among owners and a 2.4% decrease among non-owners. At the mean U.S. home ownership rate, these estimates imply that the net effect of a $10,000 increase in house prices is a 0.8% increase in current period fertility rates. Given underlying differences in home ownership rates, the predicted net effect of house price changes varies across demographic groups. In addition, we find that changes in house prices exert a larger effect on current period birth rates than do changes in unemployment rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This analysis reveals that the policy of introducing a capital requirement tends to stabilise the market equilibrium (both with heterogeneous and homogeneous banks). Moreover, it is shown that 1) when the capital standard is reduced the market stability is lost through a flip bifurcation and subsequently a cascade of flip bifurcations may lead to periodic cycles and chaos; 2) when the expectations are heterogeneous even the case of multi-stability may be present. Therefore, although on the one side the capital regulation is harmful for the equilibrium loans' volume and profit, on the other side it is effective in keeping or restoring the stability of the Coumot-Nash equilibrium in the banking duopoly.

Pagan and Pesaran derive the restrictions which the permanent-transitory decomposition of the shocks imposes on the structural VEC model. This paper shows that these restrictions are equivalent to a set of restrictions that are applied in the methods of Gonzalo and Ng and King et al. (KPSW). Using this result, it is shown that the Pagan and Pesaran method can be used to recover the structural shocks with permanent effects identically to those from the Gonzalo and Ng and KPSW methods. In the former case, this is illustrated in the context of Lettau and Ludvigson's consumption model and in the latter case in KPSW's six variable model.

They show that the conditional equity premium is a linear function of conditional consumption and market return volatilities, which can be estimated handily by various Generalized Autoregressive Conditonal Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and Stochastic Volatility (SV) models. We find that conditional consumption and market volatilities are capable of explaining cross-sectional return differences. The Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) volatility can explain up to 55% variation of return and the EGARCH model augmented with (cay) over cap - a cointegrating factor of consumption, labor income and asset wealth growth - greatly enhances model performance. We proceed to test another hypothesis: if Bansal and Yaron estimator is an unbiased estimator of true conditional equity premium, then the instrumental variables for estimating conditional equity premium should no longer be significant. We demonstrate that once the theoretical conditional risk premium is added to the model, it renders all instrumental variables redundant. Also, the model prediction is consistent with observed declining equity premium. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The socioeconomic variables and macroeconomic conditions affect the intention to migrate indirectly through life satisfaction. At all levels of life satisfaction, individuals with similar characteristics have greater intentions to migrate from CEE countries than from non-CEE countries. These findings underscore the importance of individual life satisfaction not only as a strong predictor of the individual migration intention, but also as a mediator between individual socioeconomic variables and macroeconomic conditions and that intention.

Real annual filtering rates are faster for rental housing (2.5 percent) than owner-occupied (0.5 percent), vary inversely with the income elasticity of demand and house price inflation, and are sensitive to tenure transitions as homes age. For most locations, filtering is robust which lends support for housing voucher programs.

Theoretically, the wages of others may affect workers' utility for two main reasons: Workers may derive well-being from their social status (the comparison effect) and/or they may use others' wages to help predict their own future wage (the information effect). The author tests both hypotheses. To do this, she models individual utility from pay as a function of a workers own wage and the earnings of all other workers within the same establishment, and she estimates the model using matched British employer-employee data. The author assumes incomplete information about others' wages. She finds that the comparison effect matters. Interestingly, she also provides some evidence on a positive relation between well-being and inequality.

While empirical evidence for the hypothesis that credit-constrained firms are less likely to start to export is, at best, weak, we find no evidence for a statistically significant difference in credit-rating scores between firms that stopped to export and firms that continued to export.","[Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ, Luneburg, Germany; [Wagner, Joachim] CESIS, Stockholm, Sweden",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ, Luneburg, Germany.",wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020; Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536",,,,,22,23,25,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We have the main limitation of available information and we provide objective results using statistical method.

Given the documented relationship between corporate governance and cost of external financing, insider ownership, an important proxy of corporate governance, should affect FF via the agency cost channel. A review of the US non-financial firms from 1992 to 2009 indicates that insider ownership aids in determining the FF of firms. More specifically, results indicate the existence of optimal insider ownership, and any deviation from it causes FF to decrease. In addition, FF is higher when CEO ownership is lower (<0.08%) and this phenomenon is more pronounced for financially unconstrained firms. Furthermore, FF is higher when non-CEO insider ownership is in the middle range (0.12-0.43%) for financially constrained firms, whereas non-CEO insider ownership has minimal impact on FF for unconstrained firms.","[Chen, Naiwei] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Int Ctr Financial Res, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Hsiao, E-N] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan",Jiangxi Normal University; National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, NW (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Normal Univ, Int Ctr Financial Res, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",906218956@qq.com,,,,,,,55,3,3,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find evidence that sector concentration of highly qualified workers (with at least a college degree) generates knowledge externalities. Hence, workers benefit from the skills of their peers by learning from them. Also complementing the literature, we find a geographic knowledge spillover played by the business service sector.

We analyse the properties of the short-term macroeconomic equilibrium in the presence of a climate policy, which may take the form either of a carbon tax or of quotas of pollution permits. We show that in the short run climate policy (or its strengthening) is simultaneously a negative aggregate supply shock and a positive aggregate demand shock. It is thus inflationary but it has an ambiguous impact on aggregate economic activity and employment: it will only stimulate output in an economy where nominal wages are rigid enough. In all cases, climate policy will depress real wages. We also analyse the interactions between climate policy and the usual macroeconomic policies of demand (fiscal and monetary stimuli) and supply (labour tax cut). The multiplier effects of these demand and supply policies depend on the instrument chosen for implementing the climate policy (carbon tax or pollution permits). We finally establish the conditions under which a reform combining a climate policy strengthening and a labour tax cut can reach the double objective of a lower carbon footprint and a lower unemployment rate, without reducing workers' real wages. Such a policy reform has however an ambiguous impact on the government surplus (or deficit).","[Fagnart, Jean-Francois] Univ St Louis Bruxelles, CEREC, Brussels, Belgium; [Fagnart, Jean-Francois; Germain, Marc] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Germain, Marc] Univ Lille 3, EQUIPPE, F-59653 Villeneuve Dascq, France",University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite de Lille,"Fagnart, JF (通讯作者)，Univ St Louis Bruxelles, CEREC, Brussels, Belgium.",,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,21,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

A new test is established and studied to deal with the parametric specification of the nonparametric autoregressive errors with either stationarity or nonstationarity. Such a test procedure can initially avoid misspecification through the need to parametrically specify the form of the errors. In other words, we estimate the form of the errors and test for stationarity or nonstationarity simultaneously. We establish asymptotic distributions of the proposed test. Both the setting and the results differ from earlier work on testing for unit roots in parametric time series regression.

In this paper we use a growth model with a public health infrastructure to analyze, in detail, its local dynamics. The discussion of the existence of equilibria in the model reveals that some candidates for equilibria turn out to be non-relevant and are therefore ruled out.

This paper presents a simple model of global portfolio diversification in which a link between financial liberalization and production specialization emerges very naturally. Within that model, an economy that liberalizes its financial markets is able to share its consumption risks, which in turn would allow the country to take extra risks in production by specializing in the good it produces more efficiently, resulting in higher output volatility and less correlated business cycles. The model provides insights about the effects of cross-country and cross-sector productivity shock correlations on portfolio choice, industrial specialization and consumption smoothing. Output volatility will increase as countries get more financially open, whereas consumption smoothing will depend on both the actual level of financial openness and on the productivity shock correlations between sectors and between countries. Higher integration induces greater production specialization, whereas the effect of productivity correlations on production diversification is ambiguous and depends on the degree of financial frictions.","Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA",Vassar College,"Islamaj, E (通讯作者)，Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, 124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA.",erislamaj@vassar.edu,,,,,,,38,3,3,1,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Multidimensional scaling, a statistical tool for visualizing dissimilarity data as a low-dimensional map, is used on results of a simple grouping task with a given distribution set. The outcome is a perception map that presents respondents' answers spatially, which enables additional insight into respondents' thinking. The map created by the respondents' replies, presented in this paper, indicates that their decisions are driven by two factors: what the biggest gap in incomes of a given distribution is and whether some groups have equal incomes.

During these Sudden Stops, countries lost access to credit, which caused abrupt current account reversals, and suffered severe recessions. This article reviews a class of models that yield quantitative predictions consistent with these observations, based on an occasionally binding credit constraint that limits debt to a fraction of the market value of incomes or assets used as collateral. Sudden Stops are infrequent events nested within regular business cycles and occur in response to standard shocks after periods of expansion increase leverage ratios sufficiently. When this happens, the Fisherian debt-deflation mechanism is set in motion, as lower asset or goods prices tighten the constraint further, causing further deflation. This framework also embodies a pecuniary externality with important implications for macroprudential policy because agents do not internalize how current borrowing decisions affect collateral values during future financial crises.","[Korinek, Anton] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Mendoza, Enrique G.] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Korinek, Anton; Mendoza, Enrique G.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Johns Hopkins University; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Korinek, A (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",egme@sas.upenn.edu,"fungsen, chan/H-1983-2016",,,,,,84,38,48,0,17,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Commercial banks exhibit increasing returns to scale, whereas government-owned specialized banks exhibit decreasing returns to scale, implying further increases in bank size and market concentration in the commercial bank sector but not for government specialized banks. Cost inefficiency varies by bank and is a function of the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans, equity to total assets and liquid assets to total assets, as well as the number of branches. On average, banks with fewer NPLs, that are well capitalized and with adequate liquidity are efficient. Thus, stricter rules to regulate credit risk management and ensure capital and liquidity adequacy would enhance efficiency in the banking sector. Although estimated input substitutability appears to be low, labour and loanable fund are substitutes. However, labour and physical capital as well as physical and loanable funds are complements in commercial banks.

We refined the subjective method by taking into account the uncertainty as perceived by the second income earner. We then apply the 'objective' and 'subjective' method to the same data set and obtain similar results: the subjective and objective methods suggest that precautionary savings account for approximately 30% of savings.","[Mastrogiacomo, Mauro] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, DNB, Netspar, NL-1017 Z Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Alessie, Rob] Univ Groningen, Netspar, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Groningen,"Mastrogiacomo, M (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, DNB, Netspar, Westeinde 1, NL-1017 Z Amsterdam, Netherlands.",M.Mastrogiacomo@DNB.NL,"Mastrogiacomo, Mauro/HJA-2589-2022","Alessie, Rob/0000-0002-5128-6753",,,,,16,17,17,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Our study contributes to this discussion in two ways: First, on a theoretical level we propose extended multidimensional polarization indices based on a constant elasticity of substitution (CES)-type well-being function and present a new measure to multidimensional polarization, the mean minimum polarization gap, 2DGAP. This polarization intensity measure provides transparency with regard to each single attribute, which is important for targeted policies, while at the same time respecting their interdependent relations. Second, in an empirical application, time is incorporated, in addition to the traditional income measure, as a fundamental resource for any activity. In particular, genuine personal leisure time will account for social participation in the sense of social inclusion/exclusion and Amartya Sen's capability approach. Instead of arbitrarily choosing the attribute parameters in the CES well-being function, the interdependent relations of time and income are evaluated by the German population. With the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and detailed time use diary data from the German Time Use Surveys (GTUSs) 1991/1992 and 2001/2002, we quantify available and extended multidimensional polarization measures as well as our new approach to measuring the polarization of the working poor and affluent in Germany. There are three prominent empirical results: Genuine personal leisure time in addition to income is an important and significant polarization attribute. Compensation is of economic and statistical significance. The new minimum 2DGAP approach reveals that multidimensional polarization increased in the 1990s in Germany.","[Merz, Joachim; Scherg, Bettina] Univ Luneburg, Res Inst Profess FFB, Dept Econ, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Merz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Res Inst Profess FFB, Dept Econ, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78350-556-2; 978-1-78350-567-8,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2014,22.0,,,,,,273,321,,10.1108/S1049-258520140000022009,0.0,,,49,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360561500010,0

Empirical analysis also includes R&D projects valuation worksheet based upon the competition duopoly model that we applied to Brazilian Embraer and Canadian Bombardier. Embraer and Bombardier are 3rd and 4th largest suppliers of commercial aircrafts. These are main rival competitors in the segment of small commuter planes. Our main objective was to study changes of R&D projects performance when alterations of environmental factors are simulated. Basically, we observed significant difference between SMCs and Blue Chips. SMC tend to start new R&D projects on their own while Blue Chips buy other companies that already have access to new technologies. Moreover, in the group of small companies, R&D costs are significantly positive, while Blue Chips show opposite results as R&D costs are negative and statistically significant in this group. In addition, R&D projects and patents possessed by investigated companies affect positively R&D projects valuation. Future growth, which forms part of the value of a company, depends on the number of patents pertaining to companies and newly started R&D projects which subsequently will become patents possessed by those companies.","[Metelski, Dominik; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Arteaga-Ortiz, Jesus] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",University of Granada; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Metelski, D (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",dominik@trade2win.pl; amihi@ugr.es; jarteaga@dede.ulpgc.es,"Metelski, Dominik/JEZ-3170-2023; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906",,,,,32,2,2,0,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Our results show that different public child care policies may induce substantially diverging effects and reveal that each policy frequently faces a trade off between an encouragement of labor supply and an enhancement of the child's performance. In addition, we find that, from an efficiency perspective, an income-based fee levied on public child care services is dominated by both a flat fee and a use-based fee system.","[Minagawa, Junichi] Chuo Univ, Fac Econ, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan; [Upmann, Thorsten] Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Duisburg, Germany",Chuo University; University of Duisburg Essen,"Minagawa, J (通讯作者)，Chuo Univ, Fac Econ, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan.",minagawa@tamacc.chuo-u.ac.jp; Thorsten.Upmann@uni-duisburg-essen.de,"Upmann, Thorsten/AAA-9925-2019","Upmann, Thorsten/0000-0001-7804-7982",,,,,41,0,0,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This paper presents a new version of the paradox in which a tax reduces price-and increases industry output-because it attracts additional entry into the market. It is particularly striking that the demand conditions under which cost pass-through exceeds 100% for a fixed number of firms are also those for which pass-through can turn negative with endogenous entry. A novel application to the environment shows that a Pigouvian emissions tax can lead to an increase in industry emissions.

They do product R&D (R&D aimed at improving the quality of existing products, and creating new products). They also do process R&D (R&D aimed at lowering the cost of making existing and new products). Moreover, firms often do both product and process R&D simultaneously. As far as the objective of firms is concerned, this need not be limited to profit-maximization only. Rather, firms may have a broader objective, where they care about profits as well as consumer surplus. This paper studies effects of a firm having a general objective function (that takes into consideration both profits and consumer surplus) on its product and process R&D choices, and corresponding implications. I consider product and process R&D choices of firms in an infinite horizon set-up with discrete time. Firms in my framework can simultaneously do both product and process R&D in every period, face a discrete-choice model of consumer demand with vertical product differentiation, and maximize a discounted, weighted sum of their profits and consumer surplus over the infinite time horizon. I show how process and product R&D differ from each other in my framework, and the role of a firm's objective function in this regard. I compare process and product R&D choices across firms that differ in their objective function, and illustrate effects of providing general R&D subsidies (subsidies given for any R&D, regardless of whether it is product or process R&D) to firms. I also characterize how in my framework, the choice of process R&D in total R&D - R&D composition - by an individual firm varies overtime, and how process and product R&D choices, process and product R&D productivity, and the choice of R&D composition vary across firms that differ in size but are otherwise similar.

In spite of this, determinants of economic development and especially the linkages between economic development and logistics performance are topics of growing interest within the recent literature, both in economic growth theory and maritime studies. In this paper our attention is focused on the importance of logistics performance as one of the explanatory variables for economic development. To this end, we have estimated different econometric models in an attempt to explain the probability of a country being economically developed, based on a number of traditional explanatory variables (including natural endowments, economic openness, and institutional framework, among others) along with logistics performance as the major theoretical innovation. The applied methodology follows the binary choice framework described in probit models.. In the next step the research is concentrated on the determination of possible endogenous causalities of the economic development. In the last section we estimate the logistics gap, measured as a probability of reaching economic development that varies due to differences in the levels of logistics performance. Our main finding shows that logistics performance is closely related to the probability of a country being developed. Specifically, the probability of being a developed country increases when logistics performance is improved.","[Sanchez, Ricardo J.; Cipoletta Tomassian, Georgina; Perrotti, Daniel E.] UN ECLAC, Santiago, Chile",,"Sanchez, RJ (通讯作者)，UN ECLAC, Santiago, Chile.",Ricardo.Sanchez@cepal.org; Georgina.Cipoletta@cepal.org; Daniel.Perrotti@cepal.org,"Perrotti, Daniel/ABE-1080-2020","Sanchez, Ricardo J/0000-0002-2676-2543",,,,,14,4,4,1,9,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

The most recent research, however, shows that this trend may have been reversed. Recent studies have applied various time series methods to the Japanese data, and estimated responses of domestic prices to the exchange rate and import prices in different time periods. Those studies have found signs that pass-through has made an impressive comeback since the early 2000s. This paper reviews the most recent evidence and discusses its policy implications. I argue that the exchange rate has likely regained its status as an important transmission mechanism of monetary policy to domestic prices.","[Shioji, Etsuro] Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Shioji, E (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",shioji@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530293] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,27,10,12,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

The empirical findings indicate that the Bangladesh banking sector has exhibited the highest and lowest level of profit efficiency during years 2004 and 2011 respectively. We find that there are only eight banks have been profit efficient throughout the period under study. The empirical findings seem to suggest that most of Bangladesh banks have been experiencing economies of scale due to being at less than the optimum size, or diseconomies of scale due to being at more than the optimum size.

With all else held fixed, a change in the rate of money-growth induces a change in the distribution of money, which leads to a change in labour supply and production throughout the economy. Thus the distribution of money provides a channel through which a change in monetary policy affects real economic activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper contributes to the understanding of this process as it carries out a comparative study of poverty dynamics in five Latin American countries during 2003-2008. It analyzes the extent to which countries with different levels of poverty incidence diverge in terms of poverty exit and entry rates, identifies the relative importance of the frequency and impact of events associated to poverty transitions and examines how these events affect households with different characteristics. For this, a dynamic analysis of panel data is carried out using regular household surveys. Sizeable rates of poverty movements were observed in all five countries and it was found that a large proportion of household experienced positive events, mainly related to the labor market; however, only a small fraction of them actually exited poverty. Demographic events and public cash transfers proved to be of little relevance; in particular, the latter did not contribute much either to intensify poverty exits or to prevent poverty entries. Households with children experienced more (less) negative (positive) events than those without children. It appeared therefore that even when the economy behaved reasonably well at the aggregate level, high levels of labor turnover and income mobility (even of a negative nature) still prevail, mainly associated to the high level of precariousness and the undeveloped system of social protection that characterize the studied countries.","[Beccaria, Luis; Maurizio, Roxana; Fernandez, Ana Laura; Monsalvo, Paula; Alvarez, Mariana] Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, RA-1613 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Fernández, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, JM Gutierrez 1150, RA-1613 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",lbeccari@ungs.edu.ar; roxanadmaurizio@gmail.com; analaurafer@gmail.com; apmons@gmail.com; malvarezdelallera@gmail.com,"Maurizio, Roxana/AAE-9674-2020","Beccaria, Luis/0000-0003-1859-8576",,,,,40,8,10,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

However, there is a lack of a common understanding of what public sector innovation is and a lack of a measurement framework that can shed light on innovation processes in public sector organisations. Based on insights generated in a recent Nordic pilot study, this paper seeks to contribute to fill this gap. The paper discusses how public sector innovation can be captured and to what extent measurement can be based on frameworks originally developed in a private sector context. While there are important differences between the public and the private sector that should be reflected in a measurement framework, there is also considerable common ground that can be drawn upon.

Several initiatives and policies have been proposed to deal with poor access to modern sources of energy in many developing countries. Given the large number of people lacking basic energy services, an important question is whether providing universal access to modem energy could significantly increase energy demand and associated CO2 emissions. This paper provides one of the few formal assessments of this problem by means of a simple but robust model of current and future energy consumption. The model allows mapping energy consumption globally for different classes of energy use, quantifying current and future imbalances in the distribution of energy consumption. Our results indicate that an encompassing energy poverty eradication policy to be met by 2030 would increase global final energy consumption by about 7% (roughly 20 EJ). The same quantity of energy could be saved by reducing by 15% energy consumption of individuals with standards above current European levels. The additional energy infrastructure needed to eradicate energy poverty would produce 44-183 GtCO(2) over the 21st century and contribute at most 0.13 degrees C of additional warming.

For the expansionary years, we find a sizable relocation of native workers to occupations with more interactive rather than manual content as a response to immigration. However, the pattern changes completely in the recession period of 2008-2012. There is no evidence of any relocation of natives to different occupations as a response to an immigration shock and we find a sizable negative impact on the employment levels of earlier immigrants.",,,,,"De la Rica, Sara/H-6637-2015","De la Rica, Sara/0000-0001-9872-6798",,,,,24,7,7,0,8,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

For low tax rates, the optimal base only comprises commodities whose discouragement index is greater than the ratio of their administrative costs to the tax they yield. An illustration with UK data shows that a category of goods should be taxed only if the revenue generated on this category is at least ten times greater than its administrative fixed cost. The cost imputable to the category of goods taxed at the standard rate would be at most 6 percent of total VAT revenue. The administration cost associated with categories of goods currently tax-free could justify exemption.","[Gauthier, Stephane] Paris Sch Econ, F-75013 Paris, France; [Gauthier, Stephane] Univ Paris 01, F-75013 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Gauthier, S (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",stephane.gauthier@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

It was expected to increase the annual number of passengers by up to 11 million and generate more than 5 billion EUR in consumer surplus. However, in 2008 the market was struck by global economic crisis. We use regression analysis to distinguish between positive impacts of liberalization and negative impacts of the crisis. We come to the conclusion that had the market not been reinforced by liberalization, annual transatlantic traffic would have shrunk at a pace 3-7 million passengers faster. The results are a clear indication that if European and US airlines want to remain competitive in the coming era of Asian dominance, further liberalization efforts have to be undertaken.","Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Int Relat, Dept Int Econ Relat & Econ Diplomacy, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Grancay, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Int Relat, Dept Int Econ Relat & Econ Diplomacy, Bratislava, Slovakia.",martin.grancay@euba.sk,"Grancay, Martin/N-9889-2014","Grancay, Martin/0000-0002-7006-147X",,,,,12,0,0,1,13,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This paper shows that female graduates of elite institutions have lower labor market involvement than their counterparts from less selective institutions. Although elite graduates are more likely to earn advanced degrees, marry at later ages, and have higher expected earnings, there is little difference in labor market activity by college selectivity among women without children and women who are not married. But the presence of children is associated with far lower labor market activity among married elite graduates. Most women eventually marry and have children, and the net effect is that labor market activity is on average lower among elite graduates than among those from less selective institutions. The largest gap in labor market activity between graduates of elite institutions and less selective institutions is among MBAs, with married mothers who are graduates of elite institutions 30 percentage points less likely to be employed full-time than graduates of less selective institutions.","Vanderbilt Law Sch, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Hersch, J (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Law Sch, 131 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",joni.hersch@vanderbilt.edu,,"Hersch, Joni/0000-0001-5340-6985",,,,,41,22,27,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Employing the autoregressive distributed lag approach to cointegration test, the paper establishes a long-run equilibrium that ties private consumption to its determinants - real income, real stock prices, real lending rate, and stock market volatility. In the long run, the presence of the stock market wealth effect is documented. At the same time, the stock market volatility is also noted to depress private consumption particularly when the volatility is at the degree as observed during the Asian crisis. The authors further note the short-run influences of real stock price changes on consumption growth and the adjustment of private consumption to the long-run level when it is modeled in an error-correction setting. Our simple simulation indicates that the drop in the private consumption due to the decline in stock market wealth post-crisis is substantial, amounting to 2.7% of average post-crisis gross domestic product.","[Ibrahim, Mansor H.] Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur 59000, Malaysia; [Law, Siong Hook] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Dept Econ, Serdang Upm 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",INCEIF; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Ibrahim, MH (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Lorong Univ A, Kuala Lumpur 59000, Malaysia.",mansorhi@inceif.org; lawsh@econ.upm.edu.my,"Ibrahim, Mansor/AAU-6887-2020; Law, Siong Hook/AAF-6672-2020","Law, Siong Hook/0000-0002-6058-4883; Ibrahim, Mansor/0000-0003-0413-0075",,,,,38,0,0,0,14,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

In the first five years, China had public communication with both the United States and the European Union under the Transitional Review Mechanism. In 2006 a new means of communication, the China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue, started to take effect. Reports show that the new mechanism has advanced the China-US relationship positively and productively. The difference between the two means of communication stimulates our study. We adopt a game theory model to examine the impact of different communication protocols on China's incentives to reveal information. We analyze a cheap-talk game between an informed agent and two uninformed principals who coordinate actions under two communication protocols: public and private communication. First, all equilibria under both means of communication are characterized. Information precision of the agent's equilibrium messages decreases with the principals' preference biases. Second, under private communication the agent communicates more informatively with one principal if she in effect reveals little information to the other. Under private communication there exists an informative equilibrium with asymmetric levels of information precision even when all equilibria under public communication are uninformative.

In a model where corruption opportunities are lower under centralization at each period of time, decentralization makes it easier for citizens to detect corrupt incumbents. As a consequence, the relationship between fiscal decentralization and corruption is conditional on political competition: decentralization is associated with lower (higher) levels of corruption for sufficiently high (low) levels of political competition. We test this prediction and find that it is empirically supported.

More precisely, we study market concentration in different technological regimes and demand conditions. The computational analysis of our model shows that market demand plays a key role in industrial dynamics. Thus, although for intermediate values of the price-performance sensitivity, our results show the well-known relationships in the literature between technological regimes and industry transformation, we find surprising outcomes when demand is strongly biased either towards price or performance. Hence, for different technological regimes, a high performance sensitivity of demand tends to concentrate the market. On the other hand, under conditions of high price sensitivity, the industry generally tends to atomize. That is to say, for extreme values of the price-performance sensitivity of demand, we find concentrated or atomized market structures no matter the technological regime we are in.

The principal enlarges the agent's awareness strategically when proposing a contract and faces a tradeoff between participation and incentives. Leaving the agent unaware allows the principal to exploit the agent's incomplete understanding of the world, relaxing the participation constraint, while making the agent aware enables the principal to use the revealed contingencies as signals about the agent's action choice, relaxing the incentive constraint. The optimal contract reveals contingencies that have low probability but are highly informative about the agent's effort. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Strong work norms arise as a way for parents to protect their children from the risk of lacking talent.

These fiscal limits invalidate Bohn's criterion for fiscal sustainability, which allows explosive debt relative to GDP, eventually violating any fiscal limit. We derive restrictions on a fiscal rule, necessary for the government to eliminate explosive behavior. These restrictions require that the response of the primary surplus to debt be relatively strong, and that the primary surplus be cointegrated with both debt and output. We test these empirical implications for a panel of eleven EMU countries, and find that they are satisfied, implying that fiscal policy does not create explosive behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of the reforms on fuel expense is weakly significant, but there is evidence of significant productivity improvement in fuel usage. Further total factor productivity (TIP) analysis shows that the efficiency gain from the reforms is still significant when the substitution effect of labor and capital inputs are considered, though the magnitude is much lower than that of the PFP analysis. The effect of the reforms on technical efficiency becomes weakly significant when fuel expense is further included in TFP analysis, but a significant positive effect is expected if fuel input is measured in physical quantity.

However, this effect varies by geographic location reflecting differences in the ability of regions to absorb and benefit from environmental spillovers.

Specifically, placing a cap on specification change in FP contracts prevents specification volatility, similar to the way that placing a cap on the price in T&M contracts prevents price escalation. We argue that these hybrid mechanisms are particularly important in software development contracting, a new critical business capability involving frequent and costly ex post adaptations to specification change. The level of completeness in these contractual archetypes is hypothesized to be determined by contracting costs and benefits, where costs are related to project uncertainty and benefits are related to the likelihood of vendor opportunism. We test this hypothesis with a unique data set of 270 software development contracts entered into by a leading international bank. The analysis confirms the existence of multiple hybrid contracts that mitigate both price escalation and specification volatility. It also shows that contracting costs and benefits explain more variance in contract choice when these hybrids are included, uncovering the detailed mechanisms used to curb opportunism when the vendor is less familiar to the client.","[Fink, Lior] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Lichtenstein, Yossi] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, London, England; [Wyss, Simon] Univ Coll Dublin, Smurfit Grad Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland",Ben Gurion University; University of East Anglia; University College Dublin,"Fink, L (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",finkl@bgu.ac.il,"Fink, Lior/F-1633-2012","Fink, Lior/0000-0001-5165-5259",,,,,39,6,6,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I find that two separate proxies for market functioning show adverse responses to Federal Reserve purchases that appear to be most closely linked to the additional open-ended MBS purchase program announced in September 2012. However, the magnitude of the disruption in market functioning appears to be quite modest. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Appropriate measures can reduce the risk of crisis in individual countries, the severity of crises, and the magnitude of needed adjustments. These include an appropriate exchange rate policy (flexibility is highly desirable), ensuring the soundness of the financial system, not allowing expansion of credit at too high a rate, adopting structural fiscal budgeting policies, and avoiding dangerous sovereign debt build-up. On the crisis resolution side, the lesson that stands out is the desirability of decisive and credible action to address the causes of the crisis. The issues that arise when the banking and financial system is weakened in the run-up to crisis are extremely difficult, especially when sovereign debt is unsustainable. Therefore, while the important lesson is to avoid overly expansive credit build-up during good times, in the event of a crisis, it is important that the health of the banks be restored as quickly as possible and that a viable supervision and resolution framework be put in place.","[Krueger, Anne O.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Krueger, Anne O.] Stanford Ctr Int Dev, Stanford, CA USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Krueger, AO (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",annekrueger@jhu.edu,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

When the more efficient downstream firm is charged a higher price than the less efficient firm in the first model, in the second model when investments are made after input prices are set, it may be charged a lower price due to the additional indirect effect of input prices on derived demands (via the change of investment incentives). It is illustrated that, with linear market demand and quadratic investment cost, whether a lower or higher price is charged to the more efficient firm depends on the ratio of the linear and quadratic coefficients in the cost function.

While reference dependence is extensively studied, very little is known regarding the impact of reference points on individual choice behavior when the reference points themselves are not chosen (Reference Effect). We identify critical properties that differentiate between classes of reference-dependent models and test them. We find that the reference effect exists for asymmetrically dominated reference points, but we do not see any evidence of a reference effect for symmetrically dominated reference points. Some of the existing models are mostly consistent with our data but lack predictive power. None of the models offers the particular predictions that our experiment suggests. Finally, we also tease apart the differences between the reference effect and the asymmetric dominance effect (decoy effect), a well-known phenomenon observed in the literature on context-dependent choice.

It is argued that the discourse pathologises consumers who are susceptible to sub-optimal market outcomes, treating their behaviour as abnormal and treating individuals as deviants in need of rehabilitation. It is claimed that by this means new forms of policy are legitimated, specifically behavioural remedies designed to draw apparently errant consumers towards behaviour that conforms more closely to the standard (that is, neoclassical) model of decision making. It is argued that the upsurge of interest in these behavioural remedies distracts attention from facets of the individuals environment, such as the characteristics of markets and the behaviour of firms, and also the set of norms and beliefs underpinning the economic system.","[Mehta, Judith] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Mehta, J (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, ESRC Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",J.Mehta@uea.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,75,15,16,2,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The introduction of new 'smart' meters allows electricity providers to differentiate tariffs on the basis of time. Utilising congestion pricing theory, the energy industry has embraced 'time-of-use' (ToU) tariffs with a view to more efficiently pricing electricity. This paper demonstrates that pricing as a function of demand variability (reflecting capacity utilisation) is a more appropriate alternative to existing ToU tariffs for more efficiently allocating costs to end users. We call this new alternative pricing model 'first derivative ratio' FDR pricing.

The municipalities differ greatly in their productive structures; therefore, a policy that is detrimental (beneficial) to a certain sector of activity may be expected to have a greater negative (positive) impact on the election results for the governing party in those municipalities where that sector is quantitatively important.

Since bulk and discounted items are sold at a lower price per unit, my findings highlight a new dimension in which online shopping can be beneficial to consumers.

Using dynamic panel data methods, we also find that there is no evidence that higher oil rents hinder growth. However, to focus on material gain means that the welfare gain from oil is understated, because oil-rich countries benefit more by the reduction in infant mortality and the gain in longevity.

The effect of federal financial aid availability on postsecondary enrollment,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financial aid; For-profit colleges; Student loan default; College access; Dynamic regression discontinuity,STUDENT PRICE RESPONSE; HIGHER-EDUCATION; IMPACT,"It is generally believed that access to financial aid will increase the likelihood that students will attend and graduate from college. There is a surprising lack of research, however, on the consequences when postsecondary institutions lose eligibility to disburse financial aid. This paper provides among the first causal estimates of institution-level financial aid funding loss on enrollment and composition of student bodies. I implement a dynamic regression discontinuity design using a multi-year rule that restricts institutions' eligibility to offer federal aid such as Pell Grants and subsidized loans when alumni's loan repayment rates are below allowed thresholds. Results suggest that financial aid loss discourages enrollment at for-profit institutions and institutions that offer programs of two years or less. The decline in enrollment appears to be driven by fewer new enrollees, particularly at for-profit colleges. I find less conclusive evidence that ineligibility to disburse federal financial aid substantially alters student body composition. This research is particularly relevant considering recently proposed federal rulemaking that will further limit the number of institutions eligible to disburse financial aid based on additional student loan debt repayment requirements. Restrictions such as these are intended to protect students and the integrity of federal aid programs, but may also have implications for access to higher education. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, remarkably little is known about the wages of workers who regularly take jobs in the temp sector or who do temp work for a substantial period of time. Based on a rich administrative data set, the effect of the intensity of agency employment on the temp wage gap in Germany is estimated. Using a two-stage selection-corrected method within a panel data framework, the paper shows that the wage gap for temps with low treatment intensity is high but decreases with time spent in the sector, presumably reflecting that temporary agency workers are able to accumulate human capital while employed in the temp sector. However, agency employment seems to stigmatize those workers who move frequently from one temp job to the next. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We show that an airport requires both pricing instruments to achieve the first-best outcome, and we distinguish their role by showing that congestion externalities need to be addressed through per-flight tolls whereas the inefficiency caused by airlines' market power exertion must be corrected with per-passenger subsidies. We also show that Bertrand competition with differentiated products, a type of behavior recently pointed out by the empirical literature as pertinent, has policy implications that diverge from analyses that assume Cournot competition. The welfare gains and congestion reductions of congestion pricing would be higher than what has been advanced before; the degree of self-financing of airport infrastructure under optimal pricing would be increased and may approach exact self-financing; and the implied differentiation of charges between (asymmetric) airlines would be significantly smaller, presumably enhancing the political feasibility of welfare maximizing congestion pricing, as the potential distributional concerns would be decreased. Finally, we numerically analyze second-best policies, and find that atomistic pricing may offer a relatively attractive alternative to first-best congestion pricing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Before vehicles are produced, their fuel efficiency can be chosen optimally. Once produced, their fuel efficiency cannot be changed. The model generates endogenously different short-run and long-run price elasticities of gasoline use, with their magnitudes well within the region of plausible estimates in the empirical literature. The paper shows that although raising gasoline taxes and tightening the CAFE standard both reduce gasoline use in the long run, they are different in terms of the transmission mechanism, magnitudes of responses and dynamic paths of key endogenous variables.

However, even if parents do not have a preference for a son, the people who surround them possibly have a preference for a son. In this case, social pressure can influence parents' behavior and fertility. This study explored how social pressure related to the sex of children affects fertility. Effects of social pressure were compared between the pre- and post-World War II generations in Japan. The dependent variable was the number of children in the regression equation. A dummy variable for the first child, which was set to 1 when the first child was a boy, and a dummy variable for the preference for a son were included as independent variables. Social pressure was considered to exist when the dummy variable for the first child had a significant negative sign. The key findings are as follows: in the pre-war generation, if the first child was a daughter, the total number of children tended to increase not only when the mother preferred a son, but also when the mother did not have a preference for either gender. This tendency was not observed for the post-war generation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Firms weigh the present value of future net revenues against the opportunity cost of staying in business in their entry or exit decisions. I find that credit frictions increase variable investment costs and result in a larger firm size and a smaller number of firms in the steady state. As the economy deviates from the steady state, however, the presence of credit frictions increases fluctuation in the number of firms, raising market entry during an economic upturn and market exit during a downturn. Also, I find that allowing free entry mitigates some of the effects of credit frictions due to macroeconomic fluctuations. In addition to the homogeneous-firm model, I examine the model when firms have heterogeneous access to credit and find that different credit access gives rise to different firm sizes in the steady state. Firms with easier access to credit become larger than those with less access to credit. Heterogeneous credit access also means that these two types of firms will respond differently to a common technology shock.","[Zeng, Zheng] Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA",University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University,"Zeng, Z (通讯作者)，Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",zzeng@bgsu.edu,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This paper extends that literature by exploiting information in the entire term structure of interest rates. I apply a dynamic version of the Nelson-Siegel yield curve model to jointly model real GDP growth and yield factors. I find that the dynamic yield curve model produces better out-of-sample forecasts of real GDP than those generated by the traditional term spread model. The main source of this improvement is in the dynamic approach to constructing forecasts versus the direct forecasting approach used in the term spread model. While I confirm the importance of the term spread as a predictor of future output, there is also a gain from using information in the curvature factor. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Our analysis is conducted within a flexible family of games of regime change, which have been used to model, inter alia, speculative currency attacks, debt crises, and political change. The endogeneity of information originates in the signaling role of policy choices. A novel procedure of iterated elimination of nonequilibrium strategies is used to deliver probabilistic predictions that an outside observer-an econometrician-can form under arbitrary equilibrium selections.

In the second strand, researchers analyse the impact of trade flows on environmental outcomes. Recently, Cole (2006) bridges this gap, analysing the impact of trade intensity on energy usage utilizing panel data at the country level. In line with Cole (2006), we analyse the impact of subnational trade flows across US states on state-level energy usage and intensity, controlling for the endogeneity of trade flows. The model treating trade as endogenous confirms the cross-country result in Cole (2006); trade causes energy intensity to rise on average. However, the impact is not homogeneous across sectors as the increase in intensity is concentrated in the industrial and transportation sectors.","Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Business Adm, 999 Phutthamonthon, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand",Mahidol University,"Chintrakarn, P (通讯作者)，Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Business Adm, 999 Phutthamonthon, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.",pandej.chi@mahidol.ac.th,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Using disaggregated CPI data for Canada, we find that the response to the adoption of inflation targeting (IT) was quite heterogeneous across sectors. While sticky-price sectors experienced a notable change in inflation dynamics following IT adoption, little structural change was observed in flexible price sectors. Our analysis based on a common factor model suggests that the structural changes in the sticky price sectors are driven by a decline in their responses to common aggregate shocks, including a monetary shock.

An optimal time-varying parking fee is charged at zero rate when there is queuing and eliminates queuing when the rate is non-zero. Within certain limits, inability to charge some drivers for parking does not reduce the potential welfare gain. Drivers who cannot be charged travel when there is queuing.

It argues that implications for explanation are likely always to be contestable (because, as a new source of empirical evidence, behavioural economics encounters familiar problems with empiricism). The implications for prescription, however, are potentially significant, although not in the direction popularised by nudging. Indeed, the behavioural insights suggest that public policy should be less concerned with forms of preference satisfaction and more concerned with individual autonomy. On many accounts of the philosophy of social science, the tension between these insights into behaviour and the dominant model of rational choice would likely consign behavioural economics to the margins of the discipline. In this context, however, this is not true, and the article concludes with a discussion of this puzzle.","[Heap, Shaun P.

Empirical analyses indicate that the former explains a significant part of the co-movement and the latter is unlikely to play an important role. We extend the analysis to intra-day high-frequency data. For example, when the Tokyo Stock Exchange begins its daily trading at 9: 00 A. M. Japan Standard Time (JST), stock prices in Tokyo exhibit responses to preceding changes in New York. An analysis with minute-by-minute data indicates that Tokyo's response to New York dissipates within about six minutes after opening. On the other hand, when the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) opens at 9: 30 A. M. Eastern Standard Time (EST), its response to Tokyo dissipates within 14 minutes. Thus, the movement of stock prices is transmitted rapidly across countries. Finally real-time simultaneous interactions between Shanghai (Shenzhen) and Tokyo are analyzed for a 30-minute period in the morning and a 60-minute period in the afternoon. Investors in Tokyo are watching stock prices in Shanghai, but not vice versa. Tight regulations on Chinese investors to prevent them from holding foreign stocks may be the reason why they do not pay any attention to stock price movements in Tokyo.","[Hirayama, Kenjiro] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan; [Tsutsui, Yoshiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University; Osaka University,"Hirayama, K (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan.",hiraken@kwansei.ac.jp; tsutsui@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23330103] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,46,3,3,0,17,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

The value functions, roles and optimal investment timing decisions of the two firms in the expansion and recession states are jointly determined. We show that the preemptive investment equilibrium, where the leader invests earlier than its own first-best investment timing, is pro-cyclical. Moreover, the simultaneous investment equilibrium, where the firms simultaneously invest late and enjoy waiting flexibility as a tacit collusion, is counter-cyclical. In addition, we specifically demonstrate that the values of the leader and follower in the expansion state are smaller than those in the recession state when the preemptive equilibrium prevails in the expansion state and the simultaneous equilibrium prevails in the recession state.

We elicit probabilistically both first- and second-order beliefs and apply the method to a Hide-and-Seek experiment. We study the relationship between choice and beliefs in terms of whether observed choice coincides with the optimal action given elicited beliefs. We study the relationship between first- and second-order beliefs under a coherence criterion. Weak coherence requires that if an event is assigned, according to first-order beliefs, a probability higher/lower/equal to the one assigned to another event, then the same holds according to second-order beliefs. Strong coherence requires the probability assigned according to first- and second-order beliefs to coincide. Evidence of heterogeneity across participants is reported. Verbal comments collected at the end of the experiment shed light on how subjects think and decide in a complex environment that is strategic, dynamic and populated by potentially heterogeneous individuals.

J,"McColloch, WE",,,,"McColloch, William E.",,,A shackled revolution? The Bubble Act and financial regulation in eighteenth-century England,REVIEW OF KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bubble Act; Bank of England; financial regulation; industrialization,INDUSTRIAL-REVOLUTION; GROWTH; MARKET,"Revisionist estimates of growth rates during the British industrial revolution, though largely successful in presenting a more modest picture of Britain's 'take-off' prior to the 1830s, have also posed fresh analytical difficulties for champions of the new economic history. If eighteenth-century Britain was witness to a diffuse explosion of 'useful knowledge,' why did aggregate growth rates or industrial output growth rates not more closely shadow the pace of technological change? In an effort to explain this paradox, Peter Temin and Hans-Joachim Voth have claimed that a few key institutional restrictions on financial markets namely the Bubble Act, and the tightening of usury laws in 1714 served to amplify the crowding-out impact of government borrowing. Against this vision, the present paper contends that the adverse impact of financial regulation and state borrowing in eighteenth-century Britain has been greatly overstated. To this end, the paper first briefly outlines the historical context in which the Bubble Act emerged, before turning to survey the existing diversity of perspectives on the Act's lasting impact. It is then argued that there is little evidence to support the view that the Bubble Act significantly restricted firms' access to capital. Following this, it is suggested that the 'crowding-out' model, theoretical shortcomings aside, is largely inapplicable to eighteenth-century Britain. The savings-constrained vision of British capital markets significantly downplays the extent to which the Bank of England, though founded as an institution to manage the public debt, provided the entire financial system with liquidity in the eighteenth century.","Lewis & Clark Coll, Portland, OR 97219 USA",,"McColloch, WE (通讯作者)，Lewis & Clark Coll, Portland, OR 97219 USA.",,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,8,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In our model, customers have endogenously determined patience in tolerating bad outcomes from credence-good providers. The more competitive the market, the more options customers have away from a firm, and so the less tolerant of bad outcomes she will be. Competition thus increases equilibrium firm effort, as providers work harder to impress impatient customers.

WTO commitments will progressively and significantly lower the applied tariffs of the Russian Federation. Russian tariffs will ultimately fall to between 45 and 68 percent of their pre-accession levels, with the larger fall being on a weighted average, rather than an unweighted average basis. Nonetheless, bound tariffs will exceed applied tariffs for almost 1,500 tariff lines.

A narrative approach,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exogenous shocks; The narrative approach; Real effects of monetary policy,PEOPLES BANK; SHOCKS; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSMISSION; STANCE; SPIRIT,This paper applies the narrative approach to Chinese monetary policy to solve two problems of policy measurement. The first problem arises because the PBC (the Chinese central bank) applies multiple instruments and none of them alone can adequately reflect changes in its monetary policy. The second one is the classical identification problem: the causation direction of the observed interaction between central bank actions and real activity needs to be identified. The PBC's documents are used to infer the intentions behind policy movements. Three shocks are identified for the period 2000-2011 that are exogenous to real output Estimates using these shocks and various robustness tests indicate that monetary policy has large and persistent impact on output in China.

We study when discretion in the form of exceptions to a simple rule can be implemented, if the information is shared by the action taker and a second party, who is able to verify for the larger group that an exception is warranted. In particular, we compare protocols where the second party excuses the action taker from taking the action ex ante with protocols where the second party instead forgives a rule-breaking actor ex post.

While group structure and dynamics are important in shaping in-group favouritism, less attention has been paid to individual characteristics affecting favouritism. Using data from dictator games conducted among 523 microcredit clients in Angola, this paper analyzes the effect of education on in-group favouritism. When addressing the endogeneity of education, we find that education increases in-group bias. This goes against the conventional view that education broadens the perspectives of an individual. In addition, our results suggest that in-group favouritism is related to gender, family background and access to particular forms of networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We use non-cooperative game forms with pure strategy Nash equilibria and embed them through framing structures. These frames alter how players perceive the game, or rule out the choice of some elements of players' option sets. In this way, we explicitly link the notion of social game to concepts taken from Erving Goffman's theory of interaction. According to Goffman, game theory is flawed because it applies a single-level model to two-leveled situations, ignoring the fact that people form impressions and expectations during or before any strategic game. In this essay, we provide a set-up endowed with these two levels. Firstly, players endogenize a given setting and frame the interaction. This determines what kind of game they will play. Secondly, they select Nash equilibrium strategies. As we shall discuss, it is possible in this way to consider how frames operate and what role they have in determining Nash solutions of non-cooperative games. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines how the welfare implications of strategic behavior depend on how pollution is regulated. Under an emissions tax, aggregate emissions do not affect the marginal cost of polluting. In contrast, the price of tradable permits is endogenous. I show when this feedback effect increases strategic firms' output. Relative to a tax, tradable permits may improve welfare in a market with imperfect competition. As an application, I model strategic and competitive behavior of wholesalers in a Mid-Atlantic electricity market. Simulations suggest that exercising market power decreased emissions locally, thereby substantially reducing the regional tradable permit price. Furthermore, I find that had regulators opted to use a tax instead of permits, the deadweight loss from imperfect competition would have been even greater.","[Mansur, Erin T.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Mansur, Erin T.] NBER, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mansur, ET (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, 6106 Rockefeller Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",erin.mansur@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,27,15,19,2,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

To make matters even worse, these problems have developed into a systemic crisis of the European Monetary Union (EMU), since observers have apparently developed fundamental doubts over its integrity. To overcome this systemic crisis, it would not be sufficient, if only the stronger Euro area economies provided more solidarity, nor would it be sufficient, if only all of Europe adhered to ironclad budgetary discipline from now on. A European Redemption Pact could be a strong political commitment to the EMU and offer a bridge between the proponents of fiscal discipline and structural reform and those governments advocating more support.

The existing literature typically views corruption as extortion of pre-existing rents. This perspective suggests that competition usually reduces corruption, although generally the sign of this relationship is ambiguous. Shleifer and Vishny (1993), however, show that cost-reducing corruption is promoted by product market competition. That is, the effect of competition on corruption depends of the nature of corruption. Unlike the existing empirical studies that employ cross-country data and general measures of corruption, we test the competition-corruption relationship using firm-level information. Our approach overcomes significant estimation difficulties that result from relying on cross-country data; for instance, we include country fixed effects, and we deal with potential endogeneities by instrumenting competition with US capital-labor ratios for the appropriate industries. Contrary to the existing empirical work, we show that stronger product market competition is associated mostly with greater corruption of the cost-reducing variety. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this area, econometric techniques usually rely on systems with either a small number of series, N, or, at the other extreme, a very large N. In this paper we propose tools to select the relevant business cycle indicators in a medium N framework, a situation that is likely to be the most frequent in empirical works. An example is provided by our empirical application, in which we study jointly the short-run co-movements of 24 European countries. We show, under not too restrictive conditions, that parsimonious single-equation models can be used to split a set of N countries in three groups. The first group comprises countries that share a synchronous common cycle, a non-synchronous common cycle is present among the countries of the second group, and the third group collects countries that exhibit idiosyncratic cycles.

Capital is allowed to accumulate and is used, together with other inputs, to produce new knowledge. The stability of the steady state path is found to be determined by the inequality and/or knife-edge restrictions needed to produce steady state growth. This paper takes the ratio of the shadow price of capital to knowledge and the level of consumption as jump variables. Semiendogenous growth models lead to a 4 x 4 dynamic system where the sign of the coefficient matrix of the log linearized dynamic system is indefinite, leading to a potential for both stable and unstable equilibria. The knife-edge restrictions needed to generate policy influences on growth are shown to be restrictions that reduce the system to 3 x 3 with a positive definite coefficient matrix, thereby guaranteeing a globally stable equilibrium.

It does so by basing conclusions upon the responses of variables in three dollarized countries (Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama). They import US monetary policy just as genuine US states do, but have the advantage that non-monetary US shocks are not imported perfectly. Consequently, this setting reduces the effects of any mistakenly included non-monetary US shocks, while leaving the effects of true monetary shocks unaffected.

In other words, most estimates of the trade-cost elasticity are imprecise and lack consistency. In this article, we discuss two issues that are critical in better assessing empirically the trade-flow and welfare effects of trade liberalizations (or trade-cost changes). The first issue is how to quantify the trade-cost elasticity when trade costs themselves are approximated imperfectly. The second issue is that typical empirical evaluations to estimate the impact of trade-policy liberalizations on trade flows use the 'gravity equation'. However, the self-selection of country pairs into such agreements introduces endogeneity bias in the estimation of the trade-cost elasticity in gravity equations, requiring better identification techniques.(JEL codes: F10; F12 and F13)","[Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Dept Finance, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] Univ Notre Dame, Kellogg Inst Int Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany",University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; Ifo Institut,"Bergstrand, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Dept Finance, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",bergstrand.1@nd.edu,,,,,,,43,2,2,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

A model of three-candidate runoff elections is presented, and two new features are included: the risk of upset victory in the second round is endogenous, and many types of runoff systems are considered. Three main results emerge. First, runoff elections produce equilibria in which only two candidates receive a positive fraction of the votes. Second, a sincere voting equilibrium does not always exist. Finally, runoff systems with a threshold below 50 percent produce an Ortega effect that may lead to the systematic victory of the Condorcet loser.

There is simultaneous investment in a more employer-led skills policy, in order to better tackle skills shortages and gaps. But is an employer-led skills policy the best way of boosting industrial growth in all UK regions? Are there potential market failures in employer-led policies of which the public sector should be aware? This article warns against taking an overly simplistic approach to skills development, arguing that while skills policies should be flexible to the needs of employers, there is still justification for investing in a broad educational curriculum at the local level.

Contrary to this, Hess and Rose (2012) show that separate identification of the two components is not in fact possible in a random coefficients model using a typical linear in parameters specification, and that any gains in performance are potentially just the result of more flexible distributional assumptions. On the other hand, linking scale heterogeneity to measured characteristics of the respondents is likely to yield only limited insights, while using respondent reported measures of survey understanding or analyst captured measures such as survey response time puts an analyst at risk of measurement error and endogeneity bias. The contribution made in this paper is to put forward a hybrid model in which survey engagement is treated as a latent variable which is used to model the values of a number of indicators of survey engagement in a measurement model component, as well as explaining scale heterogeneity within the choice model. This model overcomes some of the shortcomings of earlier work, permitting us to link part of the heterogeneity across respondents to differences in scale, while also allowing us to make use of indicators of survey engagement without risk of endogeneity bias. Results from an empirical application show a strong link between the two model components as well as arguably more reasonable substantive outputs for the choice model component.

The data come from three rounds of the Young Lives longitudinal survey, conducted in 2002, 2006 and 2009, of a sample of around 850 children across 20 sentinel sites in Ethiopia. The results show that when a childs mother dies in middle childhood, it has a significantly negative impact on school enrolment. A parents death also has a significant negative impact on a childs sense of optimism about the future. These effects are short term in nature and do not persist into adolescence. However, the children orphaned in middle childhood engage in significantly more paid employment and self-employment at age 1415. In contrast to maternal death in middle childhood, maternal death in adolescence has no impacts on any of the outcomes considered in our sample. However, the death of a father in adolescence has a significant negative impact on school enrolment, maths scores and a childs sense of agency. It is unclear as to why this is the case, as these orphans do not seem to engage in more employment than others and there have been no significant disruption to caregiver arrangements. It is likely that the negative impact on enrolment and scores works through the lower sense of self-efficacy or agency.","Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Himaz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",rozana.himaz@queens.ox.ac.uk,,"Himaz, Rozana/0000-0003-0895-8144",,,,,22,9,14,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In a first treatment subjects insignificantly corrected for past errors, which implies that history plays a role for determining current prices. By reporting the business indicator in a simpler form the second treatment tacitly offered a heuristic for setting prices. This option was widely taken, bringing about an excess response to the business indicator and a significant deviation from equilibrium even in the long run. In a third treatment with staggered pricing we observe that subjects look only one round into the future but not further ahead, contrary to theoretical predictions.

This paper considers a new and intuitive explanation that focuses on the quality of the politicians competing for office. The key insight is that a good incumbent with preferences identical to those of a representative voter will want to keep rent-seeking politicians out of office; he may do so by distorting his policy choices to signal his type and win reelection. The value of signaling and staying in office increases with the fraction of rent-seeking types in the population of politicians. Electing good types may therefore not be enough to ensure that the best policies are implemented, especially when rent seeking is widespread. This provides a new explanation for why political failure is particularly severe in corrupt democracies.","[Leon, Gabriel] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England; [Leon, Gabriel] Univ Cambridge, St Catharines Coll, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Leon, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Austin Robinson Bldg,Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",gjl38@cam.ac.uk,,"Leon Ablan, Gabriel/0000-0001-9826-7966",,,,,37,0,0,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The results show that the public sector wage premium is strongly counter-cyclical. On average, a 10 percent increase in the local unemployment rate increases the public-private sector wage gap by one percent. Separate analyses by government sector and quantiles of the distribution of wages reveal that it is local government workers and those working at lower skill levels who benefit more from increasing unemployment rate.

The impact of remittance on recipient economy requires further empirical investigation as there has not been consensus on whether remittance induces financial prodigality or investment in Africa. Differing from extant studies, this study employed rule of law, regulatory quality and government effectiveness as indicators of institutional quality. This is with a view to exploring how institutional quality and financial depth interact with remittance to influence investment in 44 African countries (1995-2010). The major finding from the study, inter alia, is that institutional quality and financial depth play complimentary role in influencing remittance for investment in Africa. This study concludes that the impact of Africa's money in Africa will be enhanced in the presence of reliable institutional quality and viable financial sector. Thus, the side effect of financial prodigality that might be associated with remittance can be ameliorated.","[Osabuohien, Evans Stephen] Covenant Univ, Dept Econ & Dev Studies, Ota 234, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Osabuohien, Evans Stephen] GIGA German Inst Global & Area Study, Hamburg, Germany; [Efobi, Uchenna Rapuluchukwu] Covenant Univ, Sch Business, Ota 234, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University; German Institute of Global & Area Studies; Covenant University,"Osabuohien, ES (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Econ & Dev Studies, PMB 1023, Ota 234, Ogun State, Nigeria.",stephen.osabuohien@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; uche.efobi@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"OSABUOHIEN, EVANS/O-3082-2017","OSABUOHIEN, EVANS/0000-0002-3258-8326",,,,,46,84,84,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

By using an input-output structural decomposition analysis (SDA), results confirm the theoretical predication that skills help to upgrade the quality of exporting commodities, by documenting that trade growth is associated with increases in the use of the higher skilled labor. We observe that Chinese and Indian ethnic groups contribute the most to the quality upgrading of exporting commodities, more so than the Malays, which imply productivity differentials among the ethnic groups.","[Saari, M.

We consider both welfarist and paternalistic social objectives. The paternalistic government attempts to correct the projection bias by using a higher discount factor. We derive general mathematical expressions that characterize optimal tax/pension design (marginal tax/subsidy rates). They suggest that the pattern of marginal labor income taxes depends on habit formation. Negative marginal labor income tax rates are possible. To gain a better understanding, we examine numerically the properties of an optimal lifetime redistribution policy with habit formation. We find support for non-linear tax/pension program in which some types of individuals are taxed while some are subsidized. The effect of changes in the degree of habit formation is explored in the numerical simulations as well as the implications of different degrees of correlation between skill and projection bias.","[Tuomala, Matti] Univ Tampere, Dept Econ, Espoo, Finland; [Tenhunen, Sanna] Finnish Ctr Pens, Res Dept, Elaketurvakeskus 0065, Finland",Tampere University,"Tuomala, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Dept Econ, Espoo, Finland.",Matti.Tuomala@Kolumbus.fi; sanna.tenhunen@etk.fi,,"Tenhunen, Sanna/0000-0002-3767-1751",,,,,31,5,5,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Patterns of both nominal and real returns on long-term government bonds imply a higher level of integration by the end of the 20th century compared to earlier periods.

These concerns have been described as imbalances and the remedy as rebalancing, and they have been widely covered in the media. But many economists are sceptical, arguing that the concept of sectoral balance is not meaningful, or that sectoral imbalance is nothing to worry about, or that, even if it is, policy-makers can do little about it. This paper explores the concept of sectoral rebalancing, considers the evidence for sectoral imbalance in the economies of rich countries, and examines the arguments why rebalancing might be a good thing. It finds that while arguments for interventions to restrict the risk and growth of the financial services sector have considerable evidence to support them, arguments that manufacturing output is especially desirable and should be promoted more than other sectors are less well evidenced. Finally, the paper considers recent policies that have been introduced to change the sectoral structures of economies, and sets out some principles for would-be rebalancers to follow.",,,,stian.westlake@nesta.org.uk,,,,,,,56,3,3,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Although compulsory-education barriers for migrants' children have gradually disappeared in China, many families who migrate to cities have to leave their school-age children in their hometown. In this paper, using a logit model, we investigate which factors influence school-residential choice for migrants' children. The latest migration survey, Shanghai's 2011 Floating Population Dynamic Monitoring Survey, which contains data on 23, 517 migrant families, is used. We obtain two major findings. First, higher levels of household income and parents' education increase the probability of migrants' children receiving their education in the city. Our second finding, which has more policy implications, is that noncompulsory-education barriers still prevent many migrants' children from moving to the city.","[Xu, Shengyan; Zhu, Hongfei; Li, Xiaolong] Fudan Univ, Econ Sch, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Zhu, HF (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Econ Sch, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",xushengyan_yn@126.com; zhuhongfei@fudan.edu.cn; lxl1976ad@gmail.com,"Li, xiaolong/GRS-9148-2022",,,,,,14,4,4,0,26,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,2436-097X,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

To interpret the data, we develop a simple model that identifies the flow of new vacancies and the job-filling rate for vacant positions. The fill rate moves counter to aggregate employment but rises steeply with employer growth rates in the cross section. It falls with employer size, rises with worker turnover rates, and varies by a factor of four across major industry groups. We also develop evidence that the employer-level hiring technology exhibits mild increasing returns in vacancies, and that employers rely heavily on other instruments, in addition to vacancies, as they vary hires. Building from our evidence and a generalized matching function, we construct a new index of recruiting intensity (per vacancy). Recruiting intensity partly explains the recent breakdown in the standard matching function, delivers. a better-fitting empirical Beveridge curve, and accounts for a large share of fluctuations in aggregate hires. Our evidence and analysis provide useful inputs for assessing, developing, and calibrating theoretical models of search, matching, and hiring in the labor market.

In one setup, participants earn their income by trading in a double auction (DA) with exogenous zero or full redistribution. In another setup, after trading, they vote on redistributive tax policies in a majoritarian election with two competing candidates. This results in virtually full redistribution, even when participants have the opportunity to influence taxes by transferring money to the candidates. We find that the high redistribution reduces trading efficiency, but not as much as predicted if market participants trade randomly. This is because, rather than capitulating to the much lower trading incentives, many participants respond to redistribution by asking and bidding more conservatively in the DA, and in this way help to prevent further efficiency losses.

It notes that both law and money are complex and controversial phenomena. They have to be treated as historically specific institutions that arise in the context of fundamental uncertainty. The historical origins of both are briefly considered. It is argued that fundamental uncertainty in the Knight-Keynes sense has been marginalised in modern economics and this creates problems for the theory of money. The comment also expands on the notion of 'essential hybridity' - which signals that money and law are a result of both private arrangements and state intervention.

A Simple Model Without Capital,ANNALS OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Corporate tax; Risk taking; Tax incidence; Entrepreneurship,,"This paper challenges the traditional view of the corporate tax as taxing corporate capital rather than the act of incorporating. Our model has no capital. Entrepreneurs pay to go public to diversify their risk. In discouraging incorporation, the tax keeps more entrepreneurs private and exposed to more risk. The tax falls primarily on high-skilled entrepreneurs and to a lesser extent on labor, who experience less demand for their services. The wage reduction also induces marginal entrepreneurs to set up shop and experience more risk. Hence, the answer to the title's question is that the corporate tax taxes risk-sharing.","[Kotlikoff, Laurence J.; Miao, Jianjun] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Miao, Jianjun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Miao, Jianjun] Zhejiang Univ, AFR, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Boston University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University,"Kotlikoff, LJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",kotlikoff@gmail.com; miaoj@bu.edu,,,,,,,11,2,3,2,17,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Native voters know that immigrants hold different 'political' preferences and would thus tend to postpone their enfranchisement as much as possible. They also consider, however, that a more restrictive naturalization policy may reduce the gains from immigration. We find that the optimal timing of naturalization depends on the quantity, quality (productivity), and preferences of potential immigrants, the political composition and the age structure of the native population, as well as the sensitivity of migration choices to the citizenship issue.","[Mariani, Fabio] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium; [Mariani, Fabio] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Mariani, Fabio] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Universite Catholique Louvain; Paris School of Economics; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Mariani, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium.",fabio.mariani@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,37,6,7,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

This uncertainty leaves the decision maker with a preference for flexibility: When choosing among menus that contain alternatives for future choice, she weakly prefers menus with additional alternatives. Standard representations that accommodate this choice pattern cannot distinguish tastes (indexed by a subjective state space) and beliefs (a probability measure over the subjective states) as different concepts. I allow choice between menus to depend on objective states. My axioms provide a representation that uniquely identifies beliefs, provided objective states are sufficiently relevant for choice. I suggest that this result can provide choice theoretic substance to the assumption, commonly made in the (incomplete) contracting literature, that contracting parties who know each others' ranking of contracts also share beliefs about each others' future tastes in the face of unforeseen contingencies.","Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Sadowski, P (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",p.sadowski@duke.edu,,,,,,,31,7,7,0,7,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

A unique steady state equilibrium exists Where distressed sellers attempt liquidation sales by accepting prices that are substantially below fundamental values. During periods where a large number of sellers are forced to liquidate customers exhibit 'predation': they hold off purchasing and strategically slow down the speed of trade, which in turn causes more sellers to become distressed. The model naturally suggests several proxies of liquidity. Interestingly, the average time on the market (TOM), one of the most frequently used statistics in the literature, does a poor job within the context of liquidation sales and predation. Specifically we show that TOM falls during periods of predatory buying, which, if interpreted on face value, indicates that the market becomes more liquid with predation. We propose an alternative proxy - the profit loss in fire sales - which appears to be a more robust measure of liquidity than TOM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Beyond this window of opportunity, human capital accumulation is more costly. Despite compelling evidence in support of this notion, government education spending is allocated disproportionately toward late childhood and young adulthood. We consider the consequences of a reallocation using an overlapping generations model with private and public spending on early and late childhood education. Taking as given the higher returns to early childhood investment, we find that the current allocation may nonetheless be appropriate. When we consider a homogeneous population, this can hold for moderate levels of government spending. With heterogeneity, this can hold for middle income workers.

To test this prediction, we have collected information on the club of employment of national team players for most countries in the world.

These long standing puzzles make the models harder to defend. In this paper, we present a symmetric two country portfolio balance model in which home and foreign bonds are imperfect substitutes for money in each country's transactions technology; this of course makes home and foreign bonds imperfect substitutes for each other. Our calibrated model is capable of addressing the Backus-Smith puzzle and the Backus-Kehoe-Kydland puzzle. It does not fully resolve the exchange rate volatility puzzle, but it makes some headway. And finally it generates deviations from uncovered interest parity, though by some estimates these deviations are not large enough to be consistent with the data.","[Canzoneri, Matthew; Cumby, Robert; Diba, Behzad] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Canzoneri, M (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",canzonem@georgetown.edu; cumbyr@georgetown.edu; dibab@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,44,8,8,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

However, neither the theoretical nor the empirical literature provides unambiguous guidance on the trade effect of ERV. This article applies meta-regression analysis to the empirical literature and finds evidence of: modest publication bias; a range of authentic empirical effects that are highly conditional, even with respect to sign and, correspondingly, pronounced heterogeneity in the reported results. Investigation of this heterogeneity reveals that the results are significantly influenced both by authors' modelling strategies and by the contexts of their investigations. In particular, researchers are most likely to find an adverse trade effect by investigating low-frequency real exchange variability and trade between less developed economies, hence, beyond the reach of hedging opportunities (as suggested by previous studies). In general, our most important advice for policy makers is that economic research does not reveal a single representative effect size.","[Haile, Mekbib Gebretsadik] Ethiopian Econ Assoc, Ethiopian Econ Policy Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Pugh, Geoff] Staffordshire Univ, Sch Business, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DE, Staffs, England",Staffordshire University,"Haile, MG (通讯作者)，Ethiopian Econ Assoc, Ethiopian Econ Policy Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",haymakg@yahoo.com,"Pugh, Geoffrey/AAG-5009-2019","Pugh, Geoffrey/0000-0002-9596-1757; Haile, Mekbib/0000-0002-5480-531X",,,,,78,15,17,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

J,"Kury, TJ",,,,"Kury, Theodore J.",,,Price effects of independent transmission system operators in the United States electricity market,JOURNAL OF REGULATORY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity market structure; Regional transmission organizations; Electricity market reform,COSTS,"In 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sought to remove impediments to competition in the wholesale bulk power marketplace and to bring more efficient, lower cost power to the Nation's electricity consumers through a series of market rules. A product of these rules was the establishment of regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) charged with facilitating equal access to the transmission grid for electricity suppliers. Whether these changes in market structure have succeeded in achieving FERC's goal to provide lower cost power to the Nation's electricity consumers remains an open question. This paper utilizes a panel data set of the 48 contiguous United States and a treatment effects model in first differences to determine whether there have been changes in delivered electric prices as a result of the establishment of ISOs and RTOs. To avoid the confounding effects of electric restructuring, the model is estimated with the full panel data set, and then again without the states that have restructured their electric markets. This estimation shows that electricity prices fall approximately 4.8 % in the first 2 years of an ISO's operation and that this result is statistically significant. However, this result is dependent on the presence of states that restructured their electricity markets. When these restructured states are removed from the data set the price effects of RTOs become indistinguishable from zero. The paper concludes that rate agreements are the principal source of the observed decrease in prices and that RTOs have not had the desired effect on electricity prices.","Univ Florida, Publ Util Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Kury, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Publ Util Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",ted.kury@warrington.ufl.edu,,,,,,,16,7,9,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The model generates predictions for asset market participation and returns across households. Moreover, search for financial returns enables the model to generate a more skewed equilibrium wealth distribution. In this context, social security privatization affects household search effort, asset market participation and the competitiveness of the asset market. Privatization reduces average welfare and this reduction is somewhat magnified by the search friction. While some have suggested that household decision making could be important for the consequences of privatization, my analysis does not bear this out. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In spite of the non-concavities due to the leisure externality, the balanced growth path is always unique, which guarantees global stability for comparative-static exercises. We find that small differences in preferences toward leisure or in leisure externalities can generate substantial differences in hours worked and growth, which may play a significant role in explaining differences in growth paths between the US and Europe, in addition to the mechanisms uncovered in Prescott (2004) [15] relying on differing marginal tax rates on labor income.

To this purpose, a twofold procedure is adopted here: first, LLL incidence is estimated for the total number of men and women taken separately, regardless of their country of residence; second, the information on the country where they live is taken into account and 21 country-specific equations are computed. Again, this is made for both sexes. This procedure allows us to shed light on cross-country gender differences. In the whole sample, our results show that for both men and women formal LLL incidence is significantly higher among young, better-educated, part-time and temporary workers, and lower among those who changed their job in the preceding year, are employed in small firms and have low-skilled occupations.

We focus on an overlapping generations exchange economy where each household makes a portfolio choice between money, held because of a liquidity constraint, and another asset with no fundamental value. We show the existence of equilibria where the second asset takes a positive value as a pure rational bubble. There may exist endogenous cycles and bubble fluctuations driven by the volatility of agents' expectations. An expansionary monetary policy can shelter the economy from these endogenous fluctuations, but this positive effect is counterbalanced by a welfare loss according to the Friedman critique: there is a trade-off between the stability and the stationary welfare target. Eventually, we consider a temporary bubble on real balances as an alternative source of self-fulfilling cycles.","[Bosi, Stefano] Univ Evry, EPEE, F-91025 Evry, France; [Seegmuller, Thomas] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Seegmuller, Thomas] EHESS, Marseille, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bosi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, EPEE, Blvd F Mitterrand, F-91025 Evry, France.",stefano.bosi@univ-evry.fr,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

We describe an OLG model in which demographics, technology, and social security are linked together in a political economy equilibrium. In the model economy, there are two locations (sectors), the farm (agricultural) and the city (industrial) and the decision to migrate from rural to urban locations is endogenous and linked to productivity differences between the two locations and survival probabilities. Farmers rely on land inheritance for their old age and do not support a pay-as-you-go social security system. With structural change, people migrate to the city, the land loses its importance and support for social security arises.

Beginning from Margaret Archer's analysis of modes of reflexivity and following the respective contributions of Geoff Hodgson and John Davis, the paper seeks to integrate into Archer's approach a place for habitual beliefs and an analysis of the 'relative autonomy' of the embedded individual. Archer's identification of modes of reflexivity is endorsed but her avoidance of any dispositional place for habit in the mind is questioned. It is argued that by excluding habits in this way, Archer, unlike Davis, implausibly assumes most individuals have achieved relative autonomy in their group associations. The essay develops an approach to the mind that articulates underlying relationships between habits and internal conversation, potentially enriching Archer's explanation of modes of reflexivity while locating Davis's notion of relative autonomy within that framework. Specific economic implications are then briefly considered.","Univ E London, Royal Docks Business Sch, London E15 4LZ, England",University of East London,"Fuller, C (通讯作者)，Univ E London, Royal Docks Business Sch, London E15 4LZ, England.",c.g.fuller@uel.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,7,7,1,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The main objective of the paper is to identify systematically potential mechanisms linking violent conflict with changes in poverty across provinces and households in Rwanda before and after a decade of violence. In accordance with emerging literature on the long-term economic effects of violent conflict, we find empirical evidence for economic convergence between richer and poorer Rwandan provinces and households following the conflict shocks. Using a small but unique panel of households surveyed before and after the conflict period, we find that households whose house was destroyed or who lost land ran a higher risk of falling into poverty. We do not find much evidence for an economic effect of violent deaths at the household level due to substitution effects of labor within the household. Non-violent deaths however seem to increase income per adult equivalent for the survivors.

This study develops a simple model that shows how a buyer group changes market behaviour, focusing on the impact on downstream firms outside the buyer group. This impact critically depends on whether or not the buyer group and the supplier can write a contract contingent on the market price paid by outsiders. With contingent contracts, the price paid by firms outside the buyer group rises and their profits fall. If such contracts are infeasible, possibly due to legal concerns, the market price is lower after the buyer group forms. These results raise issues for antitrust authorities in Australia, Europe, the USA and elsewhere who evaluate buyer-group agreements. We extend the model to consider the situation where a supplier can commit in advance to the market price. In this situation, the bargaining power of the buyer group becomes relevant with the market price inversely related to this bargaining power.

In our theoretical modeling we draw on the convenience yield approach in order to approximate the fundamental value of the oil price. We separate the oil price fundamental from the bubble component by expressing a standard present-value oil price model in state-space form. We then introduce two Markov-regimes into the state-space representation in order to distinguish between two distinct phases in the bubble process, namely one in which the oil price bubble is a stable process and one in which the bubble explodes. We estimate the entire Markov-switching state-space specification using an econometrically robust Bayesian Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methodology. Based on inferential techniques designed for statistically separating both Markov-regimes in the bubble process from each other, we find robust evidence for the existence of speculative bubbles in recent oil price dynamics.

Using the net interest margin as a proxy for financial intermediation costs at the bank level, we find that within LICs a substantial part of the variation in interest margins can be explained by bank-specific factors: margins tend to increase with higher riskiness of credit portfolio, lower bank capitalization (or lower risk aversion), and smaller bank size. Overall, we find that concentrated market structures and lack of competition in LICs banking systems and institutional weaknesses constitute the key impediments preventing financial intermediation costs from declining. Our results provide strong evidence that policies aimed at fostering banking competition and strengthening institutional frameworks can reduce intermediation costs in LICs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Small group effectiveness of improvement that all or almost all improvement can be realized by relatively small groupsof players. With many players, small group effectiveness ensures that diverse economies, including those with local public goods, clubs, indivisibilities and non-monotonicities are competitive; there exists price-taking economic equilibrium and the outcomes in the core and of price-taking equilibrium are equivalent and have the equal-treatment property.

He abandoned ospeculation' in favour of oinvestment'unamely, a ocareful selection of a few investments ... having regard to their cheapness and potential intrinsic value over a period of years ahead'. In other words, he was applying the margin of safety, a concept we particularly associate nowadays with Benjamin Graham, who incorporated it inter alia into his magnum opus of 1934, Security Analysis. An examination of the writings of Keynes, on the one hand, and Graham, on the other, reveals considerable overlap between, not to say unity of, their respective conceptions.

Our maximum entropy bootstrap based approach, which avoids pre-test biases while also being less affected from the size distortion problem, shows that a statistically significant relationship between FDI and GDP growth does not exist. We also explore whether this result is driven by the level of financial development and we find that there is no evidence of a change in the noncausal relationship due to this contingency effect. Our results indicate that FDI does not necessarily lead to higher economic growth at the aggregate level and suggest the need for undertaking disaggregated analyses using industrial and provincial level data for the formulation of effective macroeconomic policies concerning the flows of FDI.

An incumbent combines pre-determined capital with labor to produce different goods in the current period, and accumulates physical and financial capital for future production. Capital-labor complementarity determines how anticipated political turnover shapes governments' choice between saving in physical capital or financial assets. Turnover tends to render the stock of physical capital for public production too low and inefficiently combined with labor.

The dominant approach to inflation over the past two decades or so has been inflation targeting. The global environment of the decade circa 1995 to 2005 with the China effect pushing down prices of manufactured goods and with primary commodity prices being subdued was conducive to low inflation. It is argued that inflation targeting has not been a great success story and is unable to address inflation arising from global forces,or from struggles over the distribution of income. It is argued that a more sophisticated analysis than that contained in the Phillips curve is required. Further, and from our analysis, counter inflation policies should include the achievement of an inflation barrier consistent with full employment without inflationary pressures. This can be addressed by ensuring that there is sufficient productive capacity to underpin full employment, where sufficient is to be interpreted in terms of quantity, quality and geographical distribution. Further, we argue that this should be complemented by some form of incomes policy, to enable inflation to be contained without resorting to demand deflation.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Sawyer, Malcolm] Univ Leeds, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Cambridge; University of Leeds,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",pa267@cam.ac.uk; m.c.sawyer@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,12,16,0,16,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,1,,,,,1,17,,10.2298/PAN1301001A,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,148KA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319242300001,0

We estimate single equation, two-stage, and sibling fixed-effects models. We consider both absolute weight and weight relative to other girls in the individual's school. We focus on vaginal intercourse without a condom, any type of sexual activity while under the influence of alcohol, and anal intercourse. Our findings confirm previous research indicating that overweight or obese girls are less likely than their recommended-weight counterparts to be sexually active. As a result, they are less likely to have vaginal intercourse without a condom. However, overweight or obese girls are not less likely to have sex under the influence of alcohol, and once they have had vaginal intercourse, their consistency of condom use is no different from that of their recommended-weight peers. The most striking finding is that overweight or obese girls are at least 15% more likely than their recommended-weight peers to have ever had anal intercourse regardless of whether they have ever had vaginal sexual intercourse. The results from this study underscore the importance of using multifaceted and contemporary measures of risky sexual behavior and have implications for the health and well-being of adolescent girls.

It shows that in addition to income effects and growth differentials in sectoral total factor productivities (TFP), sectoral distortions are important for understanding the reallocation of resources across sectors. Allowing for a growing wedge between the marginal revenue product of labor relative to capital can explain the rapid decline in the manufacturing share of hours for the US that started in the 1980s. The distortions are also important for explaining the paths of sectoral hours for many European countries. However, the distortions lead to a misallocation of resources across sectors, which helps explain why the rapid Europe-US income convergence that started in the 1950s stopped in the early 1980s.","Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Bah, E (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",e.bah@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6116,1935-1690,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Following Donaldson and Pendakur (2006), the generalised absolute equivalence-scale exactness (GAESE) restrictions are incorporated into a translated quadratic almost ideal demand system. We obtain declining-with-expenditure equivalence scales, a pattern that tends to strengthen when the number of children increases. Thus, scale economies in current consumption are lower for families with poor expenditure capacities. We also show that families living in the South bear a substantial additional cost to achieve the same well-being of those living in the North.

We apply to that end a newly developed methodology based on high dimensional VAR theory. This approach features a dominant unit to a large set of over 60 countries' real effective exchange rates and is based on the comparison of two estimated systems: one before and one after EMU. We find strong evidence that the pattern of responses depends crucially on the nature of global shocks. In particular, post-EMU responses to global US dollar shocks have become similar to Germany's response before EMU, i.e., to that of the economy that used to issue Europe's most credible legacy currency. By contrast, post-EMU responses of euro area countries to global risk aversion shocks have become similar to those of Italy, Portugal or Spain before EMU, i.e., of economies of the euro area's periphery. Our findings also suggest that the divergence in external competitiveness among euro area countries over the last decade, which is at the core of today's debate on the future of the euro area, is more likely due to country-specific shocks than to global shocks.","[Bussiere, Matthieu] Banque France, Int Macroecon Div, F-75049 Paris, France; [Bussiere, Matthieu] Banque France, F-75001 Paris, France; [Chudik, Alexander] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, CAFE, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Chudik, Alexander] CIMF, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Mehl, Arnaud] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; Bank of France; European Central Bank; Bank of France; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; European Central Bank,"Bussiere, M (通讯作者)，Banque France, Int Macroecon Div, 49-1374 DERIE SEMSI, F-75049 Paris, France.",Matthieu.BUSSIERE@banque-france.fr,,"Chudik, Alexander/0000-0003-0239-1909",,,,,47,7,7,1,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Sizeable fiscal support packages in the aftermath of the crisis, coupled with a prolonged slack in most large advanced economies, have pushed government debt to unprecedentedly high levels. Sustained medium-term consolidation is therefore needed at a time when the outlook for the global economy remains fragile. This challenging conjuncture has attracted renewed interest in the quantification of fiscal multipliers, which vary considerably depending on policy settings (e.g., interactions among fiscal, monetary and structural policies) and the economic environment (e.g., simultaneous adjustment in a country s neighbours and trading partners, the level of government indebtedness, exchange rate regimes). Methodological considerations are also important when estimating the potency of fiscal multipliers. Given that the medium-term consolidation needs of most advanced economies are large, and that the fiscal multipliers are likely to be strong in the current juncture, the paper also discusses options for embedding fiscal adjustment in broader policy packages that include supply-side measures to minimise the short-term effects of budget retrenchment on activity and foster stronger growth in the longer-term.",,,,,,,,,,,64,2,3,0,26,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2013,,204,,,,,113,139,,,,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,206NO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323528900005,0

After the introduction of the Act, French academic institutions increased their propensity to claim IPRs over their employees' inventions, mainly under the form of co-ownership with business companies.

The main objectives of the process were to: develop a system of easily readable and comparable degrees, adopt a system with two main cycles (undergraduate/graduate), establish a system of credits, promote mobility by overcoming legal recognition and administrative obstacles, promote European co-operation in quality assurance, and promote a European dimension in higher education. Our universities are still undergoing a major change process including several measures and initiatives partly started even before the Bologna agreement (Nickel 2011). The fact that a change process turns out to be more complex than envisaged before is a common phenomenon. Thus, despite the efforts, there is a danger that the changes proposed might only be cosmetic. The effects of the Bologna process in the real organisation of European universities should be studied more carefully. To avoid a cosmetic reform, it is important to understand that the Bologna Process will only be a reality with the joint commitment of national and European level institutions (Berlin Conference 2003), and with the involvement of the whole university community. In this context, the paper takes a look at the current state of Intellectual Capital (IC) reporting and managing at universities, with special attention on the role of teaching while considering the three pillars of IC: human, structural and relational capital. Most of IC indicators used by universities focus on research and third mission while less on teaching. This contradicts the fact that Bologna shall strengthen the role of education and teaching in universities and improve organisation and management. How can this gap of objectives and practical implementation be overcome? The analysis of a case study of a German faculty where teaching and learning play a major strategic role serve us to illustrate how far evaluation and quality management in teaching indirectly lead to practical IC management, although not wearing this name. Finally we suggest a set of indicators for IC management, and eventually reporting, in teaching, that can practically be introduced to universities' monitoring and evaluation systems.","[Elena, Susana] European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain; [Pook, Katja] Univ Koblenz Landau, Fac Psychol, Landau, Germany",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); University of Koblenz & Landau,"Elena, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain.",susana.elena-perez@ec.europa.eu; pook@uni-landau.de,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,142,153,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000017,0

In compliance with theoretical assumptions and using the gravity model of international trade, it analyses the trade creation and trade diversion effects of the customs union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia. Although removing tariff and non-tariff obstacles to trade in the creation of the customs union contributes to the trade creation effect, the results have shown that there are other important factors that also influence the volume of trade flows. The aim of the paper is the assessment of the effects of the customs union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia on their bilateral trade as well as the impact of the customs union on European Union (EU) trade. For the future, deeper economic integration in the form of single economic space created by Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and other potential countries from EURASEC presents serious obstacles for developing tighter EU trade relations with Russia, which constitutes the third most important EU trade partner behind the United States and China.","[Fojtikova, Lenka] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Fojtíková, L (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",lenka.fojtikova@vsb.cz,"Fojtikova, Lenka/JCD-8885-2023",,"SGS project of Faculty of Economics, VSB - Technical University of Ostrava [SP2013/122]","SGS project of Faculty of Economics, VSB - Technical University of Ostrava","This paper was created under the SGS project (SP2013/122) of Faculty of Economics, VSB - Technical University of Ostrava.",,28,0,0,0,8,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-248-3095-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,32,45,,,,,,14,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393737200004,0

In other words, if Croatia traded with EU member states in accordance with the Linder theory of international trade based on the high level of intra-industry trade or the Heckscher-Ohlin theory of international trade based on the high level on inter-industry trade. Motivation for this research is the accession of Croatia to the European Union on the 1' July 2013.

However, under reasonable assumptions about the agent's utility function, the contracts induce a high effort less often as the agent's bargaining power increases. As for the social welfare, we are surprised to find that a utilitarian, who cares about the sum of the two parties' certainty equivalents, is worse off as the agent's bargaining power increases.

First, we develop a dynamic three-factor model of forward exchange rates in continuous time that incorporates central bank policy. We model the policy-related events, especially the interest rate adjustment, as interest rate jumps. We apply the model framework to the pricing of USD/CAD and USD/JPY forward exchange rates. We use the Kalman filter approach to estimate the model and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to discriminate jumps in interest rates. The empirical results show strong evidence of jumps in interest rates related to macroeconomic announcements. Given these jumps, we conclude that our proposed model improves the performance of existing forward exchange rates models. Last but not least, when jumps in interest rates occur, whether the volatility curves of forward rates are asymmetric smile-shaped depends on the standard deviation of spot exchange rate, the speed of adjustment coefficient of foreign interest rate and the correlation coefficient between spot exchange rate and foreign interest rate.

By 2011, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting persistent current policy budget deficits exceeding 6% of GDP, even after the economy recovered from the recession. This paper reviews the remarkable deterioration in the US fiscal outlook. It shows that more than half of the deterioration occurred before the 2007-9 recession, as a combination of tax cuts, increased spending, and worse than expected economic performance shifted the budget from surplus to deficit. The further deterioration since 2007 has two main components. Spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security is projected to increase by almost 3% of GDP over the first 10 years of baby boomer retirements, and interest costs are rising both because of the underlying fiscal imbalance and also as a result of the recession.

However, this method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, so that in practice VARs are estimated on a limited number of variables, leading to a potential missing information problem. In this article we use the method of structural factor analysis to evaluate the effects of monetary policy on key macroeconomic variables in a data rich environment. This methodology allows us to extract information on monetary policy and its impact on the economy from a much larger data set than is possible with the traditional VAR method. We propose two structural factor models. One is the Structural Factor Augmented Vector Autoregressive (SFAVAR) model and the other is the Structural Factor Vector Autoregressive (SFVAR) model. Compared to the traditional VAR, both models incorporate information from hundreds of data series, series that can be and are monitored by the central bank in setting policy. Moreover, the factors used are structurally meaningful, a feature that adds to the understanding of the 'black box' of the monetary transmission mechanism. Both models generate qualitatively reasonable impulse response functions. For the SFVAR model, both the price puzzle and the liquidity puzzle are eliminated.","[Liu, Dandan] Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Jansen, Dennis W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Liu, DD (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, 478 Business Adm Bldg,POB 5190, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",dliu1@kent.edu,,,,,,,42,0,1,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We identify for each country three distinct regimes in inflation/unemployment space. Similarities exist across countries in both the regimes and the timings of the transitions between regimes. However, the typical rates of inflation and unemployment experienced in the regimes are substantially different. Further, even within a given regime, the results from the cluster analysis reveal persistent fluctuations in the degree of attachment to that regime of inflation/unemployment observations over time. The economic implications of this are that, first, the inflation/unemployment relationship or Phillips curve experiences from time to time major shifts. Second, that it is also inherently unstable even in the short run. It is likely that the factors which govern the inflation/unemployment trade-off are so multi-dimensional that it is hard to identify periods of short-run Phillips curves which can be assigned to particular historical periods with any degree of accuracy or predictability.

In this context the development and use of intellectual capital (IC) provides an important lever for the implementation of sustainability management due to the fact that the IC of an organisation affects the performance of the three sustainability dimensions equally. A variety of sustainability management concepts point out the relevance of intangible resources whereas appropriate assessment and management approaches which reveal the contribution of IC are not or only very limited provided. Study results prove that the number of enterprises which are oriented towards sustainability has increased in recent years, but the implementation still encounters a variety of limits. This especially applies to small and medium sized enterprises (SME). Due to time and financial restrictions, many SMEs do not see themselves in a position to implement sustainable development as a part of the corporate strategy (Drenk 2009). Therefore concepts and methods have to be found in order to provide new and promising instruments in particular for SMEs which constitute the majority of Europe's economic strength. Within this research paper different aspects regarding the integration of Intellectual Capital and Sustainability Management in a SME context should be examined in detail. Against the background of the Fraunhofer Integrated Model the relevance of indicators for an integrated management approach will be highlighted. In the past, in particular quantitative indicators represented the largest share of measured variables. However, more and more non-monetary, qualitative indicators are increasingly included in the catalogues (Hirsch et al. 2004). Based on a systematic review of existing indicator catalogues, requirements and initial content for an integrated indicator format will be formulated. Against this background the aspect of benchmarking will be taken into account. The developed methodology is currently tested in a SME from the manufacturing sector. The last chapter of this paper will outline the preliminary results of this practical implementation.","[Orth, Ronald; Kohl, Holger] Fraunhofer IPK, Business Excellence Dept, Berlin, Germany",,"Orth, R (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer IPK, Business Excellence Dept, Berlin, Germany.",ronald.orth@ipk.fraunhofer.de; holger.kohl@ipk.fraunhofer.de,,,,,,,25,1,1,1,12,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,323,332,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000037,0

Creditworthiness is approximated by firm-specific factors, e. g. the firms' assessment of their current business situation and their business expectations. After controlling for the return on the banks' risk-free investment alternative, which is also likely to affect the supply of loans, we derive a credit crunch indicator, which measures that part of the shift in the loan supply that is neither explained by firm-specific factors nor by the opportunity costs of providing risky loans.","[Rottmann, Horst; Wollmershaeuser, Timo] Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Rottmann, Horst] Amberg Weiden Univ Appl Sci, D-92637 Weiden, Germany; [Wollmershaeuser, Timo] Univ Munich, Chair Publ Finance, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Wollmershäuser, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",wollmershaeuser@ifo.de,,,,,,,37,5,10,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The model uses a transformation function to recognize multiple outputs; separate technological classes based on multiple characteristics, a flexible generalized linear functional form, a variety of inputs and random effects to capture firm heterogeneity; and measures of first- and second-order elasticities to represent technical change and biases. We find that if multiple production frontiers are embodied in the data, different firms exhibit different output or input intensities and changes associated with different production systems that are veiled by overall (average) measures.

The income elasticity of demand for imports is obtained by employing 2SLS assuming that domestic income is endogenous. It is shown that the Slovak economy grew at a higher rate than the rate consistent with the balance-of-payments equilibrium at the cost of accumulating current account deficits. A sustainable solution should be focused on reducing the income elasticity of the demand for imports and increasing exports growth.

Notably, pass-through was higher for products assembled in high education countries while the response of outsourcing import prices to competing suppliers' prices was largest for products sold by firms in capital-intense industries. The reasons for these cross-country and cross-industry differences, as they relate to theories of outsourcing and trade, are explored.

A complicated process is required to find a rational solution that would include a large number of problems and criteria. Therefore, existing MCDM methods must be used as well as new ones developed. Notwithstanding SEA of Analysis of Socio- Economic Processes, there is little research examining factors of use of MCDM methods; thus, a more in- depth analysis should be undertaken. This study applied a systematic search of literature. A total of 73 papers from the academic literature containing such terms as ` Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)', ` Socio- Economic Processes (SEP)', ` Socio- Economic Systems (SES)', ` Social Systems (SS)', ` Economical Systems (ES)', ` Decision- Making (DM)' and ` Multi Criteria Decision- Making (MCDM)' were identified and reviewed. As to the eligibility problem in Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), criteria included studies on both Social and Economic Systems & Processes that examined development and trends related to SEA of Socio- Economic Processes. MCDM methods, assessment processes, data extraction and analysis were completed in all relevant studies. General activity fields in Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of Socio- Economic Systems were analysed. The key issues of SEA in micro, meso and macro environment, Socio- Economic Systems and Socio- Economic Processes factors were prominent across all researched categories. As far as the analysis of Socio- Economic Systems & Processes, decision makers should be aware of the problem in its complexity and undertake multi- stage decision- making. To honour the contribution made by Prof Valentinas Podvezko contribution in the field of Decision- Making (DM) to Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of Socio- Economic Systems using MCDM methods, and to commemorate his 70th anniversary, this article also highlights his academic career and research.","[Tamosaitiene, Jolanta] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Fac Civil Engn, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kaplinski, Oleg] Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Architecture, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Poznan University of Technology,"Tamosaitiene, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",jolanta.tamosaitiene@vgtu.lt,"Kaplinski, Oleg/H-8382-2014; Tamošaitienė, Jolanta/E-9278-2012","Tamošaitienė, Jolanta/0000-0003-4692-6821; Kaplinski, Oleg/0000-0003-0780-3968",,,,,72,6,6,0,28,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

With these aims in mind, we develop a model based on those first put forward by Settergren and Mikula (2005) and Boado-Penas et al. (2008) to obtain the analytical properties of the CA and to confirm its soundness as a measure of the assets of a PAYG scheme. Our model also enables us to explore whether, and to what extent, the HA can be considered a second alternative measure of the assets for PAYG schemes. The main theoretical finding is that, despite their very different natures, the HA and the CA may nearly coincide at the limit when the interest rate of the financial market approaches the growth of the covered wage bill from above, but the HA supplies a solvency indicator which is not always consistent with the system's financial health.","[Boado-Penas, Maria del Carmen] Keele Univ, Keele Management Sch, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England; [Vidal-Melia, Carlos] Univ Valencia, Dept Financial Econ & Actuarial Sci, Valencia 46022, Spain",Keele University; University of Valencia,"Boado-Penas, MD (通讯作者)，Keele Univ, Keele Management Sch, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England.",m.d.boado-penas@econ.keele.ac.uk,"VIDAL-MELIA, CARLOS/AAH-9010-2020","VIDAL-MELIA, CARLOS/0000-0002-7227-5076; Boado Penas, Carmen/0000-0002-0643-4921",,,,,33,14,14,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Because we lack evidence on the rate at which unpaid consumption displaces paid consumption, we know little about the size of the effect of pirate consumption on the volume of paid consumption. We provide direct evidence on both the volume of unpaid consumption and the rate of sales displacement for movies in China using two surveys administered in late 2008 and mid-2009. First, using a survey of Chinese college students' movie consumption and an empirical approach parallel to a similar recent study of US college students, we find that three quarters of movie consumption is unpaid and that each instance of unpaid consumption displaces 0.14 paid consumption instances. Second, a survey of online Chinese consumers reveals similar patterns of paid and unpaid movie consumption but a displacement rate of roughly zero.

Using the first approach, we estimate the effectiveness of a sample of Chilean schools after controlling by a baseline at the student level. In order to avoid the endogeneity of such a baseline with respect to the school effect, we use a longitudinal data set (SIMCE 2004 and SIMCE 2006) from which a natural pseudo-experiment is defined in such a way that the baseline is by design uncorrelated with the school effect. Thereafter, we investigate possible relationships between parental school choice (as declared in public standardized surveys) and the schools classified by their effectiveness. The main conclusions of this paper are, on the one hand, that there is not remarkable difference between municipal (public) and subsidised schools in terms of their effectiveness analyzed under value-added; and, on the other hand, that there is no relation between parental school choice preferences and school effectiveness.","[Carrasco, Alejandro; San Martin, Ernesto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Measurement Ctr MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile; [San Martin, Ernesto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Mathemath, Measurement Ctr MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Carrasco, A (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Measurement Ctr MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile.",,"San+Martín, Ernesto/AAQ-2374-2021; Carrasco Rozas, Alejandro/F-6620-2015","Carrasco Rozas, Alejandro/0000-0003-1504-5044",,,,,29,16,26,0,36,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

Asia-Europe overlap, Europe, Europe-America overlap and America. Modelling the interaction between returns and volatility in an autoregressive five-equation system, we find evidence that depreciation of the US dollar against the yen has a greater impact on the US dollar-yen volatility spill-over than appreciation in the subprime crisis period. Appreciation and depreciation of the US dollar against the euro does not appear to have an asymmetric effect on the euro-US dollar volatility spill-over.

A pilot inclusive agricultural extension system was introduced in 2005 to better meet the diverse needs of small-scale farmers. Three key features of the experiment are (1) inclusion of all farmers as target beneficiaries, (2) effective identification of farmers' extension service needs, and (3) an accountability system to provide better agricultural extension services to farmers. This paper describes design of the reform initiative and examines its effect on farmers' access to extension services. Based on farmer supplied data from six counties for the years 2005 to 2007, this paper shows that inclusive reform initiatives significantly improve farmers' access to and actually received of agricultural extension services as well as their adoption of new technologies. Implications for further reforms to the agricultural extension system are also discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

We show that the technology with the lower critical mass implies risk dominance and selection by the maximin criterion.

The effect of R&D investment is modelled via the accumulation of knowledge that is treated as a specific production factor. The main findings show that knowledge accumulation can contribute to higher economic growth, but the impact of the dynamisation in the CGE model is very low. However, in terms of structural changes in the economy, the omission of knowledge capitalization might underestimate the tertiary sector in the longer run.

Analyzing a revenue-sharing program between the central and local governments in Brazil that uses an allocation formula based on local population estimates, I document two main results: first, that the population estimates entering the formula were manipulated and second, that this manipulation was political in nature. Consistent with swing-voter targeting by the right-wing central government, I find that municipalities with roughly equal right-wing and non-right-wing vote shares benefited relative to opposition or conservative core support municipalities. These findings suggest that the exclusive focus on discretionary transfers in the extant empirical literature on special-interest politics may understate the true scope of tactical redistribution that is going on under programmatic disguise.

Recent theoretical and empirical studies indicate that an important margin of adjustment to policy reforms is the reallocation of output within firms through changes in product mix decisions. This paper examines the frequency, pervasiveness and determinants of product-switching and upgrading activities in firms located in China's state-owned forest areas during a period of gradual institutional and managerial reforms (2004-2008). We find that changes to the product mix are pervasive and characterized by adding or churning products rather than only shedding products.

We used survey-based experimental techniques to extract individual household credit demand functions from which we estimated point demand elasticities. From a theoretical point of view, we proposed that as interest rates fell the demand for credit increased in elasticity, and this appears to hold in our data. We find a range of elasticities with mean point estimates of about -0.6. We find that nearly 20% of farm households have nearly perfectly inelastic demands for credit but we also find that nearly 20% have elasticities above -0.75 including some 15% that have elasticities greater than -1.0. Previous studies that have argued against credit policies because of the low inelasticity of demand do not generally hold. There is much heterogeneity in credit demand and we would argue that a full spectrum of targeted credit policies can be used to address differences across farms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Based on this analysis, we seek to place the Copenhagen pledges in a long-term context, putting focus on costs and feasibility. We set up a Carbon Prices Convergence Scenario, assuming that all countries start from the Copenhagen commitments and gradually undertake their own individual efforts in accordance with the convergence of carbon prices toward a uniform price in 2050. Despite soaring carbon prices in most countries, total costs as share of GDP show modest increase, ranging mostly between 0% and 0.4%. We also find that there does not seem to be much difference in the degree of burden between developed and major developing countries under this scenario.

According to many problems of ore body extraction are direct or indirect depend on underground mining method, this issue is one of the most critical decisions in the design stage of mine that should be made. A number of the evaluation criteria that often are in conflicting with each other exist for evaluating feasible mining methods. Therefore, the problem of mining method selection is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) issue. On the other hand, according to the sophisticated structure of the problem, imprecise data,less of information, and inherent uncertainty, the usage of the fuzzy sets can be useful. In this paper an integrated model based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) is developed. FAHP is applied to determine the relative weights of the evaluation criteria for mining method selection that these weights are inserted to the FTOPSIS technique to rank the alternatives and select the most appropriate alternative.

Indeed, many pleasure trips are often characterized by the visit to more than a single destination. Although the topic is well-documented in literature, the empirical results are limited to a few pioneering studies. The lack may be attributable to the failure of tourism organizations to collect data on multi-destination trip behaviour. This can be seen, for example, in the system of European statistics on tourism (according to the Council Directive 95/57 EC), where information on the average number of visited destinations within a single trip is not provided. This paper aims at discussing the main implications of multi-destination trips, both on tourism statistics and on destination management. It also proposes to describe the research design and main preliminary results of a survey on incoming tourism in Sicily.

They assume that consumers derive different utilities from the consumption of the same good in different seasons. The seasonal product differentiation is modelled along the lines of Gabszewicz and Thisse (Price Competition, Quality and Income Disparities, 1979) and Shaked and Sutton (Relaxing Price Competition through Product Differentiation, 1982). The authors assume that it is possible for a firm to invest in order to reduce the degree of the demand seasonality. They show that, for a wide set of parameter configuration, the optimal effort to reduce seasonality is higher from a social welfare perspective, as compared to the private producer perspective. The tourism market can represent an application of the present model. However, unlike most available literature in this field, their model provides a microeconomic basis for the evaluation of investments aimed at reducing seasonality, rather than taking a macroeconomic approach.","[Cellini, Roberto; Rizzo, Giuseppe] Univ Catania, I-95129 Catania, CT, Italy; [Rizzo, Giuseppe] Ctr Strateg & Policy Studies, Gadong, Brunei; Ctr Strateg & Policy Studies, Gadong, Brunei",University of Catania,"Cellini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, CT, Italy.",cellini@unict.it,,"Rizzo, Giuseppe/0000-0002-3631-5456; Cellini, Roberto/0000-0003-1991-9685",,,,,25,2,2,0,16,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 21,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201243.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-43,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,091HG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315039400001,0

It is not obvious that the positive treatment effects identified in the research-driven intervention can be replicated locally. The present study explicitly addresses this challenge by analysing the local version of a research-driven business training programme among microfinance entrepreneurs in Tanzania. Comparing the local programme with the research-led programme in terms of attendance and subjective evaluation, we find that success in local implementation cannot be taken for granted. Moreover, an analysis of long-term outcomes also demonstrates a weaker impact of the local programme. We conclude that the estimated effect of research-led interventions should be interpreted as an upper bound of what can be achieved when scaling up such interventions locally.","[Berge, Lars Ivar Oppedal; Bjorvatn, Kjetil; Juniwaty, Kartika Sari; Tungodden, Bertil] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Berge, Lars Ivar Oppedal] CMI Chr Michelsen Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Juniwaty, Kartika Sari] Univ Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Indonesia,"Tungodden, B (通讯作者)，NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway.",bertil.tungodden@nhh.no,,"Juniwaty, Kartika Sari/0000-0002-8039-2133",,,,,14,20,22,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

At the beginning of transition, the new opportunities to start own businesses were expected to release the entrepreneurship potential of the population and lead to fast convergence towards the successful market economies. At the same time, entrepreneurship was expected to alleviate the labour shedding from restructured inefficient industrial sector. The data seldom corroborates this successful transition scenario. This paper provides analysis of the regional differences in self-employment in Croatia during the mature transition 1998-2008 period. Although self-employment cannot be equalized with entrepreneurship, Labour Force Survey as relatively rich data source enables investigation of certain factors that might be partially related to the overall entrepreneurship propensity of the working population in Croatia. Furthermore, analysis of potential regional differences in Croatian labour force entrepreneurship propensity has not been previously quantitatively assessed in the literature. The regional perspective in the paper is used to investigate whether there is a link between the evolution of self-employment and overall unemployment rate in the region (does self-employment help to alleviate unemployment problems?), the share of public sector employment (do chances of finding a secure government job impede entrepreneurship?), economic structure of the region (which economic sectors are more likely to encourage self-employment?) through time. In addition, the characteristics of the self-employed - in terms of gender, age, occupation, education, wage, household characteristics are compared to those in employment. With this segment of the analysis we try to reveal whether there is higher entrepreneurship propensity within certain population subgroups in Croatia.","Inst Econ Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Botric, V (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedy 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",vbotric@eizg.hr,,"Botric, Valerija/0000-0001-5482-7490",,,,,21,7,7,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We assume that an asset with fixed supply(land) is used as collateral, and firms need to hold collateral to finance their input costs. The latter feature introduces an interaction between the inefficiencies in the financial market and in the factor market. Good news raises the price of land today, which relaxes the collateral constraint. It, in turn, reduces the inefficiency in the labor market. If this force is sufficiently strong, the equilibrium labor supply increases. So do output, investment, and consumption. Our models also generate procyclical movement in Tobin's Q.

Using a three-stage least squares procedure, I estimate a simultaneous equation model for employment, wages and capital stock. The importance of the study of the relationship between growth and employment is due to the fact that the sign of this connection is not clear-cut. Theoretical models imply that the impact of productivity on employment is ambiguous. Furthermore, the empirical contributions are still not so many to reach a strong conclusion on the sign of the relationship above. This paper finds that the impact of productivity growth on employment is negative in the short-run and this effect remains negative even in the long-run. The implication of my results is that all new technology is embodied in new jobs and job creation plays no role in the employment dynamics of the sample I have considered.","[Ladu, Maria Gabriela] Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali DiSEA, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Ladu, Maria Gabriela] CRENoS, Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari,"Ladu, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali DiSEA, Via Torre Tonda 34, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",mgladu@uniss.it,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2012,39.0,4,,,SI,,513,524,,10.1007/s10663-012-9202-y,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,026BZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310247300005,0

In a panel cointegration and Granger causality framework, the major sectors in China are studied using data collected from July 2001 to December 2010. When the effects of cross-sectional dependence and multiple structural breaks are taken into account, the panel cointegration relationship between oil prices and stock prices is confirmed at the disaggregated sector level. The results indicate that there is some evidence of structural breaks in the interaction between oil prices and Chinese sectoral stocks. The long-run estimates suggest that the real oil price has a positive effect on sectoral stocks in the long run. The Granger causality tests demonstrate a unidirectional, short-run Granger causality relationship running from oil prices and sectoral stocks to the interest rate for 2001/07-2005/10. There is also a unidirectional, long-run Granger causality running from sectoral stocks to the interest rate for 2001/07-2005/10 and 2005/12-2007/06. However, the long-run Granger causality is bidirectional between oil prices, the interest rate and sectoral stocks for 2007/08-2008/11 and 2009/01-2010/12.

By establishing objective functions of LMF and PMF, it constructs the theoretical framework to discuss the role of information in the duopoly firstly. Then, based on the comparative static analysis, it discusses the effects of the market demand information and cost information on expected output and welfare. Finally it compares the role of information in LMF with the case of PMF, and the role of information in the LMF-PMF duopoly with those of LMF-LMF duopoly and PMF-PMF duopoly. It is shown that whereas the LMF's behavior is analogous to that of the PMF twin in some circumstances, the former may be entirely different from the latter in others. The LMF will be more sensitive to the information. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In a similar manner, we might expect ex ante, that increases in the level of personal indebtedness would be likely to provide similar incentives to engage in criminality.

In particular, Pasinetti calls attention to the heuristic value of Sraffa's unpublished manuscripts in assessing the constructive effort of Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities (PCC). This paper moves further along the above line of investigation and explores the Smithian strand of PCC. In particular the paper highlights that the duality between 'horizontal' and 'vertical' prices, explored by both Sraffa and Pasinetti, points to the existence of different complementary causal linkages in classical political economy. Vertical integration makes it possible to 'resolve' prices into a sum of weighted quantities of labour and calls attention to the system of weights needed for this operation. Alternative weighting systems may be associated with alternative institutional arrangements. For example, a traditional wage-profit economy would attach increasingly higher weights to increasingly remote quantities of labour. But the analytics of vertical integration also raises the institutional possibility of increasingly lower weights as increasingly remote labour quantities are considered. The paper argues that by assessing together the horizontal (Ricardian) and vertical (Smithian) strands of PCC it is possible to grasp more fully the theoretical potential of this work. In particular, it becomes possible to distinguish between the identification of general causal principles and the instantiation of those principles in specific historical contexts.","[Scazzieri, Roberto] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Scazzieri, Roberto] Univ Cambridge Gonville & Caius Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TA, England",University of Bologna; University of Cambridge,"Scazzieri, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",rs292@cam.ac.uk,,"SCAZZIERI, ROBERTO/0000-0003-4652-8807",,,,,15,5,5,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Since the rational expectation theory revolution linear models of inflation have been criticised for their poor forecasting performance.

I present a formal model in which an inventor and the existing firm engage in a strategic innovation game by choosing whether to compete or to cooperate through technology transfer. The model highlights how the problem of tacit knowledge affects the inventor's R&D investment and the existing firm's investment in absorptive capacity. The inventor's tacit knowledge implies that benefits from own-use through entrepreneurship can exceed the benefits from technology transfer. In equilibrium, higher-quality inventions result in entrepreneurship and lower-quality inventions result in technology transfer. R&D investment and absorption investment are strategic substitutes in the innovation game with the option of entrepreneurship. The possibility of entrepreneurship increases R&D investment and reduces absorption investment. The equilibrium probability of entrepreneurship is decreasing in the costs of R&D, increasing in the costs of absorption, and decreasing in the set-up costs of new firms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While depletion is spread in a balanced Hotelling fashion during peace, the presence of conflict creates incentives for rapacious extraction, as this lowers the stakes of future contest. This voracious extraction depresses total oil revenue, especially if world oil demand is relatively elastic and the government's weapon advantage is weak. Some of these political distortions can be overcome by bribing rebels or by government investment in weapons. The shadow of conflict can also make less efficient nationalized oil extraction more attractive than private extraction, as insecure property rights create a holdup problem for the private firm and lead to a lower license fee. Furthermore, the government fights less intensely than the rebels under private exploitation, which leads to more government turnover. Without credible commitment to future fighting efforts, private oil depletion is only lucrative if the government's non-oil office rents are large and weaponry powerful, which guarantees the government a stronger grip on office and makes the holdup problem less severe.

In a symmetric case where the number of firms, emission coefficient, and firms' environmental consciousness are the same in two countries, an opening of trade unambiguously improves each country's welfare in the short run. In the long run, however, trade increases the stock of global pollution and hence, whether opening of trade is beneficial depends on the parameters of the economy. If there are asymmetries between countries, the short-run gains from trade in both countries are not necessarily guaranteed, because trade liberalization may increase output in one country and reduce it in the other.

Our estimates use a new micro-data set that comprises the accounting statements of all listed, non-financial companies in Japan. We find that in 1980-1986, a period that immediately preceded Japan's so-called bubble economy, our assessed value of corporate productive assets, net of the value of corporate debt, is approximately equal to the actual stock market value of Japanese corporate equity. The finding differs from previous results based on studies of aggregate data sets or based on studies of micro-data sets that neglected intangible capital. We also show that the Japanese ratio of the amount of intangible capital stock to the amount of tangible capital stock is comparable to the analogous ratios for the U.S. and U.K. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

First, the effect of trade liberalization on economic growth is ambiguous. Second, the effect of trade liberalization by developing countries on their income distribution is ambiguous. This paper attempts to explain simultaneously these two puzzles, based on a multiple-cone neoclassical growth model. The model shows that countries that are labour abundant in a global sense may see a rise in income inequality and a fall in per capita gross domestic product with liberalization if they are capital abundant in a local sense. The results suggest that the existence of multiple cones and the multiple steady states within the same cone, or the existence of global and local factor abundances, can be a possible explanation of these puzzles.","Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Business Adm, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan",Yokohama National University,"Kiyota, K (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Business Adm, 79-4 Tokiwadai, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan.",kiyota@ynu.ac.jp,,"Kiyota, Kozo/0000-0001-7649-9870","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22243023, 21730187] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,25,7,8,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In the experiment, Vietnamese students enrolled in an English course performed significantly better on the official standardized international final test when they were told their rankings on practice tests than when they were not.

Our main idea is that any method of ascribing welfare to an individual as a function of choice is subjective, and depends on the economist undertaking the analysis. We provide a simple example of the type of exercise we propose. Namely, we define an individual welfare functional as a mapping from stochastic choice functions into weak orders. A stochastic choice function (or choice distribution) gives the empirical frequency of choices for any possible opportunity set (framing factors may also be incorporated into the model). We require that for any two alternatives x and y, if our individual welfare functional recommends x over y given two distinct choice distributions, then it also recommends x over y for any mixture of the two choice distributions. Together with some mild technical requirements, such an individual welfare functional must weight every opportunity set and assign a utility to each alternative x which is the sum across all opportunity sets of the weighted probability of x being chosen from the set. It therefore requires us to have a prior view about how important or representative a choice of x at a given situation is. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, foreign firms' exports and processing trade tend to be more destination-specific and products are more specialized.

In a blog post, Greg Mankiw expressed skepticism. In their blogs, Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman sighed. Of course there would be strong growth, they maintained, because the recovery of employment would mandate it via Okun's Law. Mankiw challenged Krugman to a bet on the issue, but there was no response. Of course we now have a good idea of the likely outcome, but I posit a hypothetical time series econometrician who, at the time of the blog entries, applies some standard forecasting methods to see whether DeLong and Krugman's confidence was justified. The econometrician's conclusion is that Mankiw would likely win the bet and furthermore that a rebound of any significance is unlikely. The econometrician has no idea how DeLong and Krugman could have been so confident in the CEA's rebound forecast.","Westminster Coll, New Wilmington, PA 16172 USA",Westminster College Pennsylvania,"Cushman, DO (通讯作者)，Westminster Coll, New Wilmington, PA 16172 USA.",cushmado@westminster.edu,,"Cushman, David/0000-0001-8021-3660",,,,,54,7,7,1,13,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

The institutional vacuum created by the disappearance of large collective farms after the Soviet Union's collapse was not filled by recognizing the autonomy of local communities, as happened in other Central European countries. In the mid-1990s, an original citizen movement emerged in the form of rural communities that, reconnecting with the pre-Soviet village system, signaled a return to a concrete, operational territorial grid. During the first decade of their existence, this self-organized movement mainly focused on strengthening social bonds between the inhabitants of local communities; but since the Leader Program was introduced and has become a major source of funds for local development in Lithuania, these rural communities are adopting development strategies and concrete projects. This new form of local action is described by analyzing a few projects at the initiative of the Local Action Group in Joniskis district, northern Lithuania.","[Dedeire, Marc] Univ Montpellier 3, UMR 5281, ART Dev, F-34032 Montpellier, France; [Maciulyte, Jurgita] Univ Vilnius, Vilnius, Lithuania",CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Vilnius University,"Dedeire, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier 3, UMR 5281, ART Dev, F-34032 Montpellier, France.",marc.dedeire@univ-montp3.fr; jurgitamaciulyte@hotmail.com,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,16,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Our results confirm that output comovement is higher for country pairs with closer trade linkages and similar patterns of sectoral specialisation. By contrast, it remains difficult to find a direct relationship between bilateral financial linkages and output correlation. However, our results suggest that financial integration spurs business cycle synchronisation indirectly by raising the similarity in sectoral specialisation.

We study how different classes of production functions generate alternative equilibrium assignments. We then use confidential Census data on U.S. law offices to investigate the form that the production function should take to rationalize earnings patterns in legal services. We argue that earnings patterns in this industry are consistent with a production function that is characterized by asymmetric sensitivity to the skill of agents in different organizational positions, complementarity between managers' and workers' skill, and scale effects in individual skill.

The study adopts a semi-parametric variable coefficient model in order to investigate the impact of climatic factors on electricity demand. As evident from previous studies, electricity demand is a U-shaped function of temperature. We find the rising part of the temperature-electricity curve to become more pronounced over time implying an increase in cooling demand per unit increase in summer temperatures. The study therefore predicts the adverse effects of climate change on electricity demand to be asymmetrically distributed in different seasons in the future, resulting in a serious disequilibrium in the hot months.

An informed but self-interested agent makes a price offer to buy decision-making authority from an uninformed principal, who then decides to either accept or reject the offer. No matter how large the difference is between the parties' preferences, there exists a continuum of perfect Bayesian equilibria in which authority is transferred with a probability of 1. In these equilibria, no information is transmitted, even though the informed agent's price offers could have been used as a signaling device. However, we also construct an infinite sequence of informative equilibria that approximates the full revelation of information in any state of nature in the limit. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is generally accepted that news coverage depends not only on the preferences of media consumers but also on the preferences of advertisers or subsidizing groups. However, existing models reach the opposite conclusions about the relationship between the profitability of advertising and media bias. We present a theoretical model that reconciles these results. The model shows that the sign of the effect of marginal costs of production or marginal advertising revenues on the level of distortion in news coverage depends on complementarity or substitutability between media bias and audience size for an interest group, the existence of a budget constraint for an interest group, and media outlets' reliance on subscription, in addition to advertising, revenues.

J,"Tooley, J",,,,"Tooley, James",,,Big Questions and Poor Economics: Banerjee and Duflo on Schooling in Developing Countries,ECON JOURNAL WATCH,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Education; private schools; private education; development; developing countries,,"In Poor Economics, MIT professors Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo set out their solutions for global poverty. Their key premise is that development experts have been sidetracked by the big questions of development, such as the role of government and the role of aid. This approach, they say, should be eschewed in favour of adopting carefully tested small steps to improvement. The book ranges widely, covering topics such as food, health, family planning and microfinance. Here I treat only their arguments on education in developing countries. Poor Economics points to evidence that shows that governments have not been successful in bringing quality education to the poor. Nevertheless, the authors bring their own big-think judgments to suggest why, despite the evidence, governmentally owned and operated schooling should remain central. Part of their own evidence concerns how private schooling, including for the poor, is burgeoning and outperforming government schooling. But private education cannot be the solution, they argue, because private schooling is not as efficient as it could be. The problems identified by Banerjee and Duflo are, however, clearly caused by bad public policy. I suggest that development economists are quite justified in forming and exercising judgment on the big questions, and that when they do exercise such judgment they should be aware that they are doing so.","Newcastle Univ, EG W Ctr, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Tooley, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, EG W Ctr, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",james.tooley@newcastle.ac.uk,,,,,,,10,2,2,1,10,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

This study investigates the impact of fiscal decentralization on the ownership shares of multinational firms in China. Multinational firms located in regions with higher degrees of fiscal decentralization are found to own larger shares of their foreign subsidiaries. This result is consistent under various robustness checks, including instrumental variables estimations. The finding suggests that multinational firms respond to local fiscal decentralization by increasing their participation in investment. This study therefore provides additional evidence for the beneficial effect of fiscal decentralization on China's economic growth by highlighting the risk-mitigating role of fiscal decentralization.","[Wu, Shih-Ying] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; [Teng, Mei-Jane] Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taichung 411, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University; National Chin-Yi University of Technology,"Wu, SY (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",wus@mx.nthu.edu.tw; tengmj@ncut.edu.tw,,,,,,,47,3,3,1,35,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Using state level pooled data for the period 2000-2009 the paper finds that the more unequal the distribution of income in a state and the more urban the state, the greater the bankruptcy rate in the state.

Agents are heterogeneous along two dimensions: employment status (insiders and outsiders) and skills (low and high). Unlike previous work on the political economy of labor market institutions, we emphasize the role of job protection and unemployment benefits in the wage-setting process.

Trade intensity, sector specialization and financial integration are tested for being the driving forces for the endogenous synchronization of wage dynamics. We use regression techniques with instrument variables, and find evidence of persistent asymmetries in nominal wage formation, despite a single currency and monetary policy. We explain the result with more specialization following financial integration, and with still existing differences in wage formation and labor market institutions.

Capital controls are strongly associated with countries having significantly undervalued exchange rates. Capital controls also appear to be less motivated by worries about financial market volatility or fickle capital flows per se, but rather by concerns about capital inflows triggering an overheating of the economy - in the form of high credit growth, rising inflation and output volatility. Moreover, countries with a high level of capital controls, and those actively implementing controls, tend to be those that have fixed exchange rate regimes, a non-IT monetary policy regime and shallow financial markets.

The study is performed on the basis of the Datastream and DTCC data on CDS spreads and the BIS data on cross-border exposures. The analysis of the data shows that sovereign risk mainly concentrates in the EU countries. The EWMA correlation analysis and the Granger-causality test demonstrate that there was contagion effect since correlations and cross-county interdependencies increased already after August 2007. Furthermore, the IRF analysis shows that among PIIGS the CDS markets of Spain and Ireland have the biggest impact on the European CDS market, whereas the CDS market of the UK does not cause a big distress in the Eurozone. The adjusted correlation analysis confirms that Greece and other PIIGS (even Spain and Italy) have lower capacity to trigger contagion than core EU countries.

A network of interbank lending is established that is used as a transmission mechanism for the failure of banks through the system. We trigger a potential banking crisis by exogenously failing a bank and investigate the spread of this failure within the banking system. We find the obvious result that the size of the bank initially failing is the dominant factor whether contagion occurs, but for the extent of its spread the characteristics of the network of interbank loans are most important.

Instead of analyzing the time series at their original level, as it is usually done, we first decompose the two macroeconomic variables at various scales of resolution using wavelet decomposition and then we study the relationships among the decomposed series on a scale by scale basis. A major finding of this paper is that the linear and nonlinear causal relationships between the real oil price and the real effective U.S. Dollar exchange rate vary over frequency bands as it depends on the time scales. Indeed, there is a strong bidirectional causal relationship between the real oil price and the real dollar exchange rate for large time horizons, i.e. corresponding to fundamentalist traders, especially fund managers and institutional investors. But, for the first frequency band which corresponds to a class of traders whom investment horizon is about 3-months and whom trading is principally speculative (noise traders), the causality runs only from the real oil prices to real effective U.S dollar exchange rate.

Studies have generally used polynomial regression (quadratic or cubic form) to investigate this relationship. It has been recognised that polynomials are not that flexible and that, by choosing the degree of the polynomial, researchers make a priori assumptions. In this paper, we investigate the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis using a flexible approach from additive mixed models. Such models are well-suited to handle nonlinear covariate effects flexibly and to simultaneously deal with temporal error structure. We consider the following countries: Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Our results show the existence of the classic environmental Kuznets curve for France and Switzerland, and of a nonlinear (increasing) relationship for Australia. Italy and Spain. For Austria, the evidence reveals a weak N-shaped relationship. New nonlinear shapes are found for Finland (inverted-L-shape relationship), Canada (a special case of the inverted-L-shape relationship), and Denmark (M-shape relationship). Our findings are complemented by the calculation of the elasticity of the carbon dioxide emission per capita as a percentage of each level of real gross domestic product per capita.

The key feature of the proposed approach is the introduction of inputs/outputs factor efficiencies, specified as distance functions, to the decomposition model. By using the proposed approach, the components driving the change of CO2 emissions are decomposed into the contributors from nine factors specified in this paper, and several production technology related components are included. This paper applies the model to data from developing countries. For the 20 developing counties as a whole, empirical results indicate the economic (GDP) growth is the most important contributor to CO2 emission increase, while good output technical change is the most important component to CO2 emission reduction between 1995 and 2005.

(2) Does it depend upon whether others expect you to reward them vs. punish them? (3) what is the interpretation of Such a causal effect? We investigate these questions using a modification of the lost wallet trust game (a simplified version of the trust game) that permits punishment Like previous studies, we collect data on what second-movers think that first-movers expect them to do by directly eliciting the second-movers' expectations. Unlike previous studies, we ensure exogeneity of these expectations by instrumenting for them. The instrument is the expectations of neutral observers which are disclosed to second-movers prior to the elicitation of second-movers' expectations. We find that what you think others expect you to do has a zero causal effect on both reward and punishment decisions. We also find that it is important to instrument for second-order expectations because they are endogenous. We interpret these findings in terms of models of guilt-aversion and intentional reciprocity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We claim that a similar performance can be achieved without resorting to market incompleteness. We show that a model with completemarkets driven by productivity shocks alone can account for the international comovement puzzle. Our model features time nonseparable preferences that allow arbitrarily small wealth effects on labor supply. It matches the data by predicting (i) positive cross-country correlations of investment and hours worked; (ii) realistic cross-country correlations of consumption. It reduces the gap between international correlations of output and consumption, but fails to change their order.

We focus here on negative externalities from inequality that make financial well-being decline more rapidly than real income measures indicate. Housing, with its relatively inelastic supply, relationship to local public goods, role in establishing status and dependence on mortgage finance is used to illustrate the negative trickle-down effect. Increasing concentration of economic power results in political power that alters the regulatory structure. Along with contributing to financial instability and sluggish recovery this is an additional negative externality.","[Holt, Richard P.

However, it is not uncommon for water prices faced by consumers to be unclear. In Windhoek, Namibia, the marginal and average water price is difficult to calculate from the information provided in users' utility bills. This paper applies a hedonic pricing approach to investigate price perceptions of water users in a setting with cryptic price information. Using self-reported water charges as the dependent variable, the pricing model utilises reported utility characteristics and other factors that may affect perceived price. Low-income standpipe water users report a weighted average monthly charges of N$24.68, whereas users in high income segments report N$521.34. This reflects differences in service levels, possible subsidies to low-income users and potential errors in respondents' understanding of their water price. Average price per litre (N$11.78 for the low-use segment; N$1.89 for the highest segment of Tier 1 water use) tends to be perceived as higher by those with lower water use even though average prices in the relevant range should generally be identical.","[Karuaihe, Selma] Dept Econ Dev, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa; [Wandschneider, Philip; Yoder, Jonathan] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Karuaihe, S (通讯作者)，Dept Econ Dev, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa.",karuaiheselma@yahoo.com,"Karuaihe, Selma Tuemumunu/AAN-8376-2020; Yoder, Jonathan K/F-4840-2011","Karuaihe, Selma Tuemumunu/0000-0003-1453-7979; Yoder, Jonathan/0000-0002-9049-9591",,,,,30,2,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

This path creates a puzzle since the existing explanations for the post-1975 boom in the higher education of women are not fully consistent with this evidence.

In this paper, we examine the impact of this tragic event on a particular measure of immigrants' social outcomes-marriage with a native or intermarriage. We find that the tragic event actually Hispanic immigrants' probability of being married to a native. We suggest that our results could be explained by that after 9/11, the deteriorated labor market conditions, along with tightened immigration policies, may have led to increased incentives of immigrants to marry natives. This effect is large relative to the potential discrimination effect, if any, that could reduce natives' willingness to marry an immigrant. We also find that the magnitude of the effect is much smaller in the years immediately following 9/11 and becomes larger over time; and that there exists a large, statistically significant gender difference in the effects of 9/11 on intermarriage outcomes. Finally, we conduct indirect tests of proposed explanations; and our results imply existence of economic gains from intermarriage, and that discrimination may indeed exist.","[Wang, Le] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Wang, Chunbei] Univ Massachusetts, Dartmouth, MA USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Massachusetts System; University Massachusetts Dartmouth,"Wang, L (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",le.wang@unh.edu,,,,,,,38,10,11,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We find that job finding through both personal contacts and public employment networks increases the probability of finding employment, but the former, especially job finding through contacts with South Koreans, is the most effective route to finding employment. In addition, jobs with higher wages are acquired in employment attained from South Korean referrals, followed by South Korean government agencies and those from North Korean refugee contacts.

It also presents a forecast of the optimal debt during the period 2009-2014. The optimal debt policy was derived using an open economy model for Egypt. The uncertainties in the model stem from the uncertainties in the interest or debt service payments and the uncertainties in the rate of return on investments. The stochastic control approach was used to find the optimal debt policy. It was found that Egypt could borrow externally as long as the trend in the rate of return on investments exceeds the trend in the real interest rate or the trend in the rate of the debt service payments. The analysis finds that Egypt's foreign debt was higher than the optimal level before 1997. After 1997, foreign debt seems to converge to the optimal level. However, Egypt's foreign debt is still below its optimal level which results in an opportunity cost for the economy to grow, otherwise, GDP could have recorded a favorable increase.

If such governments could be relied upon to enact such reforms, they would likely not be necessary. Since existing governments are resistant to change, we argue that the only way to overcome the deep problem of reform is by focusing on the bare-metal layer of society the technological environment in which governments are embedded. Developing the technology to create settlements in international waters, which we refer to as seasteading, changes the technological environment rather than attempting to push against the incentives of existing political systems. As such, it sidesteps the problem of reform and is more likely than more conventional approaches to significantly alter the policy equilibrium.","[Friedman, Patri; Taylor, Brad] Seasteading Inst, Sunnyvale, CA 94607 USA; [Taylor, Brad] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Friedman, P (通讯作者)，Seasteading Inst, Sunnyvale, CA 94607 USA.",patri@seasteading.org; brad.taylor@anu.edu.au,,"Taylor, Brad/0000-0003-4375-6206",,,,,116,12,13,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2012,65.0,2,,,,,218,235,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2012.00535.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,926VU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302860800005,0

We analyse a large panel of 52 currencies in advanced and emerging countries over almost 25 years of data. We find that only a few factors are robustly associated to a safe haven status, most notably the net foreign asset position, an indicator of external vulnerability, and whether currencies have been a good hedge in the past. In addition, the currencies of large, less financially open economies are a good hedge against global risk aversion shocks. By contrast, the level of the interest rate spread vs. the US is significant only during the latest crisis. Finally, we find some evidence of non-linearity as the importance of the fundamentals is stronger during crisis times. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the recent oil shock and its consequences relaunch the debate on understanding the behavior underlying the expected oil prices. Combining the dynamic properties of multilayer back propagation neural network and the recent Harr A trous wavelet decomposition, a Hybrid model HTW-MPNN is implemented to achieve prominent prediction of crude oil price. While recent studies focus on the determination of the best forecasting model by comparing various neural architectures or applying several decomposition techniques to the ANN, the new insight of this paper is to target the issue of the transfer function selection providing robust simulations on both in sample and out of sample basis. Based on the work of Yonaba, H., Anctil, F., and Fortin, V. (2010) Comparing Sigmoid Transfer Functions for Neural Network Multistep Ahead Stream flow forecasting. journal of Hydrologic Engineering, April, 275-283, we use three variants of activation function namely sigmoid, bipolar sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent in order to test the model's flexibility. Furthermore, the forecasting robustness is checked through several levels of input-hidden nodes. Comparatively, results of HTW-MBPNN perform better than the conventional BPNN. Our conclusions add a major attribute to the previous studies corroborating the Occam razor's principle, especially when simulations are constructed through training and testing phases simultaneously. Finally, more eligible forecasting power is found according to the wavelet oil price signal which appears to be the closest to the real anticipations of future oil price fluctuations.

It points out that a political hierarchy, financed by a tax-farming system in China, fails to contain the exploitative behavior of local officials. Such a system results in expenditure devolution and revenue centralization, and peasants at the bottom of the hierarchy bear the brunt of tax burden. As the financial pressure of excessive levies and fees reaches a perilous point, peasants resort to violent protests. Unless a fiscally decentralized system with horizontal accountability mechanisms evolves, the country's ability to sustain a centralized polity may become in creasingly undermined.

In particular, it considers a multi-sectoral growth model in discrete time with infinite horizon, endogenous growth, embodied technological progress, horizontal differentiation and lab-equipment specification of R&D, and with human capital accumulation (represented by the fact that households devote a fraction of their time to schooling), in order to take into account the crucial role of the latter when new technologies are present. In this model it is possible to obtain some important results, both analytically and through simulations, either in the case of constant productivity of schooling and in the case in which this productivity is a function of technological progress. The first conclusion is that the productivity of schooling affects the long run growth of the economy, contrary to the productivities of the other sectors, hence in this model human capital accumulation is the true engine of growth. It is then possible to study the reaction of the economy to different types of shocks, and to compare the results with the empirical evidence. The conclusion is that the model is able to reproduce such evidence, suggesting that the interaction between ICT and human capital is one of the drivers of the recent economic performance.

This paper uses data compiled by the Penn World Tables on government sector size and employs the Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOFSwiss Economic Institute) index of globalization. The results show that globalization increased government sectors around the world. Social globalization especially had a positive influence. Globalization-induced effects were stronger in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Overall globalization and economic globalization reduced the relative price of government expenditures.

The distribution over states of the world (a state corresponds to a payoff matrix) is commonly known, but players do not observe nature's choice. Over time, they can learn the state in two ways. After each round, each player observes his own realized payoff (which may be stochastic, conditional on the state) and he observes a noisy public signal of the state (whose informativeness may vary with the actions chosen). Actions are perfectly observable. The result is that for any function that maps each state to a payoff vector that is feasible and individually rational in that state, there is a sequential equilibrium in which patient players learn the realized state with arbitrary precision and achieve a payoff close to the one specified for that state. That result extends to the case where there is no public signal, but instead players receive very closely correlated private signals of the vector of realized payoffs.","Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Wiseman, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",wiseman@austin.utexas.edu,,,,,,,37,8,10,0,11,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The equilibrium policy in the legislative bargaining stage maximizes the aggregate policy utility of the coalition members and the lobbies, but lobbying can also lead to the preservation of the status quo and lobby-induced gridlock. When the status quo does not persist, the policy outcome is largely determined by the selection of a coalition, since legislative bargaining under unanimity within the coalition leads to a coalition-efficient policy regardless of the identity of the proposer.

They are higher if social norms recognise the importance of compliance. But how do social norms frame decisions to pay tax? Can prospect theory be applied to shed insight into the way that social norms exert their influence? An analysis of questionnaire responses (from Italy and from the UK) suggests that they exert their influence by changing the reference points that individuals use when they code changes as 'gains', or 'losses'. The evidence suggests that social norms frame the decision to pay tax by changing individuals' perceptions of their entitlement to income. This consideration is important when designing policy to deter evasion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The main feature of our model is that it throws light on the relationships between long waves and business cycles in the economy. The driving forces in the model work in this way: endogenous R&D investment creates new cumulative knowledge. When this knowledge reaches a threshold H*, radical innovations occur which generate productivity growth via the substitution of old capital with new capital. These disruptive events appear recurrently, generating long waves and revitalizing the growth process. Short-term cycles in the model come from the interactions between these innovation-driven transformations and certain prey-predator mechanisms that involve the labor market. We find that our model presents excellent properties: the model generates endogenous cyclical growth as a disequilibrium process; persistent and irregular short cycles appear interwoven with the long waves; and there is a strong significant interaction between both kinds of fluctuations.","[Fatas-Villafranca, Francisco; Jarne, Gloria; Sanchez-Choliz, Julio] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Fatás-Villafranca, F (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain.",ffatas@unizar.es,,"Fatas Villafranca, Francisco/0000-0002-1246-6751",,,,,18,13,14,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

These reforms include reductions in the generosity of public pensions and reduced penalties for working past the normal retirement age. In this paper, we consider how reforms to public pension systems affect labor supply over the life cycle. We put the recent empirical evidence on the effect of government pensions on labor supply in a life cycle context, and we present evidence on the effectiveness of tax reforms for stimulating labor supply over the life cycle. Our main conclusion is that the labor supply of older workers is responsive to changes in retirement incentives. The labor supply of younger workers is less responsive.

In SP auctions we find a substantial amount of coincidence with theory. We observe systematic deviations from risk neutral bidding in FP auctions and show theoretically that these deviations are consistent with risk averse preferences. We find essentially no heterogeneity in bidding in SP auctions where risk preferences and the number of bidders do not affect the optimal bid, while in the FP auctions heterogeneity in bidding persists with experience. We find that heterogeneity in bidding in FP auctions is consistent with heterogeneity in risk preferences, the attempt to count the number of bidders in the auction, and bidder specific noise.

Limiting factors are (i) increasing atmospheric carbon concentration due to fossil fuel-related carbon emissions, and (ii) the inertia of the global carbon cycle itself. Accordingly, we explicitly include the largest non-atmospheric carbon reservoir, the ocean, to achieve a better representation of the global carbon cycle than the proportional-decay assumption usually resorted to in economic models. We also investigate the option to directly inject CO2 into the deep ocean (a form of carbon sequestration), deriving from this a critical level for ocean sequestration costs. Above this level, ocean sequestration is merely a temporary option; below it, ocean sequestration is the long-term option permitting extended use of fossil fuels. The latter alternative involves higher atmospheric stabilization levels. In this connection it should be noted that the efficiency of ocean sequestration depends on the time-preference and the inertia of the carbon cycle.","[Rickels, Wilfried] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Lontzek, Thomas S.] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Zurich,"Rickels, W (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",wilfried.rickels@ifw-kiel.de,"; Rickels, Wilfried/H-1706-2013","Lontzek, Thomas/0000-0002-4789-5820; Rickels, Wilfried/0000-0002-5407-6364",,,,,27,4,4,2,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The main finding is that windfalls from international commodity price booms lead to a significant increase in net foreign assets, but only in countries that are ethnically homogeneous. In highly ethnically polarized countries, net foreign assets significantly decreased. To explain this asymmetry, the paper shows that in ethnically polarized countries commodity windfalls lead to large increases in government consumption expenditures and political corruption.

Thus modeling volatility of NPV is the foundation for CVA valuation. This paper assumes that default times of counterparty and reference firm follow a special contagion model with stochastic pre-intensities that allows for explicit formulas for default probabilities. Stochastic interest rate is also incorporated to account for positive correlation between pre-intensity and interest. Survival measure approach is employed to calculate NPV of a risk-free CDS, and semi-analytical solution for CVA is obtained through affine specifications. Numerical analysis shows that contagion has more significant impact on CVA than diffusion of pre-intensities, and the positive correlation between interest and reference firm's pre-intensity has monotonic decreasing impact on CVA.

It starts from the observed distribution of income before and after redistribution and corresponding marginal tax rates. Under a set of simplifying assumptions, it is then possible to recover the social welfare function that would make the observed marginal tax rate schedule optimal. In this framework, the issue of the optimality of an existing tax-benefit system is transformed into the issue of the shape of the social welfare function associated with that system and whether it satisfies elementary properties. This method is applied to the French redistribution system with the interesting implication that the French redistribution authority may appear, under some plausible scenario concerning the size of the labor supply behavioral reactions, non Paretian (e.g. giving negative marginal social weights to the richest class of tax payers).","[Spadaro, Amedeo] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Bourguignon, Francois; Spadaro, Amedeo] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Paris School of Economics,"Spadaro, A (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ, Ctra Valldemossa Km 7,5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",amedeo.spadaro@uib.es,"Spadaro, Amedeo/AAA-1975-2019",,,,,,39,41,46,1,10,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Individuals are heterogeneous with respect to their managerial ability, and firms run by more able managers have a higher productivity level and make higher profits. There is rent sharing at the firm level due to fair wage preferences of workers, and hence firms with higher profits pay higher wages in equilibrium in order to elicit their workers' full effort. We show that in this framework international trade leads to a self-selection of the best firms into export status, with exporting firms having to pay a wage premium. Aggregate welfare increases, but there is also larger inequality along multiple dimensions: Involuntary unemployment and income inequality between managers and workers increase, and so does inequality within these two subgroups of individuals, as measured by the respective Gini coefficients.

Hence, due to the pivotal role of human resources in construction projects cost, a major part of Iranian construction companies seek their profitability and survival in maximizing the productivity of their operatives. Because of the widespread belief among contractors about the low productivity of daily workers and operatives with basic salary, they commit a major part of their projects activities to sub-contractors. Deployment of sub-contractors by construction firms has become largely conventional in country's construction projects. The aims of this paper is defined as determining the factors and grounds affecting sub-contractors productivity and evaluate their overall negative side effects on project productivity via a structured questionnaire. A total of 31 factors selected and were divided into 7 broad categories. The perceptions of companies managers were asked about the level of effect brought about by the mentioned factors and groups upon productivity on a time based criterion. The analysis indicated that the most important grounds affecting sub-contractors productivity in descending order include: Materials/Tools, Construction technology and method, Planning, Supervision system, Reworks, Weather, and Jobsite condition. Project managers should focus on the identified major grounds and relevant factors in order to improve productivity as long as they commit construction activities to sub-contractors.","[Hosseini, Mohammad Reza] Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Ghoddousi, Parviz] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran",University of South Australia; Iran University Science & Technology,"Hosseini, MR (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",ghoddousi@iust.ac.ir; hosmy008@mymail.unisa.edu.au,"Hosseini, M Reza/AAA-4859-2021; Ghoddousi, Parvaiz/T-2213-2018","Hosseini, M Reza/0000-0001-8675-736X;",,,,,32,113,119,0,34,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Under special conditions, increasing shareholder power may have positive effects on capital accumulation and productivity growth and hence on potential growth of the economy. However, such a regime not only requires directly positive-or under certain conditions only weakly negative-effects of increasing shareholder power on the productivity regime but it also requires expansive-or under special circumstances only weakly contractive-effects of increasing shareholder power on capital accumulation via the demand regime of the economy. Both conditions have recently been questioned on empirical grounds, so that an overall long-run contractive regime seems to be the most likely outcome of financialization, rising shareholder power, and pronounced shareholder value orientation.","Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Hein, E (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany.",,"Hein, Eckhard/HQY-4102-2023","Hein, Eckhard/0000-0002-6542-6630",,,,,57,28,28,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

In this paper, we investigate sources of this fast accumulation and make projections for the future. We estimate a convergence equation for physical capital per capita, which is derived from an open economy growth model, using a pooled cross-country, across-decade sample of the entire world. We also conduct projections for the next two decades. We find that an economy with a low level of capital stock per capita tends to experience faster accumulation subsequently. Asian economies have certainly benefited from this convergence effect. But on the other hand, other factors such as a low rule of law score and high investment goods prices have worked against them. Our projection shows that, if those economies wish to maintain their current pace of fast capital accumulation, the keys would be to reduce distortions in the domestic market and to improve the quality of institutions.

Global biodiversity regulation involves choosing the optimal stopping rule regarding global land conversions, in order to ensure that some areas of unconverted natural reserves remain to support the production sector that exists on converted lands. The basic difficulty with implementing a solution to this global problem lies in the asymmetry in endowments between those states that have previously converted, and those that have not. We demonstrate that the fundamental problem of global biodiversity regulation is similar to the bargaining problem analysed by Nash, Rubinstein, and others. There are benefits from global land conversion, and there must be agreement on their distribution before the conversion process can be halted. Since the institutions addressing global biodiversity problems are either highly ineffectual (benefit-sharing agreements, prior informed-consent clauses) or very extreme (incremental cost contracts), the biodiversity bargaining problem remains unresolved. For this reason we anticipate that suboptimal conversions will continue to occur, as a way of protesting the ineffective and unfair approaches employed in addressing this problem to date.","[Swanson, Tim] Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Groom, Ben] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Swanson, T (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.",tim.swanson@graduateinstitute.ch; bg3@soas.ac.uk,"Groom, Ben/AAP-9305-2021","Groom, Ben/0000-0003-0729-143X",,,,,35,8,10,2,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

But it has one drawback: when applied in the context of renewable resources, and with a constant discount factor, there exists no exploitation path that maximizes this criterion. The present article suggests a way to cope with this problem. The idea is to restrict attention to the set of convex combinations between the optimal discounted utilitarian program and the stationary program leading to the green golden rule. It is shown that an optimal path in this set exists under rather weak sufficient conditions on the fundamentals of the problem. Some ethical properties of this approach are also discussed. In some cases, it turns out that the restricted solution implies no loss of efficiency and benefits intermediate and infinitely distant generations.","[Figuieres, Charles; Tidball, Mabel] INRA, UMR LAMETA, F-34060 Montpellier, France",INRAE; Universite de Montpellier,"Figuières, C (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR LAMETA, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",figuiere@supagro.inra.fr,"Tidball, Mabel/GYD-3456-2022","Tidball, Mabel/0000-0002-5576-0977",,,,,20,12,12,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Portfolios in different size financial markets are formed from different numbers of stocks in order to get the same non-systemic risk elimination effect. In most cases scientists agree about naive portfolio diversification effect. Scientific debates on the measurement of diversification effect of differently-weighted stocks portfolios are still in progress. Therefore, authors of the article solve the scientific problem assessing the possibilities for diversification when portfolios are made of different weight stocks and compare the diversification effect of naive and differently-weighted stocks portfolios. The research is done in Lithuanian Stock Exchange Market and based on daily stock market prices during 2009-2010. The research methodology is original because the selection of shares to portfolios is carried out under the following criteria in order of priority: 1) the largest negative correlation coefficient values, 2) the quantitative characteristics of the negative correlations with the other stocks in pairs, and 3) stocks of companies from different industry sectors. The diversification effect is evaluated by three indicators: percentage of diversifiable risk elimination, depending on the number of stocks in portfolio, regressions of standard deviations of portfolios against number and concentration of stocks. The results showed that in all cases greater diversification effect is obtained in naive portfolios.","[Alekneviciene, Vilija; Rinkeviciene, Rasa] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, LT-53361 Kauno R, Lithuania; [Alekneviciute, Egle] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Alekneviciene, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Univ St 10, LT-53361 Kauno R, Lithuania.",vilija.alekneviciene@lzuu.lt; egle.alekneviciute@gmail.com; r.rinkeviciene@e-energija.lt,,"Alekneviciene, Vilija/0000-0002-6501-8792",,,,,27,6,6,1,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

What is the outlook for Swiss exports given the still elevated CHF? In this article, we shed light on these questions by analysing a panel of Swiss exports disaggregated along both the regional and the industry dimension. To explain the export performance of the recent past, we estimate how the exchange rate and demand growth in each export market affect trade flows and also, how this varies across different industries. The appreciation of the CHF has considerably dampened Swiss export performance. As a counterfactual, we ask how Swiss exports would have developed had the CHF stayed flat against other currencies during the 5 years leading up to October 2010. Compared to this scenario, the Swiss export industry has already lost a cumulative of CHF 35 billion in revenues due to the CHF appreciation. At the current juncture, monthly exports are reduced by CHF 2.7 billion (around 17%). We show that the key reason for the strong export performance despite the CHF strength was the rebound in global demand in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Moreover, we also document that the timing of global demand growth has completely masked the effect of the CHF strength: during the last quarters, periods of pronounced CHF appreciation always coincided with strong recovery of global demand. Failure to account for this coincidence could lead to the wrong assumption that the exchange rate matters very little for Swiss export performance. Last, to gauge the likely evolution of Swiss exports and their regional composition in the years to come, we combine our estimation results with the regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and exchange rate forecasts provided by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Following this approach, we predict that over the next 3 years, Swiss exports will rise a combined 16%, with little less than half of this increase going to Emerging Asia and 30% to the euro zone. We also document the key industries that will drive Swiss export growth in the near future.","[Auer, Raphael] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Auer, Raphael; Saure, Philip] Swiss Natl Bank, Zurich, Switzerland",Princeton University; Swiss National Bank (SNB),"Auer, R (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, 436 Robertson Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",raphael.auer@snb.ch,,"Saure, Philip/0000-0002-9923-2965",,,,,7,8,8,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The agent's information about which project delivers a good outcome depends on both his ability and his effort. This paper examines how the agent's incentives for effort change depending on whether or not the agent's project choice is observed. If this choice is publicly observed, the agent's project choice is distorted towards particular types of projects. When the outcomes of these advantaged projects are particularly sensitive to the agent's information, such transparency boosts the agent's information-gathering incentives. However, when public observation of project choice leads the agent to choose information-insensitive projects, then such transparency dampens incentives. This provides a more nuanced view of the implications of action transparency in the literature on career concerns for experts.","NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Bar-Isaac, H (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",heski@nyu.edu,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Marginal hiring costs increase with the number of hires and reach up to 24 weeks of wage payments. We find no evidence for a fixed cost component. Hiring costs also increase with the hiring rate (the ratio of hires and skilled workers), confirming convexity.

We find evidence of changes in preferences. More precisely there are differences in preferences for the price attribute for the two identical sequences. Moreover, we find a reduction in the error variance for the last eight choice sets relative to the first eight choice sets. This is mainly caused by very high error variances in the first two choice sets.

So far, income and unemployment have been the main dimensions considered in social comparison.

Thus, we study the effects of the health of others and relative health hypotheses on two measures of subjective well-being: happiness and subjective health. Using data from the Italian Health Conditions survey, we show that a high incidence of chronic conditions and disability among reference groups negatively affects both happiness and subjective health. Such effects are stronger among people in the same condition. These results, robust to different econometric specifications and estimation techniques, suggest the presence of some sympathy in individual preferences with respect to health and reveal that other people's health status serves as a benchmark to assess one's own health condition.","[Carrieri, Vincenzo] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Carrieri, Vincenzo] Univ Salerno, CELPE, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Salerno,"Carrieri, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",vcarrieri@unisa.it,"Carrieri, Vincenzo/AAS-9319-2021","Carrieri, Vincenzo/0000-0001-8742-3820",,,,,47,23,25,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Results show that ICT investments positively and significantly affected firms' TE. Moreover, group, size and geographical position have a positive influence on TE.

We model the interaction between the regulator and the firm as an infinitely repeated game; we observe that there exist self-enforcing contracts in which the regulator, using her discretionary power on the price (the contractible variable) can induce the firm to produce the required quality level by leaving it a positive rent. When players use grim trigger strategies, the optimal self-enforcing contract implies a distortion from the second best which is greater the more impatient is the firm and the larger is the effect of the price on the deviation profits. Whenever the equilibrium profits of the static game are strictly positive, even if the firm were infinitely patient, the optimal contract would not reach the second-best: it would ensure a quality-adjusted Ramsey condition and, at the same time, leave positive profits to the firm. We extend the model in a few ways: we find that when players use stick-and-carrot strategies, with an infinitely patient firm the second-best outcome is reached even if this implies to punish the deviating firm with negative profits. When instead the regulator is unable to perfectly monitor the firm's quality choice, the price/quality pair giving the highest payoff to the regulator does not directly depend on the firm's discount factor, which instead affects the probability of punishment. Our results suggest that, in fixed price regulatory contracts, the regulatory lag should be shorter the more relevant is the issue of unverifiability, in order to reduce the reward for opportunistic behavior by the firm.","[Cesi, Berardino; Iozzi, Alberto] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy; [Valentini, Edilio] Univ G dAnnunzio, Chieti, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Cesi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy.",berardino.cesi@uniroma2.it; Alberto.Iozzi@UniRoma2.It; valentin@unich.it,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Since all borrowers were simultaneously exposed to the same policy, the paper develops a creative identification strategy that relies on the exogenous variation of the opening and closing dates of loan cycles across lending groups. A credit expansion effect is identified for some borrowers in FINCA who looked more creditworthy after their positive records were exposed, suggesting that other lenders targeted FINCA clients with good credit records.

This paper presents a frictionless assignment model in which these two features can be explained simultaneously as the result of the decline in the relative price of capital. Additional implications of the model regarding the skill premium and the dispersion in labor productivity across plants are also consistent with the empirical evidence. The model permits to consider changes in the skill distribution too. Combining these changes with falling capital prices provides a more comprehensive view of the overall trend of wage inequality and of workers' segregation by skill in the data, and it helps explaining some episodes of decreasing wage inequality.

These similarly high poverty rates between the two minorities are, however, the result of different combinations of factors related to the specific characteristics of these two groups. In this article, we analyse the role of demographic and labour-related variables in the current differential of poverty rates among racial and ethnic groups in the United States and its recent evolution. Our results show, first, that these differentials are largely explained by differing family characteristics of the ethnic groups. Furthermore, we show that while labour market activity of family members and a preponderance of single mothers play a more significant role in the higher poverty rates of Blacks, a larger number of dependent children is closely associated with higher poverty among Latinos, who also suffer from a larger educational attainment gap and higher immigration rates.","Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ, Vigo 36310, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Gradín, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Spain.",cgradin@uvigo.es,"GRADIN, CARLOS/AAH-9326-2019","GRADIN, CARLOS/0000-0001-7744-0707",,,,,21,33,63,1,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Evidence suggests that credit constraints have recently become important for schooling and other aspects of households' behavior. We highlight the importance of early childhood investments, as their response largely determines the impact of credit constraints on the overall lifetime acquisition of human capital. We also review the intergenerational literature and examine the macroeconomic impacts of credit constraints on social mobility and the income distribution. A common limitation across all areas of the human capital literature is the imposition of ad hoc constraints on credit. We propose a more careful treatment of the structure of government student loan programs and the incentive problems underlying private credit. We show that endogenizing constraints on credit for human capital helps explain observed borrowing, schooling, and default patterns and offers new insights about the design of government policy.","[Lochner, Lance] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Lochner, Lance] Univ Western Ontario, CIBC Ctr Human Capital & Prod, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Monge-Naranjo, Alexander] Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Lochner, L (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",llochner@uwo.ca; alexmonge@gmail.com,"Monge-Naranjo, Alexander/H-9949-2016","Monge-Naranjo, Alexander/0000-0002-6068-7620; Lochner, Lance/0009-0006-6980-8894",,,,,100,97,126,3,46,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4604-1,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Yet few African countries have been successful in this transformation. This raises many questions: Within agriculture, services or industry, how does the process of moving into higher quality goods and services happen? Within firms, why are some able to move into export markets and start producing new goods, while others languish? How do economies move up the value chain? What determines a country's ability to create jobs? What is the appropriate role for governments and markets in the growth dynamics? This paper summarises the intellectual progress achieved through several major waves of growth research and highlights the remaining challenges of understanding structural change. It then provides some empirical evidence of the limited structural transformation that has taken place in Africa since independence, and suggests a blueprint to help policymakers in Africa and elsewhere address them.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Monga, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cmonga@worldbank.org,,,,,,,62,6,8,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Focusing on the behaviour of bank loans, we extract the dynamic response of a bank to innovations in its capital and in its regulatory capital buffer. We find that innovations in a bank's capital in this (precrisis) sample period were coupled with a loan response that lasted up to 3 years. The international presence of UK banks allows us to identify a specific driver of capital shocks in our data, independent of bank lending to UK residents. Specifically, we use write-offs on loans to nonresidents to instrument bank capital's impact on UK resident lending. A fall in capital brought about a significant drop in lending in particular, to Private Nonfinancial Corporations (PNFC). In contrast, household lending increased when capital fell, which may indicate that, in this precrisis period, banks substituted into less risky assets when capital was short.","[Mora, Nada] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA; [Logan, Andrew] Oxford Econ Ltd, Oxford OX1 1HB, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City,"Mora, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, 1 Mem Dr, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA.",nada.mora@kc.frb.org,,,,,,,36,28,32,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The payments, and their distribution, are more important in the areas most affected by disastrous weather events, usually coinciding with areas of pronounced impact of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this article, the impact of weather and climate, as well as some economic variables, on disaster payments is analysed using county level data from four states in the southeastern United States. The results suggest that weather and climate variables explain most of the crop disaster payments at the county level while socioeconomic variables do not, suggesting that advancements in weather and climate forecasts could be helpful in planning for disaster compensation.","[Hartarska, Valentina] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Nadolnyak, Denis] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Hartarska, V (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",hartarska@auburn.edu,,,,,,,28,7,7,3,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Given this heterogeneity, the object of this article is to analyse the quality of employment being created in different sub-sectors of services, relative to the industrial sector, where quality is defined to include wages, job security and social protection. Analysing household survey data from India in 1993-94 and 2004-05, we find the following. First, sub-sectors of services are generally either 'good' or 'bad' employers - higher wages do not compensate for less job security or less job protection. Second, the classification of most service sub-sectors as 'good' or 'bad' employers in 2004-05 is the same as that in 1993-94. Third, employment expansion during the 10-year period under consideration is more in service sub-sectors where quality of employment is low.","Ctr William Rappard, Econ Res Div, World Trade Org, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland",World Trade Organization,"Nayyar, G (通讯作者)，Ctr William Rappard, Econ Res Div, World Trade Org, Rue Lausanne 154, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland.",gauravnayyar81@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,5,5,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

There existed before it a certain stages-of-capitalism (SoC) approach with a long history. The SoC approach developed largely under the influence of social and anthropological stage theories of progress and of Marxism. Accordingly, capitalism as a mode of production was perceived as progressing through commercial, industrial, and financial stage. In this paper, this link will be recovered for the benefit of further scholarship. We emphasize that the VoC approach, by the weight it puts on efficiency tends to rank circumstantially the variety at issue, thereby implying occasionally a desirable move towards the more efficient form. This means that the elements forming a given variety may actually be matched with the successive stages of a certain progress.","[Ozveren, Eyup] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Karaoguz, Emrah] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,"Özveren, E (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",ozveren@metu.edu.tr; uhavuc@metu.edu.tr; emrah.karaoguz@izmirekonomi.edu.tr,"Karaoğuz, Hüseyin Emrah/S-7126-2019","Karaoğuz, Hüseyin Emrah/0000-0003-4525-2626",,,,,68,3,3,1,23,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,1,,,,,13,36,,10.2298/PAN12010130,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,916OR,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302113600002,0

Estimates drawn in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis report a potential multiplier value of around 1.2.

A higher growth of labour productivity and total factor productivity is found for new exporting firms. To uncover the channels through which the learning effects are driven, the same methodology is applied to some sub-samples. Learning effects are higher for new exporters that are also importers or start importing at the same time. Other factors affecting learning ability are found in firms exporting to more developed markets, in those that achieve a certain threshold of export intensity and mainly for those firms that belong to sectors where Portugal has a comparative disadvantage.","[Afonso, Oscar; Africano, Ana Paula] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Oporto, Portugal; [Silva, Armando] ESEIG, Inst Politecn Porto, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto,"Afonso, O (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Oporto, Portugal.",oafonso@fep.up.pt,"Africano, Ana Paula/AAC-4895-2020; Silva, Armando/A-8786-2017; Afonso, Oscar/B-6016-2009","Silva, Armando/0000-0002-4791-0680; Afonso, Oscar/0000-0002-9597-9850; Africano Sousa e Silva, Ana Paula/0000-0001-9501-6459",,,,,32,15,16,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In general, they evaluate reforms within a particular state, focus on a small number of outcome variables (usually caseload levels) and/or use a very narrowly defined time period. This narrow and partial analysis is perplexing, from an institutional perspective, as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) forces states into a zero-sum funding game, where shares depend on differential relative success in achieving policy objectives metrics. This institutional structure incentivizes states to mimic and improve upon more successful counterparts to recapture a larger share of TANF block grants. Given this dynamic institutional structure, an evolutionary evaluation of state TANF programmes is warranted. This article uses cluster analysis to explore evolutionary changes in state TANF policies (as characterized by a comprehensive set of outcome variables) immediately following the imposition of TANF (1997-2005). We identify or benchmark clusters of 'successful' and 'less successful' TANF programmes. The results allow us to track which states in which year fall into the 'successful' and 'less successful' clusters over the 9-year period. The results support the notion that initially unsuccessful states mimic other successful state programmes over time.","[Snarr, Hal W.] N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA; [Friesner, Dan] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Pharm Practice, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Underwood, Daniel A.] Peninsula Coll, Social Sci Div, Port Angeles, WA USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University; North Dakota State University Fargo,"Snarr, HW (通讯作者)，N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA.",hwsnarr@ncat.edu,"Friesner, Daniel/AAK-2377-2020",,,,,,17,6,6,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Recognizing the role of the garment industry in Vietnam's economy, the paper addresses the relationship among technical efficiency and firm structure, business activity, export destination and location based on 2007 firm-level data. We find that high inefficiency exists in the Vietnam's garment industry and there is much room for improvement. Product specialization and export markets would contribute to efficiency enhancement in the short run. Also, garment firms located in Ho ChiMinh City, where competition is fiercer than other production areas, tend to achieve higher efficiency performance. To a lesser extent, private ownership and smaller firm size (small and medium-sized enterprise - SME) appear to be associated with higher efficiency. These findings would give rise to promotion of business competition, market-supporting institutions and nonstate ownership for the benefit of the garment industry as a whole.","[Vixathep, Souksavanh; Matsunaga, Nobuaki] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Int Cooperat Studies, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Kobe University,"Vixathep, S (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Int Cooperat Studies, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",svixathep@yahoo.com,,,,,,,41,8,8,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Most WBs have quite high but unused potential for agriculture. The small-scale and fragmented nature of private farming remains a general characteristic of agriculture in all WBs. After a decline in the volume of agricultural production due to transition and armed conflicts an increase seems to have set in for WBs since 2000. However, yields still lag behind the EU average in all WBs, particularly in the livestock sector. In general, agricultural producer prices are rather high, mostly above the EU average, indicating weak price competitiveness for most WB products. Serbia is the only net exporter of agricultural and food products. Budgetary transfers to agriculture have been at a low level, except in Croatia, but mostly are increasing rapidly. The WBs lack a stable agricultural policy and a true strategy of reforms and adjustment to EU requirements.","[Erjavec, Emil] Univ Ljubljana, Domzale, Slovenia; [Volk, Tina; Rednak, Miroslav] Agr Inst Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; Agricultural Institute Slovenia,"Erjavec, E (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Domzale, Slovenia.",emil.erjavec@bf.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,12,9,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24.0,1,,,,,111,123,,10.1080/14631377.2012.647631,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,918PH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302262100006,0

This essay describes the statist-and-corporatist political economy of the country as it soared from near the bottom of the Western European income hierarchy at the end of the World War II to up near the top by the 1980s. It illustrates how a group of neoliberal politicians and allied civil servants drove through selective deregulation and privatisation in the 1990s and 2000s. In the space created for newly privatised banks, Icelandic financiers grew the banks and linked private equity firms through mergers and acquisitions abroad to the point where by 2007 tiny Iceland supported three banks in the world's biggest 300 banks, with assets eight times the GDP-second highest in the world after Switzerland. As profits from these overseas operations were partly redistributed back to Iceland the economy boomed, in the grip of super-Minsky processes. The government, the banks and the media interpreted the boom as testimony to the validity of neoliberal policies and went out of their way to hide increasing financial fragility from view, preventing a negative or self-correcting policy feedback loop. The accident waiting to happen happened in the wake of the Lehman collapse in September 2008. The essay charts the zigzags of the government's response and the citizens' response, and discusses the prospects for a resumption of growth on a more sustainable basis. It suggests that Iceland illustrates in miniature the ratcheting down of mass living standards underway across the Western world now that the cushion of debt has been removed, even as financiers and others in the top few percentiles of national income distributions increase their share of national income. But economic institutions and politics matter: in Iceland the large devaluation spread the cut in a relatively 'apolitical' way; the government let the banks go bust rather than bail them out at taxpayers' expense; it imposed capital controls on outflows; and it used fiscal transfers to protect the bottom half of the population from disproportionate cuts.","[Sigurgeirsdottir, Silla] Univ Iceland, Dept Polit Sci, Sch Social Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Wade, Robert H.; Sigurgeirsdottir, Silla] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of Iceland; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sigurgeirsdottir, S (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Dept Polit Sci, Sch Social Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",silla@hi.is,,,,,,,35,40,40,0,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Once the distribution of the eigenvalues of the empirical correlation matrix is found to differ from that of a pure random matrix, data are further analysed by means of hierarchical clustering techniques which allow for the creation of data clusters with common properties.

J,"Baily, MN; Bosworth, BP",,,,"Baily, Martin Neil; Bosworth, Barry P.",,,US Manufacturing: Understanding Its Past and Its Potential Future,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The development of the US manufacturing sector over the last half-century displays two striking and somewhat contradictory features: 1) the growth of real output in the US manufacturing sector, measured by real value added, has equaled or exceeded that of total GDP, keeping the manufacturing share of the economy constant in price-adjusted terms; and 2) there is a long-standing decline in the share of total employment attributable to manufacturing. The persistence of these trends seems inconsistent with stories of a recent or sudden crisis in the US manufacturing sector. After all, as recently as 2010, the United States had the world's largest manufacturing sector measured by its valued-added, and while it has now been surpassed by China, the United States remains a very large manufacturer. On the other hand, there are some potential causes for concern. First, though manufacturing's output share of GDP has remained stable over 50 years, and manufacturing retains a reputation as a sector of rapid productivity improvements, this is largely due to the spectacular performance of one subsector of manufacturing: computers and electronics. Second, recently there has been a large drop in the absolute level of manufacturing employment that many find alarming. Third, the US manufacturing sector runs an enormous trade deficit, equaling $460 billion in 2012, which is also very concentrated in trade with Asia. Finally, we consider the future evolution of the manufacturing sector and its importance for the US economy. Many of the largest US corporations continue to shift their production facilities overseas. It is important to understand why the United States is not perceived to be an attractive base for their production.","[Baily, Martin Neil; Bosworth, Barry P.] Brookings Inst, Econ Studies Program, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Baily, Martin Neil; Bosworth, Barry P.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution; Brookings Institution,"Baily, MN (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Econ Studies Program, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",mbaily@brookings.edu; bbosworth@brookings.edu,,,,,,,15,73,106,0,39,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Conventional plant breeding remains inherently random and slow, constrained by the availability of desirable traits in closely related plant species. In contrast, agricultural biotechnology employs the modern tools of genetic engineering to reduce uncertainty and breeding time and to transfer traits from more distantly related plants. Critics express concerns that the technology imposes negative environmental effects and jeopardizes the health of those who consume the frankenfoods. Supporters emphasize potential gains from boosting output and lowering food prices for consumers. They argue that such gains are achieved contemporaneous with the adoption of farming practices that lower agrochemical use and lessen soil. The extensive experience with agricultural biotechnology since 1996 provides ample evidence with which to test the claims of supporters and opponents and to evaluate the prospects of genetic crop engineering. In this paper, we begin with an overview of the adoption of the first generation of agricultural biotechnology crops. We then look at the evidence on the effects of these crops: on output and prices, on the environment, and on consumer health.

Empirical evidence, however, has failed to confirm this hypothesis (Callahan, McDonald and O'Brien 1994; Destler 1986; Pastor 1980). Rather, voting patterns in the Senate have been consistent with the party platform hypothesis. This paper presents an alternative account of the origins of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which is in keeping with the party platform hypothesis, and whose results are consistent with the log-rolling hypothesis. Specifically, I argue that the demand for protection on the part of U.S. farmers and manufacturers in the late 1920s, and the subsequent supply of protection by the Republican Party, were the direct result of a general-purpose technology shock - namely, electrification whose diffusion throughout the 1920s led to significant excess capacity in manufacturing and agriculture. In manufacturing, more productive firms became increasingly constrained on product markets. The resulting tractorization of U.S. agriculture and the motorization (trucks and automobiles) of transportation throughout the 1920s wreaked havoc on an already weakened agricultural sector (owing to lower post-war exports) by decreasing the demand by 48,294,887 grain- and hayequivalent acres. The proposed tariff bill sought to increase domestic firms' market share in these industries by reducing imports.","Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University,"Beaudreau, BC (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,58,1,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This paper develops a framework that allows us to study tax incidence on financial markets, and applies it to a financial transactions tax. A main result is that the tax may contribute to financial distress. Moreover, if the government has to bail out the debtors of failed financial institutions, the tax-induced increase in bailout costs may be larger than the increase in tax revenue, so that the government's overall fiscal position becomes worse.

The high growth could partly be attributed to the successes in structural transformation of the economy and industrial upgrading of the manufacturing sector toward high value-added products. However, regional inequality in China has increased considerably behind the scenes. In order to have sustainable economic growth, it is thus crucial to investigate the impacts of both structural transformation and industrial upgrading on regional inequality. This paper contributes to the literature by employing a database compiled at the county-level. Decompositions are performed for different spatial groupings so as to provide a clear view of evolution of regional inequality. In addition, the contributions of the major industries to inequality in industrialization are examined by using another database of value-added compiled at the provincial level. The results may have important policy implications for the formulation of a comprehensive and coherent strategy in managing inequality while promoting structural transformation and industrial upgrading.

Global volatility factors are extracted from a panel of monthly volatility proxies relating to 25 developed and 20 emerging stock markets. A dynamic factor model (FM) is estimated using two-year rolling-window regressions. The FM's time-varying variance shares of global factors map variations in volatility comovement over time and across countries. The results indicate that global volatility linkages are significantly stronger during financial crisis periods in Asia (1997-1998), Brazil (1999), Russia (1998) and the United States (2000, 2007-2008). Emerging markets are weakly synchronised with world volatility in comparison with developed markets. In particular, emerging market comovement is significantly lower than developed market comovement during the Asian and US sub-prime crises. This suggests a degree of decoupling of emerging markets from the global drivers of volatility during these periods.","[Duncan, Andrew S.] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Kabundi, Alain] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Kabundi, Alain] South African Reserve Bank, Res Dept, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; University of Johannesburg,"Duncan, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",andrewd@uj.ac.za; akabundi@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Accordingly, understanding the underpinnings of natural gas prices is likely to be critical, both to policy analysts and to market participants. At present, it is common to assume that these prices follow a geometric Brownian motion, i.e., that log returns - the inter-temporal differences in the natural log of prices - are normally distributed (possibly allowing for some form of mean-reversion). Increasingly, however, it has been recognized that the arrival of new information can lead to unexpectedly rapid changes - or jumps - in spot prices. The implication is that the presumption of normally distributed log-returns may be suspect. In particular, the prospect for abnormally fat tails becomes important. This article investigates the potential presence of jumps in two key natural gas prices: the spot price at the Henry Hub in the U. S., and the spot price for natural gas at the National Balancing Point in the U. K. We found compelling empirical evidence for the importance of jumps in both markets, though jumps appear to be more important in the U. K. (C) 2014 Elsevier ay.

Rather than taking stock, this paper capitalizes on some of these developments to look ahead. Section 2 provides a reminder of the hard core of transaction cost economics (TCE) with an emphasis on problems that TCE has allowed to identify, particularly the richness of organizational arrangements, an issue that needs further investigation. Section 3 discusses how to better understand the embedment of organizational arrangements in their institutional environment. The concept of 'meso-institutions' is introduced as a mean to capture mechanisms providing the needed interface.

Previous work has argued that fiscal decentralization has the potential to reduce income differences across regions but that this potential may not be realized because of governance problems associated with sub-national authorities. Our empirical evidence based on a sample of departments (regions) of Uruguay over the period 1990-2010 lends support to this idea.

Much of this analysis has centred on gaining a better understanding of the cyclical behaviour of capital flows. This paper continues in this vein by identifying capital flow episodes for South Africa and analyses the nature and main drivers of cross-border flows during these episodes. This paper makes two major contributions to the empirical work on South African capital flows. First, specific attention is given to some pertinent measurement issues in the identification of capital flow episodes for South Africa. The post capital account liberalisation period (post-1995-period) is delineated into a normal period (when capital inflows were close to historical averages) and an abnormal period (when capital inflows deviated significantly from the historical average). Second, the paper identifies some defining characteristics during these two periods. In this regard, the behaviour of domestic and foreign agents as drivers of capital flows and the probability of capital flow reversals across asset classes are given particular attention. Although these issues have significant policy implications, they have, to date, been given limited attention in the empirical work on South African capital flows.","[Rangasamy, Logan] South African Reserve Bank, Res Dept, ZA-0027 Pretoria, South Africa; [Rangasamy, Logan] Univ North West, Trade Res Area, Kirkland, WA USA; [Rangasamy, Logan] Univ North West, Grad Sch Business, Kirkland, WA USA",,"Rangasamy, L (通讯作者)，South African Reserve Bank, Res Dept, POB 1633, ZA-0027 Pretoria, South Africa.",logan.rangasamy@resbank.co.za,,,,,,,40,4,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

In the US, pictorial HWLs have been adopted, but tobacco industry litigation has delayed their implementation. This intervention could have value to smokers, if it increases their information and changes their smoking behavior. In this paper we estimate the value of two different health warning labels for cigarette packages relative to the current US labeling policy. Our methodology does not depend on the personal values of policy makers or other individuals, as the value of information estimates we derive are based solely on smokers' own consumption choices, not any public health or other effects. We introduce an approach to valuing information with a surplus measure that couples willingness-to-pay from non-hypothetical experimental auctions with time-series revealed preference demand estimates. We find that a pictorial HWL has a large value to smokers, and a higher value than a label that only contains text, insofar as changing purchase behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A trade surplus per se was not the main objective; presumably the argument was that trade would be balanced at the new higher growth rate. Moreover, the arguments for free trade were made against the background of an assumed hard peg (the gold standard) which would enforce balance of payments equilibrium. This means that contemporary free trade agreements (FTAs), with floating exchange rates, cannot be defended on the traditional grounds. With a floating exchange the appropriate policy advice for each individual jurisdiction is monetary mercantilism the use of macroeconomic policy in an attempt to achieve a trade surplus as a percentage of GDP. If one partner pursues such a strategy alone, this will translate into a one-for-one increase in the growth rate, and potential regional hegemony for the first mover. To restore balance amongst the trade partners (not necessarily with the outside world) and yet still keep higher growth rates there would have to be a union-wide expansion. This need not be formally coordinated, but at least all the partners should be in broad agreement about the stance of policy.","[Smithin, John] York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada; [Smithin, John] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Smithin, J (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,16,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

However, the information asymmetry in production costs that results from innovation reduces the efficiency of all firms in a market for a homogeneous good. We employ a signalling game to discuss the feasibility of utilising R&D spending and output levels as cost signals in an environment of quantity competition. The results show that a firm does not spend its money on R&D solely to signal the type of cost. Rather, R&D spending may be chosen as a cost signal over the output level only if expenditures on R&D can lead to a sufficiently high probability of reducing production costs.","[Tung, Chris Y.; Wang, Chun-Chieh] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University,"Tung, CY (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.",yntung@facmail.nsysu.edu.tw; cxw359@mail.nsysu.edu.tw,,,,,,,17,0,0,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Research contributions in these focal areas and in some related areas are briefly characterized. In the second image, there is a breakout from this 'beachhead' and a broader conflict with the reigning paradigm, neoclassical economics. Thomas Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions provides a framework and stimulus for thinking about the latter case, and the 20th century paradigm conflict in physics provides a baseline for thinking about it. The core strengths of evolutionary economics in the paradigm conflict are noted, and the evolutionary role of intentionality is examined No definitive prediction about the future is offered.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Winter, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",winter@wharton.upenn.edu,"Winter, Sidney/GXG-2470-2022",,,,,,77,25,27,1,43,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Thus, weak monotonicity reflects the nature of the egalitarian Shapley values in the same vein as strong monotonicity reflects the nature of the Shapley value.

We show that capital requirements should be reduced in response to unanticipated loan write-offs. We also show that capital requirements should be tightened in anticipation of future declines in productivity, and loosened at the onset of recessions. We conclude that macro-prudential capital requirement policies can be optimal from a welfare standpoint, but they can also generate output and credit booms through general equilibrium effects.","[Catalan, Mario] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Ganapolsky, Eduardo] Univ Torcuato Tella, RA-1002 Caba, Argentina",International Monetary Fund; Universidad Torcuato Di Tella,"Catalán, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mcatalan@imf.org; eganapolsky@proficioinvestment.com,,"Catalan, Mario/0000-0003-3165-822X",,,,,29,0,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

The U.S. Congress is currently considering whether to require them all to do so. Evidence on the potential impact is scant, though a large body of economic research suggests that individuals are not currently making optimal retirement-saving decisions. Through a field experiment, we measure how provision of retirement income projections along with enrollment information affects individuals' contributions to employer-sponsored retirement accounts. We find that the intervention boosted annual contributions to employer retirement accounts by $85, equivalent to 3.6% of the average contribution level or 0.15% of average salary, relative to those who received no intervention. In addition, randomly-assigned assumptions regarding retirement age, investment returns, and hypothetical contribution amounts were used to generate the projections and were found to have significant impacts on saving behavior. This finding suggests that care is warranted in the design and communication of projections. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that: (i) a positive shock to the crude oil prices has an initial positive effect on the CO2 allowance prices, which later becomes negative; (ii) an unexpected increase in the natural gas prices reduces the price of CO2 emissions; (iii) a positive shock to the prices of the fuel of choice, coal, has virtually no significant impact on the CO2 prices; (iv) there is a clear positive effect of the coal prices on the CO2 allowance prices when the electricity prices are excluded from the BSVAR system; and (v) a positive shock to the electricity prices has a negative impact on the price of the CO2 allowances. We also find that the energy price shocks have a persistent impact on the CO2 allowance prices, with the largest effect occurring 6 months after a shock strikes. The effect is particularly strong in the case of the shocks to the natural gas and crude oil prices. Finally, the empirical findings suggest an important degree of substitution between the three primary sources of energy (i.e., crude oil, natural gas and coal), particularly when electricity prices are excluded from the BSVAR system.

To explain how aid affects donor's exports, we constructed a theoretical framework that considers aid as public goods with externality effects. We also estimate augmented gravity equations using Korea's bilateral exports and ODA data, employing Hausman-Taylor Method and system-GMM to address the endogeneity problem. Through the long-term analysis with aggregated data, we confirmed the positive effects of total ODA, loans, grants and economic aid but no such effect in non-economic (humanitarian) aid At the sub-sector level, we found out that in some cases infrastructure aid had no effects and humanitarian aid showed positive effects, which was contrary to the results obtained analyzing aggregated data. These conflicting results imply that the effects of ODA on exports depend on both ODA types and industrial sectors. By comparing two distinct periods, we found out that the vanguard effects of ODA on donor exports have lasted even after untying aid was introduced These results show that donors are not necessarily anxious about expanding untying aid, since they are highly likely to continue to benefit if aid packages are well designed The government efforts to sophisticatedly make the combination of various ODA types would not only enhance the trade creation effects of ODA but also secure domestic supports for scaling up ODA; hence eventually helping the international community to mobilize financial resources.","Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Seoul,"Kang, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",gilseong.kang@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,2,3,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We compare the rolling window approach to estimation by smoothing methods. The main difference between the rolling window and the smoothing methods is in the way information is weighted. We propose that the Kalman filter smoother is the most appropriate estimator for the task as it optimally weights current and past information. We show the rolling window approach does not produce estimates that are attenuated over time leading to chain drift in the index. We also compare two alternative specifications to model property location. The empirical section uses data from a small and homogeneous market in the state of Queensland, Australia. The Tornqvist and Jevons indexes differ in value during periods of market volatility.

The above conclusions imply Chinese central bank should not implement the monetary policy based on core inflation excluding food price but should make a certain response to the surging food price.","Huaqiao Univ, Coll Econ & Finance, Quanzhou 362021, Peoples R China",Huaqiao University,"Su, ZF (通讯作者)，Huaqiao Univ, Coll Econ & Finance, Quanzhou 362021, Peoples R China.",suzufine@hqu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund [14BJY013]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [13SKGC-QT04],National Social Science Fund; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),The National Social Science Fund (Project No. 14BJY013) and Huaqiao University's Academic Project supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Project No. 13SKGC-QT04) are gratefully acknowledged.

The adopted methodology deploys the non stationary panel unit root framework to cope with the problem of limited sample providing more reliable insight and, in particular, the analysis uses the univariate and panel minimum Lagrange Multiplier (LM) unit root tests, suggested by Lee and Strazicich (2003, 2004) and Im et al. (2005), that accounts for one and two endogenously determined structural breaks. The overall evidence is in favor of catching up with the EU benchmark cases as well as in favor of convergence within the Balkan area.

An Agency View of Trade Credit Use by Chaebols,GLOBAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,agency cost; trade credit; Inter-firm credit; ownership-control disparity; chaebol,MONETARY-POLICY; BUSINESS; FINANCE; STATE,"Abstract We study inter-firm credit (also known as trade credit (TC) or the delayed payment a supplier allows its downstream customer on a product sale) with an emphasis on its unique features in Korea. It is the prominence of chaebol-affiliated firms in the Korean economy that makes Korea unique because chaebol firms are linked together by common ownership and thus distort the assumption common to all theories of TC that the input supplier is independent from its customer. We find several aspects of TC use by chaebols. First, viewed as input purchasers, these firms take more TC (the chaebol effect). The amount of TC taken is positively related to purchases from other chaebol affiliates (the affiliate effect), and with the degree of the chairman's ownership-control disparity (the ownership multiplier effect). Also TC as proportion of short-term debt increases significantly after profit growth (the profit effect). Furthermore, chaebol members give less TC although this is strongly correlated with transactions with affiliates. We suggest a unifying interpretation of these patterns based on agency cost: TC, by substituting for external financing and reducing monitoring by outsiders, presents controlling minority owners the opportunity to misuse their greater control for their own benefit.","[Kim, Daehwan] Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Nilsen, Jeffrey] Amer Univ Bulgaria, Dept Econ, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria",Konkuk University; American University Bulgaria,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",dkim@konkuk.ac.kr,"Kim, Daehwan/D-6040-2011","Kim, Daehwan/0000-0002-2068-6826",,,,,36,1,1,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Our purpose is to assess if in Italy there is a connected and stable structure, due to the presence of directors with multiple mandates, like it happens in the German case. We find a very cohesive network structure, due to the presence of a few directors with multiple assignments and, unlike the German case, this structure is stable, but not connected. Moreover we propose an alternative approach to investigate the dynamics, based on temporal networks, in order to quantify the variation of links in a certain time period. We construct a unique cumulative network, where nodes are companies and the existence of an edge is related with the persistence in time of an interlock between two companies. This persistence is due on the one hand to the ownership of a few family firms, and on the other hand to cross-shareholdings between companies. To complete the analysis we also investigate whether the link stability results from the appointments of the same director or from the stepping in/out of different directors.","[Bellenzier, Lucia; Grassi, Rosanna] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Grassi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",rosanna.grassi@unimib.it,"Grassi, Rosanna/AAE-6910-2019; Grassi, Rosanna/U-5668-2019","Grassi, Rosanna/0000-0001-5292-1723",,,,,37,26,27,1,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Previous studies were limited to the cases of per unit and ad valorem taxes. Three main contributions are made. Methodologically, the elasticity of the tax function is introduced as a new parameter so that the price-elasticity of general consumption tax schedules in different models of imperfect competition might be dealt with in a tractable manner. Theoretically, existing results on the difference between the incidence of ad valorem and per unit consumption taxes are generalized to non-linear consumption taxes: the larger the elasticity of the tax function, the smaller the share of consumption tax borne by consumers. From the perspective of applied public economics, it is shown how the regulator may reduce prices in very uncompetitive markets by increasing the elasticity of the consumption tax on a targeted range of producer prices.

The results are robust to the use of housing price as an instrumental variable for the economy-wide nominal wage and the inclusion of real GDP growth, demographic structure, government deficit, pollution emissions and health sector quality as control variables.

By allowing negative consumption as a mathematical construct, closed form solutions for equilibrium tax-adjusted income are derived.

J,"Trew, A",,,,"Trew, Alex",,,Spatial takeoff in the first industrial revolution,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Endogenous growth; First industrial revolution; Economic geography; Structural change,FARM WAGES; GROWTH; ENGLAND; PRODUCTIVITY; GEOGRAPHY,"Using the framework of Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (forthcoming), we present a model of spatial takeoff that is calibrated using spatially-disaggregated occupational data for England in c. 1710. The model predicts changes in the spatial distribution of agricultural and manufacturing employment which match data for c. 1817 and 1861. The model also matches a number of aggregate changes that characterise the first industrial revolution. Using counterfactual geographical distributions, we show that the initial concentration of productivity can matter for whether and when an industrial takeoff occurs. Subsidies to innovation in either sector can bring forward the date of takeoff while subsidies to the use of land by manufacturing firms can significantly delay a takeoff because it decreases spatial concentration of activity.

Employing Danish employer-employee matched data covering from 1995 to 2007, the analysis shows a significant change in the workforce composition of firms in response to heightened competition. Competition is found to negatively affect employment, value-added, and intangible assets of the Danish firms, and firms refocus away from products, where China's competitive advantage becomes higher. The results show an important role of the distributional impact of low-wage competition within firms in restructuring the industry.","[Utar, Hale] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Utar, Hale] Univ Aarhus, Labor Market Dynam & Growth Ctr LMDG, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",University of Bielefeld; Aarhus University,"Utar, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Dept Econ, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",haleutar@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,30,35,0,13,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

We obtain first the outcomes of this unobservable-contracts case. Next, we perform comparative statics of these outcomes with respect to the higher-valuation player's valuation for the prize. Finally, we compare the outcomes of the unobservable-contracts case with those of the observable-contracts case. We find, among other things, that the unobservability of delegation contracts narrows the gap between the delegates' equilibrium contingent compensation.","[Baik, Kyung Hwan] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea; [Kim, Jihyun] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Baik, KH (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",khbaik@skku.edu; kimjihy@indiana.edu,"Baik, Kyung Hwan/ABE-6007-2021; Baik, Kyung Hwan/IAQ-5601-2023","Baik, Kyung Hwan/0000-0003-3032-9686",,,,,46,8,8,0,9,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.
