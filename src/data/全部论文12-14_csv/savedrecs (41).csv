In this paper, we take a relational approach, using statistical techniques from social network theory, to examine the governance structure of markets in a commune of Tra Vinh province in the Mekong River Delta. We demonstrate that new opportunities provided by the process of market development are accessible only to those households controlling the right bundles of resources in the core agricultural production and trading system of the area. Further, industrial employment is available only to those who have, at some stage, controlled land, while those who have never participated in the land and rice markets are confined to casual agricultural labour.

The analyses are based on a framework provided by the over education/required education/under education literature, and the decomposition developed by Chiswick and Miller (2008). It shows that the payoff to correctly matched education in rural China is much higher for females than for males. Associated with this, the wage penalty where workers are under qualified in their occupation is greater for females than for males. Over educated females, however, are advantaged compared with their male counterparts. These findings are interpreted using the explanations offered for the gender differential in the payoff to schooling in the growing literature on earnings determination in China.","[Miller, Paul W.] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Ren, Weiwei] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Ren, Weiwei] Yunnan Normal Univ, Sch Math, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Curtin University; University of Western Australia; Yunnan Normal University,"Miller, PW (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",Paul.Miller@curtin.edu.au,,,,,,,26,10,10,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Although behavioral research has revealed a number of insights into the nature of trust, as well as its antecedents and consequences, an increasing number of scholars have begun to investigate the topic from a biological perspective to gain a deeper understanding. These biological investigations into trust have been carried out on three levels of analysis: genes, endocrinology, and the brain. Based on these three levels, we present a review of the literature on the biology of trust. Moreover, we integrate our findings into a conceptual framework which unifies the three levels of analysis, and we also link the biological levels to trust behavior. The results show that trust behavior is at least moderately genetically predetermined. Moreover, trust behavior is associated with specific hormones, in particular oxytocin, as well as specific brain structures, which are located in the basal ganglia, limbic system, and the frontal cortex. Based on these results, we discuss both methodological and thematic implications.","[Riedl, Rene] Univ Linz, Dept Business Informat Informat Engn, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Javor, Andrija] Linz Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol & Psychiat, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz; Kepler University Hospital,"Riedl, R (通讯作者)，Univ Linz, Dept Business Informat Informat Engn, Altenberger Str 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",rene.riedl@jku.at,,,,,,,191,88,103,0,44,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The reasons for this attention can be attributed to introduction of operational risk into the Basel II regulatory framework and to high losses stemming from operational risk events. Despite the fact that the new Basel III proposal does not give much attention to this risk, operational risk should not be underestimated. In this paper we present a theoretical background for the use of insurance in banks' operational management according to Basel II rules. Moreover, we provide empirical analysis of the role of insurance in operational risk management in an anonymous bank located in Central Europe. We compare the results of our case study with impact studies conducted for Basel II evaluation. Based on our analysis we reject a hypothesis that insurance serves as an effective mitigation tool of operational risk in case of the researched bank.","[Rippel, Milan; Suchankova, L.; Teply, P.] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, CZ-11001 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Rippel, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Opletalova 26, CZ-11001 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",teply@fsv.cuni.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,,,,,21,9,9,0,21,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The comparisons are based on 14 performance ratios resulting from the concept of CAMEL (which is an acronym for Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management efficiency, Earnings ability, and Liquidity sufficiency). To ensure that becoming part of an FHC is a random process, we used four matching methods to select the controlled banks so that the characteristic variables of banks in the two groups are statistically indifferent. By using the data before matching, it was found that FHC banks significantly defeat independent banks, regardless of their performance ratios. Conversely, when the sample was used after the matching, the results changed dramatically. Although FHC banks still beat the independent banks in terms of capital adequacy, asset quality, and liquidity sufficiency, FHC banks and independent banks are found to have equal profitability and management efficiency.

Based on the literature survey on the FDI and country development, this paper argues that FDI strategy has the important effects on socio-economic development through three channels: economic growth with inward FDI growth as the most essential engine; innovation and technological advance and knowledge spillovers from the FDI-based firms on the economy; and human capital accumulation from the FDI-based firms. The findings based on the secondary data are likely to support the role of inward FDI in socio-economic development. Even though, the ASEAN Economic Community Roadmap helps to encourage the high level of FDI and to optimize the socio-economic development in the ASEAN, but it still lacks the implementation and enforcement of the ASEAN agreements. In the long run, the regional economic monitoring and surveillance process must be evolved to drive the ASEAN to become the ASEAN community in 2015. It is expected that these practical actions will improve the tendency of the FDI flows, develop the foundation of the market system in the economy, and thus further lift the level of socio-economic development in the Southeast Asian region.

The purpose of this special issue is to strengthen the role played by innovation as a determinant of firm growth. Despite the emergence of a vast empirical literature on whether innovative firms grow more quickly in terms of sales and employees, a number of crucial questions and answers remain. While a large number of applied papers observe a positive link between innovation and firm growth, the complexity of R&D activities, together with the diversity of innovation strategies and the multiplicity of growth modes, requires a multidimensional approach to examine the contribution of innovations on firm growth. To shed light on the link between firm' growth and innovation sources, we organized a meeting of leading scholars of firm' growth and innovation. The papers of this special issue were presented at the workshop on 'Firm growth and innovation' held on 28 and 29 June, 2012, in Tarragona, Spain.

The goal is to study how these elements affect the deposit contract that banks offer to depositors and the ex ante probability of a bank run. We show that the coexistence of a central bank, which determines banks' reserve requirements, and an interbank market, which redistributes reserves, leads to a smaller probability of a bank run and to fewer inefficient bank runs, relative to the case with no central bank and no interbank market. By adequately choosing the level of reserves to store, the central bank can improve the equilibrium outcome and allow banks to offer a higher interim payment to depositors, relative to the situation with no cross deposits.

Our study reveals a linear relation between OFI and price changes, with a slope inversely proportional to the market depth. These results are shown to be robust to intraday seasonality effects, and stable across time scales and across stocks. This linear price impact model, together with a scaling argument, implies the empirically observed square-root relation between the magnitude of price moves and trading volume, but this relation is found to be noisy and less robust than the one based on OFI. We discuss a potential application of OFI as a measure of adverse selection in limit order executions and discuss the implications for intraday volatility dynamics.","[Cont, Rama] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Kukanov, Arseniy] Columbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Stoikov, Sasha] Cornell Univ, Cornell Financial Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Imperial College London; Columbia University; Cornell University,"Cont, R (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, Huxley Bldg, London SW7 2AZ, England.",r.cont@imperial.ac.uk,,"CONT, Rama/0000-0003-1164-6053",,,,,52,141,172,2,125,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

We start obtaining all the required information for the standard credit risk model. Then we quantify the loss distribution under the standard IS method and allocate the total risk over the different institutions in the Spanish financial system. We extend the current IS framework to deal with more general assumptions like random recoveries and market valuation. We also study the variability of the risk measures over the business cycle and the possible variability due to the model parameters uncertainty. Our results show that this approach can be very useful for banking supervisors from a macroprudential point of view and that the risk allocation can vary considerably depending on the valuation model under analysis.

To assess this risk, we consider three decades of data on the cross-border interbank market. We use Rosvall and Bergstrom's (2008) information theoretic map equation to partition banking groups from 21 countries into modules that reveal the contagious capacity of the network. We show that in the late 1980s four important financial centers formed one large super cluster that was highly contagious in terms of transmission of stress within its ranks, but less contagious on a global scale. But the expansion leading to the 2008 crisis left more transmitting hubs sharing the same total influence as a few large modules had previously. We show that this greater entanglement meant the network was more broadly contagious, and not that risk was more shared. Thus, our analysis contributes to our understanding as to why defaults in US sub-prime mortgages spread quickly through the global financial system. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

At the heart of the controversy is whether there is an energy efficiency gap, whereby consumers and firms fail to make seemingly positive net present value energy saving investments. High implicit discount rates, undervaluation of future fuel savings, and negative cost energy efficiency measures have all been discussed as evidence of the existence of a gap. We review explanations for an energy efficiency gap including reasons why the size of the gap may be overstated, neoclassical explanations for a gap, and recent evidence from behavioral economics that has potential to help us understand why a gap could exist. Our review raises fundamental questions about traditional welfare analysis, but we find the alternatives offered in the literature to be far from ready for use in policy analysis. Nevertheless, we offer several suggestions for policymakers and for future economic research.

As a result, the distribution of these benefits has received relatively little attention in transportation planning, compared to transport-related burdens. Drawing on philosophies of social justice, we present an equity assessment of the distribution of accessibility in order to define the rate of access poverty among the population. We then apply this analysis to regional transportation plan scenarios from the San Francisco Bay Area, focusing on measures of differences between public transit and automobile access. The analysis shows that virtually all neighborhoods suffer from substantial gaps between car and public transport-based accessibility, but that the two proposed transportation investment programs reduce access poverty compared to the no project scenario. We also investigate how access and access poverty rates vary by demographic groups and map low-income communities within access impoverished areas, which could be the subject of further focused investments.

We investigated this question based on three groups of Danish seniors: persons who were licensed as drivers (drivers); persons who have never been licensed drivers (never-drivers); and persons who recently gave up their licence (ex-drivers). Data were collected via standardised telephone interviews in 2012 among 863 individuals born in 1939/40. The three groups differed significantly in socio-demographics and health; never-drivers had the least resources, and ex-drivers the poorest health. Moreover, the two unlicensed groups had more unmet mobility needs than drivers. In ordinal regression models, both never having had a licence and having given up a licence significantly affected unmet mobility needs. Among the background variables, which were successively added to the models, health variables were most relevant, while socio-demographics and infrastructure played a minor role. When entering the health variables to the models, the effect of giving up a licence decreased but remained significant for unmet leisure needs, while it became insignificant for unmet shopping needs. The effect of never having had a licence was hardly affected by the inclusion of control variables. The results emphasise the importance of a driving licence in fulfilling seniors' mobility needs. Contrary to our hypotheses, more experience with, and better access to alternative transport modes cannot sufficiently compensate for mobility problems due to the lack of the option to drive.

Empirically, New York Stock Exchange intermediary data reveals economically large price pressures, 0.49% on average with a half life of 0.92 days. Theoretically, a simple dynamic inventory model captures an intermediary's use of price pressure to mean-revert inventory. She trades off revenue loss due to price pressure against price risk associated with staying in a nonzero inventory state. The closed-form solution identifies the intermediary's risk aversion and the investors' private value distribution from the observed time series patterns of prices and inventories. These parameters imply a relative social cost due to price pressure, a deviation from constrained Pareto efficiency, of approximately 10% of the cost of immediacy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main finding is that a sharp acceleration of the gap at the top is not observed in Japan when we use a sample of all workers. However, a glass ceiling effect is observed for white collar workers who do not receive performance-based pay. On the other hand, the feature of maintaining a raw gender wage gap at about the same level above the 60 percentile is observed for white collar workers who receive performance pay. In addition, we find that the raw gender wage gap among the performance-pay group is about 5-18 points greater across the wage distribution than that among the non-performance-pay group. A second finding is that after performing the counterfactual decomposition analysis introduced by Machado and Mata (2005), differences in promotion between women and men explain the gender wage gap at the top of the distribution for non-performance pay workers. On the other hand, the gender difference for those working in large companies explained the gender wage gap at the top distribution for performance pay workers. J. Japanese Int.

We present the matching scores (accuracy) for recognition of facial expressions and the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) index of agreement. In 2005, matching scores of 89% were reported for FaceReader. However, previous research used a version of FaceReader that implemented older algorithms (version 1.0) and did not contain FACS classifiers. In this study, we tested the newest version (6.0). FaceReader recognized 88% of the target emotional labels in the Warsaw Set of Emotional Facial Expression Pictures (WSEFEP) and Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES). The software reached a FACS index of agreement of 0.67 on average in both datasets. The results of this validation test are meaningful only in relation to human performance rates for both basic emotion recognition and FACS coding. The human emotions recognition for the 2 datasets was 85%, therefore FaceReader is as good at recognizing emotions as humans. To receive FACS certification, a human coder must reach an agreement of 0.70 with the master coding of the final test. Even though FaceReader did not attain this score, action units (AUs) 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 25 might be used with high accuracy. We believe that FaceReader has proven to be a reliable indicator of basic emotions in the past decade and has a potential to become similarly robust with FACS.","[Lewinski, Peter] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Dept Commun Sci, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [den Uyl, Tim M.] Vicarious Percept Technol BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Butler, Crystal] NYU, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of Amsterdam; New York University,"Lewinski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Dept Commun Sci, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.lewinski@uva.nl,,,European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/ under REA grant [290255],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/ under REA grant(European Union (EU)),"The findings have been presented as an abstract/poster at NEFCA Etmaal van de Communicatiewetenschap (24 Hours of Communication Sciences), Wageningen, The Netherlands, February 2014.

Specifically, we use banking sector news to proxy for the severity of career concerns. Analysts follow more closely the consensus forecast when the prospects of the banking sector are negative (and vice versa). The effect is both economically and statistically significant after controlling for various firm, analyst, brokerage house, and forecasting characteristics, as well as sector and economy wide effects. The more established analysts, in terms of reputation and experience, are generally unaffected by banking sector news. In contrast, their less established peers tend to cluster their forecasts near the consensus after a sequence of negative news flows for banks. Collectively, our results support the notion that during banking stresses when job security is low analysts' tendency to imitate others increases. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a longitudinal data that tracked almost 3000 children into adulthood, we showed that the negative effect of unemployment on mental well-being and life satisfaction is significantly larger for workers who, as adolescents, had a relatively poor father-child relationship. Maternal unemployment, on the other hand, is a good predictor of how individuals react psychologically to future unemployment Although the results should be viewed as illustrative and more research is needed, the current article provides new longitudinal evidence that psychological resilience to job loss may be determined early on in the life cycle.

We find that this latent factor outweighs the observed systematic risk factors and can substantially improve the in-sample predictive accuracy at the firm, rating group, and aggregate levels. Thus it might be helpful to include the unobserved systematic risk factor when simulating portfolio credit losses. However, we also find that this factor only marginally improves out-of-sample model performance. Therefore, although the models we investigated all show reasonably good ability to rank order firms by default risk, accurate prediction of default rate remains challenging even when the unobserved systematic risk factor is considered.

Five contestants prepare a dinner for each other during the course of a week and evaluate each other's performance. The winner receives a monetary prize. Evaluations remain concealed until the show is broadcast. Because actual voting behavior remains concealed during the show, a contestant could evaluate his/her opponents as zero in an effort to increase his/her own chances of winning, without risking later punishment in the form of low scores. However, this behavior is not observed in our dataset, which runs from 2006 to 2011. We find that all of the following have a significant influence on the evaluating behavior: the objective sophistication of a meal; the order of cooking; whether a person has already cooked; and the social similarity between contestant and evaluator.

This article addresses three popular claims saying that complex financial markets are at fault and need more regulation. It argues that even in the midst of a major economic downturn, the much-maligned mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps, and unregistered hedge funds functioned almost exactly as designed. When macroeconomic conditions worsened, firms and investors that were paid to assume certain risks had to assume them. Those that opted for safer investment vehicles with more levels of private protection faced fewer problems. Although many investment vehicles lost money, one must differentiate between problems that manifested themselves in markets and problems with the market itself. Even though government policies caused many of the problems, public officials always have an incentive to point the finger at Wall Street and to argue for more regulations when their policies negatively affect markets.","Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Stringham, EP (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",edward.stringham@ttu.edu,,,,,,,94,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2014,161.0,3-4,,,,,269,288,,10.1007/s11127-014-0198-7,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AT7XF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345147000001,0

In practice, however, many productive firms are not internationalized, whereas many unproductive firms are, which suggests that there are factors other than productivity that influence firms' internationalization. This study uses a unique panel data set for Japanese small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to examine whether the personal characteristics of a firm's president are factors in firm internationalization. We find that SMEs with a risk-tolerant, forward-looking president are more likely to be internationalized. These effects are large in magnitude, as is the productivity effect, which provides a partial explanation as to why many productive firms are not internationalized. In addition, we find that productivity has an insignificant effect on firms exiting export markets, whereas presidential myopia increases the probability of exit. The evidence further suggests that a firm's initial export costs become sunk following its entry into export markets, which explains why many unproductive firms are internationalized. J.

Evidence from the recent crisis,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bank risk; Systemic risk; Deposit insurance; Bank supervision and regulation; Financial crisis,DESIGN,"Deposit insurance is widely offered in a number of countries as part of a financial system safety net to promote stability. An unintended consequence of deposit insurance is the reduction in the incentive of depositors to monitor banks which lead to excessive risk-taking. We examine the relation between deposit insurance and bank risk and systemic fragility in the years leading up to and during the recent financial crisis. We find that generous financial safety nets increase bank risk and systemic fragility in the years leading up to the global financial crisis. However, during the crisis, bank risk is lower and systemic stability is greater in countries with deposit insurance coverage. Our findings suggest that the moral hazard effect of deposit insurance dominates in good times while the stabilization effect of deposit insurance dominates in turbulent times. The overall effect of deposit insurance over the full sample we study remains negative since the destabilizing effect during normal times is greater in magnitude compared to the stabilizing effect during global turbulence. In addition, we find that good bank supervision can alleviate the unintended consequences of deposit insurance on bank systemic risk during good times, suggesting that fostering the appropriate incentive framework is very important for ensuring systemic stability.

Our results indicate that both the long memory and asymmetric behavior characterize the conditional volatility of oil and stock market returns. On the other hand, the dynamic conditional correlations (DCC) between the crude oil and US stock markets are affected by several economic and geopolitical events. When looking at the optimal design of an oil-stock portfolio, we find that investors in the US markets should have more stocks than crude oil asset in order to reduce their portfolio risk. Finally, the use of the DCC-FIAPARCH model that explicitly accounts for long memory and asymmetric volatility effects enables the investors to effectively hedge the risk of their stock portfolios with lower costs, compared to the standard DCC-GARCH model.

Hence, credit constraints might reduce the export-sales ratio or not. This paper assesses the role of credit constraints for the export-sales ratio at the firm level. We explore this hypothesis empirically, using cross-section and panel data on Chinese enterprises compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. We approximate credit constraints by a firm's ratio of liquid debt to sales and, alternatively, the ratio of liquid assets to total assets. In particular, we estimate the impact of these financial fundamentals on the extensive and the intensive margins of firm-level exports in two-part fractional response models. Fixed effects panel regressions point to a negative relationship between export-sales ratios and credit constraints only at the extensive margin.","[Egger, Peter H.; Kesina, Michaela] ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Kesina, M (通讯作者)，ETH, LEE G116,Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",kesina@kof.ethz.ch,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207; Kesina, Michaela/0000-0002-3223-0973",,,,,42,12,14,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Boomers' retirement is expected to mitigate the demand for equities until 2050, but its impact varies with the specific population age structure along decades. This paper employs a dynamic asset pricing model with optimum consumption and portfolio rules to estimate aging effects on S&P500 returns between 1950 and 2050. Calibration for demographic and economic data between 1950 and 2005 yields model estimates that significantly explain the moving average of S&P500 returns.

Structural change entails the movement of labor from low productivity sectors like agriculture into more modern sectors of the economy. Because the share of the labor force in agriculture is so high in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, the potential for structural change to lead to growth and poverty alleviation in Africa appears to be enormous. Yet, very little of this new literature on structural change focuses on Africa. This special issue begins to fill that gap. The first half of this special issue contains five original contributions that provide new insights with respect to the nature of Africa's growth over the past two decades. The second half contains six original contributions that examine opportunities for structural transformation in Africa. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent arguments have increasingly emphasised the more indirect benefits of informal taxation in relation to economic growth, broader tax compliance, and governance. More research is needed, we argue, into the relevant costs and benefits for all, including quasi-voluntary compliance, political and administrative incentives for reform, and citizen-state bargaining over taxation.","[Joshi, Anuradha] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Prichard, Wilson] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Heady, Christopher] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Sussex; University of Toronto; University of Kent,"Joshi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",a.joshi@ids.ac.uk,,"Heady, Christopher/0000-0003-3414-0100; Joshi, Anuradha/0000-0003-0990-7701; Prichard, Wilson/0000-0002-9855-6538",,,,,120,45,51,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Systemic risk comes about as soon as firms diversify their collateral by holding claims on a big wholesale (merchant) bank whose asset side includes claims on the same producer set. The merchant bank sector proves to be fragile (has a short distance to default) regardless of competition. In this setting, the policy response, consisting in official guarantees for the merchant bank's liabilities, entails considerable government loss risk. An alternative without the need for public sector involvement is to encourage systemically important merchant banks to introduce a simple bail-in mechanism by restricting their liabilities to contingent convertible bonds. This line of regulatory policy is particularly relevant to the containment of systemic events in globally leveraged economies serviced by big international banks outside host country regulatory control.

Monetary authorities can play a central role in determining the economic course and costs of currency crises. They have to decide whether to defend or not to defend the domestic currency giving rise to three different types of crises: (i) an immediate depreciation if the central bank does not intervene and either (ii) a successful defense or (iii) an unsuccessful defense in the case of an intervention. We find that a central bank has two options to mitigate the costs of speculative attacks, namely an immediate depreciation and a successful defense. If a central bank intervenes she might be able to stabilize the exchange rate only temporarily and risks to ultimately fail facing the worst of the three scenarios with the highest economic costs.

We show that, an investor has higher cautiousness (i) if and only if she is always more likely to buy the option; and (ii) if and only if she always demands more options per share. As an option's payoff is a convex function, increasing positions in the option increases the convexity of a portfolio, which leads to an increase in skewness.

Results highlighted that gambling decisions were negatively induced by the probability of losing and the frequency of previous losses, and positively induced by the probability of gaining. Actual decisions were consistent with first order stochastic dominance. The study of second order stochastic dominance revealed that macaques were risk-prone whereas capuchins and orang-utans were risk-adverse. We detected responses comparable to the hot-hand effect, a bias found in humans. Capuchins and orang-utans exhibited probability distortion and loss aversion, which were not systematically found in macaques. Given the heterogeneity among individuals, we implemented mixture models and showed that attitudes towards risk and probabilities play complementary and different roles in the three species.","[Pele, M.; Thierry, B.; Dufour, V.] CNRS, Dept Ecol Physiol & Ethol, Strasbourg, France; [Pele, M.; Thierry, B.; Dufour, V.] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, Strasbourg, France; [Broihanne, M.

Using parametric survival analysis, we test the effects of regional innovation on exit likelihood in the US computer and electronic product manufacturing during the 1992-2008 period. The novelty of our approach is in conditioning the effects of metropolitan innovation on firm size. Estimation results suggest a negative relationship between metropolitan patenting activity and survival of firms that started with 1-3 employees. This effect decreases if companies grow. Establishments with more than 4 employees at start-up are insensitive to metropolitan innovation, although size of firms that started with 4-9 employees improves their survival chances. These findings indicate that local knowledge spillovers do not translate into lower hazard. The negative relationship indicates either a creative destruction regime or decisions of entrepreneurs to shut down existing ventures in order to pursue other opportunities.","[Tsvetkova, Alexandra] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Thill, Jean-Claude; Strumsky, Deborah] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",George Mason University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Tsvetkova, A (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",atsvetko@gmu.edu; Jean-Claude.Thill@uncc.edu; dstrumsk@uncc.edu,"Strumsky, Deborah A/HSE-8706-2023",,,,,,109,30,37,4,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This may reflect insufficient emphasis on local banking practices. Bankers commonly seek to ensure repayment by using methods other than securing collateral, such as targeting borrower characteristics that, on average, improve repayment rates. Formal land titles can signal these important characteristics to the bank. Using a household survey from Indonesia, we provide evidence that formal land titles have a positive and significant effect on access to credit and that at least part of this effect is best interpreted as an improvement in information flows. These results stand in contrast to the prevailing notion that land titles function only as collateral. Analysts who neglect local banking practices may misinterpret the observed effect of systematic land titling programs on credit access because these programs tend to reduce the signalling value of formal land titles.","[Dower, Paul Castaneda] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia; [Potamites, Elizabeth] Mathematica Policy Res, Moscow, Russia",New Economic School,"Dower, PC (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia.",,,"Castaneda Dower, Paul/0000-0001-5902-6799",,,,,25,14,18,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Hispanics were 17% less likely to receive an offer, after including controls. The discrepancy is robust to lender-specific regressions and the inclusion of a large number of explanatory variables.

Meanwhile, a largely independent literature proposing and applying alternative measures of tax compliance has also developed in recent years, which has sought to provide tax agencies with tools to identify the extent of tax non-compliance as a first step to designing policies to improve compliance. In this context, measures of tax gaps' - the difference between actual tax collected and the potential tax collection under full compliance with the tax code - have become the primary measures of tax non-compliance via (legal) avoidance and/or (illegal) evasion. In this paper, we argue that the tax gap as conventionally defined is conceptually flawed because it fails to incorporate behavioural responses by taxpayers. We show that conventional tax gap measures, which ignore the presence of behavioural responses, exaggerate the degree of non-compliance. This potentially applies both to indirect taxes (such as the VAT gap') and direct (income) taxes. Further, where these conventional tax gap measures motivate reforms designed to increase the tax compliance rate, they will likely have a tax-base-reducing effect and hence generate a smaller increase in realised tax revenues than would be anticipated from the tax gap estimate.","[Gemmell, Norman] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Hasseldine, John] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA",Victoria University Wellington; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Gemmell, N (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.",Norman.Gemmell@vuw.ac.nz; john.hasseldine@unh.edu,,,,,,,23,17,19,0,42,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

In the same election year, turnout in presidential nomination contests ranges from less than 1 % of party supporters participating in some caucuses to record breaking turnout levels upwards of 50 % in primaries in other states. This variation is attributable, in part, to the electoral rules, which vary across states, years, and parties. In this paper, I provide a comprehensive examination of the extent to which party and state rules affect voter turnout in nomination contests from 1980 to 2012. Using the normal partisan support score as the voter turnout denominator, I find that primaries, open contests, and proportional representation rules result in higher levels of turnout. I also show that within the window of competitiveness, turnout is higher in states that hold contests later in the nomination season. Overall, my analysis provides insight into the institutional structures that influence the number of people who participate in the presidential nomination process and enhances understanding about the factors that affect voter turnout.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Jewitt, CE (通讯作者)，Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 119 Major Williams Hall,220 Stanger St, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",cjewitt@vt.edu,,,,,,,36,5,7,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2014,160.0,3-4,,,,,295,312,,10.1007/s11127-014-0185-z,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AL7VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339344600001,0

This gives a new dividend to the incentive policies to postpone the retirement age: extending the worker horizon gives incentives to better train seniors. This increase in the labor productivity raises the earnings of the employment recovery. A model of job search where the age of retirement and the investments in human capital are simultaneously endogenous, provides the theoretical basis for these mechanisms. Its simulation, based on a calibration of the French case, shows that the contribution of the workers over 55 years old in total output increases from 9.5 % to 16%, with progression more than 10% of individual productivity on these age groups.","[Khaskhoussi, Tarek] Inst Super Informat & Gest, Lab Microecon Appl, LARMA, Kairouan 3100, Tunisia; [Langot, Francois] Banque France, Ecole Econ Paris, IRA, Cepremap, Paris, France",Universite de Kairouan; European Central Bank; Bank of France; Paris School of Economics,"Khaskhoussi, T (通讯作者)，Inst Super Informat & Gest, Lab Microecon Appl, LARMA, Rue Khemaies Elouini, Kairouan 3100, Tunisia.",Tarek.Khaskhoussi@gmail.com; flangot@univ-lemans.fr,,"langot, francois/0000-0001-7737-5319",,,,,29,0,0,3,16,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We show that the results of the estimated state-space models and the estimated VAR return decomposition models that attempt to estimate the contribution of expected returns and dividend growth to movements in the price-dividend ratio provide different results when one corrects for proper inference for both models. The corrected inference indicates that the contribution of expected returns to fluctuations in the price-dividend ratio is found to be statistically insignificant according to the state-space model, however, expected returns are found to contribute significantly to movements in the price-dividend ratio when one employs the VAR model.

Banks are required to be compliant with all four constraints simultaneously. Our article provides a framework for banks to help their search for an optimal transition from Basel II to Basel III. Recognizing that banks' return and the four constraints are of linear type, this search can be formulated as a linear program and solved by standard software. Incorporating uncertainty on future defaults, risk weights and withdrawals and formulating the problem as a Chance constrained model does not only yield optimal transition strategies but also determines the internal thresholds for the Basel III-ratios. Our approach needs two standard inputs from controlling: profit margins per product and non-financial adjustment costs to expand or cut back business. The adjustment cost can be used to calibrate the model to the current business mix. This calibration can be done by bank outsiders and allows the model to be used in impact studies to replace ad hoc strategies. To highlight its practicality, we apply our model to a typical German bank with a business mix that complies with Basel II, but not with the Basel III-, capital-, leverage- and net stable funding-ratio. Assuming that its business model is optimal under Basel II, we find that this bank would achieve compliance restructuring its funding side by replacing interbank funding by capital and retail deposits. Additional uncertainty would amplify the magnitude of the changes, but would still affect the same positions. These findings are robust against alternative margin definitions and adjustment cost levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We use loan performance as a direct measure of portfolio risk as well as less direct market-based measures. Our results document that AIRB risk weights are highly correlated with loan performance and that, in contrast, Basel I risk weights are not. We find that capital requirements under the AIRB approach are higher than those under Basel I especially for portfolios recently under stress such as mortgages and some sovereign exposures. The alignment of Basel risk estimates with market-based risk indicators is less robust, although the association is nevertheless stronger under the AIRB approach. Our results support the view that internally generated risk weights are determined mostly by portfolio risk and, as a result, are substantially more risk sensitive than the fixed asset class based risk weights of Basel I.

There has also been a substantial fall in the variability of inflation. Many economists have conjectured that financial globalization contributed to the improved inflation performance. This paper explores the causal link running in the opposite direction. Using an open economy model with endogenous portfolio choice, it is shown that a monetary rule that reduces inflation variability tends to increase the size of gross external asset positions. This result appears to be robust across different modeling specifications.","[Devereux, Michael B.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Senay, Ozge; Sutherland, Alan] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland",University of British Columbia; University of St Andrews,"Devereux, MB (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",devm@interchange.ubc.ca; os12@st-and.ac.uk; ajs10@st-and.ac.uk,,"Senay, Ozge/0000-0002-8310-968X; Sutherland, Alan/0000-0002-0175-3886",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I024174/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,4,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We focus on start-ups for which a new idea (a new product, technology, production process, or management concept), which the founder developed during her work as an employee, was essential for setting up the new business. These firms are denoted corporate spin-offs. Using data from German start-ups founded in the period from 2005 to 2008, we apply nearest-neighbour propensity score matching. We find that corporate spin-offs outperform other start-ups founded by former employees of incumbent private firms that are not based on an essential idea in terms of post-entry innovation activities. However, we cannot show that corporate spin-offs benefit from the transferred idea in terms of employment growth.

According to the literature we find that market liquidity is impaired when stock markets decline, implying a positive relation between market and liquidity risk. Moreover, this relationship is the stronger the deeper one digs into the order book. Even more interestingly, this paper sheds further light on so far puzzling features of market liquidity: liquidity commonality and flight-to-quality. We show that liquidity commonality varies over time, increases during market downturns, peaks at major crisis events and becomes weaker the deeper we look into the limit order book. Consistent with recent theoretical models that argue for a spiral effect between the financial sector's funding liquidity and an asset's market liquidity, we find that funding liquidity tightness induces an increase in liquidity commonality which then leads to market-wide liquidity dry-ups. Therefore our findings corroborate the view that market liquidity can be a driving force for financial contagion. Finally, we show that there is a positive relationship between credit risk and liquidity risk, i.e., there is a spread between liquidity costs of high and low credit quality stocks, and that in times of increased market uncertainty the impact of credit risk on liquidity risk intensifies. This corroborates the existence of a flight-to-quality or flight-to-liquidity phenomenon also on the stock markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to significantly higher average returns for risky assets on announcement days, return patterns are much easier to reconcile with standard asset pricing theories, both cross-sectionally and over time. On such days, stock market beta is strongly related to average returns. This positive relation holds for individual stocks, for various test portfolios, and even for bonds and currencies, suggesting that beta is after all an important measure of systematic risk. Furthermore, a robust risk-return trade-off exists on announcement days. Expected variance is positively related to future aggregated quarterly announcement day returns, but not to aggregated non-announcement day returns.

Managers carrying high abnormal cash compensate for the low return on cash by making superior stock selection decisions, whereas less capable managers find abnormal cash costly and remain more fully invested in equities.

Using data for 314 GPTs from 18 Western European countries, we find that the announcements of GPTs generate a cumulative average abnormal return of about 22% and that pre-transaction shareholders on average receive a raw premium of about 36%. We further find that these shareholder wealth gains increase with the degree of separation of cash-flow and control rights of the pre-transaction ultimate owner and decrease with its ownership interests and with the presence of a second large shareholder. Taken together, these findings support the view that GPTs are expected to mitigate the inefficiencies induced by pre-transaction agency problems between controlling and minority shareholders. Thus, shareholder wealth gains from GPTs reflect the potential additional value that will be created under private ownership. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the benefits of a corporate environmental strategy are less clear in emerging (developing and transition) economies, where environmental regulations may be poorly enforced and social pressures to comply are weak. Thus it is important for business leaders, policymakers, and environmental activists to understand the causes and consequences of corporate environmental strategy in these economies so that they are able to implement effective strategies, develop useful policies, and promote meaningful activities, respectively. Drawing on both the theoretical and empirical literature, this article examines a broad array of drivers behind corporate environmental strategies including internal characteristics of firms, market pressures, and pressures from government and civil society. The empirical findings for developing economies (i.e., those whose physical and human resources, along with institutions, are still developing) suggest that government and civil society provide weak incentives for corporate environmental compliance, foreign ownership and foreign customer pressure improve environmental management practices, and information disclosure programs offer some promise for improving corporate environmental performance. The empirical findings for transition economies (i.e., those transitioning from reliance on the government's allocation of resources to market-based allocations) also suggest a positive, albeit weaker, role for foreign ownership and foreign customer pressure in improving firms' environmental performance. However, the findings also indicate that government policies, such as stricter enforcement, granting of permits, and higher rates for emission charges, are more effective in transition economies than in developing economies.","[Earnhart, Dietrich H.] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Inst Policy & Social Res, Ctr Econ Res & Grad Educ,Econ Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Energy Biosci Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Lyon, Thomas P.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Kansas; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Earnhart, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Inst Policy & Social Res, Ctr Econ Res & Grad Educ,Econ Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",Earnhart@ku.edu; khanna1@illinois.edu; tplyon@umich.edu,,,,,,,84,57,61,1,90,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

To explain this, researchers have favored essentialist explanations that attribute differences to core biological mechanisms and have tended to neglect psychological mechanisms that reflect the influence of culture and socialization. To better understand gender differences in risk tolerance, we investigated the relative effects of multiple psychological dimensions of gender, including gender identification (i.e., identifying as one's biological sex and viewing it as a positive part of the self), gender typicality (i.e., feeling like a typical member of one's biological sex), and gender-stereotyped personality traits and social roles. We also measured 2D:4D digit ratios as an indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure. Stereotypically masculine or instrumental personality traits (e.g., strong, acts as a leader) were associated with more risk tolerance in both men and women but were relatively more important for understanding men's risk tolerance. Stereotypically feminine or communal personality traits were associated with less risk tolerance in women. Women who identified more with other women, and men who identified less with other men showed greater risk tolerance. Digit ratio was not associated with risk tolerance. Further research focused on psychological gender and risk tolerance is emphasized. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I introduce cointegrating mixed data sampling regressions. I derive asymptotic limits under substantially more general conditions than the extant theoretical literature allows. In addition to the possibility of cointegrated series, I allow for regressors and an error term with general correlation patterns, both serially and mutually. The nonlinear least squares estimator still obtains consistency to the minimum mean-squared forecast error parameter vector, and the asymptotic distribution of the coefficient vector is Gaussian with a possibly singular variance. I propose a novel test of a MIDAS null against a more general and possibly infeasible alternative mixed-frequency specification.

The present study tries to elicit the existing distance characteristics using walking and cycling in terms of an acceptable trip distance. Household travel data of Bangalore city, for the year 2009, are used in the study. First, a description and a statistical analysis of the walking and cycling trip distance data across the subcategories of socio-demographic and regional factors is done. Secondly, an acceptable distance is computed from the cumulative trip length distribution based on the results of the statistical analysis. The socio-demographic and regional factors used in the study include purpose, age, gender, educational level, occupational status, and motor vehicle ownership. The major results include a significant difference between the mean trip distances on foot for the subcategories of variables such as gender, whether the respondent owned a private vehicle, and whether the trip was made inside the CBD. One of the major implications of this study pertains to requirement of a separate acceptable distance planning guideline for deciding the location aspect of settlements categorized on the ownership of vehicles.

In addition, they may channel interest payments through Dutch special purpose entities (SPEs) to avoid withholding taxes, a widely-used arbitrage strategy. Analysing the capital structure of large EU-based multinationals, this paper provides evidence that the use of Dutch-issuing SPEs is associated with higher debt financing relative to equity. Furthermore, it shows that EU subsidiaries of larger firms are more leveraged and that the use of Dutch on-lending SPEs is also associated with higher subsidiary leverage. Thus, the paper provides evidence that Dutch SPEs facilitate higher external debt financing as well as internal debt shifting. The findings indicate that withholding taxes on interest payments to entities outside the EU, determined by individual EU member states, are not very effective. The national tax systems of EU countries such as the Netherlands, which does not impose interest withholding tax, allow large firms to avoid those taxes.","Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Weyzig, F (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",fweyzig@yahoo.co.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,35,7,8,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We estimate the empirical relation with a panel Instrumental Variable Generalized Method of Moments (IV-GMM) estimator which allows for arbitrary heteroskedasticity and endogeneity. Decomposing private capital flows into its component parts, we find that foreign direct investment, foreign equity portfolio investment and private debt flows all have a negative impact on economic growth. Countries with strong domestic financial markets, however, benefit more by being able to transform the negative impact of private capital flows into a positive one. Private capital flows, thus, promote economic growth in the presence of strong domestic financial markets. These results suggest that strong financial markets are needed for private capital flows to impact economic growth positively. Our results are robust to the control of population size, savings, financial openness and institutional quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We consider two key markets, the stock exchange and the foreign exchange using daily data in the period 1992-2001. We present several notions of financial contagion as a significant change in volatility tail dependence (VTD) among different assets. To this end, we introduce a semiparametric VTD estimator in the framework of regularly varying strictly stationary time series. Our analysis provides mixed evidence with respect to the interdependence vs contagion dispute. Within-country contagion is more likely to hold than across-country contagion. Because the latter is typically symmetric, contagion in stocks and foreign exchange coincide, in line with portfolio rebalancing arguments. Across-market contagion supports the wake up call argument of loss of confidence, as small countries' currency markets affect contagiously the stock markets of the larger economies.","[Karmann, Alexander] Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Monetary Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Herrera, Rodrigo] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Talca, Chile",Technische Universitat Dresden; Universidad de Talca,"Herrera, R (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Ave Lircay S-N, Talca, Chile.",rodriherrera@utalca.cl,"Herrera, Rodrigo/AAL-9467-2021; Herrera, Rodrigo/GXV-4743-2022","Herrera, Rodrigo/0000-0002-4604-0396; Herrera, Rodrigo/0000-0002-4604-0396",,,,,33,3,3,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

With the growing importance of logistics and supply chain economics for many industrial and business activities, firms organizing their industrial activities and locating their warehousing and operational centers increasingly must consider the availability, quality, and cost of a range of transportation services, particularly in connection with essential intermodal activities. Accordingly, development of major logistics parks in conjunction with major intermodal hubs has become an important element in the overall industrial economy, predicated on the notion that robust freight activity is a good indicator of demand for industrial space. In this study, using regression techniques, we examine the relationship between freight transportation activity and industrial space demand at the metropolitan area level. The results confirm this relationship, reflecting significant statistical association between higher levels of freight traffic and higher levels of industrial space demand. This relationship is more pronounced in inland versus port markets. In addition, the data reveal that there was a shock to industrial space demand in 2001, thereby altering the structural relationship between demand and the drivers of demand. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that listed companies that have been incompletely restructured from former state-owned enterprises and in sound financial condition tend to exchange higher quality assets for lower quality assets (i.e., tunneling). However, when there is a need to avoid reporting a loss and to raise additional capital, listed companies tend to exchange lower quality assets for higher quality assets (i.e., propping). We also find that the market reacts indifferently to asset exchange announcements. Finally, we find asset exchanges motivated by a tunneling (propping) incentive to be associated with poorer (improved) post-exchange stock performance and financial performance. In summary, this study contributes to the corporate asset literature by providing two new incentives: tunneling and propping. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We account for the dividend imputation scheme employed by various countries at different periods of time. In this paper it is argued that the heavier is domestic taxation of domestic dividend income, the more attractive is foreign investment to domestic agents. Dividend imputation eliminates the double taxation of domestic income, reduces the effective tax rate on domestic investment and makes investment in foreign securities less attractive. A fall of 10% in effective tax rate on domestic dividend income reduces foreign equity investment by about 5%. Domestic investors who are paid dividends under a dividend imputation system receive a credit for the tax paid at the company level and this reduces the effective tax rate. Cross-border equity investment is increased if tax credit rises for taxes paid overseas. Empirical analysis is based on bilateral investments among 23 mature economies over 2001-2011.

The period starts after implementation of the comprehensive reform in the banking sector and lasts until culmination of the global financial crisis. The concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index are applied to measure level of concentration. We found the banking sector to be almost non-concentrated with exemption of deposit market where we revealed a slight concentration. However, there is a clear trend of increasing concentration at all segments of the Turkish banking sector over the analysed period. The Panzar-Rosse model is used for estimation of competitive conditions in the banking market. Specifically, we use a panel with data for most of the Turkish banks to estimate the H statistics. We concluded that the Turkish banking sector can be characterized as an industry with monopolistic competition that closely approaches monopoly. The results imply that banks in Turkey do not operate in a competitive environment and enjoy monopoly rents. Moreover, we revealed decreasing level of competition during the entire period of estimation.

In theory, CDO equity should be similar in nature to bank stock since both represent residual claims on a portfolio of loans. We find CDO equity returns are much more related to stock returns than to fixed-income returns. CDO equity returns track the returns of financial stocks much more closely than any other industry. Nearly two-thirds of the variation in CDO returns can be explained by fundamentals.","[Longstaff, Francis A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Myers, Brett W.] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Longstaff, FA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, 110 Westwood Plz,Box 951481, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",francis.longstaff@anderson.ucla.edu; brett.myers@ttu.edu,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Our analyses suggest that a rail transit service coverage boundary of 500 m provides the best fit for estimating rail transit ridership levels. With regard to land use, our results confirm that density is positively related to rail transit ridership within a 750 m radius of each station. In contrast, land use diversity is not associated with rail transit ridership. We also found that station-level accessibility is as important as land use for explaining rail transit ridership levels. Finally, we conclude that development density and station-level accessibility measures such as the number of station entrances or exits and the number of bus routes at the station are the most important and consistent factors for promoting rail transit ridership.

Such risk contagion was caused by enormous changes in interest rates. Although risk contagion has been investigated by several literatures, the magnitude of propagated interest rate risk around global financial markets remains unexplored. Therefore, this study quantifies the degree to which the increased credit risk within the US financial system propagated to the European markets' liquidity risks. Specifically, using a conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) model, we quantitatively measure interest rate risk of a European country, by looking at the upside risk in distribution of changes in interest rate. And such propagation risk measure considers additional value-at-risk conditional on the interest rate movements in the US. The results show significantly positive differences between European country's value-at-risk conditional on the US financial markets being in a normal or distressed state. This propagating effect increased from 2007, and was particularly pronounced in the 2008-2009. In addition, the interest rate risk contagion is especially severe for some countries in the Euro regions with greater sovereign debt problems. Hence our result foretells the deterioration of the European sovereign debt crisis which started to unfold in 2010. Our work supplements the literature by successfully quantifying the magnitude of additional interest rate risk conditional on risk exposure from external sectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To the extent that regulation functions as a fixed cost, it should lead to larger firm size. However, regulations may also lead to smaller establishments with firms outsourcing regulated activities or staying small to take advantage of state exemptions for small businesses from regulations. We empirically examine the relationship between the size distribution of establishments and the level of regulation using state- and industry-level panel data from 1992 to 2004. Our results suggest that regulation decreases the proportion of zero employee and 1-4 employee establishments. The proportion of establishments in the 5-9 employee range generally increases with the level of regulation. Thus, regulation appears to operate as a fixed cost causing establishments to be larger.","[Calcagno, Peter T.] Coll Charleston, Dept Econ & Finance, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Sobel, Russell S.] The Citadel, Sch Business Adm, Charleston, SC 29409 USA",College of Charleston,"Sobel, RS (通讯作者)，The Citadel, Sch Business Adm, Charleston, SC 29409 USA.",calcagnop@cofc.edu; russell.sobel@citadel.edu,,"Sobel, Russell/0000-0001-6820-5414; Calcagno, Peter/0000-0002-8440-0188",,,,,32,24,24,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

These semiparametric approaches generally involve two steps: the first step that incorporate an initial estimate of the model parameter to produce a residual sample, and the second step that uses the residuals to estimate the likelihood, which is subsequently maximized to obtain the final estimate of the model parameter. Therefore, the characteristics of the initial input estimator may be carried over to the final semiparametric estimator, and the performance of the semiparametric estimator will be impaired if the input estimate is deficient. In this article we have studied a one-step semiparametric estimator where no initial input is necessary. The estimation procedure is illustrated via a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. Asymptotic properties of the estimator are established, and finite sample performance of the estimator is evaluated via simulation. The results suggest that the proposed one-step semiparametric estimator avoids significant drawbacks of its two-step counterparts.","[Di, Jianing; Gangopadhyay, Ashis] Boston Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Di, JN (通讯作者)，3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",jdi@its.jnj.com,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

They are in relation to improved bias-correction, stationarity-correction, and the use of matrix formulae for bias-correction and covariance matrix estimation. The improved ARM parameter estimators are unbiased to the order of n(-1), and always satisfy the condition of stationarity. With the matrix formulae, the improved ARM can easily be implemented for a high order model with multiple predictors. From an extensive Monte Carlo experiment, it is found that the improved ARM delivers substantial gain in parameter estimation, statistical inference, and out-of-sample forecasting in small samples. As an application, the improved ARM is applied to monthly US stock return data to evaluate the predictive power of dividend yield in univariate and bivariate predictive models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A key contribution of our paper is to demonstrate how one can obtain a closed-form solution to the consumption-sharing rule for agents who have both heterogeneous priors and heterogeneous preferences without restricting the risk aversion of the two agents to special values. We solve in closed form also for the state-price density, the risk-free interest rate and market price of risk, the stock price, equity risk premium, and volatility of stock returns, the term structure of interest rates, and the conditions necessary to obtain a stationary equilibrium in which both agents survive in the long run. The methodology we develop is sufficiently general in that, as long as markets are complete, it can be used to obtain the sharing rule and state prices for models set in discrete or continuous time and for arbitrary endowment and belief updating processes.","[Bhamra, Harjoat S.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Bhamra, Harjoat S.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Uppal, Raman] Edhec Business Sch, Roubaix, France",University of British Columbia; Imperial College London; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Bhamra, HS (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",h.bhamra@imperial.ac.uk,,"Uppal, Raman/0000-0001-9428-147X",,,,,78,78,88,1,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

From a standard model of bank production that does not control for any TBTF factors, we find evidence of scale economies for our sample of large banks. We then control for TBTF factors by using a measure of the implicit subsidy that emerges from a reduction in TBTF banks' funding costs due to investor expectations of government support. We do this in two ways: first, we estimate scale economies from an augmented model of bank production that employs a proxy for the counterfactual price of debt that banks would face in the absence of any TBTF funding cost advantage; second, we estimate scale economies from a model of bank production that is estimated only for a sample of banks considered unlikely to be TBTF. After controlling for TBTF factors using either method, we no longer find evidence of scale economies for our sample of large banks.

Global ports of Northern Range and Marseilles serve a large number of overseas regions (forelands) and secondary ports mainly serve niche markets. In this paper we demonstrate that global ports serve also larger hinterlands, but their prominence over secondary ports depends on the types of cargo handled. The results of our spatial interaction model demonstrate that most of types of cargo flows are strongly constrained by distance. This indicates that, despite a deep transformation on forelands, the secondary ports subsist because they partly depend on niche markets and largely on local economies generating substantial amounts of non-containerized cargo flows. Some implications of this finding are explained. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We formally include psychological drivers in this model. These drivers affect individual behavior, such as risk aversion, together with appreciation of public expenditure, expectations about peers' compliance and a natural inclination to comply, all of which we summarize in a quality termed citizenship. The enforcement system, based on random inspections, is standard and only partially known to agents. The agent-based model is simulated under a variety of settings, representing different societies. We use the artificial data produced by the model to estimate the effects of taxpayers' traits on personal tax behavior and to build a compliance societal slippery slope. At the individual level, we find a positive dependence of compliance on all variables, with the significant exception of the tax rate, which has a negative impact. As far as societies are concerned, we show how aggregate tax compliance depends on composite indices of citizenship and power, and we find that the former is more important than the latter.

The results of the second model show that the consumer trust also has a significant effect on virtual brand loyalty (dependent variable). Model 3 was developed by including consumer perception of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and consumer trust as independent predictor variables and virtual brand loyalty as the mediator variable with the specific intention to determine whether the effects of consumer perception of CSR on virtual brand loyalty became insignificant or less significant.

A large database consisting of information from 3,180 households in eight provinces from south to north is used to explore factors correlated with more strongly perceived tenure security and determinants of forest-related investment. The study adds to the limited research testing whether there is endogenous causality between investment and tenure security in forestland, and finds that investment was not undertaken to enhance tenure security. In addition, the data allow for differentiation between perceived tenure security and contracted use and transferability rights. Overall, stronger contracted rights were found to affect investment. China's forest tenure reform - where individual households can manage forestland, empowered by legal certification and stronger contract rights - has thus enhanced tenure security and encouraged forest investment.","[Yi, Yuanyuan; Kohlin, Gunnar] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-41124 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Xu, Jintao] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jintao] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; Peking University; Peking University,"Yi, YY (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Room L-212,Bldg L,Vasagatan 1, S-41124 Gothenburg, Sweden.",yuanyuan.yi@economics.gu.se; gunnar.kohlin@economics.gu.se; xujt@pku.edu.cn,"Kohlin, Gunnar/AAK-7797-2021","Kohlin, Gunnar/0000-0002-4387-7561; Xu, Jintao/0000-0001-5588-2942; Yi, Yuanyuan/0000-0003-4599-5227",,,,,23,48,60,6,58,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The intrinsically uncertain, unstructured, and often tacit nature of facilities layout design preferences and constraints necessitates the use of domain experts in the fitness evaluation of layout alternatives. However, unavailability of domain experts in a timely or economical fashion highlights the need for resorting to the use of automation in this important area. To test the key novel component of the proposed approach, a variety of artificial neural networks are trained on a large data set containing both qualitative and quantitative fitness of layout alternatives and subjective ranking by a domain expert utilizing the knowledge of the application domain. Simulation results strongly support the viability of the proposed concept. Such an automated approach to fitness evaluations of layout alternatives is expected to significantly improve the efficacy and efficiency of the facilities layout planning process. Furthermore, such an approach would spur the much sought for research in decision support and expert systems in layout planning.","[Ahmad, Abdul-Rahim] Umm Al Qura Univ, Dept Business Adm, Mecca, Saudi Arabia; [Tasadduq, Imran A.] Umm Al Qura Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Mecca, Saudi Arabia; [Imam, M.

If this statement is true, then this system may provide a cushion against potential losses resulting from probable future financial crises. In this article, we make use of heteroscedasticity-robust linear Granger causality and nonlinear Granger causality tests to examine the links between the Islamic and global conventional stock markets, and between the Islamic stock market and several global economic and financial shocks. Our findings reveal evidence of significant linear and nonlinear causality between the Islamic and conventional stock markets but more strongly from the Islamic stock market to the other markets. They also show potent causality between the Islamic stock market and financial and risk factors. This evidence leads to the rejection of the hypothesis of decoupling of the Islamic market from their conventional counterparts, thereby reduces the portfolio benefits from diversification with Sharia-based markets. A striking result shows a connection between the Islamic stock market and interest rates and interest-bearing securities, which is inconsistent with the Sharia rules. The results also suggest that modeling Islamic stock markets should be done within a nonlinear VAR system and not through a regression equation.

The aim of this study is to develop a conceptual model to understand what is required to achieve the organisational innovation capability, such as: socio-technical enablers (STF); diffusion of innovation (DOT) dimensions; knowledge-sharing processes (KSP); and organisational innovation capability (OIC). This study demonstrates the extent to which socio-technical enablers combine with the dimensions of the diffusion of innovation to result in processes of knowledge-sharing.

For this purpose we assume that volatility is multiplicatively decomposed into a conditional and an unconditional component as in Amado and Terasvirta (2012, 2013). The latter component is modelled such that the unconditional time-varying component evolves slowly over time. Statistical inference is used for specifying the parameterization of the time-varying component by applying a sequence of Lagrange multiplier tests. The model building procedure is illustrated with an application to 22,986 daily returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index covering a period of more than ninety years. The main conclusions are as follows. First, the LM tests strongly reject the assumption of constancy of the unconditional variance. Second, the results show that the apparent long memory property in volatility may be interpreted as changes in the unconditional variance of the long series. Finally, based on a formal statistical test we find evidence of the superiority of volatility forecasting accuracy of the new model over the GJR-GARCH model at all horizons for eight subsets of the long return series.

In three laboratory experiments employing undergraduates we apply this perspective to investigate factors that prevent herd influence that would lead to inaccurate predictions of stock prices. In Experiment 1, we show that an economic reward for making the same predictions as the herd increases the influence of a majority but not the influence of a minority, and that an individual economic reward for making accurate predictions reduces the influence of the majority. In Experiment 2, we show a reduced influence of a majority herd's inaccurate predictions when requiring assessments of the accuracy of the majority herd's predictions as compared to requiring judgments of their consistency. Experiment 3 shows that a lower volatility of stock prices reduces the influence of a majority herd's inaccurate predictions.","[Andersson, Maria; Hedesstrom, Martin; Garling, Tommy] Univ Gothenburg, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Gärling, T (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Ctr Finance, Box 500, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",tommy.garling@psy.gu.se,,"Hedesstrom, Martin/0000-0002-7377-4715",,,,,50,15,18,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

From a survey run by IBM in 2008 it was concluded that Chief Executive Officers from many corporations feel the need to adopt their business models and even to undertake larger changes as a result. Most financial analysts or academics take the music industry as a prime example of failure to innovate its core business model, especially in this troubled crisis period. There are many other industries where failure to innovate its core business lead to their decline. One of the biggest calamities of the current recession is the fall of the once highly regarded (and onetime fourth-largest) Wall Street investment firm Lehman Brothers Holdings, which was forced to file for bankruptcy protection few years ago. Not many years ago another giant WorldCom second biggest long distance phone company in the US filed for bankruptcy burning 107 billion USD of assets. It is claimed that the financial crisis is the reason. But, is the financial crisis the only reason for failure? The reality shows that the business models and crisis management provisions have lost their role. The aim of this article is to present the rationale on the need of investing in innovative business models as the literature tells and run a comparative study using data from two or three big corporations in order to show how innovative business models can help the management to take the right decisions when dealing with crisis situations. The main result and conclusion of this article is to show that the failure of many corporations is not created by the crisis alone, but because the management did not innovate its business model.

At the same time donors are targeted by a pressing good-cause related marketing and the competition for resources is particularly keen. Not-for-profits like USA Universities are then confronted with different marketing tools: some of them are typical of for-profits and concern customers, their segmentation and their purchasing-power exploitation; some are, instead, typical of not-for-profits and aim to gain propensity and trustworthiness of donors. The economic and marketing literature counts several contributions about the implementation of marketing, fundraising, investing and other miscellaneous strategies whose final aim is the revenue maximization. From draft application to mature strategies, marketing is exploited by the 'cultural entrepreneur' who copes with the eternal trade-off between cultural-artistic purposes and an efficient allocation of resources. As a matter of fact, inside of the organization the competition between marketing experts and fundraisers for the allocation of budget and resources is increasing. The paper's research goal is to investigate the revenue diversification in USA Universities, referring to 2012's data of IRS Forms with the highest 2012 revenues. The cluster analysis gives evidence that the highest gain is the result of the implementation of revenue diversification for hybrid profiles. The most crowded cluster is the Marketing Expert with the second highest gain. Focused on revenue-maximization, USA universities are surviving thanks to an efficient resource allocation in marketing, fundraising and other financing strategies. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In the aftermath analytical reviews evaluate both success and failure to reflexively improve relief outcomes in future aid deployments. Both activities tend to concentrate on the experiences of key individuals in major organisations associated with disaster recovery and reconstruction. Little consideration is given to the influence of the non-human aid they deploy beyond the recognition that they are vital and necessary. Similarly, government and NGO policies and procedures are regarded as the mechanisms by which aid is distributed. None of this is counterintuitive or surprising, yet there may be another dimension. Actor Network Theory (ANT) was conceived as a problem-solving action research tool predicated upon the notion that non-human actants can play an equal role in problems, and while ANT has previously been utilised in monthly to consider the challenges faced when integrating high-level technology systems with humans this paper speculates that the technique could also reveal useful insights during disaster recovery and reconstruction. This paper uses a detailed case study to suggest that a) nonhuman actants in disaster contexts may exert influences that were not foreseen when they were deployed, and that b) human actants may exert unintended influences: critically these actants include researchers and reporters. The research concludes that ANT principles have the potential to surface new perspectives in complex post-disaster contexts, but that the conduct of a purist ANT investigation would be highly problematic and potentially disruptive to the reconstruction process.

This paper considering contagion as a change in the transmission mechanism of shock clarifies comovement among the sovereign credit default swap (CDS) markets of seven European countries and UK from November 2008 to June 2013. By examining daily pricing data of the five-year sovereign CDS contracts of those countries, I found the large increase in the volatility in the crisis period and hence a correlation test's invalidation but a potential application of both parametric method with GARCH structure applicable to the time series' residuals and quantile regression approach. The first test modelling time series' residuals by GARCH formula shows little impact of significant nonlinear terms or no contagion. In the second method, slope equality tests analyse the stability in linear relationship among markets across quantile and find no evidence of contagion. This final result of no contagion during the debt crisis suggests that the reason of the sovereign risk's propagation is the conventional interdependence among countries, not the greatness of the shock.","[Duong Thi Hieu] PricewaterhouseCoopers Vietnam, Hanoi, Vietnam",,,hieudt.sec@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,3,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,135,152,,,,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200010,0

Newly available data on border measures and behind-the-border measures (for example, bailouts and subsidies) implemented through April 2010 are matched to monthly 4-digit bilateral trade data using a first-differenced gravity equation. The estimation strategy exploits within-product variation and utilizes extensive time-varying fixed effects and duad/tetrad ratio estimation to isolate as far as possible the impact of protectionist measures from that of other factors to estimate trade policy impacts. The estimates suggest that trade in country pairs subject to new border measures decreased by 5-8 percent relative to trade in the same product among pairs not subject to new measures. Identification of trade impacts of behind-the-border measures proves to be considerably more challenging, but, also for these measures, evidence points toward a negative impact, possibly of roughly the same magnitude. These results imply a decline in global trade of about 0.2 percent on account of crisis protectionism.","[Henn, Christian] World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [McDonald, Brad] US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC USA",World Trade Organization; United States Department of the Treasury,"Henn, C (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,"Henn, Christian/0000-0001-8438-2752",,,,,61,12,14,2,18,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Thus, the Korea Core Industrial Technology Investment Association (KITIA) was established to implement a matching fund program (MFP) to help SMEs with this undertaking. Applicant firms to the MFP are reviewed first based on their technology levels and are required to attract financing from venture capitalists (VCs), before receiving funds from the MFP. This paper, based on KITIAs MFP applicant data from 2001 to 2004, evaluates the performance of the MFP in terms of the success rate of funded SMEs' initial public offerings (IPOs) and bankruptcy rates in relation to those SMEs that could not attract matching funds. Propensity score matching was used to eliminate selection bias from the data in order to assess the actual treatment effect of the MFP. According to the result of logistic regression applied to the matched data, MFP apparently did not have significant effects on IPO success and bankruptcy. This implies that MFP needs to allow VCs more time to evaluate SMEs covering qualitative aspects as well. It is expected that this change of structure can provide better performance of MFP in terms of IPO success and bankruptcy of matched SMEs.","[Heo, In Seok; Sohn, So Young; Ji, Eun Jeong] Yonsei Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Sohn, SY (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, 134 Shinchon Dong, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",sohns@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,44,2,5,1,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper argues that tight budget constraints make reform harder by introducing an information problem. Governments are uncertain about bureaucratic departments' effectiveness. Normally, effective departments can be identified by increasing their budget, since they can use the increase to produce more than ineffective departments can. When budgets must be cut, however, ineffective departments can mimic effective ones by reducing their output. Budget cuts thus harm both short-run productive efficiency, and long-run allocative efficiency. I confirm these predictions in a US dataset. Low marginal productivity bureaucracies reduce output by more than expected in response to a budget cut, and budget setters respond less to observed short-run marginal productivity after cutback years.","Univ Warwick, Ctr Competit Adv Global Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Hugh-Jones, D (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Ctr Competit Adv Global Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",D.Hugh-Jones@warwick.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,16,4,4,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2014,158.0,1-2,,,,,209,220,,10.1007/s11127-012-0002-5,0.0,,,12,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AA3FZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330979600016,0

For a long time, sustainability was an important but specialized issue. The sustainability of an enterprise is always defined by future events, and the future is always uncertain. Sustainability Management integrates management concept in a sustainable setting. It is difficult to define a reference model for sustainable management. Therefore a holistic approach to enterprise sustainability management becomes emergent. Enterprise Sustainability Management (EMS) integrates the necessary components of sustainable development in business processes. EMS touches every area of the value chain: including product development, purchasing, sales, customer service, and others. EMS ensures sustainable enterprise development that meets not only their business needs, but also highlights the life and durability of the system in which it works. Thus, the sustainability management will change the competitive landscape of the enterprise in the manner in which firms develop and use resources, capabilities and competencies. It becomes imperative for the enterprise that the corporate success is directly proportional to the sustainable development. Each organization defines its own system with its own leadership and its sustainable development model. Therefore, developing a model of enterprise sustainability becomes emergent. This model incorporates three basic pillars: knowledge management, risk management and leadership. The paper explores a model of sustainable enterprise development, current approaches of sustainability, directions and keys drivers. European Union directions are moving towards creating a balanced environment in which the enterprise to work and in which the future companies are able to develop their own activity.","[Izvercian, Monica; Ivascu, Larisa; Potra, Sabina] Politehn Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",Polytechnic University of Timisoara,"Izvercian, M (通讯作者)，Politehn Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania.",monica.izvercianu@upt.ro; larisa.ivascu@upt.ro; sabina.potra@upt.ro,"YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/F-1270-2019; Potra, Sabina/AAD-2754-2020; IVASCU, Larisa/E-5644-2016","YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/0000-0001-5240-1023; Potra, Sabina/0000-0001-9225-7003; IVASCU, Larisa/0000-0003-1506-5467",,,,,24,9,9,0,12,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,440,449,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300047,0

Traditional firm-centric strategies need to be complemented by the network-based strategies since increasingly competition occurs between networks replacing competition between companies.

The consequence of this, among other things, is the growing number of projects which emerge and are carried out in all business systems around the world. With the growing number of projects, there arose the need for trained project managers. In order to successfully do their tasks, it is very important for project managers to know and understand various techniques and methods of project management. The rate at which the number of formally trained project managers is growing and the dynamics of their adaptation to the specificities of today's business environment is still insufficient. Development of user-friendly IT support tools which would enable project managers to successfully implement projects without previous very long and intense project training imposes itself as a possible and increasingly available solution to the above mention problem. The development of IT technology and software increased enormously in the last decade. The emergence of Web 2.0 technology finds new solutions, very useful and applicable also in the field of project management. These options are currently still underutilized by companies when dealing with projects. Capabilities of existing and emerging solutions of Web 2.0 development and the open source community create important value and the potential to increase the efficiency of project management. The emergence of the Semantic Web (Web 3.0) currently being developed and implemented, with its innovations and technologies based on semantic and artificial intelligence, is expected to greatly change the present concepts of doing business. In the paper we will analyze the importance and possibilities arising from new web technologies (especially Web 2.0 and Web 3.0) when dealing with project management issues.","[Jurina, Kresimir; Barilovic, Zlatko] Coll Business Adm Baltazar Adam Krcelic, Zagreb, Croatia; [Vrecko, Igor] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Project Management, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,,kresimir.jurina@vspu.hr; igor.vrecko@uni-mb.si; zlatko.barilovic@vspu.hr,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,9,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,69,76,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000006,0

We aim to clarify potential differences in forecasting economic activity during periods of steady growth and economic turbulence. Design/methodology/approach - The out-of-sample forecasting analysis is conducted recursively for two different time periods: the steady growth period from 2004: 1 to 2007: 4 and the financial crisis period from 2008: 1 to 2011:2. Findings - Our results from Finland suggest that the proper choice of forecasting variables relates to general economic conditions. During steady economic growth, the preferable financial indicator is the short-term interest rate combined with past growth. However, during economic turbulence, the traditional term spread and stock returns are more important in forecasting GDP growth. Research limitations/implications - The results highlight the importance of long-term interest rates in determining the level of the term spread when the central bank implements a zero interest rate policy. Moreover, during economic turbulence, stock markets are able to signal the expected effects of unconventional monetary policy on GDP growth.","[Kuosmanen, Petri; Vataja, Juuso] Univ Vaasa, Dept Econ, FIN-65101 Vaasa, Finland",University of Vaasa,"Kuosmanen, P (通讯作者)，Univ Vaasa, Dept Econ, FIN-65101 Vaasa, Finland.",jpv@uwasa.fi,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78350-756-6; 978-1-78350-755-9,INT SYMP EC,,,2014,23.0,,,,,,217,234,,10.1108/S1571-038620140000023008,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358526100008,0

We found empirical evidence that macroeconomic surprises, domestic (Brazilian) and external (U.S. American), which lead the market to believe that there might be a higher risk of inflation or an overheated economy, raise nominal interest rates, implicit expected inflation and real interest rates. Surprisingly, in relation to the efficient-market hypothesis, we found that some macroeconomic surprises have a lagged effect on the yield curves.

By examining 52 selected papers, the study specifically attempts to systematize the existing literature, explore key emerging themes and recent developments, identify research gaps, and suggest potential areas for future research. As a result, 'coming out', 'wage inequality', 'GLBT employee groups', 'the effects of GLBT (non) discrimination on the workplace and business outcomes' were identified as the major themes of the current review.

Education in disaster resilience is of great importance for administrators forming policies and planning disaster response, managing post disaster actions and performing risk and vulnerability assessments. This paper presents the results from a study aimed to explore, analyse, compare and describe disaster resilience related higher education programmes in Europe in order to establish the existing capacity among European Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) to address the threats posed by hazards of natural and human origin.

The paper first examines the critical determinants not only to overall international bank lending but also to cross-border bank lending, and find that cross-border lending by international banks tend to pull out from host economies during difficult times in source economies, whereas such retrenchments are not evident on the basis of overall lending. The paper next examines the differences between subsidiaries and branches of international banks in their ability to shield themselves from the financial difficulties of their global parent banks and thus their ability to continue lending in destination markets. The results show that foreign bank subsidiaries are more capable in this regard. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A recent feature of the last years, specific to the business world and not only, is the concept of performance. Organizations are increasingly faced with unexpected challenges that require very competent management situations. This places an emphasis on achieving performance in all areas. Organizations are continually concerned either to achieve performance or to maintain performance or to improve performance or to measure the performance obtained. In this way, a new management discipline is created: Identifying and measuring performance. We strongly believe, as research economists, that the future of any type of society including the Romanian one stands in its on-going power to improve itself and better anticipate the need of business organizations. Moreover, the new global economy, characterized by economic liberalization, globalization, constant competition, the transition from industrial economy to knowledge economy information and knowledge, the social and environmental restrictions, the constant need of sustainable development, the global financial and economic crisis have altered the requirements directed to various business entities and diversify their responsibilities to all categories of holders of interest to the society as a whole. In this new economic system, companies can also be seen as cells that depend on the health of the body as a whole. Therefore, we cannot speak of the viability of a company in a competitive environment, which is unstable and turbulent, without taking into account the importance of performance. Performance is the only reliable source that can truly ensure the competitive advantage of any nation and excellence represents the key element in the competitive advantage and also in the competitive intelligence process of well functional and well developed business organizations. Our study starts with an introduction in which we presented the place of excellence as well as the main triggers that generate performance in a business organization; we continued with a literature review in which we presented the opinions that academics, researchers and specialists have regarding excellence and performance and their importance; we identified what does measuring performance in the context of the new global economy means; we emphasized the role of the organizational performance as well as the need of knowing and using performance indicators; we provided some guidelines and trends to improve organizational processes management on the road to excellence, starting from the quality control to total quality management and also the total quality management to managerial excellence; we focused on a case study of the Romanian's society in terms of excellence in business organizations, in nowadays turbulent moments generated by the global economic crisis.","[Popescu, Cristina Raluca] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Popescu, Veronica Adriana] Commercial Acad Satu Mare, Satu Mare, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Popescu, CR (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",popescu_cr@yahoo.com; popescu_va@yahoo.com,"Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh./T-8658-2019","Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh./0000-0002-5876-0550",,,,,21,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,2368,2380,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300237,0

This organism already has five functional and complete organs which are quiet capable to perform their specific tasks. These organs include: (1) operational organ (palm-oil producer, local university, local research institute), (2) coordinator organ (business culture), (3) controller organ (business culture and the government), (4) planner/ intelligence organ (the government), and (5) policy organ (brain) (the government). However, this organism faces too much of the government domination (acts as controller, planner and brain of the innovation system at the same time) which possibly hinders other organs (the business actors them self, the market and the business association) to more independently and significantly perform. Furthermore, as an autonomous body, the system is divided into two big groups of organ which work somehow disconnectedly. Those two groups are machines organs (which consist of industry, research institute and university) and think-thank organs (which consist of the government). Hence, the system could not efficiently and effectively perform. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Social responsibility is an extensive topic, but also a part of the organizational culture of the company. In this context, top management objectives should target to maximize the positive impact, which the company has on society, and to minimize the negative effects.

Due to supply shortage of the right quality milk, most processing facilities operate at 50% to 60% of their capacity. In such an operating environment, Hiruth has managed to create and grow her business at a rapid pace.

This article reviews the central issues surrounding the role bank capital plays in financial stability. Because the socially efficient capital level may exceed banks' privately optimal capital levels, regulatory capital requirements become germane. But such requirements may entail various bank-level and social costs. Thus, despite agreement that higher capital would enhance banking stability, recognition of these costs has generated theoretical disagreement over whether capital requirements should be higher. Empirical evidence reveals that, in the cross section of banks, higher capital is associated with higher lending, higher liquidity creation, higher bank values, and higher probabilities of surviving crises. Moreover, increases in capital requirements are met with modest declines in lending. The overarching message from research is that lower capital in banking leads to higher systemic risk and a higher probability of a government-funded bailout that may elevate government debt and trigger a sovereign debt crisis. Thus, capital regulation reform, as well as tax policy, should seek to increase bank capital. This article discusses the contemporary thinking on these issues and concludes with open research questions.","Washington Univ, John M Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Thakor, AV (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, John M Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",thakor@wustl.edu,,,,,,,136,90,101,1,46,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4806-9,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

In this context, this study aims at performing an econometric analysis of the credit expansion process and social welfare from a comparative perspective, with a focus on ten developing and advanced economies from the area of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe (including Romania). The purpose is to better understand the real impact of the credit expansion process on social welfare. The usefulness of the present study becomes higher given the fact that nowadays the socio-economic development is often assisted by a stronger and more acute crisis.

We make new, consistent estimates of expenditure inequality for 1993-2013, using several measures that draw on household expenditure data from the National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas) for 1993-2013. In doing so, we note that the central statistics agency, Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS), used grouped data for its estimates of inequality until 2009 and that this underestimated inequality up to then. Thus the rise in inequality reported since 2009 actually has a longer history. We argue that Indonesia experienced divergence and convergence at the same time: the magnitude of the rise in inequality was significant (divergence), but the rise was greatest in provinces or districts with low initial levels of inequality (convergence). We consider the literature on drivers of changes in inequality and identify a set of hypotheses, with an empirical basis, which we introduce as potential Indonesian-specific drivers of rising inequality for future exploration.","[Yusuf, Arief Anshory; Rum, Irlan Adiyatma] Padjadjaran State Univ, Jatinangor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Sumner, Andy] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England",Universitas Padjadjaran; University of London; King's College London,"Yusuf, AA (通讯作者)，Padjadjaran State Univ, Jatinangor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia.",,"Rum, Irlan Adiyatma/GRY-3564-2022; Yusuf, Arief Anshory/AAA-5839-2020","Rum, Irlan Adiyatma/0000-0003-0301-4953; Yusuf, Arief Anshory/0000-0002-3126-3853; Sumner, Andy/0000-0002-8995-7065",,,,,28,47,50,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Building on dynamic capability lens, we conceptualize innovation ambidexterity as a dynamic and nested phenomenon that requires balancing exploitation and exploration in several levels of organization. At an individual level of analysis, ambidexterity requires higher cognitive (creativity, open mind, clear intent) and social (connectedness, clear vision, self-confidence) capabilities. Those capabilities make individuals able to juggle contradictory logics of action with a higher dexterity and decide how and when switching between them. Team ambidexterity arises from collaboration, freedom and independence between individuals. Self-regulation of actions at team level is strongly related to changing leadership roles.

Existing evidence for developed countries shows that the self-employed report higher job satisfaction than the employed. The evidence, however, is less conclusive in terms of life-satisfaction. Moreover, for Latin American countries, the evidence shows that self-employed individuals report lower life-satisfaction than employed individuals do. To clarify the effect of self-employment on satisfaction, we use the Latinobarometro survey 2007 for eighteen Latin American and Caribbean countries, considering the category self-employment as a heterogeneous category. Additionally, we control for the distinction between necessity and opportunity self-employed. Contrary to existing evidence, we find that not all self-employed individuals are more satisfied than employed individuals. Specifically, we find evidence revealing that, compared to workers in paid employment: (i) selfemployed professionals are more satisfied than the employed only with their incomes; (ii) business owners are more satisfied with their lives, income and job; (iii) self-employed famers and fisherman are less satisfied with their jobs and income; and (iv) precarious self-employed workers are as satisfied as the employed with their life but less with job, and for household income results are not conclusive.

This paper argues that board ability is also important. Corporate boards are reluctant to replace CEOs, as this makes financing expensive by sending a negative signal about board ability. Entrenchment in this model does not result from CEO power, or from agency problems. Entrenchment is mitigated when there are more assets-in-place relative to investment opportunities. The paper also compares public and private equity. Private ownership eliminates CEO entrenchment, but market signals improve investment decisions. Finally, the model implies that board choice in publicly listed firms will be conservative. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This impact is shown to have been everywhere significantly negative. The fact that our model fully explains the 'bond yield conundrum' gives support to the hypothesis that the US CDO market was rapidly expanded before 2007 chiefly to absorb the overspill of global demand for safe assets.

Not only did donor-country incomes fall, but the cause of the drop the banking and financial-sector crisis may exacerbate the long-term effect on aid flows. This paper estimates how donor-country banking crises have affected aid flows in the past, using panel data from 24 donor countries between 1977 and 2010. We find that banking crises in donor countries are associated with a substantial additional fall in aid flows, beyond any income-related effects, at least in part because of the high Fiscal costs of crisis and the debt hangover in the post-crisis periods. Aid flows from crisis-affected countries are estimated to fall by 28% or more (relative to the counterfactual) and to bottom out only about a decade after the banking crisis hits. In addition, our results confirm that donor-country incomes are robustly related to per-capita aid flows, with an elasticity of about 3. Findings are robust to estimation using either static or dynamic panel data methods to account for possible biases. Because many donor countries, which together provide two-thirds of aid, were hit hard by the global recession, this historical evidence indicates that aggregate aid could fall by a significant amount (again, relative to counterfactual) in the coming years. We also explore how crises affect different types of aid, such as social-sector and humanitarian aid, as well as whether strategic interaction among donors is likely to deepen or mitigate the fall in aid.

However, little progress has been made to date in adapting benefit transfer (BT) procedures for cultural variations. Using information from a study that ranked 62 societies with respect to nine attributes of their cultures, we develop an index that is then used to re-weight multiple coastal ecosystem service value estimates. We examine whether these culturally-adjusted BT estimates are statistically different than simply transferring the income-adjusted mean transfer estimates for each coastal ecosystem service from international study sites to the policy site. We find that once differences in income levels have been accounted for, the differences in cultural dimensions between study and policy sites actually have little impact on the magnitude of our transfer estimates. This is not a surprising result given that the majority of the study site estimates are derived from countries that share many ethnic, linguistic and other cultural similarities to the policy site. However, benefit adjustments based on cultural factors could have a much higher impacts in settings different to that investigated here.","[Hynes, Stephen; Norton, Daniel] Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, SEMRU, Galway, Ireland; [Hanley, Nick] Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK 94LA, Scotland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University of Stirling,"Hynes, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, SEMRU, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",stephen.hynes@nuigalway.ie,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012","Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499",,,,,67,29,32,0,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The likely explanation, for which we provide cross-sectional evidence, is that falling house prices increased the market's trust in a government bailout, thereby increasing market valuations of firms that were expected to benefit from government rescue measures.

The empirical analysis shows that, in addition to credit risk, a relevant variable for explaining the interbank rate dynamics is the outstanding volume in the Asset Backed Commercial Paper market. In short, the large spread observed in the market is explained by the interrelationship between collateralized short-term debt markets and the unsecured interbank market.

Intermodal flows are seen as critical to rail freight's future success and feature strongly in contemporary transport policy. This paper investigates a practical rail network enhancement scheme from the United Kingdom (UK) designed to achieve a shift of containers from road to rail. The paper's aim is to determine the effects on rail freight efficiency of a loading gauge increase in April 2011 which allowed 9' 6 '' high containers to be transported on standard wagons on the corridor from the port of Southampton to the West Midlands. The study is based on a before and after survey of container train capacity provision and load factors, with the before survey taking place in 2007 and the after survey in 2012. A consistent approach to data collection in both surveys allows detailed analysis of original survey data to be carried out. It is clear that there have been considerable improvements in both on-train capacity and train loads between 2007 and 2012, and that these improvements have been greatest on routes that have benefited from the gauge enhancement. Rail's mode share of container throughput at Southampton has increased. There have also been wider benefits to off-corridor locations served from Southampton and elsewhere across the network. Overall, the impacts on rail freight efficiency of the gauge enhancement have been substantial, with efficiency improvements evident even at a time of economic stagnation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Fama and Jensen (1983) assert that when equity ownership and corporate decision-making are concentrated in just a small number of decision-makers, these owner-managers will likely be more risk averse and thus less willing to invest in risky projects. Because tax avoidance is a risky activity that can impose significant costs on a firm, we predict that firms with greater concentrations of ownership and control, and thus more risk averse managers, avoid less income tax than firms with less concentrated ownership and control. Our results are consistent with these expectations. However, we also consider a competing explanation for these findings. In particular, we examine whether certain private firms enjoy lower marginal costs of tax planning, which facilitate greater income tax avoidance. Our results are consistent with the marginal costs of tax avoidance and the separation of ownership and control both influencing corporate tax practices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Because of the high potential of insuring rainfall risk, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) began trading rainfall derivatives in 2011. Compared to temperature derivatives, however, pricing rainfall derivatives is more difficult. In this article, we propose to model rainfall indices via a flexible type of distribution, namely the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution, which captures asymmetries and heavy-tail behaviour. The prices of rainfall futures are computed by employing the Esscher transform, a well-known tool in actuarial science. This approach is flexible enough to price any rainfall contract and to adjust theoretical prices to market prices by using the calibrated market price of risk. The empirical analysis is conducted with US precipitation data and CME futures data providing first results on the market price of risk for rainfall derivatives. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Through regulation of the CPR, users may achieve a more profitable and socially efficient outcome. Feeny et al. (Land Econ 72(2):187-205, 1996) delve into some of the assumptions made by traditional CPR models and how use of those assumptions provides an incomplete framework to guide fishery policy. In the theoretical models we develop, we relax two of those assumptions: CPR users are homogeneous and are unable to create, or influence, management of the resource. We note a case where regulation of the individual user can induce others to harvest more, and relate this to the slippage effect concept. Regarding resource sustainability, we document situations where incentives exist for CPR users to lobby for tighter regulations and thus increase profits by limiting the tragedy of the commons influence.","[Freeman, Matthew A.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Anderson, Christopher M.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Mississippi State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Freeman, MA (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, POB 5187, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",freeman@agecon.msstate.edu; cmand@uw.edu,"Yoon, DongJoon/E-9146-2014",,,,,,23,1,1,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The log-normal distribution is consistent with Zipf's law in the top tail, which is known to hold for many countries in different periods. The key feature of our model is that it can express city size as a product of multiple random factors (e.g., climate, geographic features, and industry composition). Each factor alone need not generate Zipf's law. Our model provides a justification for classical urban economics models that have been criticized for not delivering Zipf's law, since a single model typically represents only one factor among many present in reality.

We lay out the record from the start of 1979 through the spring of 1980, relying almost exclusively on contemporaneous sources, including the recently released transcripts of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings during 1979. We then present and discuss in detail the reasons for the FOMC's adoption of the reform and the communications challenge presented to the Committee during this period. Further, we examine whether the essential characteristics of the reform were consistent with monetarism; new, neo, or old-fashioned Keynesianism; nominal income targeting; and inflation targeting. The record suggests that the reform was adopted when the FOMC became convinced that its earlier gradualist strategy using finely tuned interest rate moves had proved inadequate for fighting inflation and reversing inflation expectations. The new plan had to break dramatically with established practice, allow for the possibility of substantial increases in short-term interest rates yet be politically acceptable, and convince financial market participants that it would be effective. The new operating procedures were also adopted for the pragmatic reason that they would likely succeed.","[Lindsey, David E.; Orphanides, Athanasios] Fed Reserve Syst, Div Monetary Affairs, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Rasche, Robert H.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Lindsey, DE (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Div Monetary Affairs, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",,,,,,,,80,5,6,0,4,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Utilizing an 8-year panel data sample for all 32 states in Mexico, this study assesses the impact of Mexican labor market and deterrence variables on various Mexican crime rates. The principal results indicate that: (1) State gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has ambiguous effect on crime rates under different conditions. Both wages and unemployment rates are negatively linked with crime rates. (2) Although the Mexican judicial and public security systems are widely believed to be ineffective, increased federal police forces and incarceration rates are associated with lower crime rates, but higher public security expenditure per capita is associated with higher crime rates. (3) The impacts from labor market and deterrence variables presented in (1) and (2) continue to hold under the Fox administration as well as for non-border states. Their respective impacts diminish, however, under the Calderon administration as well as for border states because of the small number of observations. Overall, the results indicate that increasing average wages, federal police forces, and incarceration rates would have significant impacts on reducing crime rates in Mexican states.

We construct a measure, information costs, based on both geographical distance and the proportion of worldwide GDP the partner's home country represents. Consistent with our expectations, we find an inverse association between information costs and cross-border strategic alliances. When considering the proportion of alliances formed with publicly quoted overseas partners, we find this is unaffected by the level of information costs but rather the level of stock market development, tax rate and general economic conditions. Information costs are, however, significantly negatively related to alliances with overseas private organizations. Our results offer clear support for the on-going importance of information asymmetry in corporate decision making. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We determine clusters of states where electoral swings have been more and less in sync with each other and with the national cycle. Then, we analyze how the degree of synchronism of electoral cycles has changed through time, answering questions as to when, to what extent, and where has a tendency towards a universality of political trends in presidential elections been more strongly felt.

This study makes several key contributions to explaining electoral volatility. Firstly, it is argued and demonstrated that strategic voting plays an independent role in inducing vote switching. Secondly, the analysis shows that demand-side factors-such as socio-economic cleavages and organizations-do not predict voter stability, whereas supply-side factors-such as the party system, government performance, and strategic incentives-do. Thirdly, earlier contradictory findings with respect to the role of the electoral system are clarified, as its effects are shown to be indirect rather than direct. And finally, the importance of the temporal dimension to stability is demonstrated, as the time since the previous election is found to have a positive effect on volatility. The results are based on a comprehensive statistical analysis of 336 elections in 21 countries between 1950-2005, where the significance as well as the robustness of individual variables across different model specifications inform the conclusions.","[Bischoff, Carina S.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Bischoff, CS (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Opg E, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",cb@ifs.ku.dk,"Bertram, Caroline/IXX-2488-2023",,,,,,99,30,31,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2013,156.0,3-4,,,,,537,561,,10.1007/s11127-011-9910-z,0.0,,,25,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,184NK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321897600008,0

Both anticipated economic downturns and periods of turmoil lead investors to direct flow away from risky equity funds and towards lower-risk money market funds. These patterns are markedly stronger for investors in low cost and low turnover funds relative to investors in high cost and high turnover funds, consistent with sophisticated investors being more sensitive to changing conditions. Benchmarked against a buy-and-hold strategy, these asset allocation strategies reduce risk without degrading the risk-return trade-off. Our evidence suggests that individual investors, often dismissed as noise traders, collectively react to economic signals in a sensible manner when determining asset allocations.

Following a brief account of the evolution of monetary policymaking principles and institutions in the past, the paper deals with the controversial question of how and when to exit a period of large-scale monetary expansion. The paper documents the fact that, in spite of huge monetary injections and historically low interest rates, inflation in the US and in the Eurozone remained subdued, and reports that since the onset of the subprime crisis, there has been a dramatic deceleration in the growth of banking credit in the US. The paper also discusses the tradeoff between the lender-of-last-resort function of the central bank and moral hazard; the consequences of bailout uncertainty for central bank policy; and the particular problems faced by the ECB in the face of a major financial crisis.

Market demand is positively related to past market size because of consumer learning, networks, and bandwagon effects. Firms enter the market freely in each period with fixed costs and compete in quantities. We demonstrate that the nature of the inefficiency under free entry can change as the market grows, and more importantly, that S-shaped diffusion can be a signal that the number of firms under free entry is initially insufficient, but eventually excessive.

Since October 2007, investors who characterize themselves as day traders by closing their day-trade positions on the same day enjoy a 50% reduction in the initial margin. Because we can identify day traders ex ante, we have a laboratory to explore trading behavior without the contamination of potential behavioral biases. Our results show that the 3470 individual day traders in the sample incur on average a significant loss of 61,500 (26,700) New Taiwan dollars after (before) transaction costs over October 2007-September 2008. This implies that day traders are not only overconfident about the accuracy of their information but also biased in their interpretations of information. We also find that excessive trading is hazardous only to the overconfident losers, but not to the winners. Last, we provide evidence that more experienced individual investors exhibit more aggressive day trading behavior, although they do not learn their types or gain superior trading skills that could mitigate their losses.

To examine the validity of such a claim, one needs to take the entire range of the characteristic into account, as is done in the recent proposal of Patton and Timmermann (2010). But their test is only a test for the direction of monotonicity, since it requires the relation to be monotonic from the outset: either weakly decreasing under the null or strictly increasing under the alternative. When the relation is non-monotonic or weakly increasing, the test can break down and falsely 'establish' a strictly increasing relation with high probability. We offer some alternative tests that do not share this problem. The behavior of the various tests is illustrated via Monte Carlo studies. We also present empirical applications to real data.

To compare with the new approach, we also work with the univariate and multivariate GARCH models with asymmetric effects, trading volumes and fat-tails. The heteroskedasticity-corrected Granger causality tests based on the HVAR show the strong evidence of such spillover effects. We assess the value-at-risk thresholds for Brazil, based on the out-of-sample forecasts of the HVAR model, finding the new approach works satisfactory for the periods including the global financial crisis, without assuming heavy-tailed conditional distributions.

Daily returns from 2 January 1998 to 4 November 2009 of the crude oil spot, forward and futures prices from the WTI and Brent markets, and the FTSE100, NYSE, Dow Jones and SSIP500 stock index returns, are analysed using the CCC model of Bollerslev (1990), VARMA-GARCH model of Ling and McAleer (2003), VARMA-AGARCH model of McAleer, Hoti, and Chan (2008), and DCC model of Engle (2002). Based on the CCC model, the estimates of conditional correlations for returns across markets are very low, and some are not statistically significant, Which means the conditional shocks are correlated only in the same market and not across markets. However, the DCC estimates of the conditional correlations are always significant. This result makes it clear that the assumption of constant conditional correlations is not supported empirically. Surprisingly, the empirical results from the VARMA-GARCH and VARMA-AGARCH models provide little evidence of volatility spillovers between the crude oil and financial markets. The evidence of asymmetric effects of negative and positive shocks of equal magnitude on the conditional variances suggests that VARMA-AGARCH is superior to VARMA-GARCH and CCC.

This paper analyzes the impact of fiscal stimulus using a dynamic open economy, overlapping generations model that allows for feedback effects of fiscal stimulus on private sector expenditure via changes in the tax rate and the interest rate. There are two types of goodstraded (T) and nontraded (N) goodswhich differ in their capital intensities. The main qualitative result is that the dynamic output gains from fiscal stimulus depend on the productivity of the initial stimulus spending, on the speed of repayment of debt, on the sensitivities of the interest rate to government debt and of labor supply to the tax rate. Also, the overlapping generations framework allows an intergenerational welfare analysis. Among the biggest winners from stimulus are those about to retire. The biggest losers are those near the start of their working lives when the stimulus is implemented.","[Guest, Ross; Makin, Anthony] Griffith Univ, Dept AFE, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University,"Makin, A (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept AFE, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia.",r.guest@griffith.edu.au,"Makin, Anthony/C-6738-2017","Makin, Anthony/0000-0002-5556-9590",,,,,34,6,6,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We find that positive (negative) excess returns following recommendation upgrades (downgrades) are stronger when accompanied by daily VIX decreases (increases). A rational explanation for the effect may be due to VIX serving as an indicator of future economic conditions. Noting, however, that the VIX effect is detected on excess daily stock returns is suggestive that the results are driven by more than mere changes in investors' expectations of economic fundamentals. We suggest, therefore, that investors' mood, as reflected by VIX changes, mediates their reactions to analyst recommendation revisions, to wit, investors in good (bad) mood perceive positive (negative) future financial outcomes as more probable (whether indicative of future occurrences or not) and react more strongly to analyst recommendation upgrades (downgrades).

A natural estimate consists in using the empirical correlation between the daily returns and the changes of daily volatility estimated from high frequency data. The puzzle lies in the fact that such an intuitively natural estimate yields nearly zero correlation for most assets tested, despite the many economic reasons for expecting the estimated correlation to be negative. To better understand the sources of the puzzle, we analyze the different asymptotic biases that are involved in high frequency estimation of the leverage effect, including biases due to discretization errors, to smoothing errors in estimating spot volatilities, to estimation error, and to market microstructure noise. This decomposition enables us to propose novel bias correction methods for estimating the leverage effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We make use of the Social Interaction Potential (SIP) metric, a tool to measure the average level of opportunity for people to engage in face-to-face activities given some basic constraints on their daily mobility patterns. Generally, this opportunity is a reflection of whether the urban spatial structure - a term that broadly applies to the spatial arrangement of land-uses and the interactions between them - constrains or permits the ability for potential activity partners to be at the same place and time. In this paper, the SIP metric is applied to 42 metropolitan regions in the United States with populations over 1,000,000 people. These measurements are regressed against a set of indicators of urban sprawl to expose the relationship between spatial structure and SIP. The indicators are generated by a factor analysis of a large set of variables describing the scale, centrality and dispersion of land-uses in addition to several other structural and infrastructure-related variables. Cluster analysis is also used to organize the regions into similar groupings with respect to their structural characteristics and the level of SIP they provide. The findings indicate that social interaction potential is hampered by decentralization, fragmentation, and longer commutes in the largest metropolitan regions in the country. Interestingly, the negative effect of decentralization on SIP Efficiency is found to be nearly ten times stronger than that of fragmentation and nearly 20 times stronger than the effect of mean commuting duration.

Of these guns, more than 43,000 were originally sold in a different state from which they were recovered. What factors may explain the interstate movement of these crime guns? This article uses the well-known gravity model of international trade to estimate interstate flow of crime guns. Empirical results show that, like trade of goods and services between nations, the traced movement of crime guns between states is proportionate to the economic sizes of trading partners and is inversely proportionate to the distance between them. In addition, the presence of gangs in one or both states tends to increase the flow of crime guns. Finally, differences in state gun laws tend to affect trade flows with crime guns flowing from states with weak gun laws to states with strict gun laws.

We use a panel of data from the Spanish electoral districts for the period 1964-2004 to estimate an equation in which investment depends both on economic and political variables. The results show that tactical politics do matter since the districts receiving the most funds are those in which: (i) the incumbent's vote margin is low, (ii) few votes are needed to win an additional seat in the legislature, (iii) the central and regional governments are controlled by the same party, and (iv) regional parties play a pivotal role in the legislature. However, the results also show that programmatic politics matter, since inter-regional redistribution is shown to increase: (i) with the arrival of democracy and European Union funds, (ii) under leftist governments, and (iii) the weaker the correlation is between 'political clout' and regional income.","[Sole-Olle, Albert] Univ Barcelona, Fac Ciencies Econ, Dept Econ Publ & Econ Polit, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Sole-Olle, Albert] IEB, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Solé-Ollé, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Fac Ciencies Econ, Dept Econ Publ & Econ Polit, Avda Diagonal,690,Torre 4,Planta 2Ona, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",asole@ub.edu,,,,,,,54,17,19,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2013,156.0,1-2,,,,,229,252,,10.1007/s11127-011-9896-6,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,164WW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320443600015,0

Quebec's tradition of civil law, in contrast to common law in the rest of the country, has meant that there was already a tradition of alternative forms of marriage in Quebec, The extent of cohabitation, along with the greater policy attention to family questions, has brought about a more Nordic model there in contrast to a more liberal model in the rest of the country. Attitudes differ considerably between Quebec and other provinces in terms of child-care (since 1997) and parental leave (since 2006). The Nordic model has helped Quebec to avoid particularly low fertility. Its child-care policy has been designed both to improve child welfare and to enhance women's opportunities in employment. Comparisons to other provinces indicate that women's paid work has benefited, but child development indicators are less positive. It may be that universal programs do not permit as much focus on disadvantaged children, where early intervention has a larger impact.","[Beaujot, Roderic; Ravanera, Zenaida] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Sociol, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Du, Ching Jiangqin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Beaujot, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Sociol, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",,,,,,,,69,38,40,0,25,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We build a stakeholder-relations index (SI) for a wide range of U.S. firms over the period 1992-2009 and provide evidence that the SI explained errors in investors' expectations about firms' future earnings. The SI was positively associated with long-term risk-adjusted returns, earnings announcement returns, and errors in analysts' earnings forecasts over the period 1992-2004.

In 2008 a European Commission directive aimed at improving local air quality has been introduced, the Directive on air quality and cleaner air for Europe. It seems reasonable to suggest that increased regulatory measures at European level may have spurred interest in developing potential sustainable transport (policy) innovations such as P + R. We test this hypothesis through a survey among 25 cities in North-West Europe. We find that by 2010 perceived regulatory pressure for P + R has indeed increased compared to 2005, although it remains weak and is still not a significant motivation for P + R development. Furthermore, it was found that perceived community pressure has become a significant motivation, possibly because of increased public awareness and attention for global warming and sustainability. Overall we find that framing of P + R among urban planners as well as the cities' engagement levels have not evolved significantly from 2005 levels and thus that air quality concerns are an increasing but currently not strong motivation for local authorities in North-West Europe to develop P + R.

The results suggest that borrowers' private information about their default risk is an important determinant of their debt maturity choices.","[Goyal, Vidhan K.] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wei] Queens Univ, Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Queens University - Canada,"Goyal, VK (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",goyal@ust.hk; wwang@business.queensu.ca,"Goyal, Vidhan K/C-6488-2011","Goyal, Vidhan K/0000-0002-3932-4825; Wang, Wei/0000-0002-7462-951X",,,,,33,34,42,3,70,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

It is shown that when the interest rate is zero, the optimal policy is nonintervention. If the interest rate is positive, a country may earn positive profits by incurring a trade surplus in the first period. However, there is an upper bound for optimal trade surplus. A country actually may lose money if the rate of devaluation below the equilibrium is greater than the interest rate. The limiting surplus share model suggests that China may have been losing money from excessive devaluation of renminbi since 2002. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

By focusing on hazardous areas, highly visible traffic law enforcement simultaneously can reduce both crime and crashes. Most studies have focused on the reduction of crime and crashes after applying new patrol routes, but few have documented how to improve or change police dispatch time. The objective of this study was to compare the police dispatch time between two conditions: (I) police patrol routes with organized hotspots, and (2) police patrol route patterns without focusing on hotspots. A secondary objective consisted of developing a procedure to describe the calculation of the change in dispatch time. This study used data obtained from the College Station Police Department. Crime and crash data were collected between January 2005 and September 2010, which included 65,461 offense reports and 14,712 crash reports. The study procedure includes four steps: (I) geocoding the data, (2) defining the hotspots, (3) organizing the best patrol routes, and (4) estimating the effectiveness. ArcGIS was used for the data analysis. The results indicate that using DDACTS principles can potentially reduce police dispatch time by 13% and 17% when the top five and top ten hotspot routes respectively are included in the analysis. The procedure can be used by law enforcement agencies to estimate whether or not the DDACTS protocols can be an effective tool for reducing law enforcement dispatch times when crash and crime data are analyzed simultaneously.

Several settings with regard to the origin of the fund contributions are assessed and the immediate effects on the incentives of the policyholders and equity holders are analyzed through a one-period contingent claim approach. One result is that introducing a guaranty scheme in a market with competitive conditions entails a shift of equity capital towards minimum solvency requirements.

We introduce a new measure of overall innovation by estimating and enveloping annual minimum cost frontiers to create a global frontier. The distance to the global frontier constitutes each bank's technology gap, which decreases if the bank manages to innovate. Our innovation measure enables us to derive and estimate the model of Aghion et al. (2005b) at the firm level for the US banking industry. Based on individual bank Call Report data for the period 1984-2004, consistent with theoretical and empirical work by Aghion et al., we find evidence of an inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation that is robust over several different specifications. Further evidence on major structural changes in the US banking industry indicates that banks moved beyond their optimal innovation level and that interstate banking deregulation resulted in lower bank innovation.

First, we find that eco-efficiency has improved over the period, with the exception of emissions. Second, Switzerland is the most eco-efficient country, followed by some Scandinavian economies, such as Sweden, Iceland, Norway and Denmark.

Advances in information technology may have reduced the advantages of small scale, close proximity, and local ties that traditionally have given small, community-focused banks a competitive advantage in lending to small businesses and other informationally opaque borrowers. This article examines trends in deposit shares of banks of different sizes in rural U.S. counties. If the community banking model is to remain viable, it is likely to be in rural markets with (i) a relatively high percentage of informationally opaque borrowers and (ii) relatively low costs of acquiring qualitative information about potential borrowers. The authors find that rural deposit shares of both the smallest and very largest banking organizations changed little between 2001 and 2012, despite the upheavals of the financial crisis and recession, and in contrast to the 1980s and 1990s, when the shares held by the smallest banks declined markedly. The evidence suggests that well-managed community banks remain competitive, at least in rural markets, where their niche is most likely stronger than in urban markets.","[Gilbert, R.

A cross-cohort simulation suggests that long-run shifts in the source countries of immigrants to Canada are likely to lead to a reduction in the future fraction of school entry cohorts willing to undergo apprenticeship training.","[McDonald, James Ted] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Econ, Fredericton, NB, Canada; [Worswick, Christopher] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",University of New Brunswick; Carleton University,"McDonald, JT (通讯作者)，Univ New Brunswick, Dept Econ, Fredericton, NB, Canada.",,,"Worswick, Christopher/0000-0003-4495-604X",,,,,12,0,0,0,6,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We derive a noise-robust Hayashi-Yoshida estimator that allows for very general structure of jumps in the underlying process. Based on the new estimator, different aspects and components of co-volatility are compared to examine the effect of jumps on systematic risk using tick-by-tick data from the Chinese stock market during 2009-2011. We find controlling for jumps contributes significantly to the beta estimation and common jumps mostly dominate the jump's effect, but there is also evidence that idiosyncratic jumps may lead to significant deviation. We also find that not controlling for noise and jumps in previous realized beta estimations tend to considerably underestimate the systematic risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Some implicitly assume utility is defined on final wealth whereas others argue it may be defined on initial wealth and income separately. I argue that making income and wealth separate arguments of utility has important implications that may not be widely recognized. A framework is presented that allows the unified treatment of expected utility models and anomalies. I show that expected utility of income models can predict framing induced preference reversals, a willingness to pay-willingness to accept gap for lotteries, and choice-value preference reversals. The main contribution is a theorem. It is proved that for all utility functions where initial wealth and income enter separately, either there will be preference reversals or preferences can be represented by a utility function defined on final wealth alone.","Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Lindsay, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",luke.lindsay@econ.uzh.ch,"Lindsay, Luke/JJD-2395-2023","Lindsay, Luke/0000-0002-7454-5500",,,,,28,5,5,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

The empirical part applies the framework to three different sets of financial time-series and demonstrates substantial differences in dependence patterns among asset classes and through time.

This definition is robust to the choice of the reference period and we develop a new statistical decomposition that provides bounds on changes at these margins. We focus on longer-run labour supply changes over the period 1977 to 2007 and abstract from the shorter-run impact of recessions. Examining secular changes over this period, we show that both margins matter in explaining changes in total hours.

It also attempts to work out the current distributional impacts of these policies and others that act as income supplements thereby presenting a consistent picture across time and income deciles. Figures suggest that between 2000 and 2011, the percentage share of policy costs in typical domestic electricity and gas bills rose by 14% and 4% respectively. This reflects a growing share of policy costs in bills which is relatively small for gas customers but significant for electricity customers. Moreover distributional impacts of the energy-policy mix highlight the issue of imperfect targeting of low-income households during 2009-10. The study also indicates that during 2010-11, 76% of the funds for energy-efficiency schemes were handled by the private sector Given that a long-term solution to fuel poverty lies in improving thermal efficiency of houses, this research draws attention towards the need for definitive evidence on the ways in which energy suppliers charge policy costs from their domestic customers.","[Chawla, Mallika; Pollitt, Michael G.] Univ Cambridge, Elect Policy Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Chawla, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Elect Policy Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",mc669@cam.ac.uk,,,Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC); Department of Work and Pensions (DWP); Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem); Office for National Statistics (ONS); EPSRC Flexnet project,Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC); Department of Work and Pensions (DWP); Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem); Office for National Statistics (ONS); EPSRC Flexnet project(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors wish to thank various officials from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), Office for National Statistics (ONS) and a number of energy companies for their support for this research.

Using daily data for S&P 500 index and IBM shares, we show that our component-driven regime-switching (CDRS) models are capable of outperforming GARCH, component GARCH, regime-switching GARCH, and Markov-switching multifractal models in forecasting realized variances out of sample.

The three most important contributions of his work are discussed, including the introduction of public goods theory into the study of public administration and his work on quasimarkets and the Tiebout model. Three controversies or conundrums raised by his work are then discussed.

To measure the permanent price impact incurred by each futures trade, which can be translated into the quality of information content of each trade, we use a modified version of the MRR model (Madhavan et al., 1997), which is appropriate for gauging the price impact and information content as well as analyzing the intraday price discovery issues that arise in purely order-driven markets. Consistent with the empirical results of previous studies on market microstructure issues in Korea's index derivatives market (i.e., KOSPI200 index futures and options market), we find that large trades generally incur greater permanent price impacts than small trades. This indicates that large trades generally have greater information content than the smaller ones. However, in contrast to the majority of empirical studies in this area, which have reported that buy trades are more informative than sell trades in global financial markets, we find that the permanent price impact of seller-initiated trades is clearly and substantially larger than that of buyer-initiated trades in the KOSPI200 futures market. This indicates that sell trades are more informed than buy trades in the index futures market, where informed investors can freely submit sell orders without any restrictions. The greater information content of sell trades is also apparent when trades are classified by their size. These results are quite remarkable considering that the sample period of this study (2003-2006) corresponds to a recovery period, during which the underlying stock index price and the futures price continued to increase.

If people are led by their self-interest, the young will prioritize public education services, while the elderly will demand better pensions and health-care services. Addressing this issue requires longitudinal survey data and estimation of age (life-cycle), period and cohort effects. Except for a few of studies based on US data, such analyses are non-existent. We use repeated cross-section survey-data for 22 countries. Respondents are classified into ten-year age-groups and birth decades, and we estimate a regression model explaining respondents' public spending preferences. When period and cohort effects are taken into account, elderly people want less education spending, and more health care and pension spending. These life-cycle effects vary considerably between countries, but are generally quite small. Preferences also appear mostly unrelated to left-right party choice. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These schools are well-known for their effectiveness in closing the gender gap in primary school enrolment. On the other hand, registered non-government secondary madrasas (or Islamic schools) today enrol one girl against every boy student. In this article, we document a positive spillover effect of BRAC schools on female secondary enrolment in registered madrasas. Drawing upon school enrolment data aggregated at the region level, we first show that regions that had more registered madrasas experienced greater secondary female enrolment growth during 19992003, holding the number of secular secondary schools constant. In this context we test the impact of BRAC-run primary schools on female enrolment in registered madrasas. We deal with the potential endogeneity of placement of BRAC schools using an instrumental variable approach. Controlling for factors such as local-level poverty, road access and distance from major cities, we show that regions with a greater presence of BRAC schools have higher female enrolment growth in secondary madrasas. The effect is much bigger when compared to that on secondary schools.","[Asadullah, Mohammad Niaz] Univ Reading, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Asadullah, Mohammad Niaz] ESRC Ctr Skills Knowledge & Org Performance, Oxford, England; [Asadullah, Mohammad Niaz] Univ Bonn, IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Chaudhury, Nazmul] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",University of Reading; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Bonn; IZA Institute Labor Economics; The World Bank,"Asadullah, MN (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Business, Dept Econ, POB 218,HUMSS Bldg, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",m.asadullah@reading.ac.uk,"Asadullah, M Niaz/H-6768-2013","Asadullah, M Niaz/0000-0001-8047-5548",,,,,21,8,9,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

Time-varying financial market integration of each country is measured through the conditional variances of the country-specific and common international risk premiums in equity excess returns. The country-specific and common risk premiums and their conditional variances are estimated from a latent factor decomposition through the use of state space methods that allow for GARCH errors. Our empirical results suggest that stock market integration has increased over the period 1970:1-2011:10 in all countries but Japan. And while there is a structural increase in stock market integration in four out of five countries, all countries also exhibit several shorter periods of disintegration (reversals), i.e. periods in which country-specific shocks play a more dominant role. Hence, stock market integration is measured as a dynamic process that is fluctuating in the short run while gradually increasing in the long run. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we characterize the factors that promote or hinder the international diffusion of climate-friendly technologies using detailed patent data from 96 countries for the period 1995-2007. The data provide strong evidence that lax Intellectual Property regimes have a strong and negative impact on the international diffusion of patented knowledge. Restrictions on international trade and foreign direct investment also hinder the diffusion of climate-friendly technologies. Surprisingly, local technological capabilities tend to discourage transfers. While broad indicators of technology capabilities are expected to facilitate transfers, this latter result stems from our technology-specific definition of local capabilities, which makes it possible to capture a substitution effect between local and foreign inventions.","[Dechezlepretre, Antoine] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Glachant, Matthieu; Meniere, Yann] Mines ParisTech, CERNA, F-75272 Paris 06, France",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Ménière, Y (通讯作者)，Mines ParisTech, CERNA, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75272 Paris 06, France.",A.Dechezlepretre@lse.ac.uk; glachant@mines-paristech.fr; yann.meniere@mines-paristech.fr,,,"ESRC [ES/G021694/1, ES/I015760/1, ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1, ES/I015760/1, ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,33,81,82,3,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper reviews both the analytical frameworks and the empirical evidence on the importance of womens bargaining power. It argues that there is sufficient evidence from rigorous studies to conclude that womens bargaining power does affect outcomes. But in many specific instances, the quantitative evidence cannot rigorously identify causality. In these cases, a combination of quantitative and qualitative evidence may suggest policy levers. Taken together, there are sufficient data in place to support a greatly expanded focus on intrahousehold outcomes and bargaining power.

I find that the premium for idiosyncratic risk documented by several empirical studies depends on the covariance between stock and human capital returns.","Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Eiling, E (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,79,43,53,4,82,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

We compare four ways of incorporating odor nuisance: distance to the source, distance zones, continuous odor measures, and odor zones. The odor zones approach seems best suited to estimate the external costs. We test these specifications for some 1,400 observations of house sales transaction between 2004 and 2008. Results show that houses subject to moderate and severe odor nuisance sell at a discount of 5% and 12%, respectively, compared to houses without nuisance.","[Eyckmans, Johan; De Jaeger, Simon; Rousseau, Sandra] Hgsk Univ Brussel HUB, CEDON, Brussels, Belgium; [Eyckmans, Johan; De Jaeger, Simon; Rousseau, Sandra] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Eyckmans, J (通讯作者)，Hgsk Univ Brussel HUB, CEDON, Brussels, Belgium.",,"Eyckmans, Johan/AAN-6590-2020; Rousseau, Sandra/C-8723-2011","Eyckmans, Johan/0000-0002-2885-4740; Rousseau, Sandra/0000-0001-8948-8644",,,,,29,7,7,0,20,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 728 State Street, Suite 443, MADISON, WI, UNITED STATES",0023-7639,1543-8325,,LAND ECON,Land Econ.,FEB,2013,89.0,1,,,,,53,75,,10.3368/le.89.1.53,0.0,,,23,Economics; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,245QM,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326478900004,0

The trade-off between liquidation costs and underinvestment costs implies that low-liquidity firms exhibit negative investment sensitivities to liquid funds, whereas high-liquidity firms have positive sensitivities. If real assets are not divisible in liquidation, firms with high financial liquidity optimally avoid external financing and instead cut new investment. If real assets are divisible, firms use external financing, which implies a lower sensitivity. In addition, asset redeployability decreases the investment sensitivity. Our findings demonstrate that asset liquidity is an important determinant of corporate investment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the short term, this process has brought significant benefits to the original countries of these migrant flows: reduced unemployment and social pressures, provided important support to adjust the balance of payments due to the remittances, increased local development achieved through high immigrants investments in their areas of origin. But on the long term there is a decrease in remittances and the labor force losses begin to show their negative effects on economic growth. Therefore, looking ahead CEEC governments began to realize these losses and started to develop programs in order to stimulate the reversal of migrants. Beyond the positive effects on economic growth they counted on an increased degree of knowledge brought by the experience of immigrants in the highly developed EU countries. This paper is based on a survey conducted on a representative sample (1200) of Romanian immigrants in Italy with the objectives of determining the main factors that stimulated the immigration process, but also those that could encourage the reversing wave. Italy was chosen along Spain as the main destination of Romanian migrant labor force flows.

We provide evidence that aggregational Gaussianity and infinite variance can coexist, provided that all the moments of the unconditional distribution whose order is less than two exist. The latter characterizes the case of Integrated and Fractionally Integrated GARCH processes. Finally, we discuss testing for aggregational Gaussianity under barely infinite variance.

It defines country's short-run and long-run sustainability conditions that are based on dynamics of both sources created by an economy through net export surplus and negative net yields paid from international investment position. The paper points out important differences between large advanced and small transitive economies in case of costs of net investment position. The factors like country's position of FDI lender/debtor, world investment/invoicing currency, exogeneity of foreign asset's and liability's interest yields, role of FX reserves accumulation by country's central bank and position of foreign currency denominated loans on foreign liabilities are discussed. Empirical analysis confirms the Czech economy is not able to satisfy long run sustainability condition due to high net costs of negative investments position. Estimation of parameters in econometric model shows that worsening net investment position to GDP is a result of high dividend and interest yields paid from foreign liabilities that is still above positive balance of net export.","Univ Econ Prague, CZ-10368 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Bruna, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-10368 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",bruna@vse.cz,"Bruna, Karel/AAD-9178-2020","Bruna, Karel/0000-0003-3690-1364",,,,,12,2,2,0,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Global analysis indicates that suitable land to bring into cultivation is available but concentrated in a limited number of land-abundant countries in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. In a much larger number of countries, productivity on currently cultivated land is significantly below potential. Higher returns to farming and relatively cheap land have contributed to a wave of investments into farming, mostly through very large ventures in land-rich countries. If land and other markets work well and a regulatory framework is in place, there are opportunities to generate considerable benefits by providing access to capital, technology, and new markets. However, investments have often been controversial because poor land governance and weak institutional capacity have made many of these ventures economically, socially, or environmentally unsustainable. Strengthening land governance and institutions and increasing public investment to raise smallholder productivity are major priorities for most countries to improve development outcomes from these investments.","[Deininger, Klaus] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,,dbyerlee@gmail.com; kdeininger@worldbank.org,"Byerlee, Derek/HTN-3605-2023","Byerlee, Derek/0000-0003-2580-8105; Deininger, Klaus/0000-0003-3198-0083",,,,,77,28,32,1,52,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

We aimed to explore the prevalence, reported reasons and socio-demographic correlates of these behaviours. Using surveys of 430 primary and 258 secondary schoolchildren and their parents, we examined whether parents drove their child home from school and to local destinations within walking distance. We found a third of the sample, in particular around half of all primary schoolchildren, were driven home from school. Most children usually had parental accompaniment on local trips and were almost always driven. Using regression analyses we examined which of the following were associated with these behaviours: distance (to school); social trust; concern about injury while crossing a road; urban/rural location; attending primary/secondary school; sex, age of child; at least one parent not being employed full-time; household car access. In the analysis social trust and concern about injury were prominent explanatory variables. The results suggest public policy interventions that aim to improve road safety, increase community connectedness and build social trust may be important to encourage active transport for children.

First, we examine whether moving toward the optimal level is an important concern for managers when they adjust their ownership. Second, we analyze the effect of changes in managerial ownership on changes in Tobin's q by focusing on how the market reacts differently between the adjustments toward optimal ownership and other discretionary adjustments. Using panel data of non-financial companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, we find evidence to show that managers significantly increase their ownership when there are below-optimal deviations, whereas reductions in ownership for above-optimal deviations are not significant. Empirical results also show that the market reacts positively to changes in ownership for removing deviations on either side of the optimal level. Discretionary increases or decreases in managerial ownership are detrimental to firm value. Our findings are robust to using different measures of changes in managerial ownership and to certain modifications in the empirical model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Frame, D",,,,"Frame, David",,,Saving and consumption in cities,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Housing; Housing rents; Intertemporal consumer choice,HOUSE PRICES; GROWTH; FUNDAMENTALS; MODEL; LAND,"This paper examines urban residential location and rent determination within a city populated by consumers acting with perfect foresight. In this setting, the consumption and saving decisions of city residents are determined jointly with their choice of location, thereby offering an initial step to understanding how housing services influence non-durable consumption, and vice versa. Housing, supplied by profit-maximizing land owners, is distinguished from more non-descript varieties of durable consumption by the attributes and amenities it provides occupants. These attributes are limited in supply, indivisible, and distinguished by their location in geographic space and time of development. In equilibrium, both household consumption and the rental price of housing are expressed in terms of the resident household's permanent income. In contrast to models presuming hand-to-mouth dynamics, dwelling rents depend on interest rates, future realizations of economic fundamentals such as income and commuting costs, and accumulated wealth. Finally, residential saving is determined not only by wealth, income, and market prices, but also by city-specific factors such as population, supply constraints, and the opportunity cost of land, suggesting a novel and important role for regional and geographic differences in consumer behavior.

We observe the dynamic placements of EU equity markets in clusters, by taking into account the evolutions before 2008 and between 2008 and 2011. We find that European equity markets form a heterogeneous structure, as evidenced by returns' distributions, with a number of rather stable and homogeneous clusters - formed of mature equity markets in the EU, and with other smaller clusters, with a changing composition, which include mostly the emerging markets, which seem to be less integrated with the other EU equity markets.","[Horobet, Alexandra; Marin, Erika] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest 1, Romania; [Belascu, Lucian] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Horobet, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest 1, Romania.",alexandra.horobet@gmail.com; lucian_belascu@yahoo.com; erika_tusa@yahoo.com,"Horobet, Alexandra/D-2301-2010; BELASCU, LUCIAN/Q-5282-2019; marin, Erika/AEV-0251-2022","Horobet, Alexandra/0000-0001-5821-0244; BELASCU, LUCIAN/0000-0002-7711-3746;",,,,,10,0,0,0,11,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,454,463,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100047,0

We demonstrate that, although only SLT has the same functional form as the optimal interest-rate reaction function, both PLT and SLT stabilize the model macroeconomy against a cost-push shock for a wide range of parameter values better than IT. We then estimate all three specifications using the Greenbook data.

Then the impact on the economy is discussed. Based on Polish central bank's data it may be estimated that between 1996 and 2012 the maturity gap increased significantly - average residual maturity of assets exceeds 6 years in 2012 (less than 2 years in 1996), while that of liabilities remains below 1 year. The gap between assets and liabilities is even wider if we take into account the fact that due to legal constraints practically all deposits in Poland are callable. Growing maturity mismatch in a particular bank may result in higher credit, liquidity, legal, model, interest rate and other risks. Risks accepted by banks may then propagate through the economy, which may lead to financial instability. Increasing gap affects monetary aggregates; additional imbalances catalyze asset bubbles, e. g. a boom in house prices. Also, it could be claimed that maturity mismatch distorts the economic incentives through lowered interest rates. Special case of the maturity mismatch is constituted in Poland by foreign currency denominated mortgages funded with short-term local currency deposits and hedged with short-term swaps.","[Kochanski, Blazej] Gdansk Univ Technol, Wydzial Zarzadzania & Ekon, Politech Gdanskiej, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,,bkochanski@zie.pg.gda.pl,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,642,653,,,,,,12,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100065,0

On one hand, responsiveness in the context of a system can be defined as an outcome that can be achieved when institutions and institutional relationships are designed in such way that they are cognizant and respond appropriately to the universally legitimate expectations of the citizens.. So, responsiveness is the key to the proper functioning of any democracy and an important value itself. A good functioning of the democracy must take into account as a primary value not only representation, but also the means of solving the problems. This involves information processing, communication, and the way through which the public's preferences are created and influenced by the governmental strategies and through collective dynamics along with establishing the policy agenda as a result of convergence agendas. On the other hand, a policy agenda that represents a common place of convergence between citizens' priorities and governmental and parliamentary activity, is a guarantee that the citizens will receive appropriate and opportune responses of their demands.

We employ MESSAGE modelling platform to construct a dynamic linear optimisation energy model of the Czech power system. We analyse regulation impacts on fuel use and CO2 emission, fuel-mix and technology-mix, induced investment and fuel and other O&M costs to generate electricity over the period 2006-2030. Negative external costs attributable to endogenously determined new level of air quality pollutants are quantified to make our cost-benefit analysis more complex. Overall, effects of four policy scenarios are assessed, including subsidies for renewable energy, increase in air quality charge rates and an introduction of the EU ETS in the Czech power system. Based on our simulation, we find that prospected 10-fold increase in charging of air quality pollutant would not have any significant effect on emission and would not bring any stimuli for change in technology and fuel mixes. Subsidy to renewable energy would result in their development; however, larger effect would appear in far future and only if new nuclear power units are not allowed to build. Auctioned EUA, especially above 15 per tonne of CO2, would be the only effective instrument with significant effects on power sector. Key factor on CO2 emission is whether scenario consists of new nuclear power units or these units are banned. Our simulation results hold even if we allow the key model assumption to vary, except, the discount rate that would have effect on whether more-investment intensive technologies are used to generate electricity.","[Recka, Lukas y; Scasny, Milan] Charles Univ Prague, Charles Univ Environm Ctr, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic; [Recka, Lukas y] Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Recka, L (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Charles Univ Environm Ctr, Jose Martiho 407-2, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic.",lukasrecka@gmail.com; milan.scasny@czp.cuni.cz,"Scasny, Milan/F-7394-2012; Rečka, Lukáš/C-3456-2013","Scasny, Milan/0000-0001-5040-1281; Rečka, Lukáš/0000-0003-3115-5884",,,,,41,8,8,0,13,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

One of the reasons for the diverging conclusions may be attributed to cultural factors. This study makes an attempt to close this research gap as far as Greece is concerned, where there appears to be no such published study, involving university students. The purpose of the study is to close this gap, and offer both academics and practitioners additional insight, in their decisions, concerning training and education issues such as admissions to college or graduate programs, or who is to be trained. The methodology used in this study, involves the collection of the responses from 962 university students from a population of about 3000, who completed a structured questionnaire, including the variables of the Big Five model and the Dependent Variables of student performance measured by the student Grade Point Average (GPA), and the GPA the student believed she/he deserved, as well as the percentage of the modules passed out of those required. The results were analyzed with the use of SPSS using confirmatory factor analysis and Regression analysis. In accordance with the findings of earlier studies on personality and performance (both academic and work) Academic Performance correlated with extraversion, conscientiousness and emotional stability. Also, Perceived Academic performance related to extraversion and conscientiousness. Finally, Academic performance according to percentage of modules passed was related to age, agreeableness and conscientiousness. There are serious implications for tertiary education administrations, who can select their prospective students based not only on their past (school) performance, but also on the additional information provided by the personality tests of the candidates, increasing thus the chance of their completing their studies in a timely fashion.","[Sahinidis, Alexandros G.] Technol Educ Inst Athens, Dept Business Adm, Athens, Greece; [Frangos, Christos C.] UCL, Div Med, London, England",University of West Attica; University of London; University College London,"Sahinidis, AG (通讯作者)，Technol Educ Inst Athens, Dept Business Adm, Athens, Greece.",asachinidis@teiath.gr,"Fragkos, Konstantinos/B-8861-2009","Fragkos, Konstantinos/0000-0002-7677-7989; Frangos, Christos/0000-0002-1743-5962; SAHINIDIS, ALEXANDROS/0000-0001-7564-5813",,,,,27,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,503,+,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500048,0

In such cases, according to the quality of the materials used, to how close to reality the calculation hypotheses taken into account in the design phase come, as well as to any possible execution errors, the constructions may be degraded or even damaged. The damage is the deterioration of a construction or of some of its components, and an accident, in the construction field, is an unpredictable event, usually consisting of collapses or serious damages, with or without human life losses and which involves significant material damages. Usually, construction damages are not brought about by a single cause, but by a combination of multiple causes. Their different succession and intensity makes it more difficult to objectively establish the influence that has led to the damage. There are constructions with serious hidden defects, and no visible defects. In such cases, the damage can be triggered by a minor influence overlapping the unfavourable effect of hidden defects. Numerous investigations have been conducted concerning the structural failures that have occurred over the years and it has been found that, minus a few small exceptions, they are due mainly to human errors and they almost never result from the unfavourable combinations of random events. A structure must be designed and *executed so that, throughout its lifecycle, it should satisfy the following basic requirements: structural resistance, durability, reliability. A different wording of the matter may be criticized in any way: obtaining a high degree of robustness may diminish the minimum cost requirement..

This allowed us to examine both short-and long-term causality between energy consumption and economic growth. Taking into consideration rapid economic changes experienced by the countries analysed, a set of variables was extended to include real gross fixed capital formation and labour force. The results obtained indicate that the variables remain in long-term equilibrium. Short-term relationship between energy consumption and GDP is bidirectional.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP), chief indicator of an economy, shows that for a long time, Pakistan economy was backward. The years after independence, the size of Real GDP, Per Capita GDP and their growth rates was small but improved from 1990. In this study the GDP of the 64 districts in Pakistan at current market prices are considered. The factors which have effects on the gross district product in the year 2010-2011 are measured here. Here Principal Component analysis and Maximum Likelihood method of factor analysis are used for the seventeen variables of the gross district products of 64 districts. The results show that seventeen variables contributing to our GDP have been classified into three factors. Then we rename these three factors from principal component analysis as service factor, agriculture & infrastructure factor, and fishing & mining factor. In maximum likelihood method we rename the factors as service factor, agriculture & infrastructure factor, and education factor. At last we compare the factor scores as district-wise for the three factors to reflect their significance. The study finds a clear shift of contribution by the macroeconomic variables to the GDP of Pakistan from agriculture to 'non-agriculture' sectors. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

Recently, researchers in social and behavioral sciences have identified a puzzling phenomenon called antisocial punishment: some people are willing to pay a cost to punish those who act in ways that benefit their shared social group. Interestingly, the expression of antisocial punishment behavior is regionally diverse and linked to the sociopsychological dimensions of local cultural values. In this review, we adopt an ecological perspective to examine why antisocial punishment might be an advantageous strategy for individuals in some socioeconomic contexts. Drawing from research in behavioral economics, personality and social psychology, anthropology, we discuss the proximate mechanisms of antisocial punishment operating at an individual level, and their consequences at the group and cultural levels. We also consider the evolutionary dynamics of antisocial punishment investigated with computer simulations. We argue that antisocial punishment is an expression of aggression, and is driven by competition for status. Our review elucidates the possible socioecological underpinnings of antisocial punishment, which may have widespread repercussions at a cultural level.","[Sylwester, Karolina; Bryson, Joanna J.] Univ Bath, Dept Comp Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Hellmann, Benedikt] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Bath; University of Nottingham,"Sylwester, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Comp Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",karolina.sylwester@gmail.com,"Bryson, Joanna J/C-8745-2017","Bryson, Joanna J/0000-0003-0021-0801",,,,,98,47,50,1,31,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The paper aims at describing the student-centred teaching method called simulated enterprise. This method is directed at building the competences, abilities, attitudes and personal capacity allowing students to act on behalf of being respectful of the environment and at the same time identify and find solutions for different issues in the context of sustainable development. This method supports the development of a sustainability culture, since students learn about values, attitudes, behaviour, mentalities, norms and rules relevant to their actions as responsible citizens. Finally, students having been trained within the framework of this novel approach called simulated enterprise are sensitized and made aware of the impacts of their own behaviour, decisions and activities thus developing critical and reflective thinking.

The study focused on ARV distribution from Joint Medical Stores to its health units in central Uganda. A cross sectional and quantitative research design was used. Primary data was collected from 80 Health units using self-structured questionnaires. Data was analyzed using SPSS where; a Content Validity Index was ran to assess the validity of each construct and the reliability of the variables was assessed using Cronbach alpha at a cut off level of 0.7. Pearson's rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength of the relationship between variables and a Regression analysis to determine the extent to which the independent variables could predict a change in the dependent variable. The findings indicated a positive and significant relationship between the constructs of IT integration, sourcing flexibility, logistics flexibility and supply chain agility. From this study, it is recommendable that in order to improve the supply chain's agility, other factors like; donor demands, political stability, the stigma associated with AIDS among others, should be given attention. The study contributes to the existing literature by empirically investigating the main reasons for Joint Medical stores needing to increase the agility of its supply chain so as to meet its customer requirement on a timely basis.","[Watera, Sarah; Muhwezi, M.; Ntayi, Joseph] Makerere Univ, Dept Procurement & Logist Management, Sch Business, Kampala, Uganda; [Ochara, Nixon Muganda] Univ Pretoria, Dept Informat, Pretoria, South Africa",Makerere University; University of Pretoria,"Watera, S (通讯作者)，Makerere Univ, Dept Procurement & Logist Management, Sch Business, Kampala, Uganda.",sarah_mlay@yahoo.com; nixon.muganda@up.ac.za,"Ntayi, Joseph/HKW-6871-2023; Marin, Angela Maria Azevedo Cardoso/AAJ-6892-2020; Ochara, Nixon Muganda/AAX-4432-2020","Ochara, Nixon Muganda/0000-0001-5736-7901",,,,,48,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1525,+,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100163,0

However, the models are based on specific requirements and have certain limitations. SCM-Prod model focuses on the certification and quality requirements of software product in generic software. It has been shown and indicated through previous studies and experiences in software certification exercises that requirements for user-centric approach is needed and demanded in software development as well as certification and quality management.

Two core strategies are identified: dispersion and departmentalization. There exists a trade-off between three income effects: basic footfall effects, spillover effects, and an effective floor area effect, which varies by the number of floor levels. Departmentalization is favored for centers with more than four floors. Greater spatial complexity also points to a higher degree of departmentalization. Optimal placement strategies are deteimined by the physical features of the center as a whole, and not by the features of individual levels.","[Yuo, Tony Shun-Te] Natl Taipei Univ, New Taipei City 23741, Taiwan; [Lizieri, Colin] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",National Taipei University; University of Cambridge,"Yuo, TST (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, New Taipei City 23741, Taiwan.",tonyyuo@mail.ntpu.edu.tw; cml49@cam.ac.uk,,"Lizieri, Colin/0000-0002-7111-8052",,,,,37,11,11,0,13,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

This meaningful lack of self-reliance persists after the regime's breakdown and hinders the development of an entrepreneurial spirit, which might hamper the transition process. Since East Germany adopted the formal institutions of a market economy quasi overnight when reunifying with West Germany, we avoid simultaneity issues regarding current institutions and preferences. Further tentative evidence suggests that the socialist regime also affected the composition of the East German population by inducing selective migration before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.

Controlling for effective tax rates, structuring the tax as a penalty or adding withholding taxes on cash-outs increases rollovers. Allowing employers to unilaterally cash out balances for departing employees alters the impact of other policies.

As these effects may vary depending on both the type of firm and innovation, this study provides results for small and high-tech firms and distinguishes between process and product innovation. The results suggest that for small firms banks do not intervene at the development stage of an innovation but rather play their traditional role of financing investments for constrained firms. In contrast, relationship banks do play an important role for high-tech firms in the development of a process innovation and in the introduction of new products. In addition, for both types of firms, the financing decision of the main bank seems to be correlated with the lending behaviour of other banks, with multiple borrowing exerting a positive effect on firm innovative capability.

The existence of long range dependence in the squared and absolute value of market returns is a 'stylized fact' and researchers have interpreted this to imply that the stochastic clock is self-similar, multi-fractal (Mandelbrot, Fisher and Calvet, 1997) or mono-fractal (Heyde, 1999). We model the market stochastic clock as the stochastic integrated intensity of a doubly stochastic Poisson (Cox) point process of the cumulative transaction count of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

This paper employs a new dataset by Cheibub et al. (2010) to examine the impact of transitions to democracy on economic freedom. The dataset identifies 48 political transitions from authoritarianism to democracy since the mid-1970s, for which the data on economic freedom are available. Both cross-sectional and panel data analyses are employed to examine these transitions within the framework of fixed- and random effects models. The results indicate that transitions to democracy are associated with subsequent increases in economic liberalization as measured by changes in the Economic Freedom of the World index. Moreover, the economic liberalization appears to follow the path of an inverted U. ascending for approximately 10 years after the democratic transition, but receding thereafter. There was also evidence that stable (long-term) democracies achieved larger increases in economic freedom than authoritarian regimes, while unstable democratic transitions adversely affected economic liberalization.

Using analyst reports as a proxy. I find that price events accompanied by information are followed by drift, while no-information ones result in reversals. One interpretation of these results is that investors underreact to news about fundamentals and overreact to other shocks that move stock prices. Consistent with this hypothesis, information-based price changes are more strongly correlated with future earnings surprises than no-information ones. Furthermore, drift exists only when the direction of the price move and of the change in analyst recommendations have the same sign. Finally, the ratio of no-information to information-based price shocks is strongly correlated with aggregate implied volatility and also forecasts momentum returns. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For two asymmetric countries facing the challenge of a transboundary pollution problem, we compare the relative efficiency of these two second-best agreements in the case of quasi-linear utility functions. We especially study what role the costs associated with transfer payments across countries play in the choice of cooperative agreements. To conduct this analysis, we first construct the Pareto sets corresponding to each agreement. We next analyze the agreement which will be signed by both countries using the generalized Nash bargaining solution (1953). On the one hand, our results demonstrate the equivalence of the Pareto sets corresponding to the two agreements for one special case which coincides with the first-best solution. On the other hand, in the neighborhood of this case, we show the possible superiority of the agreement based on a uniform standard with transfers over that based on differentiated standards. In this case, the level of the costs associated with transfer payments must be sufficiently low compared to the relative marginal abatement costs of the countries in the differentiated agreement.","[Bayramoglu, Basak] INRA, UMR Econ Publ, Paris, France; [Bayramoglu, Basak] AgroParisTech, Paris, France; [Jacques, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris 09, LEDa, F-75016 Paris, France",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Bayramoglu, B (通讯作者)，Ave Lucien Bretignieres, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",Basak.Bayramoglu@grignon.inra.fr; jacques@dauphine.fr,"Bayramoglu, Basak/X-1281-2019","Bayramoglu, Basak/0000-0002-0847-5858",,,,,25,1,1,0,10,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Reducing congestion is therefore one of the pivotal challenges for Dutch policymakers. In this paper we analyze population-employment dynamics in the Netherlands and concurrently decompose total employment into four broad sectors: manufacturing, distribution, business service and personal service activities. We explicitly allow for inter-sectoral relations to capture employment dynamics more accurately. We introduce a model in which endogeneity and spatial autocorrelation are dealt with by a generalized spatial three stage least squares (3SLS) estimator. Our empirical results suggest that population growth primarily causes the consumer service sector to grow. Employment growth in industrial activities and business services are not decisively affected by population growth. Moreover, the inter-sectoral relations appear more important than between employment and population growth itself. Our findings indicate that the existing magnitude and direction of consumer and business trips will be persistent over time, and potentially be even more pronounced in the future.

Such policies seek to provide an answer to the growing number of people facing time problems as a result of an erosion of collective time rhythms and a desynchronisation of different time structures of urban life. Particular emphasis is being placed on the reconciliation of opening hours of public service facilities with the travel and activity patterns of citizens in order to increase individual accessibility to urban services. In spite of the increasing relevance of time policies, only limited quantitative research has been conducted about the relationships between opening hours and accessibility. This paper seeks to extend this line of inquiry by exploring if and to what extent the accessibility of public facilities can be ameliorated by redesigning the timetables of service delivery. A method is proposed to optimise the temporal regime of public service delivery in terms of accessibility. The method is illustrated in a case study of accessibility of government offices within the city of Ghent (Belgium). Our findings suggest that by rescheduling the opening hours of public service facilities individual accessibility to service delivery can be improved significantly. Our study may support urban service deliverers, policymakers and urban planners in assessing timetables for a better 'accessible' service provision. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Using import tariffs and foreign exchange rates as instrumental variables for import penetration, I show that these results are not manifestations of endogenous relations between import competition and leverage. The results are consistent with traditional trade-off models of capital structure that predict a positive relation between book leverage and expected future profitability. Further evidence suggests that import competition affects leverage through changes in the trade-off between the tax benefits of debt and the costs of financial distress. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, education on technology and innovation management is increasing in importance, especially for developing countries. Technology and innovation management courses in higher education constitutes the significant part of the formal education in the field, hence the effectiveness of these courses has become a major issue. However in previous literature, several researchers tried to discover the ideal basic characteristics of curricula for technology and innovation management education and particularly for graduate and undergraduate courses in terms of content and theory and practice balance in universities This study aims to explore and reveal the current status of technology and innovation management courses in business administration and engineering faculties, science, technology and social sciences institutes in 95 public universities in Turkey. The findings are evaluated in terms of meeting the required major patterns of courses that are determined based on the theoretical background. Differences are considered as improvement requirements and related recommendations to practitioners are presented. Study reveals that existing courses in the explored higher education institutions are still not sufficient in number and quality to provide the knowledge and skills that create professionals who are competent in technology and innovation management.","[Yildirim, Nihan] Istanbul Tech Univ, Isletme Fak, Istanbul, Turkey; [Askun, Olcay Bige] Marmara Univ, Isletme Fak, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University; Marmara University,"Yildirim, N (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Isletme Fak, Istanbul, Turkey.",yildirimni@itu.edu.tr; olcayb@marmara.edu.tr,"AŞKUN, Olcay Bige/ABD-1796-2020; YILDIRIM, NIHAN/A-9272-2018","AŞKUN, Olcay Bige/0000-0002-1573-8900; YILDIRIM, NIHAN/0000-0002-6279-3849",,,,,49,1,2,0,46,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Specifically, we propose a model that draws on the Bayesian paradigm to integrate the variable selection process into model estimation and to reflect the accompanying uncertainty about which is the best specification in subsequent counterfactual predictions. The advantage of this procedure over previous non-Bayesian approaches is that it overcomes the problem of pre-testing in specification searches. In our application, evaluating demand for recreational lake usage in Iowa, we find clear evidence that site attributes, such as lakes size, handicap facilities and wake restrictions, do impact lake usage. There is also evidence that water quality matters in household recreation choices. Indeed, contrary to Abidoye et al. (Am J Agricult Econ, 2012), in which only a single functional form is considered, we find clear evidence that water quality matters, with posterior probability of less that 10 % associated with a model without any water quality variables. This suggests that the flexibility that the Bayesian variable selection model affords in capturing the linkage between recreation demand and site characteristics can be important.","[Herriges, Joseph A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Abidoye, Babatunde O.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0028 Hatfield Pretoria, South Africa",Iowa State University; University of Pretoria,"Herriges, JA (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 260 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",babidoye@up.ac.za; jaherrig@iastate.edu,,"Abidoye, Babatunde/0000-0002-3594-3872",,,,,24,4,5,2,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The main result is that regulators should encourage sophisticated banks to keep their asset portfolios safe, while assets with high systematic risk should be concentrated in smaller banks. The proposed regulatory differentiation follows the Basel Accord's distinction between internal ratings-based approach and standard approach. Sophisticated banks should increase their equity capital relative to other banks, leading to further size differentiation. The moral hazard problem of banks misrepresenting their loan portfolio risk is analyzed, with the result that it induces stricter capital requirements.","[Feess, Eberhard] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany; [Hege, Ulrich] HEC Paris, Paris, France",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris,"Feess, E (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,23,14,14,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,,,REV FINANC,Rev.

These include the free allocation of emission allowances versus recycling of auction revenues through proportional income tax relief and a per capita dividend. The analysis is undertaken under conditions where significant economic gains, rather than losses, are projected for the policy, and in the context of the new electricity pricing regulatory environment in which passing along the opportunity costs of using free allowances may not be approved. We adapt and enhance the Regional Economic Models, Inc. Policy Insight Plus Model and apply it for the first time to estimate the income distribution impacts of cap and trade. The analysis illustrates the importance of considering macroeconomic impacts and identifies important efficiency-equity tradeoffs.

This may be due to measurement issues, such as the widespread use of Rotter's (1966) general locus of control scale, which is not domain specific. Not surprisingly, Rotter's scale has been shown to be multidimensional, including personal efficacy. When the first Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED I) was constructed in the late 1990s, a measure of locus of control was included. Unfortunately, this scale was also multidimensional. Thus, measurement of the construct may be problematic. Because locus of control continues to be important in organizational research, where it has been found to influence intentions, motivation, satisfaction, and performance, we examined the PSED I dataset to determine whether we could develop a more robust measure after the fact. To this end, we constructed a unidimensional locus of control scale using the sample of nascent entrepreneurs in the PSED I dataset and validated the scale using two additional samples.","[Schjoedt, Leon] Drexel Univ, Ctr Grad Studies, Dept Management, LeBow Coll Business, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA; [Shaver, Kelly G.] Coll Charleston, Sch Business, Dept Management & Entrepreneurship, Charleston, SC 29401 USA",Drexel University; College of Charleston,"Schjoedt, L (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, Ctr Grad Studies, Dept Management, LeBow Coll Business, 1 Capitol Mall,Suite 260, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA.",leonschjoedt@ymail.com; shaverk@cofc.edu,"Schjoedt, Leon/C-2767-2016","Schjoedt, Leon/0000-0002-0721-6344; Shaver, Kelly G/0000-0002-0699-374X",,,,,77,32,48,3,97,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using pedestrian crash records (2000-2007) from the Georgia Department of Transportation as a case study, this paper applied a spatiotemporal clustering technique to identify clusters of injured pedestrians and then investigated the influence of personal and environmental factors on pedestrian injuries. The Bernoulli model in SatScan was used to detect the roadway segments, where pedestrian injuries were significantly clustered. Descriptive statistics and temporal (yearly, monthly, day of week, and hourly) trends of the injuries were explored, respectively. The logistic regression model was used to assess the injury risk associated with pedestrian factors (gender, age, intoxication, and maneuvers), driver's factors (gender, age, and intoxication), and environmental factors (light conditions, surface conditions, and weather conditions). The results showed that suburban high-activity corridors, where state highways intersect local streets, significantly elevated injury risks in crashes compared to other areas. The percentage of injuries was pronounced in summers, on the weekends, and from evenings to early mornings. Age, pedestrian maneuvers, and inadequate lighting were significant risk factors for pedestrian injuries.

S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. First, the paper finds that differentiated manufactures exhibited marked stability in their trade prices during the large decline in their trade volumes. Prices of nondifferentiated manufactures, by contrast, declined sharply. Second, while the trade collapse was much steeper among differentiated durable manufacturers than among nondurables, prices in both categories barely changed. Third, the frequency and magnitude of price adjustments at the product level changed with the onset of the crisis, consistent with a state-dependent view of price adjustment. The quantitative magnitudes of the changes, however, were not pronounced enough to affect aggregate prices. The paper's findings present a challenge for theories of the trade collapse based on cost shocks specific to traded goods that work through prices.

Once S&P adopts issuer-pay, its ratings increase and no longer differ from Moody's. More importantly, S&P only assigns higher ratings for bonds that are subject to greater conflicts of interest, measured by higher expected rating fees or lower credit quality.

Results show that a closed city requires not only downward adjustment to the market density at boundary locations using maximum FAR regulation but also upward adjustment at central locations using minimum FAR regulation. On the other hand, an open city requires only the former. The common practice of imposing only maximum FAR regulation is thus insufficient for closed cities although it is effective for open cities.

We find only minor differences between the responses of administrators and the general public, the most important of which is the difference in priorities between reducing the risk of many small or one large accident.

The paper introduces a stressorresponse methodology where engineering-based models are used as a basis to estimate the impact of individual climate stressors on road infrastructure in Mozambique. Through these models, stressorresponse functions are introduced that quantify the cost impact of a specific stressor based on the intensity of the stressor and the type of infrastructure it is affecting. Utilizing four climate projection scenarios, the paper details how climate change response decisions may cost the Mozambican government in terms of maintenance costs and long-term roadstock inventory reduction.

We find evidence that the answer to the CV question influences the responses to the attitudinal questions. In our case, this influence reflects rational behavior (budget constraint issues) and justification biases related to protest reasons, such as lack of trust in institutions or fairness issues with respect to the distribution of the burden of preservation.

Our measures outperform the traditional monetary shocks in explaining variation of interest rates in the event-study framework. We also study the extent to which the ECB caused jumps in euro area interest rates. The new surprises still prevail upon the traditional ones. Jumps play a great role in the variation of interest rates and the ECB induced several jumps with its decisions, but its predictability has improved over time. We find that, although the surprise measures become somewhat distorted due to money market tensions during the financial turmoil, our model still provides an interesting insight into interest rate behaviour throughout the crisis.

In two studies, predictions derived from Huber's risk defusing operator theory of decision making were tested. We investigated the effects on PPI judgements and decisions of previous experience, cognitive appraisal, emotion and changes in PPI cost and level of cover. In Study 1, a randomized groups experiment, 241 high street bank customers were presented with scenarios in which they chose whether or not to purchase PPI. Logistic regression showed that previous experience, the anticipated worry reduction (peace of mind) afforded by PPI, and its perceived value for money, all had direct effects on PPI decisions. In addition, standard regression analysis found that: (1) PPI cost and level of cover significantly predicted the perceived value for money of PPI; and (2) the subjective probability of repayment difficulties predicted anticipated worry about repayment difficulties, which in turn predicted the anticipated worry reduction of PPI. In Study 2, a survey of 300 bank customers, the above direct and indirect effects on PPI decisions were further investigated by path modeling. The final path model was a good fit to the data and confirmed the main relationships described above. Thus, in addition to judgements of the value for money of PPI, worry concerning repayment difficulties, and its anticipated reduction, are strong determinants of consumer credit insurance decisions.

Bandura (1997, Self-efficacy. The exercise of control (p. 23). New York: Freeman), quoted in title, suggests - at a context-specific level - that controllability moderates the impact of self-efficacy on outcome expectancies and we hypothesize that - at a general level - this also applies to dispositional optimism. We further hypothesize that locus of control moderates the impact of external-efficacy beliefs, but in the opposite direction as self-efficacy. Our survey data of 224 university students provides support for the moderation of self-efficacy and chance-efficacy. Our new conceptualization contributes to clarifying relationships between self- and external-efficacy beliefs, control beliefs, and optimism; and helps to explain why equally optimistic individuals cope very differently with adverse situations.

We show that robustly optimal policy can be implemented through commitment to a target criterion involving only the paths of inflation and a suitably defined output gap, but that a concern for robustness requires greater resistance to surprise increases in inflation than would be considered optimal if one could count on the private sector to have rational expectations.

We approach this question by establishing a set of stylized facts concerning the evolution of corporate default and its resolution, focusing on access to credit after default. Using a unique dataset from Portugal, we observe that half of the corporate default episodes last 5 quarters. Most firms continue to have access to credit immediately after resolving default, though only a minority has access to new loans. Firms have more difficulties in regaining access to credit if they are small, if their default was long and severe, if they borrow from only one bank or if they default with their main lender. Further, half of the defaulting firms record another default in the future. We observe that firms with repeated defaults are, on average, smaller and experience longer and more severe defaults.

Recent literature shows that providing members with opportunities to shirk their contractual obligations actually promotes agreement formation and durability. Yet, in spite of these benefits, institutions continue to exhibit wide variation in the flexibility of their rules. I show that, in the context of preferential trade agreements (PTAs), the benefits of permitting escape are enjoyed unevenly across the market. In particular, import-competing industries gain from the protection that escape clauses provide while their export-dependent counterparts bear the costs. This asymmetry creates domestic political competition over agreement design between the two traded sectors of the market.

Using published statistics from the American Community Surveys of 2000-2010. we examine how immigrant inflow shocks to a metropolitan area affect native populations. We find that immigrant inflows are associated with increases in local native populations on an annual basis but that these OLS estimates are generally upward biased. Our IV results are purged of this bias, but we still find that an additional immigrant increases the low skill native population by 0.4-0.7 in the concurrent period. To explain this result, we show that immigrant inflows lead to declines in outflows of low skill natives from affected MSAs. This is most pronounced in MSAs from which relocation is arguably more costly, which may disproportionately affect the low skilled. We find short-run responses among high skill natives that are consistent with displacement. The decline in high skilled native populations is driven by high skilled immigrant inflows, and high skilled outflows increase from affected MSAs. We show that these short-run changes are obscured in specifications using longer-run population changes and conclude that the short-run impact of immigrants on native populations differs markedly from their longer-run impact.

Second, unlike previous studies, we exploit both time series and cross-sectional variation in the data in the estimation of a panel error correction model. The panel error correction model results show that in the long-run economic freedom, per capita income, and education have a negative and statistically significant impact on corruption whereas income inequality has a positive and statistically significant impact.

Moreover, using the notion of A-efficiency introduced by Golosov et al. (2007) in a context of endogenous population (i.e., Pareto efficiency applied to people alive in every state), which contrasts with the P-efficiency criterion with respect to which the preference profiles of both born and unborn agents are evaluated in every state, some normative conclusions can be drawn: although the financing of health investments reduces both the disposable income and marginal propensity to consume of young individuals through increased labor income taxation, it also increases the length of life and can represent an A-Pareto improvement when the world interest rate is sufficiently high, because consumption when old becomes more attractive in such a case. Indeed, there exist: (i) a whole range of health tax rates that can effectively be used to increase social welfare, and (ii) an A-Pareto-efficient allocation. Moreover, the numerical simulations presented for some actual small open economies reveal that raising public health spending above the existing level causes both saving and domestic income to fall in all countries, while also finding that developed and underdeveloped (transition) economies are currently underinvesting (overinvesting) in health.","[Gori, Luca] Univ Genoa, Dept Law & Econ GLM Casaregi, I-16126 Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa,"Gori, L (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Law & Econ GLM Casaregi, Via Balbi 30-19, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.",luca.gori@unige.it,,"Gori, Luca/0000-0003-1967-0840",,,,,62,3,3,0,18,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2012,68.0,2,,,,,121,152,,10.1628/001522112X639945,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,961BN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305439000001,0

Two forms of vetoes are tested: the first is costly for the investor to implement and the second is costless. One of the key findings is that the empowerment of investors through both costless and costly vetoes significantly increases trust by over 30% in both cases. To control for a treatment sequence effect, we conducted the experiment in a reverse order. We observe a comparable loss in trust when the power to veto is removed. Further analysis of veto decisions indicates that empowering investors increases both trust and trustworthiness without an undue abuse of the power to veto and that the veto decisions are mainly driven by unfair responses, consistent with the notion that most vetoes are cast by investors whose trust has been betrayed.

In early 2005, the MFI introduced reforms that included improved enforcement of contingent renewal. The reforms led to a healthy situation with almost zero default rates. We hypothesize that strategic default under the joint liability mechanism was encouraged by weak enforcement of contingent renewal and was one of the factors responsible for the pre-reform failure. To support this hypothesis, we show that before the reforms, a borrower's delay in installment repayment was correlated with other group members' repayment delays beyond the level explained by possible correlation of project failures due to locally covariate shocks. Such excessive correlation disappeared after the reforms, including the period after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. The empirical evidence thus demonstrates the existence and seriousness of the strategic default under weak dynamic incentives.","[Kurosaki, Takashi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Khan, Hidayat Ullah] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Khan, Hidayat Ullah] Kohat Univ Sci & Technol, Kohat, Pakistan",Hitotsubashi University; Hitotsubashi University; Kohat University of Science & Technology,"Kurosaki, T (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Khan, Ilyas/C-8770-2019","Khan, Ilyas/0000-0002-2056-9371; Kurosaki, Takashi/0000-0002-9762-0067",,,,,31,13,15,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Within the program, private developers receive a subsidy in exchange for constructing apartment units that rent for a predetermined affordable rate. Because the subsidy requires apartment buildings to charge a lower rental rate, the opportunity cost of developing subsidized housing in a location is the market rent that a developer could have charged if he had not received the subsidy. This study characterizes how profit incentives motivate location decisions within the LIHTC program by showing that opportunity cost causes more LIHTC development in locations with low market rent. This result implies that additional financial incentives, like the qualified census tract, may not be necessary to promote construction of subsidized housing in low-rent areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We compare our method to a double elicitation technique in which the utility function and discount rate are jointly estimated. Our experiment shows that these methods yield consistent estimates of the discount rate, which is reassuring given the wide range of estimates in the literature. We find little evidence of probability weighting, but in a second experiment, we observe that discount rates are sensitive to the length of the front-end delay, suggesting present bias.

A discrete-time duration analysis with respect to the years from the start-up to the first loan approval by a commercial bank or a cooperative bank, which is collected from survey data in Japan, shows that the higher price cost margin (PCM) of banks, which reflects the existence of a quasi-rent for a bank, improves the credit availability for younger firms. Additional analysis to detect the regional determinants of the PCM of banks shows that the share of larger banks in each local credit market has a negative and significant impact on the PCM. In light of the existing empirical finding that smaller banks are more likely to provide relationship banking, these findings provide indirect evidence for the hypothesis that the intensity of relationship banking in each local credit market increases the PCM and this encourages banks to extend a loan to new firms so that they can pre-empt the opportunity to establish lending relationships that are expected to yield such quasi-rents.

For this reason, aviation systems are endowed to some extent with a distinctive network topology and spatial pattern. In this article, the statistical features of China's aviation system (CAS) are investigated through a complex network approach by examining weekly flight patterns. The correlation study proves the existence of a spatial hierarchical structure within China's aviation network, which implies a more complex spatial mechanism. Subsequently the spatial structure of CAS is explored based on the flight distances between airport cities. In light of three measurements of node strength, population and GDP, It has been decided that the spatial effect of China's aviation system should be analyzed separately in term of different distance scales. Only for medium- and long-distance travel, the flight patterns conform to a gravitation law: therefore, the distance dependence function can be generalized as a scaling relationship. In summary, from a complex network angle, this paper provides preliminary but enlightening insights to understanding the unique spatial mechanism of aviation systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides governments, employers are key players in this strive for a more sustainable commute. However, commuting research tends to focus on individual commuters and their place of residence, rather than on workplaces and company-induced measures. Therefore, this paper takes the workplace as research unit to analyse the popularity of carpooling in Belgium. After an exploratory (spatial) data analysis, we incorporate three groups of factors in a multilevel regression model which predicts the share of carpooling at large workplaces: location (accessibility), organisation (activity sector), and promotion (carpool-oriented mobility management measures). Higher levels of carpooling are found at less accessible locations, and in the activity sectors construction, manufacturing and transport. This analysis gives insight in the determinants of carpooling, and may thus contribute to the development of sustainable transport policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This issue has been the subject of numerous empirical studies. However, the extant evidence on this issue is inconclusive. We allow for the fact that investor demand for dividend paying stocks is time-varying and the market pays a premium for such stocks when the demand is high. Moreover, when the dividend premium (DP) is high, dividend increases could be due to managers catering to high demand for dividends by investors. We find that when the DP is low, there is a significant positive relation between dividend increases and unexpected future earnings changes, consistent with the signaling theory of dividends. However, when the DP is high, the relation between dividend increases and unexpected future earnings changes is insignificant. This finding suggests that when the DP is high, managers increase dividends primarily to cater to investors' demand for dividends rather than to signal an increase in the future profitability of the firm. Finally, as is the case with prior studies, we find an insignificant relation between dividend increases and unexpected changes in future earnings when we constraint the relation to be constant over time.","[Urcan, Oktay] London Business Sch, London NW1 4SA, England; [Ali, Ashiq] Univ Texas Richardson, Sch Management, Richardson, TX USA",University of London; London Business School; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Urcan, O (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England.",ourcan@london.edu,,,,,,,27,5,6,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Apart from the shocks that they are subject to, performance of core inflation measures depends also on the nature of the inflationary process. Therefore we evaluate the performance of measures period wise, for two subsample periods, one being relatively stable and other being less stable in terms of inflation process. We show that permanent exclusion based measures perform much better in stable times, while their performance deteriorate in less stable periods. Model based measures have a robust performance under both states. Statistical measures dominate in terms of their performance in predictive ability under both states and their trend tracking ability improves in less stable periods.","[Atuk, Oguz; Ozmen, Mustafa Utku; Tekatli, Necati] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Özmen, MU (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Istiklal Caddesi 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",oguz.atuk@tcmb.gov.tr; utku.ozmen@tcmb.gov.tr; necati.tekatli@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,3,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Results indicate that nature-based public land recreation in this area did not experience reductions in most categories of visitor spending or total number of visits during the recession. These results imply that nature-based recreation may represent an economically stable industry in public land mountain economies. Total benefits to the visitors are also quite stable, only dropping from $129 per person per trip in 2006 to $120 in 2009.

The aim of this article is to evaluate the role of internal intangible capital on firms' productivity. As firms' behavior is crucially affected by the external economic and institutional environment, we control for the characteristics of the regional location in terms of technological and human endowments, as well as for the regional infrastructures and settlement structure. In our empirical application, we analyze a large panel of European companies in the manufacturing and service sectors belonging to 116 regions of six countries, considered over the period 2002-2006. The results, obtained by applying the Levinsohn-Petrin estimation approach, show the positive influence on firms' productivity exerted by internal knowledge capital and by intangible assets available in the regional economy. The findings highlight the importance of policies which are designed to (i) stimulate the accumulation of intangible capital stocks internal to the firms, and (ii) support the development of an adequate knowledge system at the regional level.","[Marrocu, Emanuela; Paci, Raffaele] Univ Cagliari, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Marrocu, Emanuela; Paci, Raffaele] CRENoS, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Pontis, Marco] CRENoS, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Marrocu, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Viale S Ignazio 78, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",emarrocu@unica.it; paci@unica.it; mpontis@gmail.com,"; Marrocu, Emanuela/E-2903-2017","PACI, RAFFAELE/0000-0003-0301-438X; Marrocu, Emanuela/0000-0002-7436-0055",,,,,49,85,88,1,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

This paper analyzes the economics and politics of crisis insurance programs. The analysis helps explain why ex-post insurance is popular, why it tends to be undersupplied by private markets, and why governments may be better able to provide it. The analysis also points out that there are limits to what losses can be covered. The routine adoption of new programs to limit losses from crises tends to require greater expenditures through time because of moral hazard problems and the nature of crises. Eventually, this trend may produce uninsurable crises. The analysis of this paper suggests that such problems can be moderated, although not eliminated, through appropriate standing polices for ex-post funding of crisis insurance.","W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Congleton, RD (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Room 405,B&E Blg, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",roger.congleton@mail.wvu.edu,,,,,,,32,12,14,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2012,150.0,3-4,,,,,399,423,,10.1007/s11127-011-9902-z,0.0,,,25,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,858QS,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297817800001,0

We examine the effects of these two factors in a simple static contest model, in which two sides choose levels of arming and whether to engage in actual conflict or settle in the shadow of conflict. We show how arming critically depends on both governance and norms, and therefore how societies with potentially conflictual relations can make either high or low levels of expenditures on security without any difference in the levels of security they actually enjoy. We also explore how investments in governance can reduce arming.","[Garfinkel, Michelle R.; McBride, Michael; Skaperdas, Stergios] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Garfinkel, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",,,"Garfinkel, Michelle R/0000-0003-4520-2303",,,,,12,3,3,1,10,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Jointly optimal capital and priority structures can virtually eliminate investment distortions because debt priority serves as a dynamically optimal contract. Examining the relative efficiency of priority rules observed in practice, we develop several predictions about how firms adjust their priority structure in response to changes in leverage, credit conditions, and firm fundamentals. Notably, financially unconstrained firms with few growth opportunities prefer senior debt, while financially constrained firms, with or without growth opportunities, prefer junior debt. Moreover, lower-rated firms are predicted to spread priority across debt classes. Finally, our analysis has a number of important implications for empirical capital structure research, including the relations between market leverage, book leverage, and credit spreads and Tobin's Q, the influence of firm fundamentals on the agency cost of debt, and the conservative debt policy puzzle.","[Hackbarth, Dirk] Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Mauer, David C.] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Hackbarth, D (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Business, 515 E Gregory Dr,MC-520, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",dhackbar@illinois.edu,"Hackbarth, Dirk/GNM-9256-2022","Hackbarth, Dirk/0000-0003-4259-5690",,,,,51,130,151,1,76,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

To reveal long-run price discovery, we compute common factor weights of Schwarz and Szakmary (1994) and information shares of Hasbrouck (1995) based on estimated coefficients of a VECM. To analyze the short-run dynamics, we perform Granger-causality tests. We identify the futures market to be the leader of the long-run price discovery process, whereas the informational role of the futures market increases over time. In addition, we employ a version of the UECCC-GARCH model as introduced by Conrad and Karanasos (2010) to analyze the volatility transmission structure. The volatility analysis indicates a close relationship between the volatility dynamics of both markets, whereas in particular we observe spillovers from the futures to the spot market.

In addition, we test a recent explanation of preference reversals by loss aversion, which would also restrict the incidence of reversals outside the lab. According to this account, reversals occur largely because the valuation task endows subject with a gamble, activating loss aversion. This contrasts with the choice task, where the reference point is pre-experiment wealth. We test this explanation by holding the reference point constant. Our evidence suggests that reversals are only slightly diminished with ambiguity. We find no evidence supporting their explanation by loss aversion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We derive a U-shaped forest-income curve where forest cover initially declines as per capita income increases, but starts to rise after an income turning point. Political stability and corruption control do not significantly affect the income turning point but both variables shift the forest-income curve up or down. The resulting CO2 emission-income curve is downward sloping and is based on changes in the levels of variables affecting forest cover.

This is one of the reasons for which it is necessary to know and explore the Lithuanian population, as the buyer of the genetically modified products, and to examine the Lithuanian market of these products. Although the market is limited for these products, it is still very important to know as much as possible about genetically modified organisms and their effects on humans and the environment, and the future of the people, as consumers have their own opinion about them.","[Grundey, Dainora] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Rimkiene, Indre] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Grundey, D (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",dainoragrundey@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,43,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2012,14.0,31,,,,,230,245,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,900SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300910600017,0

Further, it is accruals quality associated with innate uncertainty in the firm's operating environment that attracts analysts even after controlling for operating uncertainty associated with cash flow and stock return volatility.

These results are consistent with the notion that because non-state-owned firms are more likely to suffer bank discrimination for political reasons, they tend to address their financing disadvantages by building economic bonds with banks. We also find that among non-state-owned firms, those that hold significant bank ownership have lower interest expenses, and are less likely to increase cash holdings but more likely to obtain short-term loans when the government monetary policy is tight. These results suggest that the firms building economic bonds with banks can enjoy benefits such as lower financial expenses and better lending terms during difficult times. Finally, we find that non-state-owned firms with significant bank ownership have better operating performance. Overall, we find that firms can reduce discrimination through holding bank ownership.

The existence of a possible business cycles asymmetry has major implications in economic stabilization policies modeling, forecasting and application. There are rather few studies on business cycles stylized facts in Romania and they fail to tackle business cycles asymmetry. Therefore, the purpose of our research is to test the possible business cycles asymmetry in several Romanian macroeconomic variables. We estimated the business cycles of the variables under survey using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, whereas for the tests conducted on the business cycles asymmetry recorded we preferred Sichel's (1993) methodology. We checked the robustness of the results recorded by business cycles estimation using the Beveridge Nelson decomposition.

At the time, a subsidised hunting club assisted landowners with predator control measures. A farm-level analysis of data from the Ceres hunting club's logbooks reveals that four out of five farms have experienced no predator damage whatsoever. For those reporting problems, the typical loss was in the region of one per cent of the estimated turnover. Lynx (caracal), leopards and feral dogs were responsible for most of the damage. Black-backed jackals were not a serious concern, but were also more difficult to catch. Lynx and feral dogs were controlled with ease. Death of some innocent animals was also recorded. The hunting club system thus appears to be succeeding in controlling certain predators, albeit with adverse consequences to other animals. Exploratory statistical analysis establishes that livestock losses lead to increased control efforts, which in turn leads to the death of more targeted and untargeted animals. There is even some evidence that more control efforts reduce stock losses in the following year.","[Conradie, B.] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Conradie, B.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Social Sci Res, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Conradie, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",Beatrice.Conradie@uct.ac.za,"Conradie, Beatrice/ABG-3218-2020","Conradie, Beatrice/0000-0002-4675-6300",,,,,20,4,6,0,7,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2012,51.0,1,,,,,96,113,,10.1080/03031853.2012.649540,0.0,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,973BE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306325200006,0

Data Envelopment Analysis delivered higher efficiency scores for precision farming (PF) adopters. Correcting for selection bias using a one-step endogenous switching regression reveals that farms displaying a lower cost efficiency score are less likely to adopt PF technology. Non-adopters switching to PF technology would likely be affected by a significant decrease in cost efficiency given their production conditions and/or managerial and technical skills. In line with this, results indicate that human capital and farm size increase the likelihood of PF adoption. Cost (allocative efficiency) implications of PF-related changes in input structure only, on the other hand, are not found to have an impact on the choice of technology. A positive allocative efficiency effect of PF technology is brought about mainly by a farm's ability to better extrapolate the soil's productive potential, which is insufficiently reflected in the land rental prices. The allocative as well as cost efficiency implications of PF technology are further related to technology-specific responses to various farm characteristics and technological practices. PF technology makes farms' efficiency more responsive to production conditions, farm specialisation, legal form and other technological practices. The overall efficiency effect the PF practices is, therefore, conditioned on farm characteristics.","[Curtiss, Jarmila] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe, Halle, Germany; [Jelinek, Ladislav] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Gottingen, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Curtiss, J (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe, Halle, Germany.",,,,"Czech National Agency for Agricultural Research, NAZV","Czech National Agency for Agricultural Research, NAZV","This research study was carried out as part of the project Economic system of evaluating farm performance with respect to sustainable use of natural resources No.: QH71016, and financed by the Czech National Agency for Agricultural Research, NAZV.

There is also no significant correlation between OBE grade score and OBE-student centered learning average score. No significant correlation is also reported between OBE grade score and student online grading. However, there is a significant negative correlation between OBE grade score and class size. This implied that the smaller the class size, the higher OBE grade score can be expected.

Various hypotheses have been developed to explain these fluctuations, as follows: financial pricing hypothesis, capacity constraint hypothesis, financial quality hypothesis, option pricing approach and economic pricing hypothesis. Consistent with previous studies despite of examining whether variables possess unit roots, performing an ARDL bound test on underwriting profits from 1950 to 2009 demonstrates that the economic pricing hypothesis may be the most suitable model for explaining historical insurance pricing. An evident cyclical pattern in underwriting profits is explained as dynamic feed back to the long-term equilibrium. Considerable evidence suggests that the supply effect of risk-averse insurance companies has dominated U.S. insurance markets during the last half century. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The basic concept is that the restrictions imposed by the rules are directed at the activity of the insurance company, of course with reference to the capital invested by the shareholders. The exact manifestation of these rules depends on the specific national element, however it is possible to underline two basic concepts of capital maintenance: the creation of a minimum limit of capital and the restriction of asset transfer to shareholders where net income is well below the initial invested social capital. In insurance companies the minimum capital limit must be generated in a way that protects the interests of the insured. Through the present article we have tried to present, through a comparative analysis of the risks that creditors of insurance companies face, the capital maintenance protection mechanism available to them, underlining in the end its functionality and efficiency.

This paper provides insights in effects of biogas production on farms, farm structures and rural areas for the region Altmark, Germany, for the period 2012-2026 by using the agent-based simulation model AgriPoliS. AgriPoliS enables to simulate agricultural structural change and impacts of policies based on a linear programming approach. To maximize the household-income, farm agents can invest, produce and compete against each other on the land rental market. To analyse effects of biogas production, biogas plants, possible substrate mixtures and feed-in remunerations are introduced in the model. In our analyses, we focus on 1) the choice of production of farms, 2) the competition between farms, and 3) impacts on rural areas including environmental issues and labour market. Our simulation results show that biogas production provides especially for farmers with high management capabilities and large farms a profitable income opportunity. On average, biogas farms cannot increase their profitability. As result of an increased value added through biogas production and high competition among farms, rental prices increase and thus a high share of the value added is transferred to the land owners. Biogas production leads to an intensification of land use, especially to increases in cultivation of grass and maize silage instead of meadows and other crops, and in livestock production. This may cause negative environmental effects. On the other hand both, the intensification and the biogas production have positive effects on the labour market as biogas farms have an additional workforce demand.","[Ostermeyer, Arlette; Schoenau, Franziska] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Ostermeyer, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",ostermeyer@iamo.de; schoenau@iamo.de,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,150,169,,,,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800011,0

It has gained momentum since the 1970s, and now covers more than 25 per cent of the total forestlands globally. However, the introduction of commercialisation into community forestry, controlled by private capital, has not only undermined the livelihood requirements of poor people, but also swiftly deteriorated forest conditions. By unfolding the nature of commercialisation in community forestry in Nepal, this article argues that pro-poor entrepreneurship models of producing forest resources through a partnership between poor people and community groups could be an appropriate alternative to develop economic opportunities and forest conservation.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Geog, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Paudel, D (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Geog, 267 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",paude005@umn.edu,,,,,,,45,7,7,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The results achieved highlight a positive outlook for the future development of Project performance indicators and their adaptation in business industry in achieving sustainability. It also revealed that the main problem of green public procurement in Greece is related to the waste of processes and the lack of quality specifications of projects.

For some, defined contribution (DC) retirement savings plans provide a ready source of funds to meet these medical debts. We examine whether health status and health insurance coverage predict the likelihood of having a DC loan using data from the Federal Reserve's triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) from 1989 to 2007. We find that poor health raises the likelihood that a household will borrow from their DC plans, even controlling for other forms of debt, access to credit, and whether households are covered by health insurance. Our estimates of the amount of the DC loan, taking selection effects into account, indicate that DC loan amounts are also influenced by health status; those with poor health borrow more from their DC plans. Apart from health status, once a household decides to borrow from their retirement funds, race and education also influence how much to borrow. We argue that public policy can improve the long-term financial retirement security of households by offering more opportunities to save for medical emergencies, while cautiously maintaining the opportunity to borrow from DC plans.

For the grandparents and parents of today's children, working, and earning money, outside school hours was a part of normal life for both boys and girls. While children's need for money has grown with changing lifestyles in the intervening decades, work outside the home, and particularly work that earns money, is no longer a significant part of childrens' experience.

After being discovered by brands and brand managers, such productions have become a method that is resorted by those who aim to raise awareness. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of TV series and TV series characters in raising brand awareness. For this purpose, people living in Malatya central district have been chosen as the main mass, and a questionnaire was applied to a sample chosen from among this mass. Data obtained from the applied questionnaire were evaluated. As a result, it was seen that the awareness level changed according to demographic characteristics such as age, sex, education level, marital status; and the number of TV series viewed as well as the frequency of viewing the commercials. It was determined that women watched more TV series compared to men; that there was a relationship between the number of TV series watched and the awareness level; and that women had a higher level of awareness compared to men, while those who are single had a higher level of awareness compared to those who are married, and those who are married had a higher level of awareness compared to those who are widowed. On the other hand, it was seen that a positive relationship existed between age, sex and education level variables and brand awareness.

However, little is known about how sprawl affects the cost of the most recurrent daily trip the trip to work. To explore the sprawl-work trip relationship, the study adopts a multilevel approach to private-vehicle commuting costs. The multilevel model attempts to determine which measure(s) of sprawl contribute(s) most to higher private-vehicle commuting costs at the household-level after controlling for congestion and average household expenditures on housing and transportation at the Metropolitan Statistical Area- (MSA-) level of analysis. Results show that one measure of sprawl street accessibility has a statistically significant though minimal effect on private-vehicle commuting costs and that such costs are higher in MSAs with more congestion and higher average household expenditures on public transportation. Overall, a multilevel approach suggests that congestion contributes more to higher private-vehicle commuting costs than sprawl. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, risk-taking also increases the incidence of large losses that lead to credit crunches and impose negative externalities on the real economy.

The main reason is that, despite the near-integrated dividend-price ratio, the convergence rates of the estimates are slowed down because the present value model implies a shrinking innovation variance on the predictor, an effect which is masked in a predictive regression analysis with exogenous constant covariance of innovations.

Output volatility is not associated with slower growth after controlling for institutions and the volatility of fiscal policy.","[Bleaney, Michael] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Halland, Havard] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",University of Nottingham; The World Bank,"Bleaney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,,,,,,,36,7,7,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We show that in portfolios where security specific effects have not been completely diversified, portfolio autocorrelation will not increase monotonically with increasing non-trading, as indicated in Lo and MacKinlay (1990). We show that at high levels of non-trading, portfolio autocorrelation will become a decreasing function of non-trading probability and may take negative values. We find that heterogeneity among the means, variances and betas of the component securities in a portfolio can act to increase the induced autocorrelation, particularly in portfolios containing fewer stocks. Security specific effects remain even when the number of securities in the portfolio is far in excess of that considered necessary to diversify security risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this respect, a comparative analysis of Romania's and Transylvania's tourist offering is carried out aiming at identifying the particularities of their development and the causes of their poor performance. The motivation for having chosen Transylvania resides in this region's attractiveness among foreign tourists; it is a destination with a high potential favoring the development of some tourist products competitive on the international market. Thus, based on a comprehensive secondary data analysis regarding the public lodging facilities, the paper presents their geographic dispersion, the development of the accommodation capacity by levels of classification, the number of available beds, the types of units, the structures' international affiliation, the main Romanian owners, etc. The dispersion by levels of classification, together with the net usage indexes of the accommodation capacity, characterize the performance of this industry. The research study emphasizes the fact that despite a high tourist potential, the present-day hospitality supply cannot support a healthy development of the tourist activity, and presents some possible causes.","[Coros, Monica Maria; Negrusa, Adina Letitia] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Coros, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",monica.coros@gmail.com,"Coros, Monica Maria/M-9434-2017; Negrusa, Adina Letitia/AAP-1453-2021; Negrusa, Adina Gh/C-1689-2012","Coros, Monica Maria/0000-0002-1966-8954; Negrusa, Adina Letitia/0000-0002-6164-3822; Negrusa, Adina Gh/0000-0002-6164-3822",,,,,14,10,10,0,6,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1312,1326,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900021,0

In this context of difficult macroeconomic conditions and a hardly predictable number of tourists, the suppliers of tourism services need a constant revision of strategy in order to increase their competitiveness and adapt to external market conditions. The main objective of this study is to investigate the competitive strategies that hotels managers in Mamaia resort, Romania, could adopt considering customers' expectations and hospitality industry best practices. In order to achieve this, a best practice benchmarking analysis was performed considering several locations on the seaside in France, Italy, Spain and Turkey. Following this analysis, several strategies are drafted, such as: use of social media, creation of packaged deals, targeting the business segment and advertising by using the cultural and historical context of the location. Moreover, a short survey among social media users revealed some of the tourists' expectations regarding their holidays at the Romanian Black Sea shore, such as quality of accommodation facilities, personalized services and entertainment possibilities.","[Munteanu, Adina-Roxana; Rizea, Raluca-Daniela; Ilie, Anca Gabriela; Sarbu, Roxana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Munteanu, AR (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",munteanu.adina@gmail.com,"Sarbu, Roxana/K-1659-2016; Munteanu, Adina Roxana/J-7151-2015; Sarbu, Roxana/Q-9937-2017","Munteanu, Adina Roxana/0000-0002-3045-2505;",,,,,32,1,1,0,30,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1253,1268,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900016,0

The second best portfolio was the naively diversified three-asset class portfolio.

It is widely considered a 'good thing' that has the potential not only to alleviate poverty and vulnerability, but also to generate more transformative outcomes in terms of empowerment and social justice. Based on an ethnographic study of the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), India's flagship social protection policy, this paper takes a critical look at what this policy's 'success' consists of. The study was carried out in Tamil Nadu, a state widely presented as a 'success' in terms of MGNREGA's implementation, and describes who participates in the scheme and how success is understood and expressed at different social and bureaucratic levels. In terms of MGNREGA's outcomes, we conclude that the scheme is benefitting the poorest households - and Dalits and women in particular - especially in terms of providing a safety net and as a tool for poverty alleviation. But the scheme does more than that. It has also produced significant transformative outcomes for rural labourers, such as pushing up rural wage levels, enhancing low-caste workers' bargaining power in the labour market and reducing their dependency on high-caste employers. These benefits are not only substantial but also transformative in that they affect rural relations of production and contribute to the empowerment of the rural labouring poor. However, in terms of creating durable assets and promoting grassroots democracy, the scheme's outcomes are much less encouraging.","[Carswell, Grace] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, Sussex, England; [De Neve, Geert] Univ Sussex, Dept Anthropol, Brighton BN1 9SJ, Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Carswell, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, Sussex, England.",g.carswell@sussex.ac.uk; g.r.de-neve@sussex.ac.uk,,"Carswell, Grace/0000-0002-8570-1337",ESRC [ES/F026633/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F026633/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,64,68,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Based on 5,087 SEOs from 1984 to 2007, we find a significantly negative relation between stock return synchronicity (estimated as the logit transformation of the R-squared statistic from a two-factor regression) and SEO discounts (the percentage differences between pre-offer day closing prices and offer prices). The negative relation is strongest when there is no analyst coverage, and it declines as analyst coverage increases. This shows that stock price is more informative when stock return synchronicity is higher and also that information asymmetry can be mitigated by analyst coverage. We further decompose stock return synchronicity into the market comovement and industry comovement components and find that both components are equally important in affecting SEO discounts.

Firms with financial expert CEOs hold less cash, more debt, and engage in more share repurchases. Financial expert CEOs are more financially sophisticated: they are less likely to use one companywide discount rate instead of a project-specific one, they manage financial policies more actively, and their firm investments are less sensitive to cash flows. Financial expert CEOs are able to raise external funds even when credit conditions are tight, and they were more responsive to the dividend and capital gains tax cuts in 2003. Analyzing CEO-firm matching based on financial experience, we find that financial expert CEOs tend to be hired by more mature firms.

Previous experimental studies have shown that positive and negative framing affects both gambles and incentive contracts. An agent's perception of bonus and penalty framing in a contract can determine the extent to which lottery risk and contractual risk are similar. We designed an experiment that tested the effect of bonus and penalty framed contracts on behavior under an implicit chance of failure. Moreover, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (NIRO to observe brain activity while participants viewed the contracts and purchased precautionary measures, We found that the dorsal striatum was more active during a penalty frame than a bonus frame. The study suggests that risk experienced by agents in an incentive contract is not comparable to risk experienced as a lottery.","[Ekins, W.

The book is laudable for its discussion of what constitutes a good life. Phelps argues that true life satisfaction cannot be achieved through a purposeless quest for wealth and material consumption, but rather through adventure, entrepreneurship, and creative endeavors. Weaknesses of the book include an overly glossy characterization of the period before World War II, a niggardly evaluation of European innovation, and the lack of convincing empirical evidence for the claim that the rate of innovation has slowed. These flaws are regrettable given the importance of the book's main message: innovation and creative entrepreneurship are not merely the keys to economic growth, but to life satisfaction as well. This essay discusses topics in entrepreneurship research linked to the book, including the link between innovation and entrepreneurship, the role of institutions for entrepreneurship, and the tendency of national accounts to under-record the social value of innovation and entrepreneurship. If the measures used do not capture the full social value of innovation, we are likely to underestimate the genuine rate of innovation. Government policy may also be misguided. Finally, the challenge to entrepreneurial capitalism posed by the postmodernist research paradigm is discussed.","Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Henrekson, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",magnus.henrekson@ifn.se,"Henrekson, Magnus/JXL-1358-2024","Henrekson, Magnus/0000-0002-1640-7126",,,,,83,15,19,1,86,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This study explores how an industrial policy program can affect the creation and evolution of an industry and, ultimately, the long-term performance of firms. We examine the history of the Brazilian bioethanol industry, focusing on the industrial policy program implemented by the Brazilian government in the 1970s to develop the industry. We put together a novel data set containing detailed information about the history of bioethanol producers. Our findings show that plants founded during the industrial policy program tend to be, in the long run, more productive than those founded before the program was in place. Based on additional analyses and complementary fieldwork, we infer that the wave of acquisitions that occurred after the end of the industrial policy program had an important effect on the performance of the plants founded when the program was in place. Industrial policy, especially in conjunction with a competitive post-industrial policy business landscape, can succeed in nurturing competitive firms.","[Mingo, Santiago] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Santiago, Chile; [Khanna, Tarun] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Harvard University,"Mingo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Av Diagonal Las Torres 2640 Penalolen, Santiago, Chile.",santiago.mingo@uai.cl; tkhanna@hbs.edu,"Mingo, Santiago/E-3987-2013","Mingo, Santiago/0000-0002-5181-7040",,,,,91,9,9,0,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

There is a vigorous ongoing debate on the appropriate specification of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve. A non-causal auto regression based estimation of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve approach enables us to avoid both potential weaknesses related to the Generalized Method of Moments estimation and a number of problems arise from the determination of marginal cost proxy without considering controversial ways in the literature. Our findings indicate that Hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve is valid for Turkish economy for both 1990s and 2000s and the role of forward looking behaviour has increased after implementing Inflation Targeting. Based on our findings, we inferred that the CBRT has become more effective for managing inflation expectations and monetary policy after adopting inflation targeting. However, inflation dynamics of the Turkish economy has still included inherited forms even under this regime. We indicated that this result has arisen from the failure of the CBRT to keep its inflation targets.","[Arabaci, Ozer] Uludag Univ, Dept Econometr, Bursa, Turkey; [Ozdemir, Metin] Uludag Univ, Dept Econ, Bursa, Turkey",Uludag University; Uludag University,"Arabaci, Ö (通讯作者)，Uludag Univ, Dept Econometr, Bursa, Turkey.",,"Arabacı, Özer/AAG-8285-2021; Özdemir, Metin/AAB-4251-2021","Özdemir, Metin/0000-0002-3944-4018",,,,,78,0,0,1,8,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

DICE is a wide-spread deterministic integrated assessment model of climate change. Climate change, long-term economic development, and their interactions are highly uncertain. The quantitative analysis of optimal mitigation policy under uncertainty requires a recursive dynamic programming implementation of integrated assessment models. Such implementations are subject to the curse of dimensionality. Every increase in the dimension of the state space is paid for by a combination of (exponentially) increasing processor time, lower quality of the value or policy function approximations, and reductions of the uncertainty domain. The paper promotes a state-reduced, recursive dynamic programming implementation of the DICE-2007 model. We achieve the reduction by simplifying the carbon cycle and the temperature delay equations. We compare our model's performance and that of the DICE model to the scientific AOGCM models emulated by MAGICC 6.0 and find that our simplified model performs equally well as the original DICE model. Our implementation solves the infinite planning horizon problem in an arbitrary time step. The paper is the first to carefully analyze the quality of the value function approximation using two different types of basis functions and systematically varying the dimension of the basis. We present the closed form, continuous time approximation to the exogenous (discretely and inductively defined) processes in DICE, and we present a numerically more efficient re-normalized Bellman equation that, in addition, can disentangle risk attitude from the propensity to smooth consumption over time.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Traeger, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",traeger@berkeley.edu,,,Directorate For Geosciences [1240507] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),,,41,39,44,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

To test this hypothesis, we construct new variables as well as original data sets, which are not readily available in the literature, and employ an alternative error correction model technique for a typical small open developing economy-Bangladesh. The transmission of exchange rate movements to import prices is found to be 'complete'; however, the 'second stage pass-through' is 'partial' both in the short and long run. The response of traded goods prices to exchange rate shocks is found to be significant and larger in the long run compared with the short run. Trade liberalization is also a significant phenomenon for ERPT. The analysis has wider applicability to other small open economies.","[Aziz, M.

Because contemporaneous inflation rates and output gaps are not observable at the time policy is set, policymakers must form nowcasts. The optimal nowcast will depend, in part, on forecast uncertainty whenever policymakers have asymmetric costs to over- and underpredicting inflation and output.

This study reviews this literature, disaggregating the available evidence by the different public sector contexts, particularly the different types of public sector jobs, the quality of the empirical study, and the economic context (developing country or OECD settings), with the aim of distilling useful lessons for policy-makers in developing countries. The overall findings of the review are generally positive across these contextual categories. In particular, the findings from high quality studies, based on a simple scoring method for internal and external validity, of PRP in public sector-equivalent jobs show that explicit performance standards linked to some form of bonus pay can improve the desired service outcomes, at times dramatically. This evidence primarily concerns craft jobs, such as teaching, health care, and revenue administration, apparently negating (at least in the short term) the behavioral economics concern about the crowding out of intrinsic incentives. The available evidence suggests that if policy-makers are sensitive to design and vigilant about the risks of gaming, then PRP may result in performance improvements in these jobs in developing countries. However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the review about the effect of PRP in core civil service jobs for three reasons. First, there are very few studies of PRP in these organizational contexts. The work of senior administrators in the civil service is very different from that of many private sector jobs and is characterized by task complexity and the difficulty of measuring outcomes. Second, although some studies have shown that PRP can work in even the most dysfunctional bureaucracies in developing countries, there are few cases illustrating its effectiveness or otherwise outside OECD settings. Finally, few studies follow PRP effects over time, providing little information on long-term effects and adjustments in staff behavior. We conclude that more empirical research is needed to examine the effects of PRP in the core civil service in developing countries.","[Hasnain, Zahid; Manning, Nick] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Pierskalla, Jan Henryk] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",The World Bank; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Hasnain, Z (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",zhasnain@worldbank.org; nmanning@worldbank.org; pierskalla.4@osu.edu,,,,,,,120,15,17,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

In a competitive environment with free entry, these alternative systems are inherently fragile in the sense that they are subject to socially costly bank runs. These social costs are not internalized by private individuals and banks and may exceed their social benefits. We argue that as communication technologies improve, the social benefits of fractional reserve banking decrease, but the private benefits may still exceed the private costs so that such systems continue to be used.

While excessive regulatory burden is often treated as a cause of corruption, this paper argues otherwise. It distinguishes regulatory policy, or de jure regulatory regimes from regulatory implementation and offers a more nuanced argument about the relationship between state regulations and bureaucratic corruption. The analysis of business survey data covering 25 post-communist economies demonstrates that mechanisms of regulatory implementation, rather than heavy-handed regulatory policy, are responsible for bribery. This analysis draws attention to the theoretical distinction between different types of regulatory hurdles and their differential effects on the quality of governance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact and interdependency of income tax incentives are crucial factors in the design of efficient tax policies. In this paper I exploit the variation in income taxes across U.S. states in the early 20th century to estimate these sensitivities. The potential endogeneity of state taxes is addressed using an instrumental variables approach. The results demonstrate that the relative taxation of corporate to personal income has a significant impact on the corporate share of economic activities. On average, a ten percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate is associated with a 0.2 to 0.3 percent decrease in the corporate share of economic activities, while a ten percentage point increase in the personal income tax rates applied to non-corporate income raises the corporate share of economic activities by 0.5 to 0.6 percent.","Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 1HP, England",University of Oxford,"Liu, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",li.liu@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,36,9,12,2,9,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

To this end, we argue that the general perception among environmental economists that standards are a very simple form of command and control regulation is too limited. Environmental policy standards often allow for flexibility. Moreover, other types of standards are often relevant for induced innovation and diffusion. Our broad perspective enables us to identify some interesting and important economic aspects of standards, such as their contribution to the diffusion of technologies with network externalities and the extent to which they are substitutes or complements to (other) environmental policy instruments. Finally, we discuss conditions for the successful use of standards by governments to stimulate eco-innovation.","[Vollebergh, Herman R.

A rise in income risk thus makes default less attractive, allowing creditors to relax borrowing limits. I show how, in an open economy, this endogenous financial deepening may reduce aggregate foreign assets in response to a rise in individual income risk, against the precautionary savings intuition.

Cultural tourism is the fastest growing segment of tourism in the world and is the desirable objective of new defined cultural policies in European cities. According to the European Commission (2012), it is estimated that cultural tourism accounts for around 40% of all European tourism. In general, the European Commission confirms the significant role of cultural tourism in the development of tourism in Europe and one of the most visible tools of this strategy is the designation of the ECoC. Cultural policy has also become an important tool of urban regeneration and in the rebranding of European cities. The case study of Kosice ECoC 2013 presents part of the results from the Kosice ECoC evaluation project. The Kosice ECoC 2013 project was designed as a community led project which was targeted at increasing the cultural consumption of residents rather than the number of foreign cultural tourists. However, the biggest events such as White night attracted a lot of tourists from the wider region. More than 70 million EUR was dedicated to investments, which have significantly improved the culture infrastructure in Kosice. The ECoC designation supported the local cultural buzz and led to new local production of modern culture, art and the creative industries. Other visible effects have already been seen in the advantages gained by the decentralization of the cultural infrastructure and events in the neighbourhoods. The involvement of people outside the city centre has avoided gentrification in the city. From this point of view the project Kosice ECoC 2013 has had the prerequisite to sustainable cultural tourism in Kosice.","[Sebova, Miriam; Dzupka, Peter; Hudec, Oto; Urbancikova, Natasa] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Sebová, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia.",Miriam.Sebova@tuke.sk,"Šebová, Miriam/AAE-3080-2020; Dzupka, Peter/AAD-7166-2019; Hudec, Oto/F-4898-2019; Urbancikova, Natasa/AAD-3113-2020; Dzupka, Peter/AAE-3199-2020","Šebová, Miriam/0000-0002-5157-5299; Hudec, Oto/0000-0002-8877-8647; Urbancikova, Natasa/0000-0002-2158-5517;",,,,,25,9,9,0,43,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2014,16.0,36,,,,,655,670,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AT0DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344607400015,0

We construct a contrarian flows measure by summing up the capital flows to stocks that go against the total flow of the aggregate market. We show that the contrarian flows are negatively influenced by the same-quarter consumption growth. During bad times, the majority of investors who are affected by the negative shock reduce their equity exposure, and these extra supplies of risky assets are absorbed by contrarian investors who are least affected by the consumption shock. Using quarterly stock market data, we find that the contrarian flows forecast market returns at short-to-intermediate horizons. The predictability stems from the component that is explained by the consumption growth, and therefore the consumption growth contains valuable information about the market risk premium. Moreover, the predictability is stronger for growth stocks than for value stocks, and hence it negatively predicts the value premium. This is because the contrarian flows measure the market risk premium and growth stocks bear more discount rate risk than value stocks. Out-of-sample tests show that the main results are robust to data-snooping bias. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This indicates that systematic influences are decisively underestimated particularly with regard to structured products like securitized tranches of collateralized debt obligations. Our analytical study addresses these systematic effects: We provide a simple model which allows a closed-form comparison of both bonds and tranches with respect to their systematic risk. We demonstrate that the exposure to systematic risk of tranches may be many times higher than the exposure of bonds, even if both products share the same rating grade, e.g., an 'AAA' rating, measured by either default probability or expected loss. Particularly in economic downturns, default rates of tranches may be multiples of those of bonds. Our results help understand high default rates of tranches during the financial crisis and show that classical ratings are insufficient metrics for measuring risks of structured products.","[Claussen, Arndt; Loehr, Sebastian; Roesch, Daniel] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Banking & Finance, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Löhr, S (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Banking & Finance, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",arndt.claussen@finance.uni-hannover.de; sebastian.loehr@finance.uni-hannover.de; daniel.roesch@finance.uni-hannover.de,,"Rosch, Daniel/0000-0002-2269-4045; Claussen, Arndt/0000-0002-8902-3334",,,,,30,0,2,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

This result suggests that the demand for final goods and, accordingly, the demand for materials including recycled material, have strong effects on the import volume of recyclable waste.

Using a sample of 36,343 forecasts issued for 411 European banks over 2003-2009, we find that forecasting abilities are negatively influenced by bank-specific risks, except market risk. We also find that forecasting abilities vary over time: during the crisis (insolvency, credit, liquidity and market specific) risks increase earnings forecast errors, whereas before the crisis they do not influence forecasting abilities as expected. Finally, we find that during the crisis all risk indicators significantly reduce forecasting abilities of both types of analysts (optimistic and pessimistic). Analysts' forecasting abilities prove to be worse at the height of the financial crisis, when increasing uncertainty and informational asymmetries are built-up by European banks. This questions the effectiveness of analysts in the market discipline process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Adopting the methodology of Beaudry et al. (2001), we introduce a new estimation procedure based on EGARCH to refine the framework developed by Baum et al. (2002, 2004, 2009) and Quagliariello (2007, 2009), and we analyze the relationship in the current industry context- i.e., in the context of market-based banking. Our results confirm that banks tend to behave more homogeneously vis-A-vis macroeconomic uncertainty. In particular, we find that both the cross-sectional dispersion of loans-to-assets and the cross-sectional dispersion of non-interest income share shrink during slow growth episodes, and particularly during financial crises, when the resilience of the banking system is at its lowest. More importantly, our main findings indicate that the cross-sectional dispersion of loans-to-assets has increased in the last decade, whereas the cross-sectional dispersion of non-interest income share appears to be more volatile and sensitive to macroeconomic shocks.

To circumvent the problems with unobserved heterogeneity, most recent studies use the correspondence testing approach (i.e. sending fictitious inquiries to landlords). In this study, we generalize the existing methodology in order to facilitate a test of to what extent the measured degree of discrimination depends on applicant, landlord/apartment, and regional characteristics. To show how this more general methodology can be implemented, we investigate the effects of gender, ethnicity, age, and employment status in the Swedish rental market for apartments. Our results confirm the existence of widespread discrimination against some of the groups, but also show that the degree of discrimination varies substantially with landlord, apartment, and regional characteristics. This heterogeneity highlights the importance of using a broad approach when conducting correspondence studies. Our results also allow us to interpret the nature of discrimination and how it relates to segregation and geographical sorting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Some assets follow the path of others with a small time lag. We provide indicators to measure this phenomenon using tick-by-tick data. Strongly asymmetric cross-correlation functions are empirically observed, especially in the future/stock case. We confirm the intuition that the most liquid assets (short intertrade duration, narrow bid/ask spread, small volatility, high turnover) tend to lead smaller stocks. However, the most correlated stocks are those with similar levels of liquidity. These lead/lag relationships become more and more pronounced as we zoom on significant events. We reach 60% of accuracy when forecasting the next midquote variation of the lagger using only the past information of the leader, which is significantly better than using the information of the lagger only.

Bayesian Monte Carlo methods are employed to evaluate NKDSGE model fit. Simulation experiments show that internal consumption habit often improves the ability of NKDSGE models to match the spectra of output and consumption growth. Nonetheless, the fit of NKDSGE models with internal consumption habit is susceptible to the sources of nominal rigidity, to spectra identified by permanent productivity shocks, to the choice of monetary policy rule, and to the frequencies used for evaluation.

Unlike private pension plans, public funds undertake more risk if they are underfunded and have lower investment returns in the previous years, consistent with the risk transfer hypothesis. Furthermore, pension funds in states facing fiscal constraints allocate more assets to equity and have higher betas. There also appears to be a herding effect in that CalPERS equity allocation or beta is mimicked by other pension funds. Finally, our results suggest that government accounting standards strongly affect pension fund risk, as higher return assumptions (used to discount pension liabilities) are associated with higher equity allocation and portfolio beta.

Under purchase accounting, acquired assets are reported at their transaction value, which typically exceeds the target's pre-merger book value. Thus, measured q tends to be lower for the merged firm than for the portfolio of pre-merger entities. Because conglomerates are more acquisitive than focused firms, their q tends to be lower. To mitigate this bias, I subtract goodwill from the book value of assets and a substantial part of the diversification discount is eliminated. Market-to-sales-based measures do not have this bias.","Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Custódio, C (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,"Custodio, Claudia/AAS-6496-2020","Custodio, Claudia/0000-0003-4048-0312",,,,,31,46,58,4,93,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

We show that these methods produce inconsistent estimates and can distort inference. In contrast, the fixed effects estimator is consistent and should be used instead.

Yet both the Austrian and the Keynesian interpretations of the Depression were incomplete. Austrians could explain how a country might get into a depression (bust following a credit-fueled investment boom) but not how to get out of one (liquidation). Keynesians could explain how a country might get out of a depression (government spending on public works) but not how it got into one (animal spirits). By contrast, the monetary approach of Gustav Cassel has been ignored. As early as 1920, Cassel warned that mismanagement of the gold standard could lead to a severe depression. Cassel not only explained how this could occur, but his explanation anticipates the way that scholars today describe how the Great Depression actually occurred. Unlike Keynes or Hayek, Cassel analyzed both how a country could get into a depression (deflation due to tight monetary policies) and how it could get out of one (monetary expansion).","Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College,"Irwin, DA (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",Douglas.irwin@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,73,11,13,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Instead, we propose alternative explanations for this phenomenon. In particular, we show that incentive fees can mechanistically create a kink in the net return distribution. This mechanism accounts for almost the entire kink observed in the large, liquid Long-Short Equity style. Furthermore, we show that asset illiquidity and the bounding of yields at zero can generate distribution discontinuities as well. Therefore, we conclude that the observed hedge fund return discontinuities are not direct proof of manipulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper tests the robustness of the skill difference term in the knowledge-capital model for FDI in a sample of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The evidence in this paper indicates that skill differences per se do not properly explain FDI: the skill level of the host country is also important. This paper argues that both horizontal and vertical FDI may increase in the skill level of the host. It follows that the distinction between vertical and horizontal motivations for FDI with respect to skills is less straightforward than generally assumed in the literature.,"Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Lankhuizen, M (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.b.m.lankhuizen@vu.nl,"Lankhuizen, Maureen/ABA-9241-2021","Lankhuizen, Maureen/0000-0001-7683-6283",,,,,19,5,7,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

It also aims to encourage a new and wider research framework regarding the implications of economic policies' use on consumers' perception. The results of the study indicate that the early stage of renewable energy use and the prospect of influencing the consumer behaviour in a way to increase the market performance, through the development of strategies oriented towards sustainable energy consumption, can have a positive impact on companies' responsibility.

Data from a qualitative sociological study is used here to explore the difference that cultural meanings make to cycling practices in four different English urban areas. Specifically, we discuss differences between places with established cycling cultures and those with newer cycling cultures. Drawing on concepts from practice theory we discuss the role that cultures of cycling play within the four places, and suggest how the meanings of cycling, including its association with other social identities, are connected to the materials and competences seen as necessary for cycling. Our research highlights the embedding of transport in local as well as national cultures, and the associated need for policy-makers to take culture seriously in considering how to shift transport practices.

However, organizations do not seem to learn from their mistakes, rarely exploring the reasons for their projects' success or failure, and very rarely applying those lessons learned to the business management. In fact, there is little or no point in learning unless management adapts its behavior accordingly. Usually top management does not give sufficient resources for activities such as reflecting and learning. Another recurrent problem is the timing for the lessons identification, only at the end of a project, which is clearly insufficient. This research is focused on assessing the organizational environment in order to properly explore the factors and dependencies amongst the social demographic variables.

The constructed model is based on estimation techniques of HMM, where the classification is formed by only assigning probabilities expressed by a linear function of observed characteristics. Classify with hidden markov model such as statistical methods is equivalent to determine a discriminative model, which endows our method with a solid probabilistic interpretation.

We use the concept of structural VAR models, widely used approach next to the DSGE and simultaneous equations models. We estimate four and five variable VAR containing the key macroeconomic indicators and identify monetary transmission mechanism using SVAR. Using different identification schemes and impulse response functions we compare the effect of a restrictive monetary policy shock on the set of analyzed variables, especially price level. We also compare the results of defined models for the Czech and Polish economies, that both intend to enter EMU. To avoid the possibility of a price puzzle effect, as a result of mixing policy regimes in the sample period, we use data from single monetary policy regime starting 1998, when the Czech central bank switched to the inflation targeting regime. The results indicate high sensitivity to the identification schemes in SVAR and not significant differences between responses to monetary policy shock in CR and Poland.","[Bisova, Sara Biza; Husek, Roman] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bisová, SB (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchilla Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",sara.bisova@gmail.com; husek@vse.cz,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,3,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This paper addresses the problem of how to ensure that you will have the capabilities in place to know when your project can no longer deliver value and to take appropriate action. It does not discuss in detail the technical issues of project management execution, as a well-executed project can still fail to deliver value. Rather, it looks at the specific question of knowing when projects can no longer deliver value and putting measures in place to both prevent and address project escalation. We show how a capability based approach supported by the IT-CMF framework can improve your ability to quickly identify projects that have started but now can no longer deliver value.

At present, flood risk reduction is seriously taken into consideration by relevant authorities taking mitigation actions to save lives and properties. Literature on gender and disasters shows the importance of gender in disaster mitigation to bring better results. Thus the present study is an attempt to understand the importance of gender dimension in a flood disaster risk reduction project implemented in Sri Lanka. The study was conducted in two Grama Niladari divisions Pamunuwila and Galedanda in the Gampaha district where the project cleaning Natha Ela was implemented during in to address the issue related to floods in the area. The overall objective of the research was to understand, whether gender has been adequately addressed in the project management cycle of the flood risk reduction project and its consequences. The study revealed that women were more vulnerable to the flood disaster compared to men, due to differences in employment status, income, gendered social roles, social norms and restrictions governing behaviour. Even though the communities experienced a significant reduction of flood damages after the project implementation, the impact on the community could have been much greater if the project had considered the gender aspects related to floods. The study thus reinforces the argument that gender planning is vital for any development activity. In the case of cleaning the Natha ela project, gender was neutral from the planning stage to the implementation stage. The low representation of the women in the decision making process also contributed to the lack of gender sensitivity in the project. Thus the study clearly revealed that although disasters affect both men and women, the impact could be different and therefore mitigation efforts need to addresses such differences to make both men and women resilient to flood disaster.

However, public sector employment does affect the sectoral composition of the private sector. Specifically, each additional public sector job creates 0.5 jobs in the non-tradable sector (construction and services) while crowding out 0.4 jobs in the tradable sector (manufacturing). When using data for a longer time period (1999-2007) we find no multiplier effect for non-tradables, stronger crowding out for tradables and, consistent with this, crowding out for total private sector employment.

Information technology (IT) infrastructure is altered by the business methods due to cloud computing and moved ahead towards a utility model of 'pay as you go'. Instead of spending time with constructing, managing, maintaining and running their own physical infrastructure, now firms can host their applications, platforms and storage in data centers on virtual servers supported by professional third parties. Such services based out of the 'cloud' assist agile and cost efficient business surroundings. The most essential economic influence of cloud technology could exist in developed competitiveness and cost savings of existing IT services, as well as in introducing new services to private and public companies. Because of the bulk buying of hardware and processing power, demand aggregation, and decreased costs of labor per unit, cloud providers can achieve essential savings on their running price and pass these on to their customers. Businesses can utilize the cloud computing technologies, thereby using better equipment with more flexibility, being faster, and having lower expenditures of capital. Customers of cloud computing technologies make data an online content interactive and accessible for users. Given the importance of cloud computing, not many studies have been conducted from the adoption perspective and, in particular, have not sought to identify factors of risk in the most popular cloud computing deployment model, which is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

The projection is based on the results of the latest available population projection published by the Czech Statistical Office in 2013. The expected number of employees (payers of the old-age insurance premium) is estimated on the basis of the sex and age structure of people in productive age and expected employment rates. All people at the age higher than retirement age are expected to receive old-age pension. The permanent increase of retirement age according to the present legislation is assumed. The computations show that the financial deficit of the old-age pension system would reach maximum values in the fifties when the numerous generations born in the seventies of the last century will reach the pension age. But in the last two decades of the present century the proportion of pensioners would be lower than at present times.,"[Fiala, Tomas; Langhamrova, Jitka] Univ Econ, Dept Demog, Fac Informat & Stat, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Fiala, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Demog, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",fiala@vse.cz; langhamj@vse.cz,"Langhamrová, Jitka/Z-2115-2019",,,,,,26,5,5,0,15,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We further modify and extend that model to measure TFP change with NPLs. We find that the inefficiency levels are significantly different among the three ownership structure of banks in India. Foreign banks have strong market position in India and they pull the production frontier in a more efficient direction. SPBs and domestic private banks show considerably higher inefficiency.

One of the key reasons for people in developing countries to be more vulnerable to natural disasters than their wealthier counterparts is the limited capacities in their construction industries. Among the people in developing countries, women are evidently even more vulnerable to natural disasters. Due to higher disaster vulnerability of women, recognising the different roles, capacities, vulnerabilities and needs of women, and considering them in disaster risk reduction in the built environment is significant to reduce women's disaster vulnerabilities. Gender mainstreaming as a way of bringing a gender perspective into disaster risk reduction can be applied to recognise the varying needs and capacities of women, and integrate them into disaster risk reduction in the built environment. The paper in this context aims to demonstrate how gender mainstreaming helps to bring a women's perspective into disaster risk reduction in the built environment. It identifies two main steps which involve in the process, identification of women's DRR knowledge and needs, and integration of the identified DRR knowledge and needs into DRR in the built environment. The paper provides an account of the process that the study established to incorporate a gender perspective into disaster risk reduction in the built environment based on a case study conducted in Sri Lanka. It further discusses how the social, economic, political and environmental context influences the process of gender mainstreaming in disaster risk reduction in the built environment (C) 2014 The Authors.

Estimates from the Health and Retirement Study for respondents in their early fifties suggest that pension wealth is about 82% as valuable as Social Security wealth. In data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), for members of the same cohort, measured when they are 65-69, pension incomes are about 58% as valuable as incomes from Social Security. Our empirical analysis uses data from the HRS to examine the reasons for these differences in the contributions of pensions as measured in income and wealth data. Key factors accounting for these differences include: a difference in methodology between surveys affecting what is included in pension income; some pension wealth disappears' at retirement because respondents change their pension into other forms that are not counted as pension income; and the form of annuitization may influence the measure of pension income. A series of caveats notwithstanding, the bottom line is that CPS data on pension incomes received in retirement understates the full contribution pensions make to supporting retirees.","[Gustman, Alan L.; Tabatabai, Nahid] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Gustman, Alan L.] NBER, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Steinmeier, Thomas L.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Gustman, AL (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",Alan.L.Gustman@Dartmouth.edu; Thomas.Steinmeier@ttu.edu; Nahid.Tabatabai@Dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Sri Lanka has extensive coverage of national policies regarding the outlined societal challenges. Therefore the issue lies not in policy availability but its implementation. Policy implementation needs to be consolidated by tackling the following: Lack of awareness, transparency and enforcement of existing national policies; Lack of facilities, resources and training to retain existing skilled personnel and to establish the next generation; Lack of funding and financial incentives for local development and Public Private Partnerships (PPPs); Lack of linkages between Government, Research & Development institutions, universities and industry (again PPPs can be beneficial) and thereby increase technical support. Central coordination is crucially required, as responsibilities are split across multiple Ministries and Government institutes and lack of committed funding lead to duplication and dormant policies. In addition to these areas for improvement, some future priorities were utilising a bottom up approach via decentralisation of authority and investment in localised networks and the promotion of multi-disciplinary research to facilitate competitive, market innovation.

In the present study, recent socio-economic aspects of CCS technologies are discussed. Although real cost estimation for CCS is generally considered a difficult task, an estimated relatively high cost and energy requirements of these technologies, along with an uncertainty over public acceptance of CCS, appear major barriers to the deployment of a substantial commercial market, constraining the economic viability and policy making for the application of CCS. The full life-cycle cost of CCS must be considered in an overall social/environmental/economic/political context. Social research conducted using various tools can provide an insight into several factors influencing and shaping public awareness and perceptions of CCS, in order to promote communication of expert knowledge and participation, and to enhance the required social acceptance for the advancement of these technologies.

Firstly that there is a gap in the resilience literature, and to show that electricity needs to play a more central role in all the academic research fields associated with ' disasters' and ' resilient cities'. Design/methodology/approach: Two approaches were used, database interrogation and establishing areas of expertise in the resilience and disaster case study literature. Firstly a database search was carried out, and the ' keyword' and 'abstract' fields searched for electricity related words. Then academic papers, and reports by public bodies were analysed to establish which academic disciplines are most active in this area of research. Findings: This paper shows; that only 3.9% of the 4127 papers analyzed, had key words connected to electricity, and that there is not a specific discipline within the resilience literature looking explicitly at how electricity effects the built environment. Research implications: This paper implies that the role of electricity, in the academic literature associated with resilience, is under represented. A future research agenda should be developed that more adequately reflects the importance of electricity to the resilience of the built environment. Originality/value This paper is the first to analyses the literature to understand how important the continuity of electrical supply is to the resilient-cities and disaster management academic communities, and has highlighted this theme as a gap in the literature.

Since the parametric estimation procedure is based on an a priori distribution, its misspecification can lead to the inconsistency of the estimators. Therefore non-parametric approach, in which both model's parameters and the distribution of error terms are estimated from the data, seems to be a better alternative. In our work, we propose a non-parametric technique with the use of a heuristic called differential evolution to estimate the parameters of a GARCH-M model. This technique can more likely reach to a global solution of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) task. Further, it can also more effectively control the required properties of the estimates. The suitability of our approach is verified on modeling the CZK/USD and CZK/EURO forward exchange rate premium of period from 2007 to 2012 by a GARCH-M model.","[Kukal, Jaromir] Czech Tech Univ, Trojanova 13, CZ-12000 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Quang Van Tran] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kukal, J (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Trojanova 13, CZ-12000 Prague 2, Czech Republic.",jaromir.kukal@fjfi.cvut.cz; tran@vse.cz,"Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022",,,,,,25,4,4,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We find that non-interest activities of Asian banks reduce risk, but do not increase profitability on a broad sample basis. Specifically, when considering bank specialization and a country's income level, the results become complicated. Non-interest activities decrease profitability as well as increases risk for savings banks. The impact is also different for commercial, cooperative, and investment banks either by increasing profitability or reducing risk. On the other hand, non-interest activities raise risk for banks in high income countries, while increasing profitability or reducing risk for banks in middle and low income countries. Finally, our results reveal that the persistence of risk is greatly affected by bank specialization and a country's income level, as all risk variables present persistence from one year to the next. Our findings suggest that the type of bank specialization matters for the effect of diversifying revenue sources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This ability is nowadays seen as more and more important in our every day interaction with people. We make decisions within an organization, cooperate with colleagues and deal with our business partners and customers. In all of these situations we use our knowledge ( IQ), practical skills (AQ) and personal characteristics (SQ). These three elements form a model of holistic competence as described by professor Porvaznik. But which of these elements can we consider as the most important? Or do they have the same value? In our research we work with the concept of social maturity which is based on personal characteristics. We try to demonstrate how important this part of managers' competence is in their everyday decision making. The main aim of this paper is to identify the main characteristics contained within the framework of social maturity and their influence on managerial success. The article is supplemented by information from quantitative research conducted among respondents from the Czech and Slovak Republic. We examined the position and importance of the concept of holistic competence and one of its parts - social maturity among managers.","Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Macková, Z (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic.",zuzana.bocincova@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,107,114,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000014,0

Usually, the most developed countries allocate the largest resources for these areas and have the best performance, but the relations are not very strong though. Furthermore, it is often shown that the values of the output social indicators are not congruent with those of the public expenditure, as other factors of influence interfere, such as those related to system management, the behaviour of the population, from the interest for school and performance, when we speak of education, to the lifestyle and feeding habits, when speaking about the health state.

Controlling for place of current employment (academic institution with graduate program, academic institution-undergraduate only, government, for-profit institution) and decade of PhD, the authors find many areas in which economists agree. However, important differences exist in the views of male and female economists on issues including the minimum wage, views on labor standards, health insurance, and especially on explanations for the gender wage gap and issues of equal opportunity in the labor market and the economics profession itself. These results lend support to the notion that gender diversity in policy-making circles may be an important aspect in broadening the menu of public policy choices.

The framework can be applied also for mapping innovation strategies in specific industries and describing their technological evolution. The methodology is tested on a sample of 133 companies, by analysing their patents applied from 2008 to 2012. From the analysis of the behaviours of companies, a preponderance of exploitation strategies that lead to radical outputs is detected.

The motivation for this research is to determine whether this was the case, that is, is the generation of students that took the national matriculation exam more successful than the previous generation of students,which did not. This paper aims to investigate whether the introduction of national matriculation has resulted in enrolmentof higher quality students, who achieve higher average grade, better pass rate and completion within the stipulated duration of studies, than the students enrolled prior to introduction of national matriculation.

This research explores the reported experiences of disabled people related to the 2010-2011 Christchurch, New Zealand earthquake series. Methods: Qualitative inquiry involving purposive sampling and face to face interviews with 23 disabled people living in Christchurch during the earthquakes. The qualitative research was followed by a pilot quantitative survey involving 25 disabled people living in Christchurch during the earthquakes and 10 people who work in the disability sector. Qualitative interview material was analysed using thematic analysis while quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: Disabled people preferred to shelter in place as their homes are organised to suit their specific needs. Our research suggests that urban disaster risk reduction strategies are needed that enhance opportunities for disabled people to maintain autonomy in an emergency situation. Key factors identified by participants that increase earthquake vulnerability among disabled people include a lack of personal disaster preparedness, public information that is not disability accessible and social isolation. Resilience was enhanced through disaster preparedness planning and good support networks. Implications: Individuals, communities and responding agencies could learn from the experiences of disabled people in order to improve preparation and response to disasters for vulnerable groups. Disaster recovery should be seen as an opportunity to reduce risk through avoiding recreating the conditions of vulnerability that may have existed previously. (C) 2014 The Authors.

On the other hand, firms start to lose their access to the public debt market. As a result, firms associated with high degrees of information asymmetry can only issue private debt and face the relatively low debt capacities provided in the private debt market.

Transparency and reliability of financial reporting has been and still is a severe problem in Serbia. This study contributes to the existing literature by examining financial reporting transparency in transitional economies and especially by focusing on the extent to which the stage of capital market development affects the quality and quantity of financial reporting.

This is due to the advantages offered by participation in such networks, e. g. access to the resources of partners, the opportunity to learn from partners, reduction of risk, etc. Even the negative aspects of functioning within the network do nothing to reduce the attractiveness of this concept. It should be noted, however, that any inter-organizational cooperation is combined with the likelihood that certain negative phenomena may arise, i.e. pathologies which reduce the attractiveness of this type of activity. Some of these pathologies are similar to those occurring in any organization, while the others are a specific feature of network organizations. The aim of the paper is to analyse the pathologies most frequently observed in inter-organizational networks. In contrast to pathologies resulting from a specific network structure (hereinafter referred to as structural pathologies) we have labelled such phenomena simple pathologies. Our analysis begins with a presentation of the importance of network organizations in contemporary business. We then present the major pathologies in networks and the varieties thereof. Subsequently, a comparison is made between pathologies in the organization vs. the pathologies in the networks. Finally, we have described the ways to avoid pathologies in networks, as well as summarised the potential solutions. The paper utilises the publications available in the literature, as well as the authors' experience in creating network organizations. Although it is impossible to identify a universal solution to the issue of pathologies in the networks (because their sources are complex and systemic in nature), knowledge of such phenomena can reduce the risk of their re-occurrence.

We develop a network representation of the origination market and demonstrate that it is a small world, in that most nodes are close in the network. We then rank-order the interlinked aggregators and securitizers using ex post mortgage foreclosure rates as a proxy for performance. Our findings suggest that these significant interlinkages in the mortgage-origination network represent a previously underappreciated source of systemic risk.

For example, according to some statistic evaluations and mesurements in Continental region of Croatia there has been achieved only 5% overnight stays of the total number. The main reason of the current condition in the tourist sector of Croatia in domain of rural tourism is the previous focus of national tourist politics exclusively on development and promotion of the tourist product Sun, Sea and Sand. Building on the presented, there is absence of common cooperation culture among small economic subjects, in this case with other tourist shares, which are geographically concentrated, and have potential effects in the segment of rural tourism.

In contrast with the conventional wisdom, the results show that high-poverty block groups had closer proximity to the nearest supermarket than other block groups did, on average: 85.6% of high-poverty block groups had a supermarket within 1 mile, while 76.8% of lower-poverty block groups had a supermarket within this distance. Population density is a strong predictor of proximity to the nearest supermarket. Block groups with very high population density generally had very close proximity to a nearest supermarket. In block groups lacking a nearby supermarket, rates of automobile access generally were quite high (more than 95%), although this still leaves almost 5% of the population in these areas lacking both an automobile and a nearby supermarket.","[Wilde, Parke; Llobrera, Joseph] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Ploeg, Michele Ver] USDA, ERS, Washington, DC 20024 USA",Tufts University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Wilde, P (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",parke.wilde@tufts.edu; joseph.llobrera@tufts.edu; sverploeg@ers.usda.gov,"; Wilde, Parke/B-6011-2009","Ver Ploeg, Michele/0000-0001-8476-7281; Wilde, Parke/0000-0002-9596-9230",,,,,21,14,20,1,21,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

There are two categories, sensitivity tests and scenario tests. Fora scenario test, the correlation matrix is adjusted to mimic the situation under an underlying stress event. It is only natural that when some correlations are altered, the other correlations (peripheral correlations) should vary as well. However, most existing methods ignore this potential change in peripheral correlations. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian correlation adjustment method to give a new correlation matrix for a scenario test based on the original correlation matrix and views on correlations such that peripheral correlations are altered according to the dependence structure of empirical correlations. The algorithm of posterior simulation is also extended so that two correlations can be updated in one Gibbs sampler step. This greatly enhances the rate of convergence. The proposed method is applied to an international stock portfolio dataset. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Yu, Philip L. H.; Li, W. K.; Ng, F.

We also addressed issues related to the perception of beneficiaries on the absorption of structural funds, problems, recommendations, and expectations. The disparity between this situation and the allocated sums is further amplified by the results that indicate the highest absorption rate for the Regional Operational Program(41,5%) and Developing Administrative Capacity. Operational Program (40,06%), while the operational programs with the lowest absorption rate are Transport OP(19,8%) and Economic OP (17,5%). While most new member states focus on OP Transport and OP Environment, in Romania the situation has remained unchanged each year, that is Regional Operational Program has top priority ahead of any operational program.

Methodology: We exposed subjects to six scenarios based on combination of: (1) two managerial styles (authoritative vs. participative) and (2) three levels of manager's readiness to provide benefits for employees. Than we measured overall employees' satisfaction and adherence to the organization's objectives. We also enacted supplementary psychometric testing (MBTI), widely used in managerial research. Results were processed: (1) Empirically, as micro case-studies; with direct managerial and pedagogic implications. (2) Statistically, using correlation analysis; bringing wider theoretical generalizations. Findings: Best managerial strategy is based on a naturally equilibrated relation between manager's authority and readiness to provide benefits. It's when the employees manifest highest overall satisfaction and adherence to the company objectives. Other interesting finding: Level of current employee's benefits does not primarily affect their overall satisfaction; low level of benefits could be outweighed by a good managerial communication strategy, and vice-versa; high level of benefits will not generate maximum employees' satisfaction if manager does not show certain authority. Conclusion: Based on the results, we suggest a new theory of leadership triangle, consisting in an equilibrated relation between manager's authority, respect to employees' needs and adherence to the common objectives. This is applicable at the level of individual interpersonal communication as well as at the global organization level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis deals with the use of the recently proposed 'delay vector variance' (DVV) method, which examines local predictability of a signal in the phase space to detect the presence of determinism and nonlinearity in a time series. Optimal embedding parameters used in the DVV analysis are obtained via a differential entropy based method using wavelet-based surrogates. We exploit the concept of recurrence plots to study the stock market to locate hidden patterns, non-stationarity, and to examine the nature of these plots in events of financial crisis. In particular, the recurrence plots are employed to detect and characterize financial cycles. A comprehensive analysis of the feasibility of this approach is provided. We show that our methodology is useful in the diagnosis and detection of financial bubbles, which have significantly impacted economic upheavals in the past few decades. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Using around 500,000 quarterly observations on the population of U. S. insured commercial banks over the 1995-2009 period, I document that the ratio of subordinated debt affects bank risk management decisions consistent with the market discipline hypothesis only when subordinated debt is held by the parent holding company. In particular, the subordinated debt ratio increases the likelihood and the extent of interest rate derivatives use for risk management purposes at bank holding company (BHC)-affiliated banks, where subordinated debt holders have a better access to information needed for monitoring and control rights provided by equity ownership. At non-affiliated banks, a higher subordinated debt ratio leads to risk management decisions consistent with moral hazard behavior. The analysis also shows that the too-big-to-fail protection prevents market discipline even at BHC-affiliated banks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The models that we use address momentum and the interaction between different rates.

Risky discounts such as Scratch-and-Save promotions are relatively new retail tools with very little existing research. Previous work in discount claims focuses on perceptions of the offer, whereas this study focuses on perceptions of the outcome and provides managers with information for implementing risky discounts. Across four studies, experiments with a variety of discount levels and reference prices are used to gather consumers' responses to disparities between suggested and actual discounts. This paper finds that consumers perceive a promotional offering, which is smaller than the reference discount, as more unfair and less enjoyable, even when they still get a deal. However, consumers perceive a discount greater than the reference discount only as fair and enjoyable as the reference discount. Furthermore, poor outcomes are evaluated with severe negativity in terms of perceived fairness and enjoyment, whereas beneficial outcomes garner only moderate positivity, which is consistent with the combination of prospect theory and egocentric fairness. Nevertheless, perceptions of increased unfairness arising from risky discounts have no negative bearing on future purchase intentions, but rather result in positive attitudes and optimism for future risky discounts.

We abandon the usual assumption that patents bring known benefits to the industry or that their benefits are known to all parties. When royalty payments are increasing in one's patent portfolio, as is implicitly the case in FRAND agreements, private information about the quality of patents leads to a variety of distortions, in particular the incentives of firms to pad' by contributing patents that are inessential' for the given standard, a phenomenon that seems to be widespread. Several results emerge from the analysis: (i) the number of inessential patents co-varies positively with the number of essential patents; (ii) there is over-investment relative to the second-best, that is when padding cannot be avoided and (iii) the threat of disputes reduces incentives to pad but at the cost of lower production of strong patents; (iv) mitigating this undesirable side-effect calls for a simultaneous increase in the cost of padding, through a better filtering of patent applications.","[Dewatripont, Mathias; Legros, Patrick] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Dewatripont, Mathias; Legros, Patrick] CEPR, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Dewatripont, M (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, 50 Ave FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",,,,,,,,24,10,11,3,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

We perform the analysis considering separately financial crisis periods and non-crisis periods. We find that VaR methods perform differently for portfolios with different market capitalization. For portfolios with stocks of different sizes we obtain better VaR estimates when taking market capitalization into account. We also find that it is important to consider crisis and non-crisis periods separately when estimating VaR across different sizes.

We measure the transmission of shocks between markets using a modified version of the spillover index of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009). The results show that the transmission of shocks between countries which did impose short sale bans was reduced and transmissions from countries with bans to countries without bans were also generally lower. In contrast, short sale bans did not provide protection from shocks emanating from countries which did not impose bans, as shocks from non-banning markets tended to have an increased impact on other markets during periods where bans were in place.

Using panel data on up to 30 emerging markets in the period 1993-2008 we confirm this hypothesis. Higher levels of fiscal and political decentralization increase sovereign default risk.

The results show that efficiency decreases as the number of the financial sectors that are supervised by the central bank increases.

Under the assumption that wages in the advanced agricultural sector are higher than in the traditional agricultural sector, this paper analyzes the effect of policies to promote advanced agricultural development with the comparative static method. The main conclusions of this paper are: wage subsidization of the advanced agricultural sector, in addition to having the same economic impact as interest subsidies on the advanced agricultural sector, could also increase the land employment in the advanced agricultural sector and reduce that in the traditional agricultural sector. Therefore, the effect of wage subsidizing policies is stronger than that of interest subsidies, while land rent subsidies for the advanced agricultural sector have the same economic effect as wage subsidies.","[Li Xiaochun; Shen Qin; Gu Chunlei; Ni Meng] Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Li, XC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiaochun@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,19,1,1,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

To explore these questions, we examine the results of a recent survey of tax policy experts who are members of the National Tax Association (NTA). We compare those responses to two previous surveys - one conducted in 1994 of NTA members and the other in 1934 of U.S. public finance professors. We also survey the general public on a subset of the questions asked of the NTA members, and discover a large divergence between the answers of the NTA respondents and those of the public. We suspect, but cannot prove, that part of the divergence arises because experts are trained to think of policy changes in a balanced-budget framework, so that supporting a tax cut must also mean raising some other tax or cutting some government expenditures. Absent that connection, lower taxes and narrow bases can indeed look attractive.","[Lim, Diane] Pew Charitable Trusts, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Slemrod, Joel] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Slemrod, Joel] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wilking, Eleanor] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Lim, D (通讯作者)，Pew Charitable Trusts, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",dlim@pewtrusts.org; jslemrod@umich.edu; ewilking@umich.edu,,,,,,,10,12,12,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The findings suggest that the long-run and short-run relationships between the stock market and the three risk ratings variables of each country respond asymmetrically to shocks for all of the five BRICS, but at different speeds and depending on the direction of the shock, underpinning the differences in profit opportunities among these countries. The adjustment is faster for the individual BRICS following a positive shock (than a negative shock), except for Russia.

We start from a careful modeling of optimal price setting allowing for nonunitary factor substitution, nonneutral technical change, and time-varying factor utilization rates. This ensures the resulting real marginal cost measures match volatility reductions and level changes witnessed in many U.S. time series. The cost measure comprises conventional countercyclical cost elements plus procyclical (and covarying) utilization rates. Although procyclical elements seem to dominate, the components of real marginal cost components are becoming less cyclical over time. Incorporating this richer driving variable produces more plausible price-stickiness estimates than otherwise and suggests a more balanced weight of backward- and forward-looking inflation expectations than commonly found. Our results challenge existing views of inflation determinants and have important implications for modeling inflation in New Keynesian models.","[McAdam, Peter; Willman, Alpo] European Cent Bank, Res Dept, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"McAdam, P (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England.",peter.mcadam@ecb.europa.eu; alpo.willman@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,58,8,8,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Daily traffic congestion, reduced productivity and loss of income, air pollution, environmental degradation and significant energy consumption are only a few outcomes of the millions of miles travelled every day on the region's highways and streets. An important response to this significant urban challenge has been the desire for further expansion of an efficient public transportation network and increasing densities in particular areas within the larger metropolitan region. In this paper, we estimate the current energy consumption patterns in various communities, arguing that policy attempts to achieve higher density and better jobs-housing balance should fully consider the social geography of our metropolitan areas and their close relationship with energy consumption patterns.

The regulator faces a trade-off: high capital requirements cause a drop in the banks' profitability, whereas strict supervision reduces the scope of intermediation and is costly for taxpayers. We show that a mix of both instruments minimises the costs of preventing the collapse of financial intermediation. Once we allow for cross-border banking, the optimal policy is not feasible. If domestic supervisory effort is not observable, our model predicts a race to the bottom in capital requirement regulation.

Our evidence supports this theoretical prediction, revealing that the reluctance to part with a debt financed asset causes two decision errors-(1) participants forego investments that increase firm value and (2) participants accept investments that decrease firm value. When the source of finance is equity, participants are less likely to make either of these costly decision errors. Further, we find that higher unpaid principal accentuates participants' reluctance to part with debt financed assets. Finally, the decision errors stem, in part, from the perception that an asset having a large unpaid principal balance has provided lower past benefits than an otherwise identical asset.

We find that outside the crisis period, stock prices increased as a response to unexpected FFR cuts. State dependence is identified with stocks exhibiting larger increases when interest rate easing coincided with recessions, bear markets, and tightening credit conditions. However, an important structural shift occurred during the crisis, changing the stocks' response to FFR shocks and the nature of state dependence. Throughout the crisis period, stocks did not react positively to unexpected FFR cuts, which were interpreted as signals of worsening future economic conditions. This triggered a rebalancing of investment portfolios away from falling equities and towards safe-haven assets.

From the 90's to improve the quality of the system, we have seen the emergence of a market system to supervise the transactions related to the implementation of actions for compensation. The theoretical framework of neo-institutional economics states that the choice of the organization of a transaction is based on the minimization of transaction costs. These costs are related to the coordination mechanisms that are specific to each type of organization and which efficiency in terms of transaction costs depends on the characteristics of the transaction: asset specificity, uncertainty and frequency of the transactions. Transactions related to compensation involve a significant investment in natural capital the aquatic ecosystem to produce an environmental gain equivalent in quality and quantity, to the losses related to the damage. The application of the neo-institutional theory to the study of these transactions allows us to show that these transactions have original characteristics that require organizational modes of hybrid forms. The desire to include the compensation in a trading system involves an alignment of the characteristics of transactions with a risk reduction of the specificity of natural capital. Therefore it is necessary to maintain a strong regulatory system to ensure the quality of the compensation.","[Scemama, Pierre; Levrel, Harold] IFREMER, UMR M101, AMURE, Unite Econ Maritime, F-29280 Plouzane, France",Ifremer; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale,"Scemama, P (通讯作者)，IFREMER, UMR M101, AMURE, Unite Econ Maritime, BP 70, F-29280 Plouzane, France.",pierre.scemama@ifremer.fr; harold.levrel@ifremer.fr,"Levrel, Harold/JPY-3527-2023","Levrel, Harold/0000-0002-4611-3639",,,,,94,6,6,2,53,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Most urban freight studies to date consider specific solutions and measures, as opposed to ways in which the local authorities could and should consider this issue in the wider transport planning and decision making process. The aim of this paper is to examine cities that differ in context in order to demonstrate that urban freight transport planning can be improved by involving a wider range of stakeholders. Interview data from Sweden, the UK and the Baltic Sea Region has been analysed to draw out the factors that influence the perceptions of local authorities and freight operators of freight transport issues in urban areas. The findings show that the issues faced by the freight industry are still not fully understood. The paper contradicts earlier research results that suggest differences in the ways that local authorities consider freight transport, and goes some way towards demonstrating that the problems faced by local authorities are not unique to one country or any specific category of urban area, and hence a generic decision-making framework would be of value. A framework is developed to facilitate meaningful interaction between the various urban freight actors and stakeholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ballantyne, Erica E.

Based on hierarchical (multi-level) binomial logit regressions, our findings show that the youngest and smallest SMEs have the worst perception of access to bank loans. The SMEs in nations with concentrated banking sectors are more positive about loan accessibility.

To derive model-based identifying restrictions, we model asset price shocks as news shocks about future productivity in a two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. Such shocks are found to exert sizable effects on the trade balance. Moreover, the effects are highly heterogeneous across countries. For instance, following a news shock that implies on impact a 10% increase in domestic equity prices relative to the rest of the world, the U.S. trade balance will worsen by up to 1.0 percentage points, but much less so for most other economies. We find that this heterogeneity appears to be linked to the financial market depth and equity home bias of countries. Moreover, the channels via wealth effects and via the real exchange rate are important for understanding the heterogeneity in the transmission.","[Fratzscher, Marcel] Humboldt Univ, DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Straub, Roland] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin; European Central Bank,"Fratzscher, M (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",mfratzscher@diw.de; Roland.Straub@ecb.int,,,,,,,59,12,12,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Whether it is empirically more appropriate to assess and measure the impact pathways than the impact per se remains an important methodological issue. This paper proposes a Rainwater-Livelihoods-Poverty Index (RLPI) as a comprehensive and participatory impact pathway assessment technique with measurable indicators recapitulating the sustainable livelihoods framework. The methodological contributions to rainwater impact assessment are two-fold. First, the RLPI explicitly incorporates intermediate processes and impact pathways as important factors affecting the development impacts of rainwater-related interventions. Second, the RLPI combines quantitative and qualitative household response data into a single yet meaningful quantitative impact indicator. This makes the methodology participatory, allowing farmers engagement to use their knowledge (as local expert observers) in informing rainwater management decisions. The methodology is empirically tested in Diga district (western Ethiopia) and validated using expert opinions.","[Getnet, Kindie] IWMI, East Africa & Nile Basin Off, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",,"Getnet, K (通讯作者)，IWMI, East Africa & Nile Basin Off, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",K.Getnet@cgiar.org; ebbakef@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,0,0,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

A tax in the developed country on purchases of the new durable good combined with a waste tax set below the domestic external cost of disposal is sufficient for global efficiency.

Our results suggest that strong budgetary institutions, no matter whether they are based on delegation to a strong minister of finance or on fiscal contracts, reduce the deficit bias in case of strong ideological fragmentation.

We find that acquiring firms deflate earnings in order to increase the numbers of shares to be issued to the target firm's shareholders. Furthermore, the level of earnings deflation is systematically related with the controlling owner's expected benefits measured in several different ways. We also find that the stock price reaction to member-firm merger announcements is negatively correlated with the pre-issue-period earnings deflation.

However, publicly traded banks, subject to multiple monitoring and vetting in capital markets, perform better regardless of ownership status. The privatization of banks has improved performance with respect to revenue inflow and efficiency gains in the short- or long-run (initial public offerings). The positive long-run effect is more relevant and. significant for banking institutions with minority foreign ownership. Moreover, this paper innovatively estimates interest income efficiency and non-interest income efficiency at the same time. The results suggest that Chinese banks are much more efficient in generating interest income than raising non-interest revenue, although the latter aspect has improved significantly during the sample period.

In this study, by focusing on Japanese firms pursuing FDI in emerging countries in Asia and Oceania, we provide empirical evidence of the similarities and differences in cross-border M&A and greenfield FDI determinants. We derive the following four main conclusions. First, an increase in host-country population size and decreases in per capita income and corporate tax rates generally attract both inward cross-border M&A and greenfield FDI to the host country. Second, however, a home-country firm tends to choose cross-border M&A rather than greenfield FDI when the host country sufficiently implements shareholder rights laws and the firm tends to choose greenfield FDI rather than cross-border M&A when the host country adequately enforces intellectual property rights laws. Third, a firm tends to choose greenfield FDI when the firm already has regional networks in the host country and choose cross-border M&A when the purpose of the firm's overseas operations is to establish sales distribution channels. Finally, a firm pursuing cross-border M&A experiences higher cumulative abnormal returns in its stock prices following the investment, while a firm pursuing greenfield FDI experiences increases in its stock prices immediately before the investment.

Under customary assumptions regarding the sign of the parameters of the effort function, more inflation lowers the unemployment rate, albeit to a declining extent. This is because firms respond to inflationwhich spurs effort by decreasing the reference wageby increasing employment, thus maintaining the effort level constant as implied by the Solow condition. A stronger short-run effect of inflation on unemployment is produced under varying as opposed to fixed capital, given that in the former case the boom produced by a monetary expansion is reinforced by an increase in investment.

Consumers benefit from such investment because financial literacy allows them to increase the returns on wealth. Since literacy depreciates over time and has a cost in terms of current consumption, the model delivers an optimal investment in literacy. Furthermore, literacy and wealth are determined jointly, and are positively correlated over the life-cycle. The model drives our empirical approach to the analysis of the effect of financial literacy on wealth and saving and indicates that the stock of financial literacy early in life is a valid instrument in the regression of wealth on financial literacy.

The model matches the average yield curve up to five-year maturity almost perfectly. Longer term yields are roughly as volatile as in the data. The model also generates time-varying bond risk premiums. In particular, when running Fama-Bliss regressions of excess returns on forward premiums, the model produces slope coefficients of roughly half the size of the empirical counterparts.

Then, we provide a rationale for the simultaneous increases in CEO pay, use of equity in compensation, and external hiring of CEOs.

For a wide set of currencies, our empirical evidence revealed (1) positive and significant average dependence between gold and USD depreciation, consistent with the fact that gold can act as hedge against USD rate movements, and (2) symmetric tail dependence between gold and USD exchange rates, indicating that gold can act as an effective safe haven against extreme USD rate movements. We evaluate the implications for mixed gold-currency portfolios, finding evidence of diversification benefits and downside risk reduction that confirms the usefulness of gold in currency portfolio risk management.

Evidence from Nuclear Power Plants and School Finance Equalization,LAND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,AIR-QUALITY; IMPROVEMENT; VARIABLES; BENEFITS; DEMAND; IMPACT; SITES,The conventional view of fiscal zoning is that communities make land use accommodations only for nuisance entities that generate sufficient net fiscal benefits. State reforms that redistribute property tax revenues have been accused of undermining these decisions ex-post. This paper tests this critique by examining communities with nuclear power plants sited before the school finance equalization reforms of the 1970s and 1980s. Hedonic regressions reveal these reforms to disproportionately reduce housing prices in nuclear plant communities but increase them among neighboring areas.

We find that while the DMs are close to fully integrated, both EM segments are not effectively integrated with the global economy.

In addition, we split total style-shifting performance into active and passive components. In this context, we confirm possible benefits of these performance measures by analyzing several simulated investment strategies. Our empirical study covers 520 hybrid mutual funds from 10/1998 to 12/2009 and shows that hybrid mutual funds (i) do not outperform their benchmarks on average, (ii) partially show positive in-quarter abnormal performance and style-shifting abilities, and (iii) exhibit short-term persistence in in-quarter abnormal performance but not in style-shifting abilities.

Many nonprofits and governments have created new savings vehicles to fill this void. The ability of families to succeed in these programs may depend on their personal discount rates (time preferences). In this paper, we use survey data from a matched savings program and factor analysis to characterize family time preferences in order to predict their influence on savings levels. We find that a single latent factor describing the level of discount rates (rather than other dimensions of time or amount inconsistency) best describes family differences and is significantly related to the ability of families to save within the program.

Given the scarcity of its application in transportation and its fledgling nature, preliminary case studies were conducted using continuous and discrete response data sets, for land values and land use, in comparison with results from spatial autoregressive (SAR) models with distance decay parameters estimated using Bayesian techniques. For both the continuous land value and binary land use cases, the SF approach demonstrates great potential as a worthy competitor to more conventional SAR-based models. In addition to offering high fit statistics, somewhat shorter computing times, and more straightforward computations, the SF approach makes explicit the patterns of spatial dependency in the land value and land use data. By controlling for these spatial relationships, the SF approach yields more reliable marginal effects of policy variables of interest. Model results confirm the important role of transportation access (as quantified using distances to a region's central business district, and various roadway types). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been noted that students tend to use a variety of transportation modes, including active travel, more frequently than other population segments. Investigating the modal choice of university students provides a unique opportunity to understand a population that has a large proportion of active commuters at a major trip-generating location. In turn, this can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence active travel. In this paper, we report the results of a mode choice analysis among university students, using as a case study McMaster University, in Hamilton, Canada. The results from this research indicate that modal choices are influenced by a combination of cost, individual attitudes, and environmental factors such as street and sidewalk density. A key finding is that travel time by car and bicycle positively affect the utilities of these modes, although at a decreasing rate as travel time increases. While the positive utility of time spent traveling by car has been documented in other settings, our analysis provides evidence of the intrinsic value that cyclists place on their trip experience. Examples of transportation policy measures suggested by the analysis are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We identify a surprisingly large and consistent positive relationship of left-oriented governments with firm value. Additionally, our research finds that the partisan impact on firm value is appreciably conditioned by factors like economic openness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a simple model of the evolution of preferences for conditional cooperation in the presence of a public good, which explains these two empirical findings without employing reputational or group selection arguments. In this model, individuals inherit preferences to match other agents' contributions to the provision of a public good, at some specified matching rate. Agents whose preferences induce them to be relatively successful - in material terms - increase in number, from one generation to the next. Under complete information and with randomly matched groups of N agents who have quasilinear preferences over the public good and a private good, the unique evolutionarily stable matching rate is 1, leading to Pareto optimal voluntary provision of the public good, regardless of group size N. The evolutionarily stable matching rate can be viewed as an endogenous social norm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Are entrepreneurship policies more or less important to politicians compared to the voters they represent? The Members of the Swedish Parliament were asked the same questions regarding their entrepreneurial activities as found in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). The empirical results indicate that when we analyse the statistical significance of the differences and control for individual characteristics, politicians have similar experiences and ambitions to the rest of the population when it comes to entrepreneurial activities. Politicians have a high potential for becoming entrepreneurs in the future, but seem to be less optimistic about how entrepreneurs are perceived in the cultural context. In addition, there is a substantial discrepancy between how politicians and voters perceive the ease of starting and running a business. Unlike politicians, voters do not agree that it is easy to start and run a business in Sweden.","[Nystrom, Kristina] Ratio Inst, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Nystrom, Kristina] Royal Inst Technol, KTH, CESIS, Dept Ind Econ & Management, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Nyström, K (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, KTH, CESIS, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Lindstedsv 30, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",kristina.nystrom@ratio.se,,"Nystrom, Kristina/0000-0002-1692-8677",,,,,37,7,8,2,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We find that IPOs backed by prestigious VCs are less likely to delist for performance failure and have longer listing duration relative to those without VC backing; however, IPOs backed by ordinary VCs are as likely to delist as IPOs without VC backing. The finding is robust for Internet and high-tech firms. We further examine heterogeneous VC characteristics and find that the ability of prestigious VCs to improve IPO survival is a function of their investment experience and managerial ability. VC prestige characterized by industry specialization and syndication networks is not related to IPO survival. Overall, the results suggest that the VC characteristics that produce prestige, rather than the prestige itself, drive the long-term survival of IPOs.","[Chou, Ting-Kai] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat Technol, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Cheng, Jia-Chi] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Accounting, Coll Management, Tao Yuan 32003, Taiwan; [Chien, Chin-Chen] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accountancy, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University; Yuan Ze University; National Cheng Kung University,"Cheng, JC (通讯作者)，Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Accounting, Coll Management, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Tao Yuan 32003, Taiwan.",jccheng@saturn.yzu.edu.tw,,,,,,,64,28,28,7,76,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We develop a search-matching model of a dual labor market where the formal sector is reserved for educated and trained-on-the-job workers, and where the informal sector is accessible to all workers. We study public policies aiming at improving the level of education of those populations with limited access to education. A rise in access to education, provided by an external subsidy such as non-governmental financing, increases the size of the formal sector and reduces the size of the informal sector. However, we observe a higher share of educated workers joining the informal sector. The efficiency study suggests that a public subsidy to education, financed by a tax on formal sector firms, goes against improving the labor market efficiency which would require instead a subsidy to formal job creation.","[El Badaoui, Eliane] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Rebiere, Therese] CNAM, Dept Econ, F-75002 Paris, France",Universite Paris Nanterre; heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM),"Rebière, T (通讯作者)，CNAM, Dept Econ, Case 1D2P30,40 Rue Jeuneurs, F-75002 Paris, France.",eliane.badaoui@u-paris10.fr; therese.rebiere@cnam.fr,,,,,,,27,2,2,1,19,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The consequences, moreover, contradict the conventional wisdom of low regulatory effectiveness; heightened legal awareness and strengthened labor law enforcement may result from these processes.

Using the German local business tax as a testing ground, we empirically investigate whether these agglomeration rents are taxable for local governments. The analysis exploits a rich data source on the population of German plants to construct measures for the communities' agglomeration characteristics. The findings indicate that economic agglomerations and industry clusters exert a positive impact on the jurisdictional tax rate choice. Further analysis moreover suggests that a municipality's potential to tax agglomeration rents depends on its firm and industry agglomeration relative to neighboring communities.

The findings show that investors are subject to home bias and the surveyed investors prefer to invest in local equity market. The findings show that older investors have less investment confidence and more diversification, where number of different stocks and HHI (Hezfindahl-Hirshman Index) are used as two diversification measures in the analysis. The OLS regression and logit response results prove that male investors trade more and when the investor's equity portion of the total portfolios increases, the number of trades also increases. The self-reported investment confidence level and greed have positive effect on diversification. Hence, diversification level increases with the investor's equity portion of their total portfolios. The findings suggest that male investors on the average are more confident than females in their investment decisions and males who are more confident have better portfolio diversification choices.","Kadir Has Univ, Sch Econ Adm & Social Sci, Dept Int Trade & Finance, TR-34083 Istanbul, Turkey",Kadir Has University,"Öztürkkal, B (通讯作者)，Kadir Has Univ, Sch Econ Adm & Social Sci, Dept Int Trade & Finance, Kadir Has Caddesi, TR-34083 Istanbul, Turkey.",belma.ozturkkal@khas.edu.tr,"Ozturkkal, Belma/C-6660-2013","Ozturkkal, Belma/0000-0003-1918-7293",,,,,35,1,1,2,12,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We provide an empirical analysis of the determinants of the probability that a borrowing firm will suffer financial tension and obtain two main innovative findings. First, we find that small firms supported by MGIs less likely experienced financial tensions even at that time of utmost financial stress. Second, our empirical evidence shows that MGIs played a signaling role beyond the simple provision of collateral. This latter finding suggests that the information provided by MGIs turned out to be key for bank-firm relations as scoring and rating systems - being typically based on pro-cyclical indicators - had become less informative during the crisis.

When agriculture relies on traditional technology, industrial development reduces the relative price of industrial products, but has a limited effect on per capita income because most labor has to remain in farming. Growth is not sustainable until this relative price drops below a certain threshold, thus inducing farmers to adopt modern technology that employs industry-supplied inputs. Once agricultural modernization begins, per capita income emerges from stasis and accelerates toward modern growth. Our calibrated model is largely consistent with the set of historical data we have compiled on the English economy, accounting well for the growth experience of England encompassing the Industrial Revolution.

We find that a bank's market-to-book value is negatively related to the size of its liabilities-to-GDP ratio, especially in countries running large public deficits. CDS spreads appear to decrease with stronger public finances. These results suggest that systemically important banks can increase their value by downsizing or splitting up, especially if they are located in countries with weak public finances. We document that banks' average liabilities-to-GDP ratio reached a peak in 2007 before a significant drop in 2008, which could reflect these private incentives to downsize. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Given this, we can derive a just stable equilibrium nominal interest rate with matching definitions for inflation and monetary growth. We demonstrate that these implied lower bounds match their historical analogues well.","[Faria, Joao Ricardo] Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [McAdam, Peter] European Cent Bank, Res Dept, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; European Central Bank,"Faria, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",rfaria2@utep.edu; peter.mcadam@ecb.europa.eu,"Faria, João Ricardo/AAG-5304-2021","FARIA, JOAO RICARDO/0000-0001-6484-3566",,,,,35,8,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We show that a debt structure where two distinct debt classes coexist-one class fully concentrated and with control rights upon default, the other dispersed and without control rights-removes the controlling creditor's liquidation bias when investor protection is strong. These results rationalize the use and the performance of floating charge financing, which refers to debt financing where the controlling creditor takes the entire business as collateral, in countries with strong investor protection.

The risk-taking measures include total risk, underwriting risk, investment risk, and leverage risk. The evidence shows that mutual insurers have lower total risk, underwriting risk, and investment risk than stock insurers. In terms of board composition variables, we find that some board composition variables not only have impact on risk-taking behaviors but also affect different risk measures differently. Thus, using different risk measures is better than using one risk measure to assess risk-taking behavior. Finally, we conclude that an insurer can control its total risk through management of underwriting, investment, and leverage risks that determine an insurer's risk profile.","[Ho, Chia-Ling] Tamkang Univ, Dept Insurance, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Lai, Gene C.] Washington State Univ, Dept Finance & Management Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Lee, Jin-Ping] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Washington State University; Feng Chia University,"Ho, CL (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Insurance, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",genelai@wsu.edu; genelai@wsu.edu; genelai@wsu.edu,"Chia-Ling, Ho/AAV-4141-2021","Ho, Chia-Ling/0000-0001-6257-9677",,,,,73,49,57,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

There are two notions of representation, namely, to hold seats and to belong to the ruling coalition. I refer to the effect of the former as the incumbency effect and the effect of the latter as the ruling effect. The discontinuous variation in the seat share as the vote share varies for parties is used to isolate exogenous variation in incumbency. The discontinuous variation in ruling at the 50% seat share cutoff for coalitions is used in order to exogenous variation in ruling. I find that incumbency determines the distribution of 12% of the total vote, which is similar to the advantage found in majoritarian systems. I find no ruling effect, contrary to the commonly found cost of ruling in proportional systems.","[Liang, Che-Yuan] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala Ctr Fiscal Studies, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Liang, Che-Yuan] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Uppsala University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Liang, CY (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala Ctr Fiscal Studies, POB 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",che-yuan.liang@nek.uu.se,"Liang, Che-Yuan/IUN-0503-2023","Liang, Che-Yuan/0000-0002-6016-0546",,,,,44,15,15,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2013,154.0,3-4,,,,,259,284,,10.1007/s11127-011-9817-8,0.0,,,26,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,084II,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314531800006,0

Technology transfers may occur through R&D contracting, purchase of licenses and know-how, purchase of specialized machinery, hiring of specialized personnel, and various informal channels. Estimates of a dynamic productivity model show that firms engaging in international knowledge transfer strategies record substantially and significantly higher productivity growth. While we do not find statistical evidence of complementarity between international and domestic transfers, the largest impact on productivity is found if firms combine international and domestic transfer strategies, suggesting that a diverse external technology sourcing strategy combining local know-how with know-how from abroad is most effective. Such combined domestic and international technology sourcing strategies are associated with firms' basic research orientation, R&D intensity, and the successful use of technology protection strategies to appropriate the benefits of innovation efforts. Foreign multinational firms are more likely to adopt technology transfer strategies solely focusing on international transfers. Multinational firms do not exhibit faster productivity growth if the effects of technology transfers and R&D are taken into account.","[Belderbos, Rene] Katholieke Univ Leuven, UNU MERIT, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Belderbos, Rene] Univ Maastricht, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Duvivier, Florence] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",KU Leuven; Maastricht University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Solvay SA,"Belderbos, R (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, UNU MERIT, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",rene.belderbos@econ.kuleuven.be; Vincent.VanRoy@econ.kuleuven.be; Florence.Duvivier@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,,68,27,32,2,101,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Second, there was an idea to analyze communication of parties in supply chain by observing interaction and interviewing participants and then categorizing their communication using a transactional analysis terminology as a system of classification. The hypothesis that transactional analysis can be used as a theoretical framework and methodological procedure for diagnosing and understanding social interactions was explored. As the study revealed some patterns, well described by transactional analysis concepts, psychological theory has a potential to improve understanding and practical realization of supply chain coordination and to provide some suggestions for overcoming communicational problems in supply chains of future managers.","[Kovacevic, Ivana; Panic, Biljana; Vujosevic, Mirko; Kuzmanovic, Marija] Univ Belgrade, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Panic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",panic.biljana@fon.bg.ac.rs,"Kuzmanovic, Marija/E-8303-2011; Kovačević, Ivana/GNN-0352-2022; Kuzmanovic, Marija/ITU-6684-2023; Vujosevic, Mirko/G-5379-2018","Kuzmanovic, Marija/0000-0001-5857-6932; Panic, Biljana/0000-0002-5047-9887; Vujosevic, Mirko/0000-0001-9014-7759; Kovacevic, Ivana/0000-0002-7601-1000",,,,,28,3,3,0,21,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2013,15.0,33,,,,,210,223,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,087FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314746900016,0

The analysis is motivated by two sets of compelling empirical facts. First, the origination of subprime mortgages exploded between the years 2003 and 2005. Second, the securitization of subprime loans increased substantially over the same time period, driven primarily by the five largest independent broker/dealer investment banks. We argue that the relative shift in the securitization activity of investment banks was driven by forces exogenous to factors impacting lending decisions in the primary mortgage market and resulted in lower ZIP code denial rates, higher subprime origination rates, and higher subsequent default rates. Consistent with recent findings in the literature, we provide evidence that the increased securitization activity of investment banks reduced lenders' incentives to carefully screen borrowers.

Based on a broad set of commercial banks in Asia over the 1994-2009 period, the empirical results indicate that a higher degree of market power in the banking market is associated with higher capital ratios, higher income volatility and higher insolvency risk of banks. In general, although banks in less competitive markets hold more capital, the levels of capitalization are not high enough to offset the impact on default risk of higher risk taking. Nevertheless, during crisis periods, specifically the 1997 Asian crisis that has directly affected Asian banks, market power in banking has a stabilizing impact. A closer investigation however shows that such findings only hold for countries with a smaller size of the largest banks, suggesting that the impact of bank competition is conditional on the extent to which the banking industry may benefit from too-big-to-fail subsidies. Overall, this paper has policy implications for bank consolidation policies and the role of the lender of last resort. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The data source is the World Bank's Doing Business Database. The study covers the years from 2004 to 2010. Because the paper includes the years right before the economic and financial global crisis, as well as the crisis period, the impact of changing ease of doing businesson the changing direction of FDI towards developing countries can be better evaluated. The initial results show that countries which have better records of doing business tend to attract more FDI.

With this mechanism agents decide whether to join an agreement and pay a deposit prior to making their contribution decisions. If an agreement receives sufficient membership to form, members then make their contribution decisions and compliant members are refunded their deposits. If an agreement does not form, then deposits are immediately refunded and a standard voluntary contribution game is played. We find that the deposit-refund mechanism achieves nearly full efficiency when agreements require full participation, but is far less effective, and in some cases disruptive, when agreements require only partial participation. As the mechanism does not require the existence of strong sanctioning institutions, it is particularly suited for enforcing compliance with international environmental agreements.","[Cherry, Todd L.; McEvoy, David M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Cherry, Todd L.] CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res, N-0318 Oslo, Norway",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"McEvoy, DM (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, 3108 Raley Hall, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",cherrytl@appstate.edu; mcevoydm@appstate.edu,,,,,,,0,38,40,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This pro-colonialist position would further blossom during the first years of the Third Republic, embodied in particular by the existence of a colonialist party; it was at this time that a true doctrine of French imperialism was founded. Amongst economist writings of the time, one text stands out, De la colonisation chez les peuples modernes by Paul Leroy-Beaulieu (1874), a book which would see multiple editions, with the 6th and final one published in 1908. This book would be the catalyst for debates amongst economists. The great paradox is that these key politicians, Jules Ferry in particular, would defend colonial expansion on the basis of primarily economic arguments Colonial policy is the daughter of industrial policy although most economists themselves were opposed to such endeavours. The purpose of this paper will be to analyse the debate amongst economists and to understand why the importance of this economic thought was minimised in French debates, in spite of the fact that colonisation was considered an appendage of political economics, and finally, we will explore the extent to which this issue led to advances in economic theory.","[Clement, Alain] Univ Francois Rabelais LEA, Tours, France; [Clement, Alain] UMR CNRS Triangle, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Clément, A (通讯作者)，Univ Francois Rabelais LEA, Tours, France.",clement@univ-tours.fr,,,,,,,76,7,8,2,14,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Motivating and encouraging research degree graduates to work as academic teachers should be one of the main priorities of higher education institutions. A research on what factors motivate and discourage doctoral graduates to remain in academia was conducted in the Czech Republic and Poland in the spring 2013. Results of the study showed that the main reasons why young researchers decline offers of employment at universities included: lack of vacancies, low income and no real perspectives for further development. The study showed what should be changed.","[Czapran, Tomasz Bronislaw; Habrmanova, Blanka] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Human Resources, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,tomasz.czapran@vse.cz; blanka.habrmanova@vse.cz,"Czapran, Tomasz Bronislaw/AGB-1491-2022","Czapran, Tomasz Bronislaw/0000-0002-2246-5760",,,,,9,0,0,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,252,261,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100026,0

The objective of recruitment practices is to determine a suitable pool of applicants quickly, cost-efficiently and legally. Selection process involves the assessment and selection among job candidates. The main concern of the recruitment process, for both HR managers and applicants, is the process's transparency. This paper presents a model of candidates' recruitment with the application of multiple attribute decision making (MADM) methods; in particular Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for weight estimation and finding the optimal solution, and WSA for the determination and ranking of the candidates. Based on the results the HR manager will be able to decide which candidates are the most suitable and should therefore be put through the next phase of the hiring process where selected applicants are pair-wise compared using AHP method to reveal the best candidate.

Government expenditures are examined according to their functional classification (COFOG). Econometric analysis is carried out by a panel regression based on annual time series for the period 2000-2011.

Moreover, the opposition sometimes comes from incumbent fishermen and fishing communities that would ostensibly gain the most from rent-enhancing reforms. We flesh out this puzzle by describing the political economy of past and present institutional changes in North America such as bans on fish traps, limited-entry regulations, and individual transferable quotas (ITQs). Our review identifies patterns of distributional concerns surrounding property rights; many of the same groups that opposed limits on entry and fish traps also oppose ITQs. We provide examples of how political opposition to ITQs is mollified by modifications in program design, although these design compromises may have efficiency costs. We conclude by pointing to the need for more research on equity-efficiency trade-offs and for greater attention to fishermen heterogeneity in economic analysis.","[Grainger, Corbett A.; Parker, Dominic P.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Grainger, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",cagrainger@wisc.edu; dparker5@wisc.edu,,"Grainger, Corbett/0000-0001-5789-3725",,,,,71,25,30,0,35,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The selection of members plays a vital role in success of GVTs specifically taking into account the collective effects of multiculturalism and the influences of technology as the main communication medium in these teams. However, there are very limited numbers of studies focusing on the foregoing matter. This paper builds all the discussions upon a comprehensive literature review accompanied by a critical analysis. The paper will contribute to the body of knowledge by collecting the results of seminal works within existing literature.

In this present paper, it is presumed that voter's evaluation on candidate image in internal party election initially requires a substantial cognitive effort and affective ways of how voters process and respond to the political information that construe the candidate image. Moreover, the voting act is presumed as a voter's self expression, the expression of who they are. Using personal and religiosity values as the key variables, it is possible to propose that the similarity-attraction or self-image congruence between the voters and the candidates were proposed to enhance the voters' self expression and perception on candidate's image that subsequently influence the voter's intention or decision to vote.

The paper describes basic known approaches and points out its advantages and drawbacks. The Utilitarism presents a social welfare function, the Neoclassical Economy developed cardinalistic criterions and the New Welfare Economics suggested ordinalist analysis. Unfortunately all the approaches are connected with some issues. Using GDP as a measure of welfare has a reason - if the economy is growing, so must welfare. Unfortunately, the GDP as a measure of social welfare can be considered problematic because the GDP calculates impacts of economic activities whether they are positive or negative. This and another criticism led to a supplementary theory developing some other indicators, e.g. the human development index. However, even the HDI has its limitations of use. On the other hand, the construction of the HDI enables decomposition of the index and adding some other components to enable taking into account some other phenomenon. Critics of the HDI consider that the HDI does not pay much attention to development from a global perspective and focuses on national ranking. Among others, the HDI also fails to include any freedom or environmental considerations. Therefore a modification of the HDI index is presented in the article by taking into account economic freedom and environmental issues. It analyses impact of this modification with respect to keeping logical relation between welfare and poverty.

The investigation is based on the Hofstede's modified approach. As the result the gaps between the social-cultural characteristics of workers and senior management, real and regulatory relations were found out. It is indicated, that this gaps lead to the decline in efficiency of HR-policy. Therefore the list of methodic recommendation on the issue of consideration the labour's social-cultural characteristics was developed.

The results may provide one indication of the potential barriers to trade facilitation that technical regulations can pose.","[Maskus, Keith E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Otsuki, Tsunehiro] Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan; [Wilson, John S.] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; The World Bank,"Maskus, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",maskus@colorado.edu,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330077, 22330084] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,22,14,17,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

This paper provides a framework for constructing and applying quantitative livability and sustainability indicators. In addition to critically reviewing principles of constructing indicators describing a multidimensional concept such as livability or sustainability, we also discuss methods for capturing local context, a critical feature for transportation planning. Specifically, we review methods for incorporating diverse stakeholder perspectives into indicator construction and spatial analytic tools for geographic entities and relationships. We also discuss spatial decision support systems and the Geodesign concept for organizing these tools and technologies as well as integrating livability indicators into the overall planning process.

As its departure point, it identified the best practices in IT outsourcing, the most important benefits of this process as well as the shortcomings of IT outsourcing. The study is a culmination of requests from the provincial government stakeholders to have a framework of IT outsourcing best practices which is currently not available. The study used the quantitative approach and employed a questionnaire as a research instrument. The study revealed that the decision to outsource can sometimes be difficult to make and is risky. However, it identified some benefits of IT outsourcing such as access to highly experienced IT specialists as well as access to advanced technologies, improvement in customer service and usually at high delivery quality levels. However, the study also revealed some risks associated with outsourcing such as hidden costs and loss of control on outsourced activities. In addition, outsourcing may lead to increased unemployment and may negatively affect employees' morale. It is recommended that NWPG should adopt an outsourcing plan that will guide its outsourcing process as well as establishing a clear understanding of its requirements, performing due diligence as well as carrying out of risk assessment during this process. Lastly, it should develop efficient and open communication channels between staff and management levels.","[Mtotoba, Dumisane; Mavetera, Nehemiah; Moroke, Ntebogang Dinah] North West Univ, Mmabatho, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,,dmtotoba@gmail.com; nehemiah.mavetera@nwu.ac.za; Ntebo.Moroke@nwu.ac.za,"Moroke, Ntebogang Dinah/AAZ-7657-2020","Mavetera, Nehemiah/0000-0003-0420-1742",,,,,22,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1317,1327,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100139,0

But recent studies investigated ethnic inequality in labour market intensifying brain drain. Researchers claim about discriminatory attitude against ethnic minorities which can be confirmed by two ECJ judgments in 2012 and 2011 (C-415/10 and C-104/10).

We used product attributes directly affected by information and EU legislation such as the visualization of insects on the products, the use of logo and health claims, different information treatments on positive environmental and social effects of eating insects as meat-substitutes.

At the firm level, intense competition under the global economic framework requires this sector reconsider their competitive position vis-a-vis their rivals, amongst others, through innovation. Therefore, innovation has become a centre stage in many empirical studies, especially to examine its relationship with firm performance. Little attention, however, was given to the possible impact of various dimensions of innovation on firm performance. Enriching the literature, this paper evaluates the impact of various innovation dimensions on the performance of SMEs. A total of 284 samples were collected from SMEs in the food and beverage, textiles and clothing and wood-based sub-industries. The data were analysed using a hierarchical regression analysis. The findings confirmed the hypotheses that product innovation and process innovation influenced firm performance significantly, where the impact of the former was stronger than the latter. Besides consolidating the existing theory on the importance of innovation for explaining a variation in firm performance, the findings also inform SMEs and policy makers that innovation is a critical factor in today's entrepreneurial activities. Further studies should look into how SMEs could calculate cost-benefit ratio of innovation and how they could opt for internal or external sources of innovation before actual innovation is undertaken.","[Rosli, M.

However, some authors have asserted that policy makers should understand the values communities hold towards forests before recommending strategies for CBFM. This study used Principal Component Analysis to identify the values rural households in KwaZulu-Natal hold towards forests. The Multinomial Logit Model was then used to investigate whether the values households hold towards forests, among other socio-economic and institutional factors, influence households' decisions to participate in self-initiated CBFM programmes. The study found that households' decisions to participate in community forest management depend, not only on the values they hold towards forests, but also on the forest management strategy being pursued. If a protection-oriented management strategy is pursued, households that hold more bio-centric values are more likely to participate, while households that hold more anthropocentric values towards forests are more likely to participate in managing forests when a utilisation-oriented strategy is pursued. Since rural households in KwaZulu-Natal are poor and overwhelmingly hold anthropocentric values towards forests, it was recommended that following the utilisation-oriented forests management strategy to meet the utilitarian needs of the communities would improve household participation, while reducing poverty and ensuring sustainable forest management.","[Sharaunga, S.; Wale, E.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Discipline Agr Econ, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Mudhara, M.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Farmers Support Grp, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Mudhara, M.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Sharaunga, S (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Discipline Agr Econ, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",sharaunga2000@yahoo.com; Mudhara@ukzn.ac.za; walee@ukzn.ac.za,"Wale, Edilegnaw/AAC-9048-2021; Wale, Edilegnaw/N-5292-2013; Zegeye, Edilegnaw Wale/JXY-0016-2024","Wale, Edilegnaw/0000-0003-4705-7971; Wale, Edilegnaw/0000-0003-4705-7971;",,,,,64,8,10,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2013,52.0,4,,,,,113,147,,10.1080/03031853.2013.847039,0.0,,,35,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,247WS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326654700006,0

It is argued that South Africa's Constitution bestows certain decision-making and legislative powers on its nine provinces and that public goods and redistributive policy options are available to the agricultural sector. As about two-thirds of South African agricultural expenditure (83% if conditional grants are included) takes place at provincial level, it was shown that provincial dynamics are relevant. While the characteristics of tribal populations in provinces are found to be important, a poor alignment between provincial agricultural expenditure and certain elements of consequence (employment, value addition, etc.) can be shown. The paper also deconstructs the commonly used terms state and agriculture at a provincial level and dwell on the concept of the rational civil servant. In the case of the state, the challenge of moving beyond institutionalised silos is discussed. It is shown that agriculture consists out a multitude of actors, that representation often overlap and that similarities with a tragedy of the commons can be observed in the way some of the actors maximise personal gains. To understand the system non-traditional schools of thought such as social economic systems and bounded rationality may provide answers.","[Troskie, D.

This study critically identifies the current lack of studies specifically addressing the RCBs and their CRM, and proposes a CRM framework for RCBs. The framework considers financial and non-financial variables. Using nonfinancial variables along with financial variables as predictors of company failure significantly improves credit analysis quality and accuracy. Also, this study recognises guanxi in the context of China as risk potentials affecting the business of SMEs and farming households, which are the main clients of RCBs and includes guanxi risks in the framework.

Moreover, to be politically acceptable, a post-Kyoto treaty must recognize certain constraints regarding country-by-country economic costs. This article presents a framework for assigning quantitative emissions allocations across countries, one budget period at a time, through a two-stage plan: (a) China and other developing countries accept targets at business-as-usual (EMU) levels in the coming budget period, and, during the same period, the United States agrees to cuts below BAU; (b) all countries are asked to make further cuts in the future in accordance with a formula that includes a Progressive Reductions Factor, a Latecomer Catch-up Factor, and a Gradual Equalization Factor. An earlier proposal (Frankel 2009) for specific parameter values in the formulas achieved the environmental goal that carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations plateau at 500 ppm by 2100. It met our political constraints by keeping every country's economic cost below thresholds of Y=1 percent of income in Present Discounted Value, and X=5 percent of income in the worst period. The framework proposed in this article attains a stricter concentration goal of 460 ppm CO2 but only by loosening the political constraints.","[Frankel, Jeffrey] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,,valentina.bosetti@feem.it,,"bosetti, valentina/0000-0003-4970-0027",,,,,38,21,21,1,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

We find that positive regime changes and wars are significant predictors of aid accelerations. The results also suggest the presence of aid spill-overs, where neighbors of war-torn countries are almost as likely to experience large aid inflows. Disaggregating aid flows by donors, we find some indicative evidence for competing allocation rules among European donors. We argue that drivers of aid accelerations differ from drivers of average aid flows-a distinction that can help reconcile some of the ambiguous empirical results in the aid literature.

We propose a simple explanation for this phenomenon. We show that instead of dampening productivity shocks, the banking sector tends to exacerbate them, leading to excessive fluctuations of bank credit, output, and asset prices. Our explanation relies on three ingredients that are characteristic of modern banks activities: moral hazard, high exposure to aggregate shocks, and the ease with which capital can be reallocated to its most productive use. At the competitive equilibrium, banks offer privately optimal contracts to their investors, but these contracts are not socially optimal: banks reallocate capital excessively upon aggregate shocks. This is because banks do not internalize the impact of their decisions on asset prices. We examine the efficacy of possible policy responses to these properties of credit markets, and derive a rationale for macroprudential regulation in the spirit of a Net Stable Funding Ratio.","[Gersbach, Hans] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rochet, Jean-Charles] Univ Zurich, SFI, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rochet, Jean-Charles] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Zurich; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Gersbach, H (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",hgersbach@ethz.ch; jean-charles.rochet@bf.uzh.ch,,,,,,,0,25,29,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.
