This problem, which is a crucial IT management and governance theme software piracy governance, receives more and more attention from academics. In some developing countries (i.e. emerging markets), the piracy rate is notoriously high. Anti-piracy policies are not fully executed as the government anticipates that anti-piracy actions could not improve social welfare in the short run. In some emerging markets (e.g. China), software used to be a tariff-free product due to its intangibility. This paper develops an economic model to show that governments of emerging markets should consider imposing tariffs on foreign software in a bid to strengthen the execution of anti-piracy policies, which is essentially crucial for welfare of the society. This study contributes to IT management and governance domain by exploring the software piracy management topic in developing and emerging markets. The practical implication is to assist the decision makers to devise policy concerning on software piracy.","[Wang, Wei; Yang, Xuan; Hua, Zhimin; Liao, Stephen Shaoyi] City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,,wangwei1028@gmail.com; xuanyang3-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; zhongxp@mail.ustc.edu.cn; kiwiyhua@gmail.com; hdaning@ifi.uzh.ch; issliao@cityu.edu.hk,"Liu, Xiangyan/JTV-4868-2023; lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023; li, yao/IYJ-1364-2023","LIAO, Shaoyi Stephen/0000-0002-8449-2553",,,,,17,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,513,518,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100054,0

Nonetheless, the membership and market share of US credit unions have increased, though their average size has also risen. We investigate changes in the efficiency and productivity of US credit unions during 1989-2006 by benchmarking the performance of individual firms against an estimated order-alpha quantile lying near the efficient frontier. We construct a cost analog of the Malmquist productivity index, which we decompose to estimate changes in cost and scale efficiency, and changes in technology. We find that cost-productivity fell on average across all credit unions but especially among smaller credit unions. Smaller credit unions confronted a shift in technology that increased the minimum cost required to produce given amounts of output. All but the largest credit unions also became less scale efficient over time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Studies on market power in meatpacking indicate that concentration in procurement of livestock (cattle or hogs) has not adversely affected prices received by producers or prices paid by consumers. Indeed, there is evidence that producers may be better off because of lower processing costs due to the concentration and introduction of new technical innovations. Policies to restrict alternative marketing arrangements such as those proposed by GIPSA would make producers and consumers worse off. The beef and pork industries are quite complex and contain both spatial and temporal dimensions that can affect the level of competition. Fringe producers because of locational shift of industry and thin markets may be worse off. Establishment of niche enterprises may benefit these producers. In the future, incentives are to maintain steady long-run supplies of livestock to fully operate slaughtering and processing facilities.","N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Wohlgenant, MK (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",michaelwhlgnnt@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,23,29,1,19,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The importance of such Act in protecting their rights is often overlooked at the time where securing the job immediately and signing letter of acceptance for employment are urgently required. Zero knowledge in Employment Act 1955 often leads to dissatisfaction and disputes at work, and such phenomena affects employees' commitment at workplace. This research aims to identify level of knowledge among employees on their rights under Employment Act 1955; examine their level of commitment towards the organization and test if there exists significant relationship between employees' knowledge on their rights with the level of commitment. Data was collected from operators working at the production floor of manufacturing industry. Descriptive and correlation analyses were conducted to interpret the results. Findings show that there is a positive relationship between employee's knowledge in the Employment Act 1955 with level of commitment towards the organization.

It follows that the harmonious culture is the people's spiritual home and the source which has the cohesion, the centripetal force and the charisma.

There is evidence of partisan effects on tax policies.

We find that since the crisis, there has been a shift in the balance of new measures towards net capital inflow reducing measures. However, this is not driven primarily by an increase in inflow tightening measures (e.g. taxes on inflows) relative to pre-crisis periods of inflow surges, but rather by significantly slower inflow liberalization trends (i.e. existing capital controls remaining in place). In addition, there has been a compositional shift in net capital inflow reducing measures: outflow liberalizations were the predominant tools for reducing net capital inflows pre-crisis, but such measures have become less important post-crisis. Overall, the pre-crisis trend towards capital account openness has stalled. The use of capital flow management measures is motivated by macroeconomic as well as financial stability concerns. The IMF recently endorsed use of capital controls as last resort measures in macroeconomic management. We also find that by IMF criteria, capital flow measures have not been introduced as a last resort since 2004 - alternative macroeconomic policies to deal with the surge in net capital inflows were available to the majority of countries. Moreover, most capital flow measures introduced by EMEs since 2004 are pure capital controls rather than currency based and/or prudential type measures, suggesting that they were not directly targeted to promote financial stability. However, since the crisis, there has been a small shift towards prudential-type measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, we will focus on the worst case scenario over the observation period, the Great Depression. We find that migration risk and the length of the investment horizon are critical factors when determining bank capital needs in a crisis. We show that capital may need to rise more than three times when the horizon is increased from 1 year, as required by current and future regulation, to 3 years. Increases are still important but of a lower magnitude when migration risk is introduced in the analysis. Further, we find that the new bank capital requirements under the so-called Basel 3 agreement would enable banks to absorb Great Depression-style losses. But, such losses would dent regulatory capital considerably and far beyond the capital buffers that have been proposed to ensure that banks survive crisis periods without government support.

IPR laws have contrasting dual innovation creation and access effects on self-employment activity. The first effect is positive where strong IPR laws promote innovation and so create new opportunities for self-employment. The second effect is negative where strong IPR laws restrict access to innovation and technology used as inputs to self-employed businesses. Using a 33-country dataset over the period 1995-2000, we estimate the impact of IPR laws on self-employment, helping to fill the vacuum of empirical evidence that has plagued policy decision making in this area. We find that patent activity has a negative effect on self-employment. However, overall, we find that more extensive and strong IPR laws have a net positive effect on self-employment activity.","[Burke, Andrew] Cranfield Sch Management, Bedford, England; [Fraser, Stuart] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Cranfield University; University of Warwick,"Burke, A (通讯作者)，Cranfield Sch Management, Bedford, England.",andrew.burke@cranfield.ac.uk,,"Burke, Andrew/0000-0001-8635-3859",,,,,28,10,10,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This river network must be cleaned, the costs of which must be shared among the agents. We model this problem as a cost sharing problem on a tree network. Based on the two theories in international disputes, namely the Absolute Territorial Sovereignty (ATS) and the Unlimited Territorial Integrity (UTI), we propose three different cost sharing methods for the problem. They are the Local Responsibility Sharing (LRS), the Upstream Equal Sharing (UES), and the Downstream Equal Sharing (DES), respectively. The LRS and the UES generalize Ni and Wang (Games Econ Behav 60:176-186, 2007) but the DES is new. The DES is based on a new interpretation of the UTI. We provide axiomatic characterizations for the three methods. We also show that they coincide with the Shapley values of the three different games that can be defined for the problem. Moreover, we show that they are in the cores of the three games, respectively.

Using a difference-in-differences model to control for unobservable differences between participants and non-participants, and to control for the trajectory of emissions prior to program participation, I find that the CCX is associated with a decrease in total carbon dioxide emissions for participating plants when non-publicly traded firms are included in the sample. Effects are produced largely by decreases in output. CCX participation is associated with increases in carbon dioxide intensity. The CDP is not associated with a decrease of carbon dioxide emissions or electricity generation, and program participation is associated with an increase in carbon dioxide intensity.

I use a novel approach to analyze how these measures influence both voter turnout and the candidates' political positions. In general, lowering the net expense of voting reduces political polarization. If the net expense of voting is made very low, then candidates no longer have an incentive to take partisan positions to motivate turnout and will converge at the median voter's ideal point. For small changes in the net expense of voting, however, decreasing the cost of voting and penalties for not voting (two common measures) can result in drastically different political outcomes. Counter intuitively, measures that make voting cheaper might not increase turnout: since these measures decrease the difference between the candidates' political positions, they also decrease the benefit of voting.","[Valasek, Justin Mattias] Duke Univ, European Univ Inst, Max Weber Programme, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Valasek, Justin Mattias] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Valasek, JM (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, European Univ Inst, Max Weber Programme, 213 Social Sci Bldg,POB 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",justin.valasek@eui.eu,,,,,,,39,5,5,1,36,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

In order to test PPP, in addition to the traditional approach that utilizes the linear unit root tests, the methodology focuses on the nonlinear econometric real exchange rate models. According to the empirical results obtained, the real exchange rate is accepted to follow unit root both in light of linear ADF and PP tests, which suggest rejection of PPP The KSS nonlinear unit root test shows that nonlinear unit root behavior cannot be rejected. Additionally, linearity in real exchange rates is rejected by the Hansen, Tray, Mcleod-Li and Luukkonnen et.al linearity tests. As a result, the study aimed at conducting the analysis with nonlinear Obsfeld and Taylor Band-TAR, Taylor et.al. ESTAR and the LSTAR2 model which is selected by the LM type STAR model selection tests. If models to investigate PPP are compared with Diebold Mariano tests and MSE, MAE and RMSE error criteria for forecast accuracy the success increased accordingly once we moved from linear to the nonlinear models - from AR towards Band-TAR, ESTAR, and LSTAR2. The results suggest that, for the flexible exchange rate period adopted after the Feb. 2001 Crisis in Turkey, PPP holds only for the outer regimes that occur if the real exchange rate appreciation or depreciation is larger than the upper or lower thresholds.","Beykent Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Economics, Istanbul, Turkey",Beykent University,"Ersin, OO (通讯作者)，Beykent Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Economics, Istanbul, Turkey.",ozgurersin@beykent.edu.tr,"ERSİN, ÖZGÜR ÖMER/ABB-5626-2020","ERSİN, ÖZGÜR ÖMER/0000-0002-9177-2780",,,,,74,1,1,0,7,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

I show that investment flows' response to fees cannot be fully explained by looking at investors' performance sensitivity. While performance sensitivity monotonically increases with past performance, price sensitivity does not: investors who buy top past performers seem to be distracted by the fund's previous return and pay relatively little attention to the expense ratios. Moreover price sensitivity increases with fund visibility while performance sensitivity decreases, and while looking at data from 1986 to 2006 no discernible trend can be observed in the average performance sensitivity, price sensitivity strongly increases due to the dramatic increase in the availability of mutual funds' information for retail investors. Finally I show that investment companies strategically time their repricing decisions in order to exploit time variations in price and performance sensitivities, and that fund governance quality affects the degree to which investment companies engage in this opportunistic behavior.

The survey was conducted in May-June 2008 when the rSa was tested in some areas. We also build up a typology of professional trajectories for single-parent welfare recipients. Four typical professional trajectories are underlined. We complete this analysis by using a multinomial logit model to explain the belonging to a particular typical trajectory. Having two or more children, poor health, a low level of education and having experienced long inactivity periods increase significantly the probability to belong to the trajectories mainly in unemployment or mainly in inactivity rather than to the trajectory always in employment.","[Dang, Ai-Thu] Univ Paris 01, CES, CNRS, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Dang, AT (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, CNRS, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",dang@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,65,0,0,1,22,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Based on political targets, both scenarios assume significant electricity demand reductions and a high share of renewable energy sources in Germany. We find that electricity costs and prices in the European system are higher in the phase-out scenario, especially in Germany, associated with welfare losses. Due to lifetime extensions of existing fossil-fired plants as well as moderate capacity additions, we conclude that the generation sector can generally cope with the phase-out under the given assumptions.

To control for the effect of shorting limitations on mispricing, we further examine prices during the short-sale ban in 2008.

Proposing a statistical measure of market integration, we investigate whether equity-credit market integration is related to impediments to arbitrage. We find that time variation in integration across a firm's equity and credit markets is related to firm-specific impediments to arbitrage such as liquidity in equity and credit markets and idiosyncratic risk. Our evidence provides a potential resolution to the puzzle of why Merton model hedge ratios match empirically observed stock-bond elasticities (Schaefer and Strebulaev, 2008) and yet the model is limited in its ability to explain the integration between equity and credit markets (Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin, 2001).

We propose a new estimation framework that focuses on enhancing portfolio performance. The framework applies the statistical methodology of shrinkage directly to the inverse covariance matrix using two non-parametric methods. The first minimises the out-of-sample portfolio variance while the second aims to increase out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns. We apply the resulting estimators to compute the minimum variance portfolio weights and obtain a set of new portfolio strategies. These strategies have an intuitive form which allows us to extend our framework to account for short-sale constraints, transaction costs and singular covariance matrices. A comparative empirical analysis against several strategies from the literature shows that the new strategies often offer higher risk-adjusted returns and lower levels of risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The applied simulation model features a realistic demographic transition, distinguishes three skill classes with different life expectancies and allows individuals to choose their labor supply at the intensive and the extensive margin. Our simulation results indicate that under the existing pension rules long-run contribution rates and old-age poverty rates will increase considerably. The proposed rise in the normal retirement age will postpone effective retirement by about one year and redistribute towards future cohorts. A stronger delay in effective retirement may be achieved by raising the actuarial adjustment of benefits.","[Fehr, Hans; Kallweit, Manuel; Kindermann, Fabian] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Econ, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Fehr, H (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Dept Econ, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",hans.fehr@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Kindermann, Fabian/0000-0002-7845-4948",,,,,42,35,37,0,45,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

In a survey of arsenic hotspots in the United States, we elicited individuals' subjective mortality risks related to the presence of arsenic in drinking water. Using this data, we address whether smokers perceive mortality risks from this source differently from non-smokers. We find that those who have smoked at some point in their life have significantly higher perceived arsenic mortality risks than those who have never smoked, on average. We also find that the sample group of current smokers has higher average perceived arsenic mortality risks than those who have quit smoking. We model the decision to treat water for arsenic and find some evidence that current smokers are less likely to engage in this mitigating behavior than are ex-smokers or non-smokers even though their perceived risk is higher. We infer that smokers are either less risk averse or have a higher rate of time preference than non-smokers and ex-smokers. (JEL I0, D81, Q53)","[Shaw, W.

U.S. dollar-denominated assets of banks outside the United States are comparable in size to the total assets of the U.S. commercial bank sector, but the large gross cross-border positions are masked by the netting out of the gross assets and liabilities. As a consequence, current account imbalances do not reflect the influence of gross capital flows on U.S. financial conditions. This paper pieces together evidence from a global flow of funds analysis, and develops a theoretical model linking global banks and U.S. loan risk premiums.

An externality operating through executive compensation motivates regulation. Governance lowers agency costs, allowing firms to grant less incentive pay. When a firm increases governance and lowers incentive pay, other firms can also lower executive compensation. Because firms do not internalize the full benefit of governance, regulation can improve investor welfare. When regulation is enforced, large firms increase in value, small firms decrease in value, and all firms lower incentive pay.

Credit risk optimization is challenging because the portfolio loss distribution is typically unavailable in closed form. This makes it difficult to accurately compute Value-at-Risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) at the extreme quantiles that are of practical interest to financial institutions. Our formulations all exploit the conditional independence of counterparties under a structural credit risk model. We consider various approximations to the conditional portfolio loss distribution and formulate VaR and ES minimization problems for each case. We use two realistic credit portfolios to assess the in- and out-of-sample performance for the resulting VaR- and ES-optimized portfolios, as well as for those which we obtain by minimizing the variance or the second moment of the portfolio losses. We find that a Normal approximation to the conditional loss distribution performs best from a practical standpoint. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Japanese firms exhibit an exceptionally low level of performance variability. The increased involvement of foreign investors motivated by shareholder value is thus likely to have triggered a major shift in their risk-taking behavior. My results confirm this assumption as all standard measures of performance volatility appear to have significantly increased with the level of foreign ownership. Controlling for endogeneity provides higher point estimates supporting anecdotal evidence that foreign investors have targeted firms taking unusually low risk. Overall, the evidence highlights the considerable impact that this category of investors can have on a firm's decisions and, by consequence, on its performance. J. Japanese Int.

But almost no one is homeless for all or most of his or her life. The median shelter homeless spell is well under a month, and even chronic homelessness officially entails spells of a year or so. I model homelessness as part of people's lives in a dynamic stochastic framework in continuous time. I can explain many empirical regularities with a parsimonious model: for instance, why the last addresses of homeless people are concentrated in a few low-rent neighborhoods, why homeless entries are hard to predict, why recidivism is common and past homelessness is a good predictor of future homelessness, why some groups recidivate more often than others, why the hazard rate for shelter exit is single-peaked, why effective homelessness prevention programs do not alter the average length of homeless spells. I also examine policy. The optimal homelessness prevention program is Pigouvian and starkly simple. With an optimal prevention program in place, optimal shelter quality maximizes a simple and intuitive expression, and insurance programs always raise social welfare. Most of the previous economics literature about homelessness has been static, but most literature about homelessness outside economics has been dynamic. This paper tries to bring the two strands of literature closer together. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, reflecting the view that the demand for money became unstable in the early 2000s, some commentators have reported that the ECB has downgraded the role of money demand functions in its strategy. This paper explains the ECB's monetary policy strategy and shows the considerable influence of Milton Friedman's contributions on the formulation of that strategy. The paper also provides new evidence on the stability of euro area money demand. Following a conjecture made by Friedman (1956), the authors assign a role to uncertainty in the money demand function. They find that although uncertainty is nonstationary and subject to wide swings, it is nonetheless mean reverting and has substantial effects on the demand for money.

We approach this issue from a new direction by investigating how asset-management divisions of investment banks use stock recommendations issued by their own analysts. Based on holdings changes around initiations, upgrades, and downgrades from 1993 to 2003, we find that these bank-affiliated investors follow recommendations from sell-side analysts in general, increasing (decreasing) their relative holdings following positive (negative) recommendations. More importantly, these investors respond more strongly to recommendations issued by their own analysts than to those issued by analysts affiliated with other banks, especially for recommendations on small and low-analyst-coverage firms. Thus, we find that investment banks eat their own cooking, showing that these presumably sophisticated institutional investors view sell-side recommendations as having investment value, particularly when the recommendations come from their own analysts.

The three stages by which adolescents and very young adults become autonomous with regard to driving have been subjected to multilevel analyses, using a Household Travel Survey: (i) whether young persons participate in the early driving scheme at 16-17 years of age, (ii) whether young persons of 18-24 years of age hold a driving licence, and (iii) whether young licence-holders actually drive a car. At these three stages, social inequalities can be observed. This study highlights the considerable impact socioeconomic (individual but also contextual) factors and gender have on inequalities of access to car driving. Underprivileged groups suffer from disadvantages that accumulate at each stage (driving licence and car driving). The multilevel analysis of access to the car among young persons shows that considering the effects of the geographical context improves our understanding of travel inequalities.

The home bias of lenders' loan origination increases by approximately 20% if the bank's home country experiences a banking crisis. This flight home effect is distinct from flight to quality because borrowers of different quality are equally affected. The results indicate that the home bias in capital allocation tends to increase when adverse economic shocks reduce the wealth of international investors. (C) 2012 International Monetary Fund.

Control sharing, however, plays an important role in economic, political, and social institutions. There is scarce empirical evidence on the benefits of joint ownership in corporate finance. We analyze acquisitions of corporate assets by joint ventures to empirically ascertain the value of joint ownership in economic activities. The results indicate that firms experience significantly larger returns in joint acquisitions than in full-control acquisitions and that this difference is restricted to the sample of firms in which both partners share equal ownership in the target.

However, the extent to which the market embeds information contained in the tone (i.e. sentiment) of conference call wording is unknown. Using computer aided content analysis, we examine the incremental informativeness of quarterly earnings conference calls and the corresponding market reaction. We find that conference call linguistic tone is a significant predictor of abnormal returns and trading volume. Furthermore, conference call tone dominates earnings surprises over the 60 trading days following the call. The question and answer portion of the call has incremental explanatory power for the post-earnings-announcement drift and this significance is primarily concentrated in firms that do not pay dividends, illustrating differences in investor behavior based on the level of cash flow uncertainty. Additionally, we find that a context specific linguistic dictionary is more powerful than a more widely used general dictionary (Harvard IV-4 Psychosocial). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from California, this paper shows that communities that are more homogeneous in terms of race and educational attainment are more likely to support the public provision of environmental goods, after controlling for political ideology, voter turnout, and the distribution of benefits and costs across communities. The models also reveal nonmonotonic relationships between racial and social groups and support for the public provision of environmental amenities. Support for environmental initiatives in a community typically increases at an increasing rate the greater the concentration of Whites.

One school argues that increased levels of economic interdependence encourage good political relationships and wards off possible conflict. The opposing school of thought suggests that excessive interdependence may actually create resentment, intensify rivalry and, ultimately, political discontent leading to conflict. This paper examines the main contributions to the debate and then explores the role of economic interdependence in two different conflict scenarios - Africa and the Balkans. Only recently has the relationship between economic interdependence and conflict scenarios received rigorous empirical analysis and the results so far have failed to reach any kind of consensus. We are left to conclude, therefore, that while economic interdependence may not be a silver bullet guaranteed to pacify all interstate conflicts, it may help constrain the conflict escalation process to good effect.","Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England,"Braddon, D (通讯作者)，Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",Derek.Braddon@uwe.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,3,4,1,30,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Yet the literature is divided over whether exposure (openness to the world economy) or the kind of institutions in surrounding countries (relative location) determines the quality of local institutions. This paper confronts these hypotheses empirically, addressing the issues of strong cross-sectional dependence and the endogeneity of openness. In a 107-country cross-section, both trade openness and relative location have a positive impact on local institutions. The institutional quality of neighbouring countries is not found to be statistically significant when considering openness to foreign direct investments instead of trade, but the statistical performance of that model is poorer.

Using monthly observations on S&P composite index and 10-year Government Bond, we find that the term structure of the optimal allocations depends on market conditions measured by the probability of being in bull state. At short horizons and when this probability is low, buy-and-hold investors decrease their holdings of risky assets.

Also, the topic of valuation of entrepreneurial enterprises has for the most part been ignored. The traditional approaches to valuation of small, closely held entrepreneurial enterprises are, in our view, wanting in a number of important respects. Simply, traditional valuation methods are modeled in a manner that is applicable to a going-concern business with a history of sales and revenues.

In particular, it is shown that motivations for rural electrification programs have evolved significantly over the years, following changes in development paradigms. The author finds, however, that knowledge of the impact of this has only marginally improved: low connection rates and weak productive utilization identified in the 1980s remain true today, and impacts on such dimensions as health, education, or income, though often used to justify projects, are largely undocumented. Indeed impact evaluations are methodologically challenging in the field of infrastructures and have been limited thus far.

In the present conditions, what the concept of the future of public organizations refers is the new perspectives that these organizations will gain in terms of the structures and mechanisms they have. In this process of change, the effects of globalisation process which created a great pressure on public organizations for change must also be taken into account. The effects of this pressure on public organizations are experienced in different levels depending upon the development levels of different countries. In the literature on public organizations there are some general acceptances about the nature of the change. According to these acceptances, the partnership between public and private sectors will develop, the principles of private sector will be applied in public sector, e-government implementations will play an important role in the public sector operations and so on. So the aim of this study is to assess the projections on public organizations which are supposed to be realized in future.

Unlike previous studies, by Richard Florida and others, we find that tolerance toward homosexuals is negatively related to growth. For tolerance toward people of a different race, we do not find robust results, but the sign of the estimated coefficients is positive, suggesting that inclusion of people irrespective of race makes good use of productive capacity. We propose mechanisms to explain these divergent findings, which clarify why different kinds of tolerance may be of different economic importance.","[Berggren, Niclas; Elinder, Mikael] Ratio Inst, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Elinder, Mikael] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Elinder, Mikael] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala Ctr Fiscal Studies, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Uppsala University,"Berggren, N (通讯作者)，Ratio Inst, POB 3203, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden.",niclas.berggren@ratio.se; mikael.elinder@nek.uu.se,"Berggren, Niclas/N-3578-2019","Berggren, Niclas/0000-0003-0673-5123",,,,,90,41,45,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2012,150.0,1-2,,,,,283,308,,10.1007/s11127-010-9702-x,0.0,,,26,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,858QN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297817200014,0

This popularity is in contradiction with rare academic analyses. This paper sheds some light on causal impact of such policy on investment of supported firms in Czech Republic. We use individual level panel data containing crucial observables about the firm behaviour. We overcome the selection problem by application of propensity score matching. Our comparison of investment behaviour of supported firms and firms from control group shows that the extra investment generated (or maybe only accelerated) was at most 26% of contracted amounts. Even with constraints and assumptions we explicitly discuss in our work, this indicates that the arguments for the provision of this policy in Czech economy are not valid. These findings are in line with mixed (but mostly similar) empirical evidence from other countries.","[Bolcha, Peter] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic; [Zemplinerova, Alena] CERGE El, CZ-11121 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech Academy of Sciences,"Bolcha, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",bolcha@vse.cz; aln@cerge-ei.cz,"Bolcha, Peter/N-6140-2018; Zemplinerova, Alena/H-2948-2014","Zemplinerova, Alena/0000-0002-2440-8874",,,,,30,5,5,2,31,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In particular, we collect data on the location of virtually every human services agency in the US and use this information to calculate the approximate distance that families must travel from home in order to reach the nearest office that administers the subsidy application process. Using data from the Kindergarten cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K), our results indicate that an increase in the distance to a public human services agency reduces the likelihood that a family receives a child care subsidy. Specifically, we estimate an elasticity of subsidy receipt with respect to distance of -0.13. The final section of the paper provides an empirical application in which we use variation in families' travel distance to identify the causal effect of child care subsidies on children's weight outcomes.

I propose an alternative conceptual framework that adopts the position of externalism, which I further narrow down to a distributed cognition framework, and eventually to a biosemiotic model of human choice. I relate this to existing modular theories on the brain, which I generalize into a dual selves model. In this model, the internal information asymmetries and deficiencies of the brain/body system drive the reliance of choices on external cognitive mechanisms as manifested in sign systems. I analyze this interaction and apply the combined biosemiotics/dual selves model to an important set of falsifiers of an integrated reductionist model of neuroeconomics, that is, addiction and other consumption disorders.","Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, East West Ctr Business Studies & Cultural Sci, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Herrmann-Pillath, C (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, East West Ctr Business Studies & Cultural Sci, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",c.herrrnann-pillath@fs.de,,"Herrmann-Pillath, Carsten/0000-0001-6078-0078",,,,,110,8,8,0,5,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

This result holds for portfolios formed on the basis of favorable changes in recommendations as well as unfavorable changes. The frequency of revision captures information incremental to factors known to identify superior recommendations. Although much of the frequently revising analysts' advantage follows events proxied by abnormally high returns or trading volume, it does not appear to derive from more public events such as earnings announcements. Further, these analysts outperform their counterparts even over the short-run, suggesting that this is not simply a quantity over quality phenomenon.

Over this period, industry assets increased by a factor of 200, the number of active fund families quadrupled, and the average market share of a family declined by four-fifths. We find that price competition and product differentiation are both effective strategies in obtaining market share. Families that pass along economies of scale to investors and those that charge lower fees than the competition gain market share, but only if these fees are above average to begin with. Loads and 12b-1 fees, however, have a positive effect on market share, consistent with the use of these types of fees for marketing and distribution. Families that perform better, offer a wider range of products, and start more funds relative to the competition (a measure of innovation) also have a higher market share. Innovation is rewarded more if the new fund is more differentiated from existing offerings. Overall, our evidence suggests that mutual fund families compete effectively along both price and non-price dimensions.","[Khorana, Ajay; Servaes, Henri] London Business Sch, London, England",University of London; London Business School,"Khorana, A (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.",,"Servaes, Henri/M-3048-2013","Servaes, Henri/0000-0002-8142-9903",,,,,51,70,80,2,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

In this paper we have studied the academic environment-business environment relationship as a key component in providing marketing orientation to modern university, aimed to provide superior value to all categories of stakeholders that the education institution interacts with. To achieve its purpose, we started by analysing the scientific literature, on one hand, to see on what extent it may now speak about the marketing orientation of higher education institution, and on develop the collaboration between the academic and business environment to improve the specialized practical training of Economics students. Last but not least, there were conducted in the study more focus group with members of the main categories of public-students, teachers and traders (managers) we work with in the project previously remembered. We conclude that the sustainability of economic higher education institutions, the strategic aim of marketing orientation of modern university, is achieved only by satisfying the external customers (students, business environment, society) and the internal customers (the teachers). The study results illustrate that the relationship between higher education institution and business environment is fragile, but recognized as a key component of marketing orientation and providing superior value. There is an openess from both sides. Are well aware of the benefits of such relationships. Although there is common interest, there is equally some difficulties in materializing and operating of such relationships. Therefore, we concluded that it is necessary to develop a code of best practices to harmonize the elements underlying the marketing orientation of the modern university and to take into account also the legislative framework that governs the modern university relationship with all categories of stakeholders.

A crucial institutional characteristic is the role of state regulated brokers in wholesale markets. Relying on data from a unique survey in Uttarakhand, a state in North India, we find that regulations on margins are ineffective as most brokers charge rates that significantly exceed the regulated ones. We also find that a majority of farmers self-select into long-term relationships with brokers. These relationships allow some of the farmers to interlink credit and insurance markets to the agricultural output market. This interlinkage does however not appear to be an instrument for farmer exploitation (as it does not lead to worse inputs, high interest rates, or lower implicit output prices), but is seemingly an extra service by brokers as to establish farmer loyalty to them and thus to ensure future supplies.","[Minten, Bart] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Vandeplas, Anneleen; Swinnen, Johan] Univ Louvain, Dept Econ, Louvain, Belgium; [Vandeplas, Anneleen; Swinnen, Johan] Univ Louvain, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Louvain, Belgium",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Minten, B (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",b.minten@cgiar.org,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978; Vandeplas, Anneleen/0000-0001-7629-578X",,,,,58,13,13,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Binomial logistic regressions of school travel mode choice for children aged 11-12 years, in the City of Toronto, Canada, were estimated, using six spatial units for measuring built environment characteristics. The results were suggestive of the presence of MAUP across different geographical units. Travel distance, block density, signalized intersections, walking density, and schools in low-income neighborhoods were associated with active travel.

Yet, cash is not always optimal. In this article, we demonstrate how a newly developed response analysis tool, the Marketing Information and Food Insecurity Response Analysis (MIFIRA) framework can guide evidence-based identification of appropriate transfers. We present findings from a MIFIRA analysis in Marsabit; a remote and generally food-insecure district of northern Kenya. As a demonstration of the analytical versatility of MIFIRA, we utilise a variety of data, ranging from rigorously-collected household data, to market surveys and rapid assessments in focus groups. As a proof of concept, this article shows how MIFIRA can be effectively deployed in other regions facing chronic or emergency food insecurity to help response agencies make systematic decisions on a solid evidence base.","[Mude, Andrew] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Ouma, Robert] Inst People Innovat & Change Org, Nairobi, Kenya; [Lentz, Erin] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Cornell University,"Mude, A (通讯作者)，Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",a.mude@cgiar.org,,"Lentz, Erin/0000-0001-9934-9496",,,,,33,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Using secondary data sampled from Australian Top 200 listed companies over a 3 year period straddling the global financial crisis, this study models determinants of total CEO remuneration. The results reveal that CEOs' personal reputation does have a positive significant effect on total remuneration. Of the company financial performance influences on CEO remuneration, volatility of ROE and the net operating cash flow are found to have the most significant effects on total CEO remuneration, as expected during the period of economic turbulence studied.

The analysis focuses on the 1999-2008 period, characterized by relatively stable growth. Findings show that increases in unemployment rates variability by occupation are associated with a decrease in NAIRU, while increases in unemployment rates variability by industry have the opposite effect.

Despite the great contribution that has been made to the literature in this field so far, researchers and practitioners still need to make an attempt to better understand consumers' perceptions of service quality in the present technological environment. In the banking context, technology enabled services such as ATMs, Internet Banking and Mobile Banking have been gradually adopted by the Romanian banks at the expense of territorial units. Therefore, banks' management attention should be directed towards identifying consumers' perceptions of electronic banking service quality. The aim of this paper is to evaluate consumers' perceptions of technology enabled services within the banking industry. For this purpose, a large sample of high-educated young consumers was surveyed using the SSTQUAL dimensions. Results indicate that the SSTQUAL scale needs to be refined in order to better fit the Romanian banking context. To the best of authors' knowledge, this study is the first which tests the SSTQUAL Scale in a developing country. Therefore, the findings highlighted in this paper are of great importance both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Such an unwarranted trend not only poses a challenge to the policy makers but also most importantly destabilizes the economy internally as well as externally. Thus, if India's objective is to achieve higher sable growth (which it is already achieving), the issue of both the government deficits and trade deficits must be addressed considerably and appropriate policy decisions need to be undertaken before it goes out of hand. The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the Keynesian and the Ricardian views regarding the impact of GFD (as a measure of budget deficit) on the TD (or current account deficit) for India from 1971 to 2010. In order to examine the relationship between budget deficit and current account deficit in India, this study used the ARDL model and a new co-integration test called the bounds test to estimate the long-run dynamics between budget deficit and current account deficit. The empirical results support the Keynesian view that there is a strong linkage between budget deficit and the current account deficit in the case of India during the study period. It also shows that the direction of causality is unidirectional running from budget deficit to current account deficit. Thus, a higher budget deficit leads to a higher current account deficit. Therefore, the empirical results in this study suggest that any policy measures to reduce the budget deficit could assist in reducing the current account deficit in India.

Finally, the size of non-bank financial institutions in China has no significant effect on noninterest income ratio.","[Sun Xiufeng; Cong Jinping] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5611-7073-1,,,,2012,,,,,,,58,63,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDD89,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312877300012,0

The annual rate of poverty reduction slowed significantly in the post-crisis period. However, the trend in the growth elasticity of poverty indicates that the power of each percentage point of economic growth to reduce poverty did not change much between the two periods. In both, service sector growth made the largest contribution to poverty reduction in both rural and urban areas. Industrial sector growth largely became irrelevant for poverty reduction in the post-crisis period even though the sector contributed the second-largest share of GDP. Agricultural sector growth, meanwhile, remained important, but in rural areas only. The findings suggest the need to formulate an effective strategy to promote sectoral growth in order to speed up the pace of poverty reduction.","[Suryahadi, Asep; Hadiwidjaja, Gracia; Sumarto, Sudarno] SMERU Res Inst, Jakarta, Indonesia",,"Suryahadi, A (通讯作者)，SMERU Res Inst, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,"Suryahadi, Asep/0000-0002-6589-3079",,,,,30,36,45,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The results from a structural equation model show that, in the last two decades, children's trip patterns in the Osaka metropolitan area have become more efficient through greater trip chaining. At the same time, the results also show that boys have become less mobile and their non-school activities tend to be in fewer locations than those of girls. Further, Japanese boys are the ones who travelled by car more frequently than girls. Denser built environments, accessibility by rail transport, and a higher number of school trips have constantly reduced the amount of children's private car trips in the last three decades. Moreover, private car availability did not significantly increase the amount of children trip chaining in any observed year. This finding goes against the commonly held belief that public transport is less suitable for trip chaining. This is presumably due to the travel environment created by the well developed transit networks and dense land use in the study area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The potential selection bias is eliminated by propensity score matching to estimate the average treatment on treated effect using nearest neighbour matching and a local linear regression algorithm. We find that vulnerability in SHG members is not significantly higher than in non-SHG members, even though the SHG members have a high incidence of poverty. However, vulnerability declines significantly for those that have been SHG members for more than one year.

Our analysis of household survey data indicates that four life stages are supported by the data. Our results suggest that such flexibility is important in understanding the drivers of financial satisfaction over the life cycle since there is a substantial amount of parameter heterogeneity across the four classes.

On the other hand, foreign capital financed more domestic investment, causing economic expansion and growth; with more job opportunities poverty could be reduced.

Since imitation is discouraged for very high levels of patent protection, R&D investment is maximized for an intermediate level of patent strength. This finding provides a theoretical explanation for emerging empirical evidence questioning the effectiveness of strengthening protection on innovation incentives.

Mobility licenses, actual mobility, fear of traffic, stranger danger and sense of community were compared in highly, moderately and non urbanized environments and according to gender. Results showed that increase of urbanization leads to a decrease of children's licenses to independently cross and cycle main roads; go out after dark and go to places other than school. The rising of urbanization leads to an increase of children's mean age for independent active travel; and at the same time a decrease of independent active school-home travel and leisure time activities. Parental fear regarding traffic is the most frequent cause for concern regarding children's safety when they are outdoors. Stranger danger and low sense of community are more prevalent in parents from the highly-urbanized environment. Overall, girls enjoy less actual mobility than boys. The discussion shows that children's freedom of movement in the highly-urbanized setting is very restricted due to a pervasive automobile dependence, proposing a shift from a motorized to a walkable city.

In our framework, party-specific constraints on the ideological positioning of local candidates, linked to the national party organization and its contributors, interact with the heterogeneity of state electorates to determine the number of highly competitive Senate contests. Three hypotheses emerge from this model: (1) the greater the diversity of a party's national legislative delegation, the more highly competitive Senate elections we will observe; (2) states in which the ideological heterogeneity of the electorate is relatively high will exhibit a greater number of highly competitive elections; and (3) highly competitive Senate contests will be more common in states with closed primaries than in states with open primaries.

We build on recent work using Benford's Law to detect statistical anomalies in large data sets. Our application exploits a regulatory experiment to test for systematic changes in firm behavior triggered by the 2001 implementation of the Final Rule, a major regulatory change governing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) oversight of lead emissions. Statistical results show that the EPA's Final Rule functioned to significantly improve the accuracy of facility-reported lead data. This finding is surprising because abatement requirements increased and both the probability of firm audit and expected penalties for misreporting apparently decreased in the post-Final Rule period. To explain this counterintuitive result we develop a reporting model for the firm.

Among some of these countries (especially Greece), fiscal policy had not been implemented according to good practices. In particular, the lack of fiscal discipline stemmed from pro-cyclical public spending. The (over-)reaction of financial markets translated into a sharp increase in the level of long-term interest rates in crisis-hit countries. Consequently, these countries were confronted with severe difficulties in trying to reduce public indebtednees. Moreover, the cost of borrowing for the private sector increased. In this article, we study the effects of asymmetric shocks causing a rise in the sovereign risk premium of one country of a monetary union. We analyze their effects on the domestic country (the one hit by the shock) and the spillovers on the rest of the union (RoU). To do so, we build an open monetary union DSGE model in which member countries are different from one another with regard to the degree of fiscal discipline (pro-cyclical versus counter-cyclical fiscal behaviour). We show that such a model is suitable to explain the mechanisms underlying divergent macroeconomic performance across EA countries after the Greek sovereign debt crisis.","[Badarau, Cristina; Sangare, Ibrahima] Univ Bordeaux, Lab LAREFI, F-33608 Pessac, France; [Huart, Florence] Univ Lille 1, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, Lab EQUIPPE, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Bordeaux; Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille,"Badarau, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, Lab LAREFI, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",florina-cristina.badarau@u-bordeaux.fr; florence.huart@univ-lille1.fr; ibrahima.sangare@u-bordeaux.fr,"Huart, Florence/AGJ-6819-2022","Huart, Florence/0000-0002-1491-3973",,,,,21,3,3,1,16,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Do investors earn a risk premium when disagreement arises in the market? Despite their fundamental importance, these questions are among the most controversial issues in finance. In this paper, we use a novel data set that allows us to directly measure the level of disagreement among Wall Street mortgage dealers about prepayment speeds. We examine how disagreement evolves over time and study its effects on expected returns, return volatility, and trading volume in the mortgage-backed security market. We find that increased disagreement is associated with higher expected returns, higher return volatility, and larger trading volume. These results imply that there is a positive risk premium for disagreement in asset prices. We also show that volatility in and of itself does not lead to higher trading volume. Instead, only when disagreement arises in the market is higher uncertainty associated with more trading. Finally, we are able to distinguish empirically between two competing hypotheses regarding how information in markets gets incorporated into asset prices. We find that sophisticated investors appear to update their beliefs through a rational expectations mechanism when disagreement arises.

Financialization appears as a key determinant of capital accumulation which, in turn, is the transmission channel toward its unemployment effects. We conduct a series of counterfactual simulations where we quantify the macroeconomic consequences of the recent swings experienced by the financialization process. We find that it has had relevant unemployment effects in all periods considered, even in those where financial payments were not the main driver of capital accumulation. We also identify a structural change in the financialization process in the early 1980s, and find that it has caused USA unemployment to systematically fluctuate around 2 percentage points above what it would otherwise have done.

The distributor can sell the product not only to its own market (i.e., the foreign market) but also back to the domestic market if parallel imports are allowed by the domestic government We find that if the manufacturer adopts a two-part tariff pricing scheme when selling its output to the foreign distributor, permitting PI necessarily decreases the manufacturer's product innovation. This result however is very sensitive to market structures. If the domestic market becomes duopolistic or oligopolistic, the above result is definitely reversed PI has a positive effect on the manufacturer's product innovation. Finally, if there are more than one distributor in the foreign market, parallel imports may increase or decrease product innovation depending on the consumers' quality valuations in the two countries.

In an endogenous growth framework, transitory shocks and the way they are accommodated exert permanent effects on the level of variables in equilibrium (hysteresis). We study two adjustment strategies for the public finance stance in response to a rise of public debt generated by an adverse technological shock: a gradualist strategy and a cold turkey strategy. Our model shows that shock therapy strategies, although most costly in the short-run, are better than gradualist' ones in the long-run. Therefore, assessing the relative benefits of the two alternative strategies on household welfare is a matter of parameter values in the utility function. Furthermore, the effect of technology shocks is strongly amplified by the adjustment mechanism of public debt, producing a procyclical amplification effect that we call public debt accelerator.","[Menuet, Maxime] Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, UMR 7322, F-45067 Orleans, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Orleans,"Menuet, M (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, UMR 7322, F-45067 Orleans, France.",maxime.menuet@univ-orleans.fr; patrick.villieu@univ-orleans.fr,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,8,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The analysis documents a significant structural component in the poverty dynamics of households. The lack of profitable agricultural asset accumulation plays an unneglectable role in causing households to be trapped in persistent poverty. The escape from poverty is increasingly dominated by stochastic upward mobility rather than by structural movement in terms of asset accumulation. This could threaten the prospect of poverty reduction in rural China.

This change does not appear to be fully warranted because defaults have declined over this period. Firms affected more by conservatism issue less debt, have lower leverage, hold more cash, are less likely to obtain a debt rating, and experience lower growth. Their debt spreads are lower than those of unaffected firms with the same rating, which implies that the market partly undoes the impact of conservatism on debt prices.

We compare the use of both policies by SMEs and by large firms and find significant differences both across instruments and across firm size. For SMEs, financing constraints are negatively correlated with the use of tax of credits, while they are positively associated with the likelihood of receiving a subsidy. The use of legal methods to protect intellectual property is positively correlated with the probability of using tax incentives, but not with the use of subsidies. For large firms external financing constraints are correlated with instrument use, but results regarding appropriability are ambiguous. Our findings suggest that (1) direct funding and tax credits are not perfect substitutes in terms of their ability to reach firms experiencing barriers associated to market failures; (2) one size may not fit all in innovation policy when the type or intensity of market failure differs across firm size, and (3) subsidies may be better suited than tax credits to encourage firms, especially young knowledge-based firms, to start doing R&D.","[Busom, Isabel] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Corchuelo, Beatriz] Univ Extremadura, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain; [Martinez-Ros, Ester] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Martinez-Ros, Ester] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universidad de Extremadura; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Maastricht University,"Busom, I (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Edifici B, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",isabel.busom@uab.es; bcorchue@unex.es; ester.martinez@uc3m.es,"corchuelo, beatriz/P-1205-2014; Ros, Ester Martinez/Q-5525-2018; BUSOM, ISABEL/H-7259-2015","corchuelo, beatriz/0000-0002-6590-7944; Ros, Ester Martinez/0000-0003-0088-4611; BUSOM, ISABEL/0000-0001-9621-369X",,,,,42,88,94,9,143,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Confirming previous research, we found that participants discounted gains significantly more than losses. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between culture and gain/loss outcome: Chinese discounted gains but not losses in both outcome categories more than Americans.

Recent research, however, challenges this predominant view and suggests that family firms can embrace higher strategic risk when faced with threats to their family-centered goals. Still, the internal and external conditions that drive variations in the strategic risk taking behaviors of family firms are little known and understood. This article adds to this literature by developing and testing a conceptual model of strategic risk taking that incorporates behavioral theory, family business literature, and the logic of the strategic reference point theory. With recognition that the interplay between family and economic goals determines heterogeneity in strategic actions of family firms, this model suggests that family managers respond differentially to the feedback information regarding internal and external reference points, and consequently identifies key drivers of variation in the R&D investment behavior of family firms. By examining the pattern in R&D investments of 437 Spanish private manufacturing firms from 2000 to 2006, this study shows how strategic inputs, strategic outputs, and external benchmarks produce variations in strategic decisions about R&D investments in family and non-family firms. The findings offer insights into how internal and external reference points are considered in family firms' decision making, thereby contributing a deeper understanding into the circumstances under which family goals cope or collide with the economic goals of the firm, and how this influences strategic risk decisions in family firms.","[Kotlar, Josip] Univ Lancaster, Ctr Family Business, Inst Entrepreneurship & Enterprise Dev, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [De Massis, Alfredo] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy; [Fang, Hanqing] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Management & Informat Syst, Coll Business, Starkville, MS 39762 USA; [Fang, Hanqing] Zhejiang Univ Technol, China Small & Medium Business Res Inst, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Frattini, Federico] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Lancaster University; University of Bergamo; Mississippi State University; Zhejiang University of Technology; Polytechnic University of Milan,"De Massis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Ctr Family Business, Inst Entrepreneurship & Enterprise Dev, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",j.kotlar@lancaster.ac.uk; a.demassis@lancaster.ac.uk; hf133@msstate.edu; federico.frattini@polimi.it,"fang, han/GSN-6404-2022; Kotlar, Josip/AAK-9446-2021; Kotlar, Josip/U-5073-2017","Fang, Hanqing/0000-0001-8202-8186; Kotlar, Josip/0000-0003-1809-8600; FRATTINI, FEDERICO/0000-0001-5100-3605",,,,,84,91,97,8,124,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

There have been a number of studies of high speed rail in China. However, detailed spatiotemporal accessibility pattern of cities affected by the operation of high speed rail in China has not been reported. This study takes a timetable-based accessibility evaluation approach to analyze the changes in travel time, travel cost, and distance accessibility for each of the four main stages of HSR development in China: no HSR service in Stage 1 before August 2008, several HSR lines in Stage 2 between August 2008 and July 2011, reduced operating speed of HSR trains in Stage 3 between August 2011 and November 2012, and addition of new HSR lines and reduction of ticket fares in Stage 4 between December 2012 and January 2013. In addition to the corridor effect and the center-diffusion pattern, this paper investigates the impacts of HSR on changes in in-vehicle travel time and out-of-vehicle travel time with respect to the policy changes that reduced the operating speed of HSR trains, rearranged the train timetable, and lowered the ticket fare on HSR trains. The analysis results indicate the spatiotemporal pattern of Chinese cities affected by these policy changes. This study is useful for assessing HSR impacts on the accessibility of various cities across China as well as serving as a decision-making support to policies related to adjustments of HSR operation and planning of future HSR routes by considering the existing HSR and non-HSR railway lines.

We find that, on average, 31.5% of the rents did not change from year to year in nominal terms. We then ask if the incidence of nominal rigidity depends on the turnover status of the housing unit. We show that 35.4% of the nonturnover units had rigid rents, while for only 17.1% of the turnover units rents did not change. We also present evidence that grid pricing is associated with more than half of the nominal rigidity in housing rents in our sample. The household- and individual-level determinants of the nominal rigidity in rents and turnover status are also investigated using the micro-level details available in our dataset. We document that, relative to the low-income tenants, high-income tenants are less likely to have rigid rents and they are also less likely to change units frequently. This finding suggests that search and moving costs impose frictions that amplify the opportunity costs of high-income tenants; thus, they are more likely to agree on reasonable rent increases for the purpose of saving time and reducing emotional stress.

For this we set up two distinct models of trade. First, assuming a specific factor model with full employment we show that for a small developing economy wage inequality is related to labour productivity rather than freer trade per se. The model also suggests that while trade may increase wage inequality, this does not imply that poverty increases as wages of unskilled workers increase. However, in the second model with surplus labour specific to the non-traded agricultural good which is also an intermediate good, we show that the two wage rates move in opposite direction; but either of the two wage rates could increase depending on whether the export good is skilled or unskilled labour intensive. Interestingly, in the event of rising wage inequality, the model predicts that absolute poverty may rise. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We use a variant of Extreme Bound Analysis (EBA) to examine if any of the conclusions from the existing studies on the determinants of sovereign default is robust to small changes in the conditioning information set. Our EBA, spanning 190 countries over 1970-2010, upholds the robustness of the observed association between sovereign default and credit worthiness, growth, leverage on export earnings, debt service ratio, reserves, inflation, exchange rate, trade deficit, corruption, and democratic accountability. At the same time, our EBA reveals that the correlations between sovereign default and several of the controversial variables (namely, openness, central bank liabilities, interest payments, cost of borrowing, imports, exports, per capita GNP, and government stability) are highly sensitive to small alterations in the conditioning information set.

The model allows for multiple regime shifts whose risk cannot be hedge out and thus must be priced in option market. The paper provides estimates of the price of regime-shift risk coefficients based on a joint estimation procedure of the Markov regime-switching process of the underlying stock and the suggested option pricing model, The results of the paper indicate that bull-to-bear and bear-to-crash regime shifts carry substantial prices of risk. Risk averse investors in the markets price these regime shifts by assigning higher transition (switching) probabilities to them under the risk neutral probability measure than under the physical. Ignoring these sources of risk will lead to substantial option pricing errors. In addition, the paper shows that investors also price reverse regime shifts, like the crash-to-bear and bear-to-bull ones, by assigning smaller transition probabilities under the risk neutral measure than the physical. Finally, the paper evaluates the pricing performance of the model and indicates that it can be successfully employed, in practice, to price European options. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We identify a treatment and a control group and estimate the effects of gender quotas by using a Difference-in-Differences estimation strategy. Electoral turnout shows a decreasing trend, but turnout decreased significantly less in municipalities affected by the reform, suggesting that gender quotas produced an increase in electoral participation. The effect on electoral turnout is driven by an increase in valid ballots. The effect is smaller in the southern part of the country, which typically manifests more traditional gender roles.

We bring to light the lower sensitivity of foreign investment to destination countries' corporate governance for those investors enjoying a higher degree of investor protection at home. This evidence is consistent with diminishing marginal returns of corporate governance in portfolio choice. Investors benefiting from high levels of rights protection at home recognize that a large fraction of their portfolio, the domestic one, significantly contributes to the optimal level of corporate governance in portfolios. Consequently, these investors are less demanding about this dimension when constructing their foreign portfolios. As an unintended consequence, all other things being equal, assets issued by foreign countries with good investor protection are severely penalized in portfolios held by investing countries featuring higher standards of corporate governance.

The political regime is shown to depend not only on income levels, but also, in particular, on resource inequality. The main results imply that under any economic environment a distribution of resources exists such that democracy is the political outcome. This distribution is independent of the particular income level if the income share generated by the poor is sufficiently large. On the other hand, there are distributions of resources for which democracy is infeasible in equilibrium regardless of the level of economic development. The model also delivers results on the stability of democracy. Variations in inequality across several dimensions due to unbalanced technological change, immigration or changes in the demographic structure affect the scope for democracy or may even lead to its breakdown. Among other historical examples, the results are consistent with the different political regimes that emerged in Germany after its unification in 1871. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Two-round election systems with a large number of single-member districts offer an ideal testing ground because results from the first round provide a better benchmark for voter expectations than any possible alternative measure. Using data from the 2002 and 2006 general elections in Hungary, we find that the lead of a candidate in the first round is magnified by about 10 percent in the second round, controlling for country-wide swings of the electorate between the two rounds and for the behavior of voters of smaller parties. A separate exercise suggests that at least part of the effect is caused by the lower probability of individuals voting in the second round if their preferred candidate is likely to lose by a large margin.","[Kiss, Aron] Cent Bank Hungary MNB, Budapest, Hungary; [Simonovits, Gabor] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Kiss, A (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",aron.kiss@gmail.com,"Simonovits, Gabor/IRZ-7380-2023","Kiss, Aron/0000-0002-2366-8332",,,,,36,19,24,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2014,160.0,3-4,,,,,327,344,,10.1007/s11127-013-0146-y,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AL7VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339344600003,0

Although several microcredit programs have adopted the joint liability scheme, economic theory suggests that joint liability could increase strategic default through contagion and free-riding. This paper aims at studying the extent of free-riding and contagion in joint liability lending. By using data from experimental repayment games conducted in Vietnam, with noisy signals that resemble actual microcredit programs, we found that subjects were motivated to free-ride under the joint liability scheme. While most empirical research in this area has focused on the problem of contagion, our findings point to the significance of investigating free-riding behavior under joint liability schemes. Analyses reveal that the free-riding tendency may be led by the irresponsiveness of repayment and shouldering behavior to the partner's seemingly strategic default in the previous round.

Regarding the long run, if banks' leverage ratios or related liability shares are stable over time, they form a cointegrating relationship. Thus, cointegration tests indicate whether banks' liability ratios were stable or subject to structural breaks during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. By endogenous identification of structural breaks, my analysis tracks the precise channels of banks' leverage adjustments. Findings on the long run suggest that banks cut their leverage twice. In June 2007 banks significantly reduced their foreign debt, while in April 2008 they withdrew from interbank borrowing. Regarding the short run, I study how banks adjust to the dynamics of risk proxies from distinct financial markets. Findings on the short run point out that banks' reactions to risks differ considerably across different types of financial markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, we provide a new leading indicator, which is able to forecast future solvency problems of banks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although Siegel and Woodgate (2007; Management Science, 53, 1005-1015) and Kan and Smith (2008; Management Science, 54,1364-1380) suggested two portfolio frontiers that improved upon the out-of-sample performance of a traditional sample portfolio frontier. However, this study shows that, using the copula function and Gram-Charlier series, the two frontiers are theoretically biased toward the actual frontier unless returns behave normally, and the bias is related to the return skewness and kurtosis. Indeed, the two frontiers are empirically biased to the lower-left side of the actual ones, because the Taiwan stock returns are right-skewed and highly leptokurtic. Thus, this study thus proposes revised portfolio frontiers that are closer to the actual frontier than unrevised ones. This improvement may enhance the estimation accuracy of the capital market line, and hence this study can provide an effective investment reference. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Because of the changing availability of the number of newspapers in Nexis/Lexis, two sets of time are examined: from January 1991 to May 2004 and from January 1985 to May 2004. Our results suggest that American newspapers tend to give more positive coverage to the same economic news when Democrats are in the White House than when Republicans are; a similar though smaller effect is found for Democratic control of Congress. Our results reject the claim that reader diversity is a powerful force toward accuracy. When all types of news are pooled into a single analysis, our results are significant. However, the results vary greatly depending upon which types of economic data are being reported. When newspapers are examined individually the only support that Republicans appear to obtain is from the president's home state newspapers during his term. This is true for the Houston Chronicle under both Bushes and the Los Angeles Times during the Reagan administration. Contrary to rational expectations, media coverage affects people's perceptions of the economy.","[Lott, John R., Jr.] Crime Prevent Res Ctr, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Hassett, Kevin A.] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Lott, JR (通讯作者)，Crime Prevent Res Ctr, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA.",johnrlott@aol.com; khassett@aei.org,,,,,,,62,36,46,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2014,160.0,1-2,,,,,65,108,,10.1007/s11127-014-0171-5,0.0,,,44,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AW7ZY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346481600005,0

We add the effect of hot money on exchange rate exposures and find that significant exchange rate exposures exist for most industries. After including the buy-sell imbalance of foreign investors as a factor, we find that the positive effect of currency value changes on stock returns probably contributes to the concurrent increase in the stock and foreign exchange markets caused by the hot money flowing into Taiwan from foreign investors.

The argument for using a declining discount rate (DDR) is simple: if the discount rates that will be applied in the future are uncertain but positively correlated, and if the analyst can assign probabilities to these discount rates, then the result will be a declining schedule of certainty-equivalent discount rates. There is a growing empirical literature that estimates models of long-term interest rates and uses them to forecast the DDR schedule. However, this literature has been criticized because it lacks a connection to the theory of project evaluation. In benefit-cost analysis, the net benefits of a project in year t (in consumption units) are discounted to the present at the rate at which society would trade consumption in year t for consumption in the present. With simplifying assumptions, this leads to the Ramsey discounting formula, which results in a declining certainty-equivalent discount rate if the rate of growth in consumption is uncertain and if shocks to consumption are correlated over time. We conclude that the arguments in favor of a DDR are compelling and thus merit serious consideration by regulatory agencies in the United States.","[Arrow, Kenneth J.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cropper, Maureen L.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Gollier, Christian] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Groom, Ben] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Heal, Geoffrey M.] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA; [Newell, Richard G.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Nordhaus, William D.] Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pindyck, Robert S.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pizer, William A.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Portney, Paul R.] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA; [Sterner, Thomas] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Tol, Richard S.

The high-quality pavement serviceability of these networks is essential to ensure safe, cost-effective daily traffic operations. In-depth analyses of network-wide pavement surface condition data are necessary inputs for optimal pavement design and maintenance, traffic safety enhancement, and sustainable traffic infrastructure system development. This study aims to investigate various pavement distress condition performance measurements and their correlations to better understand temporal-spatial characteristics of roadway distress based on pavement distress condition data collected in New Mexico from 2006 to 2009. Eight major corridors across various urban and rural areas were selected for analyzing pavement surface-distress conditions and discovering their intrinsic characteristics and patterns across both temporal and spatial domains. The results show that there are not strong correlations among different distress measurements, implying the rationality of the current pavement performance measurement protocol used by the state transportation agencies. Regression models were established and GIS-based spatial analyses were performed to extract temporal and spatial patterns of Distress Rate (DR) data. The model results illustrate significant correlations of the DR data on the same route between two consecutive years, which can be partially characterized by a Markov process. GIS-based spatial investigations also show unique features of pavement condition deterioration attributed to diverse geometric characteristics and traffic conditions, such as vehicle compositions and volumes and urban and rural areas. The research findings are helpful to understand the characteristics of pavement distress conditions more clearly and to optimize traffic infrastructure design and maintenance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The hypothesis of emission sustainability is assessed by estimating alternative panel model specifications with conventional and GMM estimators applied to the highly heterogeneous Italian regional agriculture, whose methane and nitrous oxide emissions are properly reconstructed for the periods 1951-2008 and 1980-2008. The modelling approach and the empirical specification include the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) as one of the possible outcomes. Results suggest that, when a significant relationship between agricultural GHG emissions and productivity growth occurs, it is often monotonic and, though sustainability is accepted for some GHG, no univocal robust evidence of the EKC emerges across the different specifications, estimators and periods. Policy implications of this empirical evidence are finally drawn.","[Coderoni, Silvia] INEA, Natl Inst Agr Econ, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Esposti, Roberto] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Coderoni, S (通讯作者)，INEA, Natl Inst Agr Econ, Via Nomentana 41, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",coderoni@inea.it; r.esposti@univpm.it,"Coderoni, Silvia/C-4740-2016","Coderoni, Silvia/0000-0001-8751-7376; ESPOSTI, Roberto/0000-0002-1656-0331",,,,,63,36,36,1,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Although speed, delay, and pick-up duration can significantly affect overall efficiency of paratransit service, studies that have focused on these performance measures have been rare. This study examines how these performance measures are associated with local environmental characteristics such as density and the characteristics of the trip makers. It uses a dataset containing detailed information on a large volume of trips made by the registered clients of Access Link, a paratransit service operated by NJ TRANSIT for persons with disabilities. To measure speed and delay, network distances for 1.91 million trips were estimated by the ArcGIS Network Analyst extension. Analysis of variance and regression models were used to examine the associations between the performance measures and a set of variables pertaining to trips, passengers, and characteristics of pick-up and drop-off locations. Models for the entire study area as well as specific Access Link regions show that there is a significant association between local environmental and personal characteristics of passengers and the performance measures. Evidence was found that higher density of population, employment, and intersections at the local level may have a significant adverse effect on service efficiency because of lower speed and higher delay. Planning implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a method to jointly measure the intensity of risk aversion, prudence, and temperance. Our theoretical approach is to define risk compensations of different orders, and in an experiment we elicit these compensations with a price list technique. We find evidence for risk aversion, prudence, and temperance. These traits correlate within subjects. The compensations elicited for prudence are significantly larger than those for risk aversion and temperance. In contrast to commonly used utility functions, prospect theory can predict this behavioral pattern. In our experiment, risk-averse, risk-loving, and risk-neutral subjects are prudent. This supports a recent theoretical observation that prudence may be a more universal trait than previously realized.","[Ebert, Sebastian] Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Wiesen, Daniel] Univ Cologne, Seminar Personnel Econ, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Wiesen, Daniel] Univ Cologne, Fac Management Econ & Social Sci, HRM, D-50937 Cologne, Germany",Tilburg University; University of Cologne; University of Cologne,"Ebert, S (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",s.ebert@uvt.nl; daniel.wiesen@uni-koeln.de,"Wiesen, Daniel/ABF-3793-2021","Wiesen, Daniel/0000-0003-4627-1730",,,,,60,73,77,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

It allows the preferences of the politicians involved to be analysed with regard to the two potential errors of an early warning system - missing a crisis and issuing a false alarm. These preferences might differ with the institutional setting. Such an analysis is done for the first time in this article for early warning systems in general by using a standard signals approach, including a preference-based optimisation approach, to set thresholds. It is shown that, in general, the thresholds of the Commission's Scoreboard are rather tight (resulting in more alarm signals), as compared to a neutral stand.

One issue is how to address projects inaugurated under the Gaddafi government, such as the terminal extension at Tripoli International Airport. Additionally, the state-owned Afriqiyah Airlines had been establishing a niche hub in Tripoli before the 2011 war, but this development has subsequently been stalled. Against this background, we analyse the prospects of an air transport hub operation in Libya, focusing on traffic between Africa and Europe, from a bird's-eye economic-geographic view. First, a literature review is undertaken to identify general success factors for air transport hubs. Second, a weighted average distance penalty (WADP) indicator is developed and applied to Tripoli as a potential hub location. This indicator considers all 4755 O&Ds between Europe and Africa with more than 100 passengers in 2012. For sensitivity reasons, alternative WADPs are estimated for the 3209 traffic flows not including North Africa and for (forecasted) future air traffic demand in 2020. The results for Tripoli International Airport are benchmarked against competing hub locations, such as Algiers, Cairo, and the major European airports. We conclude by discussing the implications of the current and anticipated future security and economic situation in the country. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The main idea in entrepreneurship literature is that EO leads to increased firm performance. We question this logic in a family business context because family related non-financial goals, like SEW, may prevent the firm to reap the fruits of their entrepreneurial efforts. Specifically, we argue that SEW engenders inefficiencies that place constraints on the realization of the benefits of entrepreneurship. Therefore, we propose that a high level of SEW preservation hinders the transmission of the family firm's EO into positive performance effects. To test this hypothesis, an empirical study was developed using a sample of 232 Belgian private family firms. Robust linear regression analysis reveals that the positive effect of EO on financial performance decreases as the level of SEW preservation increases.","[Schepers, Jelle; Voordeckers, Wim; Steijvers, Tensie] Hasselt Univ, Kizok Res Ctr, Hasselt, Belgium; [Laveren, Eddy] Univ Antwerp, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium",Hasselt University; University of Antwerp,"Voordeckers, W (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Kizok Res Ctr, Hasselt, Belgium.",jelle.schepers@uhasselt.be; wim.voordeckers@uhasselt.be,"Laveren, Eddy/HGE-7884-2022; Voordeckers, Wim/C-2239-2018; Hadri, Valdet/AAE-5457-2021; Steijvers, Tensie/E-6253-2017","Voordeckers, Wim/0000-0001-7041-3933; Steijvers, Tensie/0000-0001-6947-4421",,,,,89,131,140,4,128,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Although many studies have shown that UBP has a short-run effect on recycling, few works have tackled the long-run effect on waste generation and recycling. By using panel data for 665 Japanese cities over 8 years, we examine the long-run effect of UBP on waste generation and recycling. The estimation results in waste generation suggest that there is a rebound effect, though a small one. We confirm that the effect of UBP on recycling sustains for the long run. We also find that the short- and long-run responses to an economic incentive for recycling activities differ with income groups. Recycling among the high-income group has not been promoted by implementation of UBP, but people in that group are willing to participate in recycling without an economic incentive. In contrast, recycling activity within the low-income group is strongly motivated by UBP for many years.","[Usui, Takehiro] Soka Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo 1928577, Japan; [Takeuchi, Kenji] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Soka University; Kobe University,"Usui, T (通讯作者)，Soka Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo 1928577, Japan.",usui@soka.ac.jp,"Takeuchi, Kenji/GWV-8019-2022","Takeuchi, Kenji/0000-0002-6180-7663",,,,,55,37,39,1,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, we provide first evidence that the difference between the actual and desired amount of working hours in paid employment is positively related to the propensity to switch to self-employment. Furthermore, our analysis supports the hypothesis that employees who perceive their current wage level as very unfair are more likely to have higher entrepreneurial intentions. However, the closer actual wages get to the wage levels perceived as fair, the more employees are likely to remain in their current employment situation. We also tested the interaction effect of working time preferences and fair wage perceptions. In line with our theoretical considerations, we find that employees who perceive their wages as unfair and, simultaneously, prefer different work hours have the strongest entrepreneurial intentions.","[Werner, Arndt] Univ Siegen, Inst Mittelstandsforsch Bonn IfM Bonn, D-53111 Bonn, Germany; [Gast, Johanna; Kraus, Sascha] Univ Liechtenstein, Inst Entrepreneurship, FL-9490 Vaduz, Liechtenstein; [Kraus, Sascha] Utrecht Univ Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Universitat Siegen; University of Liechtenstein; Utrecht University,"Werner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Siegen, Inst Mittelstandsforsch Bonn IfM Bonn, Maximilianstr 20, D-53111 Bonn, Germany.",werner@ifm-bonn.org; johanna.gast@uni.li; sascha.kraus@wu.ac.at,,"Kraus, Sascha/0000-0003-4886-7482",,,,,80,24,26,0,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The empirical analysis is based on a sample covering China's import control measures (e.g. TBT, tariff, license and quota) of all harmonized system (HS) 4-digit products during the period 1998-2006. A modified two-stage gravity model is used to correct for Heckman selection bias and firm heterogeneity bias. This paper finds that, in general, TBT reduce China's import probability with potential trade partners, but raise the import values with existing trade partners. Further evidence shows that the TBT effects on trade value remain quite stable. However, the TBT effects on trade probability vary a great deal across industries and countries in different time periods.","Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ SHUFE, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Bao, XH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ SHUFE, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",xhbao369@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,30,9,10,4,67,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We use the novel World input-output database that provides bilateral and bisectoral data for 40 countries and 35 sectors for 1995-2009. We find South-North convergence of energy and labor intensities, an energy bias of import-driven convergence and no robust difference between imports of intermediate and investment goods. Accordingly, trade helps emerging economies follow a 'green growth' path, and trade-related policies can enhance this path. However, the effects are economically small and require a long time horizon to become effective. Trade-related policies can become much more effective in selected countries and sectors: China attenuates labor intensity via imports of intermediate goods above average. Brazil reduces energy intensity via imports of intermediate and investment goods above average. Production of machinery as an importing sector in emerging countries can immoderately benefit from trade-related reductions in factor intensities. Electrical equipment as a traded good particularly decreases energy intensity. Machinery particularly dilutes labor intensity.

In contrast, we investigate directly the determinants of urban land prices within a metropolitan area - the San Francisco Bay Area. Our analysis focuses on the relationship between the regulation of urban development within different jurisdictions and land prices, while considering other factors that shape the value of land, such as topography and access to jobs. We find that cities that require a greater number of independent reviews to obtain a building permit or a zoning change have higher land prices, ceteris paribus. Finally, we relate the variation in land prices to the prices paid for housing in the region and show that local land use regulations are closely linked to the value of houses sold. This is in part because regulations are so pervasive, and also because land values represent such a large fraction of house values in the San Francisco Bay Area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A theoretical framework is proposed suggesting that countries may show a certain degree of religion-enhanced international altruism associated with a lower home bias. These predictions are investigated empirically using original individual-level data from a survey on religious attitudes and home bias that was designed and collected in 15 countries. Contrary to previous evidence, the empirical investigation suggests that religious denominations may not play an important role in determining home bias. The findings partly corroborate the hypothesis that an open and tolerant attitude towards religion may enhance trust and altruism and, hence, may have a pro-trade effect by lowering home bias. It is concluded that models investigating the relationship between religion and home bias should incorporate different aspects of religion beyond affiliations and should consider different dimensions of home bias.","[Rossini, Gianpaolo] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Leroch, Martin A.] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Econ, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Reggiani, Carlo] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Zucchelli, Eugenio] Univ Lancaster, Div Hlth Res DHR, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",University of Bologna; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; University of Manchester; Lancaster University,"Zucchelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Div Hlth Res DHR, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",gianpaolo.rossini@unibo.it,"Leroch, Martin/AAJ-5029-2020; Zucchelli, Eugenio/Z-4871-2019","Zucchelli, Eugenio/0000-0003-3883-5006; Leroch, Martin/0000-0002-8368-9397; Reggiani, Carlo/0000-0002-5069-3592",,,,,23,4,4,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

On the other hand, paternalism appears in a number of variants, with considerable differences in terms of protagonists, degrees of comprehensiveness, emphases and relations to alternative approaches to labour management. After a brief preliminary section, the paper falls into three sections. The first argues for a specific definition of paternalism, against an account of the term's intellectual history. The second provides a sketch of paternalism's lines of development in African and South-East Asian agriculture. The third introduces the other papers in this collection by identifying their contributions to three central questions that arise from these discussions: how paternalism has been contested and by whom, whether paternalism will persist and if so in what form, and the implications of paternalism for citizenship.","[Gibbon, Peter] Danish Inst Int Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gibbon, Peter] Univ Manchester, DK-1401 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Daviron, Benoit; Barral, Stephanie] CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies; CIRAD,"Gibbon, P (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Int Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark.",pgi@diis.dk; daviron@cirad.fr; phanette.barral@gmail.com,,"Barral, Stephanie/0000-0002-0557-5941",,,,,97,16,19,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We examine diversity within and between specific types of capitalism using data from a transnational survey incorporating 14 organizational level practices in a sample of six capitalist archetypes, constituting 27 countries and some 6503 firms. We focus on one of the key-defining features of different varieties of capitalism, the interdependence of employers and employees. We find that there are clustering tendencies, consistent with the literature, but also considerable diversity within as well as between the varieties, although we did not find diffuse diversity or homogeneity. The analysis supports a complex and nuanced relationship within and between varieties of capitalism that has not been previously captured in the literature.","[Walker, James T.; Brewster, Christopher] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Sch Management, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Wood, Geoff] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Reading; University of Warwick,"Walker, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Sch Management, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",j.t.walker@henley.reading.ac.uk; c.j.brewster@henley.reading.ac.uk; Geoffrey.Wood@wbs.ac.uk,,"Brewster, Chris/0000-0001-5314-1518; Walker, James/0000-0002-3477-0236",,,,,50,31,32,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

But the level of information and understanding required for this effect to be observable seems quite high. In this paper, we investigate whether Riker's intuition about citizens acting on institutional preferences is borne out by an original empirical dataset collected for this purpose. These data, a survey commissioned specifically for this project, were collected as part of a larger nationally representative sample conducted right before the 2004 election. The results show that support for a reform to split a state's Electoral College votes proportionally is explained by (1) which candidate one supports, (2) which candidate one thinks is likely to win the election under the existing system of apportionment, (3) preferences for abolishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote winner, and (4) statistical interactions between these variables. In baldly political terms, Kerry voters tend to support splitting their state's Electoral College votes if they felt George W. Bush was likely to win in that state. But Kerry voters who expect Kerry to win their state favor winner-take-all Electoral College rules for their state. In both cases, mutatis mutandis, the reverse is true for Bush voters.","[Aldrich, John; Munger, Michael C.] Duke Univ, Dusham, NC USA; [Reifler, Jason] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Duke University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Munger, MC (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dusham, NC USA.",aldrich@duke.edu; jreifler@gsu.edu; munger@duke.edu,,"Reifler, Jason/0000-0002-1116-7346",,,,,25,14,17,3,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2014,158.0,3-4,,,SI,,541,558,,10.1007/s11127-013-0056-z,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AA3GM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330980900013,0

As a result, the stock exposure imbalance in option transactions translates into an imbalance in stock transactions. This paper decomposes the total stock order imbalance into an imbalance induced by option transactions and an imbalance independent of options. The analysis shows that the option-induced imbalance significantly predicts future stock returns in the cross section controlling for the past stock and options returns, but the imbalance independent of options has only a transitory price impact.

We find evidence that macro and technical predictors can (statistically) improve forecast accuracy and (economically) generate gains to investors: in contrast to the US results, predictability in our sample of European countries exists in recent data. We also find that simple forecast combinations consistently yield substantial benefits both in forecast accuracy and economic gain. For example, the magnitude of the forecasting gains for our European countries is often larger than those found for the US and other G7 countries. We provide initial evidence on the link between country characteristics and out-of-sample forecast performance. Our empirical results indicate that market development is related to the forecast performance of macro variables.

In a two-candidate equilibrium of the citizen-candidate model, asymmetries determine which candidate proposes a more moderate platform. In the probabilistic voting model, they induce both parties to move their platforms in the direction of the asymmetry, and affect the probabilities of victory of the contenders, sometimes in unexpected ways: under a restriction on party preferences, more overprovision avoidance increases the probability of victory of the party proposing a larger public sector and vice versa. The final part of the analysis shows that consumers' risk aversion, prudence and a decreasingly effective government induce overprovision avoidance asymmetries, whereas consumers' risk neutrality, a constant-effective government and a property we call decreasing satiation induce shortfall avoidance asymmetries.

A calibrated model with a fixed exchange rate regime, similar to the gold standard, does well in replicating the dynamics of output during the interwar period. We then ask to what extent shocks to the economy would have been moderated by adopting modern-day policies. We find that if policymakers had adopted a flexible exchange rate with a Taylor rule policy that output fluctuations during the Great Depression would have been moderated by up to 25%. Changes in government fiscal policy would also have moderated output fluctuations, but by a slightly smaller amount.

These empirical findings support the diversification and information hypotheses in the literature. Nevertheless, CDS trading has also introduced a new source of risk.

For such regulation to be effective in controlling the aggregate supply of credit it must be the case that: (i) changes in capital requirements affect loan supply by regulated banks, and (ii) unregulated substitute sources of credit are unable to offset changes in credit supply by affected banks. This paper examines micro evidencelacking to dateon both questions, using a unique data set. In the UK, regulators have imposed time-varying, bank-specific minimum capital requirements since Basel I. It is found that regulated banks (UK-owned banks and resident foreign subsidiaries) reduce lending in response to tighter capital requirements. But unregulated banks (resident foreign branches) increase lending in response to tighter capital requirements on a relevant reference group of regulated banks. This leakage is substantial, amounting to about one-third of the initial impulse from the regulatory change.","[Aiyar, Shekhar] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Calomiris, Charles W.] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, Financial Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wieladek, Tomasz] Bank England, External MPC Unit, London, England",International Monetary Fund; Columbia University; Bank of England,"Aiyar, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",saiyar@imf.org; cc374@columbia.edu; tomasz.wieladek@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,55,218,235,2,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Using the spatial dynamics of district-level per-capita income it was found that income distribution did not change between the years examined. It is argued that this is because of per-capita income across districts being spatially positively correlated. Physical infrastructure, human capital, and factories are identified as factors responsible for increase in income for both the rich as well as the poor districts. Infrastructure, physical or social, is a key component of growth in India. A policy impact analysis shows development of better drainage and potable water systems has a large impact on income. For the year 2001/02, it was found that for every 1% increase in closed drainage system and potable water, district-level median income increases by 1.39% and 0.21%, respectively.","[Banerjee, Anurag] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham, England; [Banik, Nilanjan] Inst Financial Management Res, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",Durham University; KREA University; IFMR - Graduate School of Business (GSB),"Banik, N (通讯作者)，Inst Financial Management Res, 24 Kothari Rd, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",a.n.banerjee@durham.ac.uk,"Banik, Nilanjan/HGD-9944-2022",,,,,,19,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Under this rule, termed the bounded rule, taxpayers are informed of the maximum number of audits by a tax authority, so that the audit probability depends on the joint decisions among the taxpayers. We compare the bounded rule to the widely studied flat-rate rule, where taxpayers are informed that they will be audited with a constant probability. The experimental evidence shows that, as theoretically predicted, the bounded rule induces the same level of compliance as the flat-rate rule when strategic uncertainty is low, and a higher level of compliance when strategic uncertainty is high. The bounded rule also induces distinctive tax evasion dynamics compared to the flat-rate rule. The results suggest that increasing the level of strategic uncertainty among taxpayers could be an effective device to deter tax evasion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

One of the reasons for competition among same-style funds is investors' search for the best managers. The high minimum investment required to invest in a hedge fund limits investors' diversification opportunities and makes this search particularly important. Finally, we show that hedge fund investors' implementation of style chasing in combination with intra-style fund selection represents a smart strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Based on food security needs and the central role of agriculture, Africa may stand to benefit from green biotechnology given the low agricultural productivity and the looming food crises in most urban areas. However, the adoption of GM crops in Africa has been slow and limited to a handful of countries. The primary objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of GM maize adoption in South Africa by looking at wholesale spot prices. We apply a threshold autoregressive model to time series data on the price of maize and GM adoption rates in South Africa to address the following questions: (1) Does the adoption of GM maize excite the growth rate of price of maize in South Africa; (2) Does the error variance of the maize price growth rate exhibit regime-switching behaviour to impact the volatility? The results show evidence that the adoption of GM maize influences the dynamics of the maize price growth rate in South Africa. Further, there is strong evidence that the error variance exhibits regime-switching behaviour with the posterior mean for the error variance in the first regime about twice as large as that of the second regime.","[Abidoye, Babatunde O.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Mabaya, Edward] Cornell Univ, Charles H Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Pretoria; Cornell University,"Abidoye, BO (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",babidoye@gmail.com; em37@cornell.edu,,"Abidoye, Babatunde/0000-0002-3594-3872",John Templeton Foundation,John Templeton Foundation,This article was made possible through the support of a grant from the John Templeton Foundation.

The paper makes an update and re-evaluation of problems related to Romania's agriculture production potential, in the context of the current evolutions of the agrarian and production structures and of the possible effects of the Common Agricultural Policy Reform. The changes produced in the last decade are investigated with regard to farm consolidation, increase of farm area, agricultural land operation modality and land market problems. At the same time, the production structures are also analyzed in relation to farm size. The main conclusion of the study is that the current agrarian structures contribute by different modalities to ensuring the domestic agricultural supply and food security. The calculation of certain statistical indicators on production variability and its diversification on the large, medium and small-sized farms revealed the strong specialization of production on the large farms and production diversification on the small farms.

Although research has been conducted on the effects of EWEs, such as flooding and snowfall, limited research has been conducted on the effects of heatwaves and hot weather conditions. Heatwaves present a somewhat different risk profile to construction, unlike EWEs such as flooding and heavy snowfall that present physical obstacles to work onsite. However, heatwaves have affected the construction industry in the UK, and construction claims have been made due to adverse weather conditions. With heatwaves being expected to occur more frequently in the coming years, the construction industry may suffer unlike any other industry during the summer months. This creates the need to investigate methods that would allow construction activities to progress during hot summer months with minimal effect on construction projects. Hence, the purpose of this paper. Regions such as the Middle East and the UAE in particular flourish with mega projects, although temperatures soar to above 40 degrees C in the summer months. Lessons could be learnt from such countries and adapted in the UK. Interviews have been conducted with a lead representative of a client, a consultant and a contractor, all of which currently operate on UAE projects. The key findings include one of the preliminary steps taken by international construction companies operating in the UAE. This involves restructuring their entire regional team by employing management staff from countries such as Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, and their labour force from the sub-continent such as India and Pakistan. This is not only due to the cheap wage rate but also to the ability to cope and work in such extreme hot weather conditions. The experience of individuals working in the region allows for future planning, where the difference in labour productivity during the extreme hot weather conditions is known, allowing precautionary measures to be put in place.

The negative relationship between managerial ownership and board activity is consistent with previous research conducted in the one-tier board model, but I argue that in the two-tier board model this can augment the shortcomings of the supervisory board.","Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Bohdanowicz, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",lbohdan@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,59,0,0,1,15,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,26,36,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500003,0

These are the steps to enhance the performance of project execution, make buildings energy efficient and reduce carbon emissions. The IGBP-PDRI model proposed to construct in this study is based on the life cycle of the engineering to set up different phases of work for process evaluation. The objective of each phase is subject to the work breakdown structure. The model of evaluation is divided into 4 sections, 11 categories, and 60 elements. The model has been tested empirically. Pre-project planning helps to forecast possible risks in the development of the project. In the course of project execution, quality requirement is satisfied through monitoring and control.

However, contrary to what one might expect, the government of Cambodia initiated unconventional intervention: it cancelled the fishing lots system, the de facto property rights that had granted exclusive access to certain aquatic resources to licence holders. These interventions, focused on Cambodia's largest lake, question the rationale behind such state measures to forfeit control. This paper demonstrates that political interests such as garnering election votes and circumventing certain bureaucratic agencies explain this radical shift in policy. Opening up previously exclusive lot areas to the communities won immediate support from the poor fishermen. However, now that the lake is under a more diverse, if obscure, system of governance managed by multiple agencies, the environmental and social consequences of the policy shift deserve a fuller examination.","[Dina, Thol] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Sato, Jin] Univ Tokyo, Inst Adv Studies Asia, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Sato, J (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Studies Asia, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",hwaka@rr.iij4u.or.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25301008] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,60,10,10,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

After unification (discretization and categorization) input value attributes, decision-making rules were calculated through the decision-making rule generation algorithm based on the rough set theory. A classification based on the generated rules classified the client (company) into creditworthy and uncreditworthy groups. The result of fuzzy logic was used to compare with the classification based on the rough set theory. The accuracies of the rough set (91.7%) and fuzzy logic (83.3 %) were compared.

Filled with several accusations of corruption, inefficient management and low absorption capacity, this period has been a tough one for the Romanian government, for the managing authorities and for the beneficiaries of the European funding, as well. Taking this into consideration the present research will be focused and will analyze the main changes occurred at the level of European funding policy in Romania in the programming period 2014-2020 in comparison with those of 2007-2013. This study is also based over the analysis of the results which were obtained within the five years which passed from the first financial allocation period. In the same time the study will realize a comparison between the different financial and organizational switches proposed to be realized at the level of the organization of management authorities, at the level of financial allocation and at the level of eligible projects. Since for Romania the period 2014-2020 represents only the second budgetary allocation period for European Union structural finding this should be considered at national level an excellent opportunity to prove that Romania learned from the mistakes from the first period of allocation and that evolved from a net contributor to a net spender of European Union's financial resources.","[Droj, Laurentiu] Univ Oradea, Fac Econ, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,,laurentiu.droj@gmail.com,"Droj, Laurentiu/N-3340-2019","Droj, Laurentiu/0000-0002-0659-9638",,,,,5,0,0,0,8,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-021-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,128,133,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346752000017,0

An important problem with using ANN for time series forecasting is to determine the number of neurons in hidden layer. There have been some approaches in the literature to deal with the problem of determining the number of neurons in hidden layer. A new ANN model was suggested which is called multiplicative neuron model (MNM) in the literature. MNM has only one neuron in hidden layer. Therefore, the problem of determining the number of neurons in hidden layer is automatically solved when MNM is employed. Also, MNM can produce accurate forecasts for non-linear time series. ANN models utilized for non-linear time series have generally autoregressive structures since lagged variables of time series are generally inputs of these models. On the other hand, it is a well-known fact that better forecasts for real life time series can be obtained from models whose inputs are lagged variables of error. In this study, a new recurrent multiplicative neuron neural network model is firstly proposed. In the proposed method, lagged variables of error are included in the model. Also, the problem of determining the number of neurons in hidden layer is avoided when the proposed method is used. To train the proposed neural network model, particle swarm optimization algorithm was used. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, it was applied to a real life time series. Then, results produced by the proposed method were compared to those obtained from other methods. It was observed that the proposed method has superior performance to existing methods.

Fat-cat salaries occur if public ownership with intrinsic motivation and a fixed wage is followed by privatisation with MCO, performance-related pay and a lower effort.

In addition, we find that the differential effect by education is larger for mandatory seat belt laws with primary rather than secondary enforcement.

Companies and researchers are constantly trying to understand the key drivers that caused significant impact on companies' performance and how to challenge them in future. One still not sufficiently covered research issue is the role that intellectual capital has played in the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises, and how this role has changed after the crisis. Intellectual capital has become a key value creation driver in the new economy. Its positive influence on firm performance has been proved by numerous empirical studies worldwide. Several of them also investigated how the economic crisis affected this paradigm. However, such an investigation is still missing in Slovakia. The purpose of our study is to examine the relationship between intellectual capital (IC) and firm performance before the recent economic crisis and in the period of recovery, among SMEs in different industries in Slovakia. To measure the level of IC and its respective components we applied the Value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC (TM)) indicator developed by Pulic. This measure, however being criticized by some authors, is the most frequent metric used to evaluate IC and its components using financial data. It provides information about the efficiency of tangible and intangible assets that can be used to generate value to a firm. As far as performance measurement is concerned, we deployed ROA as firm performance metric. Our analysis also accounted for firm size and financial leverage while investigating the effect of IC on SME performance. We based our analysis on panel data comprising of 2008 and 2011 financial statements of 1983 Slovak SMEs operating in 11 industries (sections according to SK NACE rev. 2 classifications). These data have been obtained from business information portal Universal Register Plus operated by CRIF - Slovak Credit Bureau. As far as methods are concerned, to compare the influence of IC on firm performance we constructed pre-crisis (2008) and post-crisis (2011) regression models and analyzed the observed differences. Our findings suggest a rather consistent pattern across almost all investigated industry sections showing that the role of intellectual capital performance in predicting firm's financial performance has increased in post-crisis period comparing to the pre-crisis situation.","[Holienka, Marian; Pilkova, Anna] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Holienka, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",marian.holienka@fm.uniba.sk; anna.pilkova@fm.uniba.sk,"Pilková, Anna/AAD-9645-2019; Holienka, Marian/N-8162-2015","Holienka, Marian/0000-0002-8975-6116",,,,,29,1,1,0,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,58,67,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000008,0

Three key findings emerge. First, overwhelming evidence supports the view that more volatile financial development raises the industrial volatility in sectors that rely more on external liquidity. Second, the positive effect of financial volatility on industrial volatility mainly works through the increase in fluctuations of the growth of real value added per firm and the number of firms, with the former effect more prominent. Third, both the volatilities of the banking sector and the stock market positively associate with higher industrial growth volatility, which contrasts sharply with the finding in the literature that financial structure generally does not matter.

The present paper highlight the potential of the use of this material in different experimental shelter, as building component: the case of the Scaffold House and Cardboard Shelters. The combination of TRMS building elements is a technological skin, which is constitute from modular panels made by TRM, polyester and vulcanized rubber, called Air Shelter House (ASH). The Scaffold House is made by scaffold, traditional TRMS and sandwich panels. It is a modular system easy to assembly thanks to the simple technology used, which can help the selfconstruction and maintenance by the users. To improve the processes of housing installation, ensuring thermal performance, the envelope is changing with a new composition of ASH system and sandwich panels. In this way, it is possible to increase the construction processes and deconstruction, in agreement with internal comfort, modularity of units, transport and possible reuse of the shelter in different contest. The plurality of plants functions (as a private house or as a public use), already studied for the internal disposition of the different modules, are still guaranteed from the small thickness of 65 mm of the ASH technology.

This region currently faces a key challenge, which is the necessity to overcome its relatively low social-economic development syndrome. The value of GDP per capita in 2010 was PLN 25,100, which placed the voivodship in penultimate position in the country (the national mean was 67.6%, in 2000 this value was 68.5%). According to purchasing power parity, this value was EUR 9,600, ca. 41% of the mean for the European Union (Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Lubelskiego, 2013b). One of the main priorities of the Regional Innovation Strategy for Lublin Voivodeship (RIS) up to the year 2020 is a focus on the process of economic structure transformation within the voivodship aimed at an increase in the region's economic absorption abilities; i.e. the ability to gain, assimilate, transform and utilize new technological and organizational knowledge (Zarzad Wojewodztwa Lubelskiego, 2013). The identification process of the smart specializations of Lubelskie Voivodeship proceeded in several stages: identification of endogenous development potentials of the region; determination of research and technological specialization of regional universities and R & D units; Identification of the main directions of personnel training at the level of higher education and finally preliminary identification of specialization areas, and their submission for a public consultation process and expert judgment. According to RIS, the key specialization of Lublin region is to become a bio-economy including selected activity areas (including sciences) related to the manufacture and processing of biological-origin resources (bio-resources) for food, energy and medical purposes. Methodology of smart specializations selection, has moreover allowed the identification of complementary specialization in the form of medical and health promoting services, supporting specialization, e.g. IT and automatics, and emerging specialization, i.e. low-emission power industry. This article discusses the premises which determined the choice of the specific areas of smart specializations for Lublin Voivodeship, with particular consideration of the intellectual capital elements.","Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Management, Lublin, Poland",,"Kasztelan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Management, Lublin, Poland.",armand.kasztelan@up.lublin.pl,"KASZTELAN, ARMAND/T-3982-2018","KASZTELAN, ARMAND/0000-0002-1947-9846",,,,,22,0,0,0,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,68,77,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000009,0

Over-demand of gifted, well educated employees can produce serious anomalies as well. Firms, universities or governmental organizations are facing great challenges, when attempting to fill the openings or newly created positions with talented co-workers. Talent shortage is especially distressing in the healthcare industry, in the education, in the IT sector and in the business service sector, even in those sectors, which determine the future competitiveness of countries. The concept of talent is redefined by the author, in order to make it usable for economic analysis. Namely the employers always buy talent in packages together with the employees' accumulated knowledge, so it can be describe in statistics just together. An extension of the talent shortage concept, the author introduced the quality talent shortage, which endanger even in those sectors, where otherwise surplus of manpower exists. The main goal of the paper is searching for the reasons of the global talent shortage and systematize the quite diverse explanations, appearing in the literature separately. The author looked for deeper determination behind the several concrete factors caused over-demand of talent. Her main finding is, that most reasons of talent over-demand closely connected with the trends of technological development, whilst the insufficient talent supply can be explained basically by social factors, resulted from the social system. The author formulates the conclusions, that in many countries the ever shrinking sources of talent make it necessary to discover and to consciously exploit new, so far insufficiently exploited sources of talent (women, elderly people, socially disadvantaged groups, minorities etc.).","[Katalin, Szabo] Corvinus Univ Budapest, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,,katalin.szabo@uni-corvinus.hu,,,,,,,30,0,0,1,4,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,631,644,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200046,0

The MNFs' location decisions are influenced by the fixed cost of FDI, the spillover of technologies to a foreign firm, and pollution emission standards in the host and home countries. There exist multiple equilibria in the location pattern because of the technology spillover accompanied by FDI. In addition, the analysis leads to the possibility of an equilibrium based on the Prisoners' Dilemma. When the host country relaxes emission standards, the MNFs choose FDI, although their profits are higher if both choose to export instead. This provides a rationale for the FDI source country's intervention to restrict the MNFs' FDI according to the level of environmental regulation in the host country.","[Lee, Ki-Dong] Keimyung Univ, Dept Int Commerce, Taegu 704701, South Korea; [Lee, Woohyung] Keimyung Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Taegu 704701, South Korea; [Kang, Kichun] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Kyongsan 712749, Gyeongbuk, South Korea",Keimyung University; Keimyung University; Yeungnam University,"Lee, W (通讯作者)，Keimyung Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 1095 Dalgubeoldaero, Taegu 704701, South Korea.",kdlee@kmu.ac.kr; iuh1231@kmu.ac.kr; kikang@ynu.ac.kr,"Lee, Ki-Dong/L-4195-2017","Lee, Ki-Dong/0000-0002-2660-2806",,,,,35,5,5,2,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

However, detailed facts on pricing strategies in this sector are still missing in Germany. This paper aims to provide cross-sectional evidence of pricing strategies in the quick service-sector. The focus lies on convenient prices, which according to KNOTEK (2011) simplifies the purchase due to a lower number of necessary monetary units. Convenient prices that match round prices ending on monetary denominations prevail. The only exceptions are fast-food-restaurants, which offered often odd prices. Consequently, in these stores at least one monetary unit more than in takeaway shops would be necessary to pay for the products. The study shows that there are common principles in pricing strategies in the quick service sector and the retailing sector, but also differences.","[Moeser, Anke] ConsumerTrail, D-35329 Gemunden Felda, Germany; [Kriep, Laura] Univ Giessen, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Möser, A (通讯作者)，ConsumerTrail, Ermenroderstr 14, D-35329 Gemunden Felda, Germany.",anke.moeser@consumertrail.de,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,4,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Despite these advantages, farmers make little use of weather-index insurances as yet. With this in mind, the present study focuses on the question if bounded rationality provides an explanation for the missing willingness to adopt this type of insurance. For lack of a natural experiment, an extra-laboratory experiment is carried out in the form of a multi-period, single-person business simulation game with students of agricultural sciences. Two major questions are to be answered: first, does the demand for weather-index insurances change if the subjects are not only informed about the total insurance premium but also about the loading? Second, does demand change in a framing where subjects are told that the (unchanged loading) is the result of a subsidized insurance offer? In the experiment, the explicit communication of the loading did not have a significant effect. However, demand increased in the subsidization framing. This indicates that government funding is per se considered as a quality signal and that subsidized actions are preferred without an individual analysis of their relative competitiveness.","[Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, Fak Agr, Dept Agrarokonomie & Rurale Entwicklung, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Gruener, Sven; Hirschauer, Norbert] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Germany",University of Gottingen; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Musshoff, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fak Agr, Dept Agrarokonomie & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Gruener, Sven/0000-0001-5794-7076; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889",,,,,38,5,5,1,20,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

However, Asian crisis broke this development process. Economy declined, inflation picked up, unemployment rate and poverty rate increased, which led to import substitution policy again.

(b) soft resilience: the ability of systems to absorb and recover from the impact of disruptive events without fundamental changes in function or structure, which depend on the flexibility and adaptive capacity of the system as a whole, rather than simply strengthening structures or institutions in relation to specific stresses, as in the hard resilience approach. However, there are three possibilities in response to threats of disturbance: (a) Resistance and maintenance, which is characterized by resistance to change. A human system of this type would do its utmost to avoid change and would typically deny that a problem exists. (b) Change at the margins, characterized by acknowledgement of the problem, discussion of the implications, and, hopefully, a clear acknowledgement that the present system is not sustainable and that change is needed. (c) Openness and adaptability, an approach reduces vulnerability by having a high degree of flexibility. Its key characteristic is a preparedness to adopt new basic operating assumptions and institutional structures. Once the resilience options have been identified to meet the vulnerability of a system, it is necessary to compare the degree of resilience that the different alternatives may offer. The different concepts are examined to propose both a qualitative and a possible quantification of the degree of resilience that may be achieved by the different measures proposed for implementation.

Within IFRS, fair value accounting is both very significant and controversial. In May 2011 the IASB released a new standard regarding fair value measurement; IFRS 13 was intended to provide a uniform regulation for this central valuation. It is examined whether fair value is conceptually appropriate for use in controlling if the new IFRS 13 is adhered to. Admittedly, the new IFRS 13 brings no significant improvements in terms of taxation. Fair value balancing does have certain implications for performance measurement, shown in balance sheet ratio. This, however, can be assessed only for each individual case, and not across the board. Using fair value accounting, value-driven single-period performance measures such as EVA have a potentially better database, which reduces only the number of transitional positions.","[Runzheimer, Bodo] Hsch Pforzheim Univ, Pforzheim, Germany",,,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,582,599,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000043,0

Gathering and proper use of this information is essential for the understanding the drivers of business performance, enabling companies to identify future sources of value in the competitive environment of the organization. Thus, the effectiveness of the system of measuring human capital in the organization thus depends mainly on the proper selection of the sets of metrics and indicators. However, despite the increasing importance of human capital, the development of systems and tools for its measurement remains a major challenge for both theory and practice of management. There is a wide range of data on human capital that should be taken into account in the management of the organization, which should be linked to the information needs of the given organization. The paper focuses on human capital measurement practices of the companies operating in Poland. The outline of the research project entitled, Human capital as an element of company's value will be presented, including the quantitative research findings of CATI questionnaire of a large sample of 600 companies (50 large, 150 medium sized and 400 small and micro). The aim of the study was to investigate the information needs, and currently used HC measurement tools of Polish enterprises of different sizes. The research focused primarily on: the experience of Polish entrepreneurs in the use of existing tools to measure human capital, the scope of information that is considered by Polish entrepreneurs in the measurement of human capital, factors that enable effective implementation and proper use of tools to measure human capital. The paper presents the major findings of this survey. Less than 15% of the surveyed companies apply human capital measurement on regular basis. The key reason for the measurement is the improvement of the personnel decision-making process and the need to reduce personnel costs. The study indicates that the main focus of the measurement is the cost-based perspective of human capital, as the most commonly used measures of HC are cost related: compensation costs, absenteeism, training costs and costs associated with staff turnover.","Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Sienkiewicz, L (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",lukasz.sienkiewicz@sgh.waw.pl,"Sienkiewicz, Łukasz J/D-1087-2019",,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,217,225,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000027,0

The results indicate that traditional project management phases and techniques are adapted to fit with agile.

We propose that the stages of business cycles in socio-economic systems depend on the dynamics of the interrelation and volume ratio of the financial and real sectors of the economy. The proposed tool for the quantitative measurement of the financial sector divides the sector into two segments. The first segment consists of the cash and stock, and its volume can be measured at any moment in time. The second segment is quantum in nature and consists of derivatives; measuring this segment requires special instruments including instruments imported from quantum physics. This study posits that the dynamics of the entrepreneurial sector of the economy are defined by the economic formation (which is used as a synonym of economy structure) during the applicable time period, and the economic formation itself can be described by the independent variables of the resources used and the maximum intensity with which these resources can be used. The relationships between economic formations are described by applying the elements of fractal theory. The study describes different stages of the business cycle as specific relational states between the financial and economic sectors; these relational states also define the institutional environment and level of institutional development. The study concludes by discussing the limitations of the suggested theoretical approach for modeling business cycles and the areas that require further research.","[Svirina, Anna] Kazan Natl Res Tech Univ, Econ, Kazan, Russia; [Parfenova, Elena; Shurkina, Elena] Kazan Natl Res Tech Univ, Kazan, Russia",Kazan National Research Technical University - KAI; Kazan National Research Technical University - KAI,"Svirina, A (通讯作者)，Kazan Natl Res Tech Univ, Econ, Kazan, Russia.",anna_svirina@yahoo.com; elena_parf@mail.ru; elena@yahoo.com,"Parfenova, Elena I/T-5101-2017; Svirina, Anna/AAF-6960-2021; Svirina, Anna/HTS-1465-2023","Svirina, Anna/0000-0001-8598-558X",,,,,37,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,755,763,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300081,0

In particular, principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted in order to identify the factors that affect people in purchasing food produced domestically in Greece. The factors that influence people in Greece to buy Hellenic food are: (a) product's features (I)) psychological issues, (c) economic issues. Furthermore, cluster analysis was employed to classify consumers with similar buying behaviour towards Hellenic food, and identified three groups of consumers: (a) those that support the National Economy, (b) those who are influenced by psychological issues and (c) opportunists. Discriminant analysis was performed to assess how the identified factors derived from PCA could predict cluster membership.

First, satisfaction levels are correlated with GDP and then, individual characteristics of income, gender, education and family status are regressed to as explanatory variables of life satisfaction. While the explanatory power of GDP is found as very weak for the entire period, the effect of objective characteristics has peaked in 1999 and the effect of subjective perceptions in 2008.

The focus of the research on small and micro-enterprises stems from little attention paid to these enterprises and the undeniable importance of small and micro-enterprises for the economy. Primary research is based on the examination of a phenomenological paradigm, i.e. it focuses on understanding human behaviour on the basis of a reference framework for research participants. The main research method used in research is a comparative case study, which is one of few methods that allow research of this sensitive topic. The research focuses on the detection of initiators of creative accounting, the involvement of individual persons in creative accounting and the awareness of people about the use of creative accounting in surveyed small and micro-enterprises in the Czech Republic. The research also attempts to determine internal motives of participants in creative accounting.","Brno Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Zemánková, L (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",ZEMANKOVA@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1256,1265,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300130,0

Our model embeds the core idea of the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship in established knowledge-based growth models by enriching their knowledge spillover structure. Introducing knowledge spillovers drives a wedge between the optimal and market allocation of resources between new knowledge creation and commercialization.

Unlike US studies, we use data from unique UK regulatory and disclosure environment that allows to accurately measure the share buyback completion rates. We show that information disclosure and CEO overconfidence are significant determinants of the share buyback completion rate. In addition, we find that large and widely held firms that conduct subsequent buyback programs and have a past buyback completion reputation exhibit higher completion rates. Finally, we assess whether other CEO characteristics affect buyback completion rates and find that firms with senior CEOs who hold external directorships and have a longer tenure as CEO are more likely to complete the buyback programs.

Under q-theory, managers optimally adjust the supply of assets to changes in their market value. The first-order condition of investment then provides a valuation equation that infers asset prices from managers' costs of supplying the assets. This equation fits well the Tobin's q levels across many testing assets, including portfolios formed on q. With current investment-to-capital as the only input, the supply approach does not require cash flow forecasts or discount rate estimates, both of which are notoriously difficult to obtain in practice.","[Belo, Frederico] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Belo, Frederico; Zhang, Lu] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Xue, Chen] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Zhang, Lu] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, Dept Finance, 760A Fisher Hall,2100 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",zhanglu@fisher.osu.edu,"Zhang, Lu/JXN-8237-2024",,,,,,56,8,14,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The results show that higher income and education lead to occupancy of dwellings with better structural characteristics, an effect that is reinforced if the household is large and contains few children. Religion also matters, with non-Buddhist households occupying dwellings with worse structural characteristics. The directions of these effects are mostly consistent with separate estimates of household bid-rent functions, which show that willingness-to-pay for better housing attributes rises with income and education.

Using consolidated data across both standard and E-mini futures contracts, we find that commercial firms' net trading level appears positively correlated with future index returns but the relationship is not stable across time. Based on more recent data, amongst specialist traders, hedge funds appear superior in terms of access to information and/or trading ability but this advantage is only preserved at high frequency. Therefore, the current weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report - published with a 3-day delay - prevents timely public access to this type of information. Also, trading signals generated by a popular, position-based sentiment index do not produce significant average returns. Overall, this calls into question the reliability of COT-based trading signals used by market professionals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This research examines how option framing could affect choice decisions as a function of a consumer's goal orientation. Study 1 offers convergent support for the proposition that regulatory focus moderates the option framing effect and the mediating role of action/inaction on the relationship between regulatory focus and the option framing effect. In particular, a reverse finding shows that promotion-focused consumers provided with a +OF options list tend to choose more options than those who are given a OF option list. To explain the reverse effect, Study 2 examines and demonstrates regulatory fit as a possible moderator. The results of Study 2 also confirm our inference and echo the same results of Study 1. Finally, based on the regulatory fit theory, Study 3 examines if cognitive constraints associate with a consumer's regulatory orientation may also account for the interaction between regulatory focus and option framing. The results of Study 3 also support the proposition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using banks' use of financial derivatives as a proxy for opacity, we find that high level use of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives are associated with an increase in the synchronicity (R-2) of stock price movements with the market index, which indicates less revelation of bank-specific information to the market. This finding is consistent with the prediction of the model developed by Wagner (2007). We document that superior corporate governance tempers these effects.

While a large number of studies have focused on the phenomenon of strong co-movements of asset prices and capital flows in the event of financial stress, very few discussed the contagion or spillover effects in terms of capital flow volatility. This paper is one of the first attempts to assess, empirically, whether or not there is a global and regional spillover effect in the volatility of capital flows to emerging and developing countries. Based on the sample of 49 emerging and developing countries for the period 1980-2009, the empirical results suggest strong and significant contagion effects in the volatility of capital flows to individual economies. The magnitudes of contagion vary depending on the type of capital flows, whether it is foreign direct investment (FDI) or portfolio and other investment (mostly bank lending). The findings also suggest the volatility dynamics of gross flows is different from that of net flows. The volatility of net inflows is more exposed to intra-regional contagion compared to that of gross inflows. J. Japanese Int. Economies 30 (2013) 76-95.

This paper shows that common regulation is also a conduit for interbank contagion. One bank's failure may undermine confidence in the banking regulator's competence, and, hence, in other banks chartered by the same regulator. As a result, depositors withdraw funds from otherwise unconnected banks. The optimal regulatory response to this behavior can be privately to exhibit forbearance to a failing bank. We show that regulatory transparency improves confidence ex ante but impedes regulators' ability to stem panics ex post. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

One can write a basket option on assets denominated in different currencies, but settle the option in one single currency at some fixed exchange rate. This special type of basket options can be found in many life insurance products that encompass an investment component. In order to value such options, we need to consider not only the joint dynamics of the returns on the underlying assets but also the quanto feature involved. In this paper, we use a regime-switching multivariate lognormal model for modeling returns on various assets and exchange rates. As the parameters of the model can change according to the state of a Markov chain, the model allows for stochastic volatility and correlations. We then demonstrate how domestic investors can choose a risk-neutral probability measure by the multivariate Esscher transform. This valuation methodology is illustrated with an hypothetical investment guarantee that is sold with a life insurance contract. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Ng, Andrew C.

Although insider trading laws apply equally to the options and stock markets, the options market is considerably more transparent than the equity market, which makes insider trading in options more easily detectable. We find that privately informed investors trade in the options market prior to takeover announcements; however, their transactions are limited to liquid call options and options with high inherent leverage. Furthermore, we find that prior to takeover announcements, informed investors trade on their private information in the options market only when a SEC investigation of insider trading is unlikely to occur. Our results suggest that even prior to takeover announcements informed investors are attracted to the options market, which increases profit making potential due the greater leverage it affords, although they trade in a way which minimizes the likelihood of detection.

We find that the investment effects of the variables capturing the demand-side of the capital market, i.e. sales growth and Tobin's q, behave counter-cyclically, whereas this does not hold for the investment effects of supply-side variables such as cash flow or the cost of capital.

For the organization, the possible alternatives are the possible sets of individuals who could serve together. A common approach is to choose from among these alternatives by having each voter cast separate votes on the candidates for each seat. When this type of ballot is used, important characteristics of the set of individuals on the committee (such as what percentage of the members will be female) might not be explicitly considered by the voters. Another approach that has been used is to have each voter cast a ballot which ranks all possible sets of members. However, this approach can require the voters to weigh a relatively large number of alternatives. This paper considers group decisions where it is desirable to: (1) explicitly consider characteristics of alternatives and (2) have a relatively small number of options upon which a voter has to express his preferences. The approach that we propose has two steps: First voters vote directly on pertinent characteristics of alternatives; Then these votes are used to indirectly specify preferences on alternatives. The indirectly specified preferences are ones that are naturally modeled using partially ordered sets. We identify some specific methods that could be applied in the second step. In addition, by replacing the indirectly specified preferences in a suitable way, we suggest a technique that can use any positional, pairwise, or other voting method that accepts totally (or completely) ordered inputs to tally ballots. We also describe another way to potentially compute pairwise rankings from partially ordered alternatives and discuss some practical and theoretical difficulties associated with our approach.","[Ackerman, Michael] Bellarmine Univ, Dept Math, Louisville, KY USA; [Choi, Sul-Young] Le Moyne Coll, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Syracuse, NY USA; [Coughlin, Peter] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Gottlieb, Eric] Rhodes Coll, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Memphis, TN 38112 USA; [Wood, Japheth] Bard Coll, Dept Math, Annandale On Hudson, NY USA",Bellarmine University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Coughlin, P (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",mackerman@bellarmine.edu; sulyoung@lemoyne.edu; coughlin@econ.umd.edu; gottlieb@rhodes.edu; jwood@bard.edu,"Gottlieb, Eric/GPW-7629-2022","Gottlieb, Eric/0000-0002-0874-3023",,,,,31,9,10,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2013,157.0,1-2,,,,,145,168,,10.1007/s11127-012-9930-3,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,213WI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324090700010,0

We find that higher complexity leads to increased price volatility, lower liquidity, and decreased trade efficiency especially when repeated bargaining takes place. However, the channel through which complexity acts is not simply due to the added noise induced by estimation error. Rather, complexity alters the bidding strategies used by traders, making them less inclined to trade, even when we control for estimation error across treatments. As such, it appears that adverse selection plays an important role in explaining the trading abnormalities caused by complexity.","[Carlin, Bruce Ian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kogan, Shimon; Lowery, Richard] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Carlin, BI (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,,,,,,,15,28,31,5,56,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,,,J FINANC,J.

This method jointly accounts for the number and the magnitude of extreme losses and graphically summarizes all information about the performance of a risk model. It relies on the concept of a super exception, which is defined as a situation in which the loss exceeds both the standard Value-at-Risk (VaR) and a VaR defined at an extremely low probability. We then formally test whether the sequences of exceptions and super exceptions are rejected by standard model validation tests. We show that the Risk Map can be used to validate market, credit, operational, or systemic risk estimates (VaR, stressed VaR, expected shortfall, and CoVaR) or to assess the performance of the margin system of a clearing house.

The dynamic interrelations among instruments of bank liquidity management are modelled in a panel Vector Autoregressive (p-VAR) framework. Orthogonalized impulse responses reveal that banks respond to a negative funding liquidity shock in a number of ways. First, banks reduce lending, especially wholesale lending. Second, banks hoard liquidity in the form of liquid bonds and central bank reserves. Third, banks conduct fire sales of securities, especially equity. Fourth, fire sales are triggered by liquidity constraints rather than by solvency constraints. Finally, there is some causality running from fire sales of equity to wholesale lending and liquidity hoarding. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

However, there is a risk that liberalization may benefit internationally active, export-oriented businesses at the expense of domestically oriented ones. This paper models a two-sector economy in which foreign lenders are more efficient than local lenders at extracting value from internationally tradable collateral assets. Under some conditions the entry of foreign lenders eases entrepreneurs' access to the credit market and raises asset prices and output, but in other circumstances it reduces the depth of the credit market and depresses the price of nontradables and output. Liberalization can have a contractionary impact by inducing a reallocation of credit from the nontradables to the tradables sector.","[Ferraris, Leo] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Minetti, Raoul] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Michigan State University,"Ferraris, L (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",leo.ferraris@uc3m.es; minetti@msu.edu,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Arepurchase causes a change in the investor base as investors who are most likely to disagree with the manager tender their shares. Therefore, a firm is more likely to buy back shares when the level of investor-management agreement is lower, and agreement improves as a consequence. Moreover, dispersion of opinion among investors cannot explain repurchase activity once the stock price and investor-management agreement are controlled for.

Our baseline results show that firms covered by a larger number of analysts generate fewer patents and patents with lower impact. To establish causality, we use a difference-indifferences approach that relies on the variation generated by multiple exogenous shocks to analyst coverage, as well as an instrumental variable approach. Our identification strategies suggest a negative causal effect of analyst coverage on firm innovation. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that analysts exert too much pressure on managers to meet short-term goals, impeding firms investment in long-term innovative projects. We further discuss possible underlying mechanisms through which analysts impede innovation and show that there is a residual effect of analysts on innovation even after controlling for these mechanisms. Our paper offers novel evidence on a previously under-explored adverse consequence of analyst coverage-its hindrance to firm innovation. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We employ a novel estimator for average willingness to pay (WTP) for mixed logit models with a random cost coefficient, which is robust to the presence of price insensitive respondents and performs well relative to mixed logit estimation in WTP space.

Second, information flows in both directions between changes in issuer-paid BRs and FSRs. Third, issuer-paid FSRs are predictable by investor-paid BRs.

In particular, we investigate whether an implicit agreement to exchange favors between a decision-maker and a lobbying party serves as a legal substitute for corruption. We find that even the pure anticipation of future rewards from a lobbying party suffices to bias a decision-maker in favor of this party, even though it creates negative externalities to others. Although future rewards are not contractible, the benefitting party voluntarily compensates decision-makers for partisan choices. In this way, both earn more at the expense of others. Thus, the outcome mirrors what might have been achieved via conventional bribing, while not being illegal. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Efficiency gains from this enhance economic growth and welfare of households simultaneously in both low income and advanced economies. Theoretical predictions are empirically validated here with structural VAR analysis based on quarterly data over the time period 1995:1 to 2009:1 on China's relative wage cost, interest rate differential, real effective exchange rate (REER), relative GDP and the US current account balance. It is shown how the relative prices of labour, capital and the currency affect the economic activity in China and current account balance in the US. With free capital inflows and outflows and restrictions on labour mobility, comparative advantage of China and the trade deficit of the US will both be minimised if China allows real appreciation of the Yuan and complete adjustment in prices. Higher production cost and prices in China could reduce welfare of Chinese households and the trade imbalance of the US, while higher relative GDP of China lowers the current account balance for the US.

It is found that the estimate of the saving retention rate tends to be biased downward if we fail to decompose the investment and saving rates into the private and government components. After the decomposition, we find that the private capital mobility was low prior to the 1990s, but improved notably in the more recent period. We also find that the saving-retention rate for the government sector remains negative throughout the sample, which can partially be explained by the government's reallocation of capital from the more productive regions to the less productive regions. Comparing the results of China with those of Japan shows that Japan had a much higher degree of prefectural capital mobility than China before the 1990s, but the gap gradually closed up afterwards.","[Lai, Jennifer] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chan, Kenneth; Yan, Isabel] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; City University of Hong Kong,"Lai, J (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",econlai@gmail.com,,"YAN, Kit Ming Isabel/0000-0002-6098-8087",,,,,25,1,2,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We introduce a discrete-time no-arbitrage model with observable covariates, which allows for a closed-form solution for the value of credit default swaps (CDS). The default intensity is a quadratic function of the covariates, specified such that it is always positive. The model yields economically plausible results in terms of fit, the economic impact of the covariates, and the prices of risk. Risk premiums are large and account for a smaller percentage of spreads for firms with lower credit quality. Macroeconomic and firm-specific information can explain most of the variation in CDS spreads over time and across firms, even with a parsimonious specification. These findings resolve the existing disconnect in the literature regarding the value of observable covariates for credit risk pricing and default prediction.","[Doshi, Hitesh; Jacobs, Kris; Turnbull, Stuart M.] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Ericsson, Jan] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Jacobs, Kris] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Houston System; University of Houston; McGill University; Tilburg University,"Turnbull, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, CT Bauer Coll Business, 334 Melcher Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",sturnbull@uh.edu,"Ericsson, Jan/A-5669-2013",,,,,,67,32,37,2,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

It describes the sponsorship system through which tens of millions of foreign workers are employed in Jordan, Lebanon and the Arabian Gulf states and argues that it constitutes a form of bonded labour. One of the main features of this form of unfree labour is the role played by states in facilitating and enforcing it. This example complicates the commonly held assumption that since slavery and bonded labour have been legally abolished in most countries, contemporary forms of unfree labour exist primarily in extra-legal zones outside the boundaries of government oversight. On the contrary, in the context described here the state is not merely turning a blind eye but actively enabling bonded labour. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Jordan and Sri Lanka, the article focuses on the position of Sri Lankan women employed in domestic service to illuminate workers' experiences of the sponsorship system and the institutional apparatuses that buttress it.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Frantz, E (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",Elizabeth.frantz@gmail.com,,,ESRC [RES-451-26-0537] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-451-26-0537] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,61,32,35,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This paper develops a simple model of optimal pay timing for firms. When workers have self-control problems, they under-save and experience volatile consumption between paychecks. Thus, pay whose delivery matches the timing of workers' consumption needs will reduce wage costs. The model also explains why pay timing should be regulated (as it is in practice): although the worker benefits from a timing profile that smoothes her consumption, her lack of self-control induces her to attempt to undo the arrangement, either by renegotiating with her employer or by taking out payday loans. Regulation of pay timing and consumer borrowing is required to counter these efforts, helping the worker help herself. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The changes, however, were reasonably modest, and sometimes differed between males and females. This suggests that both recent growth in the education sector (which by itself could depress the return to education) and uneven growth across the Indonesian economy (which could differentially increase demand for graduates at various levels of education) have played a role in determining the pattern of change over time in the profitability of education in Indonesia.","[Purnastuti, Losina] Yogyakarta State Univ, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Miller, Paul W.; Salim, Ruhul] Curtin Univ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta; Curtin University,"Purnastuti, L (通讯作者)，Yogyakarta State Univ, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,28,16,16,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The characterization of Indian society as semi-feudal and semi-colonial, and the elevation of the contradiction between feudalism and the broad masses as the primary (and basic) contradiction, seem to have been influenced by the programme of the CPC. This formulation may have had validity in the late 1960s, but transformations of the structure of the Indian economy since then seem to have made it less applicable at present.

We find a significant positive union effect using a q model of investment. The capital expenditures of firms are 1.71 times more sensitive to internal cash flows when unionization rates increase one standard deviation from the mean. This effect holds when we control for other proxies of financial constraints. In addition, unionized firms are associated with lower cash-cash flow sensitivity, which suggests that the higher investment-cash flow sensitivity in unionized firms is primarily driven by the incentive of these firms to reduce liquidity and enhance bargaining power against the union. We also show that the above union effects become more pronounced during labor contract negotiation years. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, relatively shorter working lives of those who have lower earnings increase the risk of receiving lower benefits. The aim of the paper is to present the changing role of a minimum pension as a tool of redistribution in the country that replaced a defined benefit (DB) pension system with a DC pension system. The old system in Poland had a significant income redistribution in the pension formula and the minimum pension was only a tool supporting this redistribution. After the introduction of the new mandatory pension system the main mechanism of redistribution (and a tool of social policy preventing poverty) is the minimum pension, financed from general taxes. According to the current rule of indexation, the minimum pension is expected to fall relative to the average wage in the economy. According to our simulations, the lack of changes of the current indexation method means that the minimum pension will fall below the International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard of the poverty protection of elderly by mid 2020s and in practice the last instrument of the poverty protection of elderly is going to disappear. However, the sole decision to change the indexation mechanism to the one based on full wage can create a significant pressure on public finance and distort incentives for prolonging work as 45% of women would be probably covered by the minimum pension guarantee (MPG). Results of simulations show that a raise and equalization of the retirement age for men and women combined with keeping a constant ratio of the minimum pension to the average (and also minimum) wage in the economy can be considered as a balanced solution that assures no further reduction of poverty protection and effective maintaining of this redistribution instrument.","[Chlon-Dominczak, Agnieszka; Strzelecki, Pawel] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Stat & Demog, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Chlon-Dominczak, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Stat & Demog, Warsaw, Poland.",Agnieszka.Chlon@gmail.com; strzeleckip@gmail.com,"Chłoń-Domińczak, Agnieszka/AAH-2673-2020","Chłoń-Domińczak, Agnieszka/0000-0001-5068-0276; Strzelecki, Pawel A./0000-0002-4318-8942",,,,,20,19,19,2,38,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

A key aspect of our analysis is that we examine the link between household structure and household income over the life-cycle. The main finding of the study is that household income profiles conditional on educational attainment in Turkey are non-decreasing and quite flat over the life-cycle. This is in stark contrast to the hump-shaped household income profiles reported for developed countries. There are three main reasons for this fact in Turkey: i) multiple families live together in the same household, especially when the household head is very young or old, and many single adult children who are employed live in their parents' households. In other words, household formation helps to smooth income. ii) Many household heads are still employed at end of their life-cycle, especially among the less-educated. iii) Pension income levels, for those who are qualified for them, are relatively high compared to other components of income.","[Cilasun, Seyit Mumin] Atilim Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06836 Ankara, Turkey; [Kirdar, Murat Guray] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Atilim University; Middle East Technical University,"Cilasun, SM (通讯作者)，Atilim Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06836 Ankara, Turkey.",smcilasun@atilim.edu.tr; kirdar@metu.edu.tr,"Kirdar, Murat Guray/AAJ-3132-2021; Cılasun, Seyit Mümin/JCP-1472-2023",,,,,,26,4,4,2,17,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Unlike much of the available literature that emphasized congestion, we focus on measures that reduce pollution, noise and some accident risks. These measures include noise barriers, speed bumps, traffic lights, tolls, emission standards, low emission zones, and bypass capacity to guide traffic around the city center. Using a simple model that distinguishes local and through traffic, we study the optimal use of these instruments by an urban government that cares for the welfare of its residents, and we compare the results with those preferred by a federal authority that also takes into account the welfare of road users from outside the city. Our results include the following. First, compared to the federal social optimum, we show that the city government will over-invest in externality-reducing infrastructure whenever this infrastructure increases the generalized cost of through traffic. We can therefore expect an excessive number of speed bumps and traffic lights, but the right investment in noise barriers. Second, when implementing low emission zones, the urban government will set both the fee for non-compliance and the emission standard at a more stringent level than the federal government. Moreover, at sufficiently high levels of through traffic the urban government will prefer imposing a toll instead of implementing a low emission zone. Third, whatever the tolling instruments in place, the city will always underinvest in bypass capacity. Finally, if it can toll all roads but is forced to invest all bypass toll revenue in the bypass, it will never invest in bypass capacity. Although the paper focuses on non-congestion externalities, most insights also hold in the presence of congestion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We show that the large positive value-minus-growth portfolio returns are explained by an over-reaction (under-reaction) to the positive (negative) market movements in short, specific time periods, during which the average returns of value-minus-growth portfolios are more than 2% a month. We propose an explanation based on behavioral biases: the dynamics of the value anomaly reflect the increased speed of return reversals subsequent to overreaction. Two conditions that increase the return reversals are proposed: when investors respond to public signals asymmetrically or when public signals become noisy. Our empirical results reveal that the value anomaly is explained by either one of these two channels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These reversals stem from the expansion of mature funds, while young funds' trading predicts one-quarter-ahead returns without future reversals.

In China, inventory has declined over recent decades, while the country's road infrastructure has expanded rapidly. Building on the existing literature, we introduce new approaches, including a quasi-experiment based on differential demand for distant suppliers, to identify the causal relationship between road investments and inventory decline. Examining a large panel data set of Chinese manufacturers from 1998 to 2007, we find one dollar of road spending saves around two cents of inventory costs. This effect is non-trivial but less than that in the United States in the 1970s. Moreover, our estimates also suggest spillover effect from road investments to firms in neighboring provinces.

But, as well as forming part of the Trans-European Rail Network, the Channel Tunnel was also seen as a potential stimulus to trans-frontier collaboration and as a possible catalyst for regional economic development. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the regional impacts of the Tunnel within the Anglo-French frontier zone on both sides of the English Channel. Although millions of passengers travel through the Tunnel every year, numbers have failed to reach the forecast levels and the overall benefits are fewer than had been anticipated. The English Channel still represents a psychological barrier (partly due to language differences) and the frontier zone has failed to develop as an integrated labour market. Moreover, the findings suggest that the Channel Tunnel has only had a limited impact on the spatial economy of the trans-frontier zone in Kent and Nord-Pas-de-Calais. While Ashford has undoubtedly gained from its high-speed rail connection, the greatest impacts have occurred in metropolitan regions further from the Tunnel, including Lille and East London.

Based on a new dataset, it provides a detailed econometric study of the Great Reform Act of 1832 in the United Kingdom. The analysis yields four main results. First, modernization theory receives limited support. Second, the reform enjoyed some measure of popular support. Third, the threat of revolution had an asymmetric impact on the voting behavior of the pro-reform Whigs and the anti-reform Tories. While the threat might have convinced reluctant reformers among the Whig politicians-and among their patrons-to support the bill, it seems to have hardened the resistance to reform among the Tories. Fourth, ideology played a critical role. Nevertheless, it also appears that self-interest and political expedience explained the votes of many Members of Parliament.","[Aidt, Toke S.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England; [Aidt, Toke S.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Franck, Raphael] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel",University of Cambridge; Ifo Institut; Bar Ilan University,"Franck, R (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",tsa23@econ.cam.ac.uk; Raphael.Franck@biu.ac.il,"Aidt, Toke/AAC-1068-2020","Aidt, Toke/0000-0002-8319-6568; Franck, Raphael/0000-0003-2068-0958",,,,,59,11,13,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2013,155.0,3-4,,,,,229,250,,10.1007/s11127-011-9911-y,0.0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,138NQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318515700003,0

In this paper, we are particularly interested in how policymakers can themselves learn by disinflating. The approach differs from the existing literature, which typically focuses on the learning of private agents during a disinflation. We build a model where both the policymaker and private agents learn, and ask what happens if the policymaker has to disinflate to satisfy a new central bank mandate specifying greater emphasis on inflation stabilization. In this case, our results show that inflation may fall dramatically before it gradually rises to its new long-run level. The potential for inflation to undershoot its long-run level during a disinflationary episode suggests that caution should be exercised when assessing the success of any change in the policymaker's mandate.","[Barnett, Alina] Bank England, London, England; [Ellison, Martin] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Ellison, Martin] Bank Finland, London, England",Bank of England; University of Oxford,"Barnett, A (通讯作者)，Bank England, London, England.",Alina.Barnett@bankofengland.co.uk; martin.ellison@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We consider a timing game in which two policymakers non-cooperatively decide their preferred sequence of moves before setting emission tax rates. We show that whether the policymakers implement emission tax policies simultaneously or sequentially crucially depends on the magnitude of environmental damages. When the damages are insignificant, the tax rates are strategic substitutes, and the simultaneous-move policymaking emerges in equilibrium. In contrast, when the damages are significant, the tax rates are strategic complements, and sequential-move policymaking emerges. We also extend the model by allowing for differences in the vulnerability to environmental damages between countries. When the differences are large, the unique equilibrium of the game is the situation where the less vulnerable country acts as a leader. In the case where multiple equilibrium emerges, the risk-dominant equilibrium is also that where the less vulnerable country leads.","[Hattori, Keisuke] Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, Osaka 5338533, Japan; [Kitamura, Takahiro] Osaka Univ Econ, Grad Sch Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, Osaka 5338533, Japan",,"Hattori, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan.",hattori@osaka-ue.ac.jp,,"Hattori, Keisuke/0000-0001-8686-4704",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730210] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,22,5,5,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

I then test the model in a cross-national dataset.

Assuming a non-homothetic preference structure, our results show that a progressive reduction of trade costs allows the economy to pass from a pre-industrialized to an industrialized stage and then, within the latter, from a dispersed to an urbanized regime. However, the introduction of capital accumulation and the dynamic setting of our model opens the door to a richer set of implications. First, an additional stage is introduced as, for some intermediate values of trade costs, a multiple equilibria regime emerges with simultaneously stable symmetric and core-periphery equilibria. Second, the introduction of non-homotheticity introduces a new channel through which growth is affected by trade costs and agglomeration. In particular, integration is always growth-enhancing while agglomeration is growth-detrimental.","[Cerina, Fabio; Mureddu, Francesco] Univ Cagliari, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Cerina, Fabio; Mureddu, Francesco] CRENoS, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Mureddu, Francesco] Tech4i2 Ltd, Thurcaston LE7 7JP, Leics, England",University of Cagliari,"Cerina, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Viale St Ignazio 78, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",fcerina@unica.it,,"Cerina, Fabio/0000-0003-4671-3404",,,,,21,2,2,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper disentangles the two components of the 3-month Euribor-Eonia swap spread, credit and liquidity risk and then evaluates the decomposition. The main finding is that credit risk increased before the key events of the crisis, while liquidity risk was mainly responsible for the subsequent increases in the Euribor spread and then reacted to the systemic responses of the central banks, especially in October 2008. Moreover, the level of the spread between May 2009 and February 2010 was influenced mainly by credit risk, suggesting that European banks were still in a lemons market and relied on liquidity on tap even before sovereign debt crisis unfolded in Europe.

The value premium decreases with firm size and is weak among the largest stocks. Momentum profits, however, exhibit no reliable relation with size. These effects are robust over 86 years of US equity data and almost 40 years of data across four international equity markets and five asset classes.

We develop a spatial model where the candidates are valence-seeking, i.e.-like the voters-the candidates prefer that the winning candidate possess qualities, such as integrity, diligence, and competence, that will enhance his job performance. We analyze a spatial model where the candidates value both the valence qualities and the policies of the winning candidate, and we show that the candidates' optimal policy choices typically diverge as the valence differential between them increases, and in particular that the valence-disadvantaged candidate normally has incentives to become more extreme as the valence advantage of her opponent increases.","[Adams, James] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Merrill, Samuel, III] Wilkes Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Wilkes Barre, PA 18766 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Wilkes University,"Adams, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jfadams@ucdavis.edu; smerrill@mathcs.wilkes.edu,,,,,,,38,7,8,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2013,155.0,1-2,,,,,139,161,,10.1007/s11127-011-9845-4,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,095RS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315352800007,0

As a new attempt, this study uses accessibility analysis for quantifying the impact of China's HSR network. Weighted average travel times and travel costs, contour measures, and potential accessibility are employed as indicators of accessibility at the macro or national level. Forty-nine major cities in the HSR network are used in the accessibility analysis. Accessibility quantification and spatial distribution analysis for the study cities are performed on a Geographical Information System (GIS) platform. Accessibilities associated with varying availabilities of HSR, conventional rail, and airline are estimated and compared. The selected indicators and computational methods are found effective in evaluating the accessibility impacts of HSR from different conceptualization strategies and perspectives.

While voters may be disillusioned with established political figures, a strong presidential candidate has yet to emerge. Many voters appear to yearn for an experienced and uncorrupt leader with new and proactive policies, which is why Jakarta's new governor, Joko Widodo, is being viewed as a potential candidate. The Constitutional Court has made two major, controversial rulings in recent months: the first concerned the upstream oil and gas regulator BPMigas, the second the international-standard pilot-project schools (Rintisan Sekolah Bertaraf Internasional, RSBIs). The Court ruled both institutions unconstitutional and called for their immediate disbandment. In 2012, Indonesia's year-on-year economic growth slowed slightly, to a still healthy 6.2%, owing to continued weak global demand for its exports and a contraction in government expenditure. In contrast, foreign direct investment and portfolio investment were particularly strong, with respective increases of 25% and more than 142%. At 4.3%, inflation for the 2012 calendar year still remains well within the government's and Bank Indonesia's expectations. However, inflation expectations are high for 2013, owing to likely reforms to energy subsidies; the expected effect of bad weather on food prices; and increases in minimum wages, which attracted attention in 2012 because of their magnitude and their apparent disparity among regions. Concerns also exist that these rises in minimum wages will hamper Indonesia's international competitiveness and could discourage investment in labour-intensive industries. Minimum-wage policy is also controversial because of doubts about its relevance to the genuinely poor sections of society those in informal employment or with primarily subsistence income, who constitute a large proportion of the population. Indonesia has experienced a steady increase in income inequality in the last decade, indicating that the benefits of strong economic growth have not been shared equally. Potential reasons for this increasing inequality relate to labour-market segmentation amid a growing middle class, weak institutional foundations, and commodity-driven growth. It appeared in 2012 that Indonesia has also been one of the world's poorest performers in HIV/AIDS prevention in recent years. While prevalence rates are low, the number of new HIV infections in 2011 was more than four times that of any other South Asian or Southeast Asian country, and the infection rate among the working-age population has risen by more than 25% since 2001. Infection rates among high-risk groups are also alarmingly high compared with those of other Southeast Asian countries. Targeted prevention, treatment and support programs among these groups are paramount.","[Cornwell, Katy] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Anas, Titik] Ctr Strateg & Int Studies, Jakarta, Indonesia",Monash University,"Cornwell, K (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,51,10,10,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

We study one particularly important collective action problem: the environment.

The relation between environmental policy and life satisfaction is not as pronounced. The evidence for the effect of environmental quality on both satisfaction with democracy and life satisfaction is not very clear, although we find evidence that citizens value personal mobility (in terms of having a car) highly, but view the presence of trucks as unpleasant. We also document that parents, younger citizens, and those with high levels of educational attainment tend to care more about environmental issues than do non-parents, older citizens, and those with fewer years of schooling.","[Halla, Martin; Schneider, Friedrich G.] Univ Linz, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Halla, Martin; Schneider, Friedrich G.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Schneider, Friedrich G.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Schneider, Friedrich G.] CREMA, Zurich, Switzerland; [Wagner, Alexander F.] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Wagner, Alexander F.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Johannes Kepler University Linz; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut; University of Zurich; Harvard University,"Halla, M (通讯作者)，Univ Linz, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",martin.halla@jku.at,"Wagner, Alexander F/G-8037-2011","Wagner, Alexander/0000-0002-9796-8821; Halla, Martin/0000-0003-2651-3894",,,,,49,9,9,0,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2013,155.0,1-2,,,,,109,137,,10.1007/s11127-011-9844-5,0.0,,,29,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,095RS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315352800006,0

J,"Leech, D",,,,"Leech, Dennis",,,Power indices in large voting bodies,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Voting power; Power index; Penrose; Banzhaff; Shapley-Shubik; Laakso-Taagepera,LIMIT-THEOREM,"There is no consensus on the properties of voting power indices when there is a large number of voters in a weighted-voting body. On the one hand, in some real-world cases that have been studied the power indices have been found to be nearly proportional to the weights (e.g., the EUCM, US Electoral College); this is true for both the Penrose-Banzhaf and the Shapley-Shubik indices. It has been suggested that this is a manifestation of a conjecture by Penrose (known subsequently as the Penrose limit theorem, that has been shown to hold under certain conditions). On the other hand, we have the older literature from cooperative game theory, due to Shapley and his collaborators, showing that, where there is a finite number of voters whose weights remain constant in relative terms, and where the quota remains constant in relative terms, while the total number of voters increases without limit, the powers of the voters with finite weight tend to limiting values that are, in general, not proportional to the weights. These results, too, are supported by empirical studies of large voting bodies (e.g., the IMF/WB boards, corporate shareholder meetings). This paper proposes a restatement of the Penrose limit theorem and shows that, in general, both the 'classical' power indices converge in the limit to proportionality with weights as the Laakso-Taagepera index of political fragmentation increases. This new version reconciles the different theoretical and empirical results that have been found for large voting bodies.","[Leech, Dennis] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Leech, Dennis] London Sch Econ, CPNSS, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Warwick; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Leech, D (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",d.leech@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,8,9,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2013,155.0,1-2,,,,,61,79,,10.1007/s11127-011-9840-9,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,095RS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315352800004,0

Within this context, it is theoretically demonstrated that: the larger the RV, the more likely the household to opt for metering; and the larger the RV, the smaller the Demand Effect of Metering (DEM; the fall in water consumption resulting from metering). These two hypotheses are confirmed with econometric analyses using datasets provided by a water company operating in East Anglia, England. The results signify an adverse-selection problem: wealthier households are more likely to opt for metering, yet they are expected to exhibit a smaller DEM once a meter is installed. In order to overcome this, we propose a two-part tariff for metered households consisting of: a variable charge levied proportional to water consumption at a uniform price; and a progressive standing charge to place a heavier burden on wealthier households. The latter component has a potentially major role in attaining social efficiency of metering, by encouraging poorer households to install meters whilst discouraging wealthier ones. The optimal two-part tariff is determined empirically.","[Ueda, Tatsuki] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Natl Inst Rural Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058609, Japan; [Moffatt, Peter G.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; University of East Anglia,"Ueda, T (通讯作者)，Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Natl Inst Rural Engn, 2-1-6 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058609, Japan.",tued@affrc.go.jp,"Ueda, Tatsuki/JOZ-5464-2023","Ueda, Tatsuki/0000-0002-6544-7546",,,,,19,4,4,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The model can generate multiple stationary equilibria, across which asset prices, market participation, capitalization, output and welfare are positively related. It can also generate a variety of nonstationary equilibria, even when fundamentals are deterministic and time invariant, including periodic, chaotic and stochastic (sunspot) equilibria with recurrent market crashes. Some equilibria have asset-price trajectories that resemble bubbles growing and bursting. Endogenous private and public liquidity is also introduced.

These data allow us to differentiate among competing ex-dividend day hypotheses in the absence of confounding tax effects present in other markets. We find that ex-day premiums increase and abnormal returns decrease after the tick size becomes smaller, which is in line with the market microstructure hypothesis. In contrast, we do not find any significant increase in abnormal volume with a reduction in tick size. This finding is inconsistent with the pattern that should occur if transaction cost is the dominant factor that causes the ex-day phenomenon. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that a competitive environment could affect how the trustors' behaviour is perceived by the trustee. If two trustors compete for the favour of a trustee, the trustee might find it difficult to interpret the trustors' investments as kind since they could as well be the outcome of a competitive race; this could negatively affect the trustee's returned amount. We allow for heterogeneous effects of competition for strangers and artificially induced partners. The results of our one-shot trust games show that introducing competition among trustors reduces return ratios of the trustee.

Such development can be fostered by a regional innovation system (RIS), although the risks of path dependency and lock-in may lead to a region decaying. A process for contributing to a RIS is the Regional Development Platform Model (RDPM), the focus of this paper. As a new approach to regional development, the RDPM is utilised and adapted to identify opportunities for potential development in a region. In this paper, the RDPM is linked to the role of a port authority and its potential to drive regional growth centred on its innovation network. Port authorities, by assuming the role of network leader, can shape the regional innovation network and create new development trajectories through their links to various levels of government and the wide range of stakeholders that utilise the port facilities. The inherent tensions in this role and the competing possibilities of path creation and path dependence to create value for a wide network of stakeholders are challenging. The paper investigates the use of the RDPM and how port authorities can influence development strategies for mutual benefit in this context. More specifically, a case study of the Burnie Port in Tasmania, Australia is conducted by utilising desktop research, interviews, an expert panel and industry roundtable to demonstrate that the RDPM has the potential as an approach beyond analysing the main sources of path dependency in a local region. By following the adaptation of the RDPM, it is argued that the trajectory of path dependency can be interrupted, for example by a port authority, enabling the potential for new paths to be created.

It describes the main actuarial principles of premium calculation and relates these to existing theory. In the German PHI policyholders do not commit to renewing their insurance contracts, but insurers commit to offering renewal at a premium rate that does not reflect revealed future information about the insured risk. We show that empirical results are consistent with theoretical predictions from one-sided commitment models: front-loading in premiums generates a lock-in of consumers, and more front-loading is generally associated with lower rates of lapse. Due to a lack of consumer commitment, dynamic information revelation about risk type implies that high-risk policyholders are more likely to retain their PHI contracts than are low-risk types.","[Hofmann, Annette] Univ Hamburg, Inst Risk & Insurance, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Browne, Mark] Univ Wisconsin, Gerald D Stephens CPCU Chair Risk Management & In, Wisconsin Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Hamburg; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Browne, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Gerald D Stephens CPCU Chair Risk Management & In, Wisconsin Sch Business, 975 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",hofmann@econ.uni-hamburg.de; mbrowne@bus.wisc.edu,,,,,,,47,22,25,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

This paper pioneered the use of ontology approach to provide connections amongst those entities.","[Abubakar, Faruq Muhammad] Bauchi State Univ, Bauchi, Nigeria; [Ahmad, Hartini B.] Univ Utara Malaysia, Ctr Univ Ind collaborat, Changlun, Malaysia; [Baharin, Shamsuddin] Minist Higher Educ, Ind Relat Div, Putrajaya, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Abubakar, FM (通讯作者)，Bauchi State Univ, Bauchi, Nigeria.",faruqmabubakar@yahoo.co.uk; hartini@uum.edu.my; drshamb@gmail.com,"ABUBAKAR, FARUQ/AIE-8028-2022","ABUBAKAR, FARUQ/0000-0002-4731-4707",,,,,41,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,234,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100023,0

The publication in 2000 of an important article by K. O'Rourke has sparked a lively debate on the linkages between trade policy and economic growth during the first globalization (1870 to 1914). The question was explored using new econometric techniques, often with references to recent inroads in the theoretical foundations for economic growth. The consensus view among various scholars tends to confirm a positive correlation between tariffs and growth for the most advanced European countries as well as overseas European Offshoots (Canada, Australia, Argentina...) - but not necessarily for periphery countries. Two factors seem to have played an important role: the quality of institutions of countries embracing protection and their legislators' ability to handpick the protected industries (those with extensive externalities). But the hypothesis of an efficient sectoral protectionism cannot be validated by the observation of effective protection rates, an approach which remains at the present stage, very fragmented, limited to a handful of sectors, for selected benchmarks and which does not take into account the dispersion of tariff rates by country of origin for identical goods.","[Becuwe, Stephane; Blancheton, Bertrand] Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux 4, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, F-33608 Pessac, France; [Becuwe, Stephane] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Becuwe, S (通讯作者)，Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux 4, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Ave Leon DUGUIT, F-33608 Pessac, France.",stephane.becuwe@u-bordeaux4.fr; bertrand.blancheton@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,89,1,1,0,10,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The major objective was to enhance budget discipline among others. This was predicated on the theoretical considerations that improving the process and management of budgeting through reforms would ultimately translate into improved budgetary outcome. This paper empirically investigated the impact of budget reforms on the quality of budget management in Nigeria. The Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) form the proxies for budget reforms while budget discipline (BDISC) and fiscal discipline (FDISC) were used as proxies for the quality of budgeting. Historical time series data representing 7years before and 7 years after the adoption of MTEF, and 5 years before and 5 years after the enactment of FRA were collect and analysed using the pre-test/post-test design of a Paired Sample T-test. The result favoured our initial proposition that budget reforms (MTEF and FRA) had not significantly impacted on the quality of budget management (BDISC and FDISC) in Nigeria. It was therefore recommended that government should provide the leadership and political will not only to enforce the provisions of FRA, MTEF and other reforms, but to sanction those that short circuit the system to their advantage. This will go a long way to enhance compliance with the reforms and bring about the expected improvement in the quality of the nation's budget management.","[Ben-Caleb, Egbide; Iyoha, Francis] Covenant Univ, Sch Business, Dept Accounting, Coll Dev Studies, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,,egbide.ben-caleb@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; kennet.adeyemi@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; iyoha.francis@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"Ben-Caleb, Egbidde/M-8866-2013; Ben-Caleb, Egbide/AAS-9730-2020","Ben-Caleb, Egbide/0000-0003-2188-2535",,,,,23,1,1,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,2155,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500212,0

And on that assumption, how do copyright and trademark institutions work together to stimulate and promote the generation of meaningful information? To answer these questions, we will look at how the meaningful forms of expressionthe worksthat have historically been covered by copyright generate specific types of externality, both positive and negative, giving rise to both incentive and censorship mechanisms. We will then show how the institutions of copyright and author's rights that allow the appropriation of a meaning-dependent good also confer a brand on it by identifying its sources.

This essay analyses th e co-creation of a market for animal friendly meat products by the joint effort of a Dutch NGO and the meat industry. The different stages of the process, from opposition to alignment, are analyzed and general implications are derived. The process follows four stages: (1) adopting a strategy to cooperate in order to overcome a legitimacy crisis, (2) adopting a moderate conflict model and imposing limiting conditions into the negotiations with businesses. The limiting conditions provide a basis for a co-creation process, (3) aligning business for co-creating a new product brand, and (4) broadening the scope towards market creation for animal friendly products. The phases of the issue-life-cycle show that interventions are dependent on the nature of the interaction and the existence of a business model. In case this does not exist, collaboration between an NGO and a number of firms can help in creating a market for latent demand into a market-oriented solution to a wicked problem.","[Bos, Jacqueline M.] Wageningen Univ, Sch Social Sci, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Blok, Vincent] Wageningen Univ, Sch Social Sci, Management Studies Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Tulder, Rob] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Bos, JM (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Sch Social Sci, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",jacqueline.bos@wur.nl; vincent.blok@wur.nl; rtulder@rsm.nl,"Blok, Vincent/E-6210-2013","Blok, Vincent/0000-0002-9086-4544",,,,,24,9,9,1,20,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

It argues that the transition to democracy changed the balance of power within which living customary law is negotiated at the local level, and emboldened women. The changes are put at risk by controversial traditional leadership laws enacted since 2003. These restore the power of definition to chiefs, and reassert constructs of customary law that obscure the dynamics of the changes under way. I suggest that the changes may, in part, reflect the re-emergence of pre-existing repertoires that were suppressed by official customary law. The paper contrasts the Constitutional Court's inclusive approach to living customary law and the legislative process, with the autocratic approach of the new laws, one of which has already been struck down by the Court.","Univ Cape Town, Fac Law, Law Race & Gender Unit, Rural Womens Act Res Project, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Claassens, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Fac Law, Law Race & Gender Unit, Rural Womens Act Res Project, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",aninka.claassens@uct.ac.za,,,,,,,0,30,37,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

(2009a and 2009b) identified the Central Karoo as the worst performing area in the Western Cape, but left the reasons for the region's declining total factor productivity (TFP) unexplained. The current paper uses a combination of literature review and analysis of anecdotal evidence to evaluate a set of hypothetical reasons for the decline. The world wool price clearly affected farm-level profitability, putting up to 50% of sheep farms out of business in some parts of the Central Karoo. If census data were properly collected, this in itself should not have affected TFP. The evidence for overgrazing and increasingly ineffective predator control was less convincing. For example, there is no conclusive evidence yet on whether game and lifestyle farms exert any negative externalities on remaining sheep operations. The cost-price squeeze resulting from falling prices and rising input costs has led to an extension of production systems and poor maintenance which will no doubt lead to a further decline in productivity. We concluded that the rate at which the Central Karoo is shedding sheep farming, and the reasons for and effects of it, should be investigated further.","[Conradie, Beatrice; Winter, Kevin] Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Piesse, Jenifer] Bournemouth Univ, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Piesse, Jenifer; Thirtle, Colin; Vink, Nick] Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Thirtle, Colin] Imperial Coll London, London, England",University of Cape Town; Bournemouth University; Stellenbosch University; Imperial College London,"Conradie, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",Beatrice.Conradie@uct.ac.za; jpiesse@bournemouth.ac.uk; c.thirtle@ic.ac.uk; nv@sun.ac.za; Kevin.Winter@uct.ac.za,"Conradie, Beatrice/ABG-3218-2020; Vink, Nick/K-5330-2013","Conradie, Beatrice/0000-0002-4675-6300; Winter, Kevin/0000-0001-6859-9732; Vink, Nick/0000-0002-5874-0939",,,,,50,10,10,0,12,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2013,52.0,,,1,SI,,1,23,,10.1080/03031853.2013.770950,0.0,,,23,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,103TE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315941000001,0

Implementation of the integrated management system is more effective than separate implementation of management systems, such as: quality management system, environmental management system, safety and worker's health management system. With the advent of the international standard ISO 50001 Energy Management System, which has a similar structure as ISO standards 9001, 14001 and 22000, the opportunity to integrate energy management system with other systems, has appeared. Interaction between man and machine, or the man-machine system (MMS) is an important component of production process.

It is discussed model based on systems theory, which describes some of the protection mechanisms hampering the attacker's penetration into IS. Information system and data stored on it are so protected. Some results of the model are visualized for clarity. In an introduction of the paper is characterized ability to detect attacks on IP addresses and next an equipment used to monitor attacks. The next section describes specific monitoring system for direct monitoring IP addresses of attackers. Monitoring is carried out attacks in two modes. The first mode is characterized by the protection of information systems operated on a specific computer with a firewall. The second mode is characterized that the computer is complemented by so called honeypot software. This software attracts attackers to attack by using of weak passwords. In the next section shows some results of monitoring attacks on the information system. To evaluate the direct measurement was ingested statistical software. Results of statistical processing are disclosed and explained next. In conclusion contains some models describing the behavior of an information system during an attack in comparison with the behavior without attacking. Typically, the attacker does not have detailed information about the contested IS. The main subject of investigation by the present model is not the case when is attacked with detailed information about the contested IS. Situation with more detailed information about the contested IS occurs rarely.

To fill the gap between empirical and purely theoretical research we run a Monte Carlo study and simulate the data from different New Keynesian DSGE models. We find that equally pooling VAR forecasts outperforms single predictions in general and that the gains are substantial for sample sizes relevant in practice. In contrast, the estimation of theoretically optimal weights or model selection is advisable only for very large data sets hardly available in practice. Notably, equally pooling forecasts from small-scale VARs can even dominate forecasts from large VARs including all relevant variables. Given our results, we advocate the use of equally pooled predictions from parsimonious VARs as an easy to implement and competitive forecast approach. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This difference warrants additional research so that effective strategy can be tailored to manage high turnover rate in the industry.

To test the model, data will be collected using a survey questionnaire design from 150 IT professionals in outsourcing industry. The findings will add to the existing body of knowledge in IT turnover in general and in IT turnover among outsourcing employees in particular.

Unlike the existing literature on non-linear estimation, we consider five candidates for the threshold variable including per capita real GDP. real energy prices, energy intensity, the ratio of gross capital formation to GDP, and error-correction term to explore which threshold variable is suitable for the non-linear energy demand model. Our empirical results demonstrate that energy consumption, real income and real energy prices can be cointegrated, and are in favor of the non-linearity for energy demand when the energy intensity and the ratio of gross capital formation to GDP are considered as the threshold variables. Furthermore, the results indicate that the adjustment speed toward long-run equilibrium of PSECM is small and approximately 7-17% in 1 year. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

But in recent years, industrial output growth rate fluctuates, and there is a downward trend. In 2009, due to the impact of financial crisis, industrial output growth rate dropped to the bottom in nearly ten years (2.95%). For the policy stimulus of central government and local government, in 2010 the province's industrial output growth rate rebounded to an all-time high (20%), but in 2011 the rate dropped to 15.8% again. The author thinks that the impact of Zhejiang Province industrial production factors has two aspects: the scale and efficiency, of which scale is the foundation, and the efficiency is the key. This paper selects imported high-tech products, foreign direct investment, research and development funding of industrial enterprises and other indicators as an important factor affecting Zhejiang Province Industrial gross. Through the establishment of regression model, the author draws the conclusion: the import of high-tech products is the effective way to increase Zhejiang Province industrial gross; and due to improper use of research and development funding, it cannot ascend industrial enterprise innovation ability, thus it has adversely influence to Zhejiang province industry growth.","[Li Rui] Zhejiang Yuexiu Univ Foreign Languages, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Yuexiu University,,liruibuddy@126.com,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,3,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,HAWTHORN EAST,"STE 4, LEVEL 3, 695 BURKE RD, HAWTHORN EAST, VC 3123, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9874593-3-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,37,42,,,,,,6,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BA4GU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335704700006,0

There are many distance measures in the current literature and there is not strictly defined, which clustering method must be used. In some cases, for example, in current literature is stated that Ward's method is usually used in conjunction with the squared Euclidean distance measures. Given that the different methods combined with various measure of distance may give different results, so it is appropriate to evaluate the results of clustering. Evaluate the results of clustering can be from two perspectives. Clustering methods may be compared with each other or optimal number of clusters can be determined. The main aim of this paper is to describe some methods for determining the optimal number of clusters and their application to practical economic problems - to determine the optimal number of clusters of EU countries. We used some macroeconomics indicators and we compared clusters of EU countries in two periods. One period is before the global financial crisis and the second period is during the crisis period.

An exponentially growing population imposed a development of technologies to sustain their needs. The economic agents have the reputation of being the most responsible for entropic degradation by the intensifying rhythm of extraction of nonrenewable resources and discharging of wastes into the environment. Intensive human actions determined atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide to grow well above pre-industrial levels. This rise of greenhouse gases level inflicts temperatures to grow and the planet's surface heated by 0.6 centigrade degrees over the last century. The cooling of a perpetual heated planet is impeded, due to entropy law, and thermal pollution could demonstrate to be a more decisive impediment to the development than the finiteness of available natural resources. Judging by the current trend, the atmospheric CO2 concentration will double by 2080, and in such conditions, the researchers forecast an increasing of 4 grades Celsius of global atmospheric temperature. Although some reductions in global carbon emissions occurred, this has fallen short in letting down the rate of global climate change. Analyzing in terms of entropic transformation how effective is the production process, any economic growth will cause more remanent waste. The value system that is built on humanity's obsession for economic growth has created a physical and psychological environment where human life became extremely unhealthy. The causality relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth is a theme for intensive studies in the field of environmental economics. In this paper, we explained through an exponential regression model how strong is the influence of CO2 emissions over GDP in Romania over the last forty nine years.","[Mascu, Simona] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Doctoral Sch, Dept Finance, Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Ciote, Cristina Steliana; Lipara, Daniel] Alexandru Joan Cuza Univ Iasi, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Doctoral Sch Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania; [Paraschiv, Gabriela-Mihaela] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Constanta, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Ovidius University,,,"MASCU, SIMONA/AAP-7960-2021",,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,111,118,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400015,0

Following this change in the legal environment, Ramanujam reengineered the apple supply chain, which had previously operated very inefficiently. He achieved some degree of initial success in an agribusiness environment where long chains of intermediaries dominated produce marketing despite adding little value. The case describes the challenges faced by Agrifresh including securing supplies from farmers, capacity utilization, and product portfolio issues.

Some dimensionality reduction methods are applicable to ordinal data (latent class models), some methods must be improved (categorical principal component analysis). Other methods are based on a distance matrix, so it is possible to use an appropriate distance measure for ordinal data (multidimensional scaling). In this paper, dimensionality reduction methods are applied to real datasets including ordinal data in the form of Likert scales. Various techniques for the comparison of these methods are used. They are aimed to investigate goodness of the data structure in original and reduced space.

My results provide broad support for this hypothesis, as I find that a one standard deviation increase in a bank's financial fragility lowers the cost of this bank's corporate loans by 7%. Since some types of regulation, such as deposit insurance, can decrease banks' financial fragility, this paper also contributes to the debate on the benefits and costs of bank regulation which can be helpful for policy-making.

The conventional agricultural research and development approaches used hitherto have not yielded much success in stimulating farmer participation in markets.

Using data from IAR4D trials in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique, the study evaluates the efficacy of IAR4D in stimulating market integration and crop intensification. The impact of IAR4D on maize yield, estimated using the local average treatment effect (LATE) is significant in all the countries. Yields improved by margins ranging 107-149 kgha(-1), which is quite substantial in a region where yields average around 1000kgha(-1).

Regarding water management, the specific objective of the SOP is to improve the quality of and access to water and wastewater infrastructure, by providing water supply and sewerage services in most urban areas by 2015, as well as establishing effective regional structures for the management of water/wastewater services.

Numerous projects for the maintenance, expansion and modernization of the sewerage network in the city are being developed presently. Moreover, projects are being implemented for the modification of the way in which water is captured and distributed. Thus, the existing groundwater sources will be used exclusively to cover the drinking water supply of the municipality, while major businesses and industrial water consumers will meet their water needs from their own sources, preferably from surface water sources.

Firstly, this contribution determines the importance of consumers, their behaviour, trendology and also the changes in their behaviour and new trends both caused by altered economic conditions. Secondly, the principles and procedures of fuzzy sets are used to measure the level of consumer policies in the chosen European countries to show the differences throughout the union. Fuzzy logic is a theory enabling to model uncertainty in the natural language which means that it comes close to approximate than to exact basic of thinking. The theory of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic were developed to enable to process mathematically the linguistic terms.","[Valaskova, Katarina; Gregova, Elena] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,,katarina.valaskova@fpedas.uniza.sk; elena.gregova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Valaskova, Katarina/O-9250-2015; Gregova, Elena/P-1820-2015","Valaskova, Katarina/0000-0003-4223-7519; Gregova, Elena/0000-0002-4296-4962",,,,,14,1,1,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1463,1472,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100147,0

Although lay-offs at large firms normally make headlines during crises, we still know little about the potential impact of firm size on adjustment behavior in a crisis. We studied effects of firm size on employment growth during economic slowdowns using a rich microeconomic database for the 1988-2007 period in Portuguese manufacturing industry. The results show that economic downturns affect firm growth negatively. This negative effect is found to be higher for larger firms, both during and immediately following crisis periods. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) emerge as potential stabilizers in downturn periods. However, larger firms seem to be able to quickly recover from downturn periods. Our results contribute to the scarce literature and to the understanding of the Portuguese case, where many SMEs secure most jobs. These first results may be useful, because SMEs play a determinant role in other European Union economies.","[Varum, Celeste Amorim] Univ Aveiro, GOVCOPP, Dept Econ Management & Ind Engn, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro,"Varum, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, GOVCOPP, Dept Econ Management & Ind Engn, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",camorim@ua.pt; verarocha@ua.pt,"Varum, Celeste/B-5853-2009","Varum, Celeste/0000-0002-9356-0087; Rocha, Vera/0000-0003-0227-7129",,,,,53,54,63,0,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Estimated at 3.3% of GDP, the tax measures were introduced to reduce public deficits without weakening the prospects of economic recovery or producing adverse redistributive outcomes. The tax reform mainly increases consumption and property taxes and gives relief for firms that recapitalize or hire young workers and women. To some extent, these measures are consistent with scholarly suggestions to foster short- and long-term economic growth by shifting the tax burden from capital and labor income towards consumption and property. Using microsimulation models, we evaluate the distributional and growth effects of the tax package. The indirect and property tax reforms are highly regressive, while the reform as a whole makes limited resources available for growth-enhancing policies, through a reduction in the effective corporate tax burden. We propose a revenue-neutral alternative reform that allows channeling more fiscal resources towards corporate tax relief, while at the same time producing less regressive distributional effects.","[Pellegrino, Simone] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, I-10134 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Pellegrino, S (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, Corso Unione Soviet 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",pellegrino@econ.unito.it,"Panteghini, Paolo/P-4581-2015; Parisi, Maria Laura/H-9904-2014; bucci, valeria/KBA-7499-2024; Arachi, Giampaolo/N-7179-2015","Panteghini, Paolo/0000-0001-6564-0816; Parisi, Maria Laura/0000-0002-7072-3664; bucci, valeria/0000-0003-3035-3686; Arachi, Giampaolo/0000-0001-8100-5820",,,,,31,2,2,3,18,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,DEC,2012,68.0,4,,,,,445,465,,10.1628/001522112X659574,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,080PG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314254700008,0

In the first stage of the analysis we measure efficiency by employing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique. In addition, we employ two distinct accounting ratios to capture the costs of intermediation (net interest margin) and cost effectiveness (cost-to-income ratio). Our regression framework includes truncated regressions and generalized linear models. Moreover, we carry out a sensitivity analysis for robustness using a fractional logit estimator. Our results show that strengthening capital restrictions and official supervisory powers can improve the efficient operations of banks. Evidence also indicates that interventionist supervisory and regulatory policies such as private sector monitoring and restricting bank activities can result in higher bank inefficiency levels. Finally, the evidence produced suggests that the beneficial effects of capital restrictions and official supervisory powers (interventionist supervisory and regulatory policies) on bank efficiency are more pronounced in countries with higher quality institutions.

We decompose volatility of high-frequency returns into components that may be easily interpreted and estimated. The conditional variance is a product of daily, diurnal, and stochastic intraday components. This model is applied to a comprehensive sample consisting of 10-minute returns on more than 2500 US equities. Apart from building a new model, we obtain several interesting forecasting results. We apply a number of different specifications. We estimate models for separate companies, pool data into industries, and consider other criteria for grouping returns. In general, forecasts from pooled cross-section of companies outperform the corresponding forecasts from company-by-company estimation. For less liquid stocks, however, we obtain better forecasts when we group less frequently traded companies together.","[Sokalska, Magdalena E.] CUNY, Dept Econ, Queens Coll, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Engle, Robert F.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); New York University,"Sokalska, ME (通讯作者)，CUNY, Dept Econ, Queens Coll, 65-30 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, NY 11367 USA.",msokalska@qc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,33,85,94,0,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Equity beta and return volatility are lower in countries where the bankruptcy code favors debt renegotiations and for firms with more shareholder bargaining power relative to debt holders. These relations weaken as the countrys insolvency procedure favors liquidations over renegotiations. In the limit, when debt contracts cannot be renegotiated, equity risk is independent of shareholders incentives to default strategically. We argue that these findings support the hypothesis that the threat of strategic default can reduce the firms equity risk.","[Favara, Giovanni] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Schroth, Enrique] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Valta, Philip] HEC Paris, Paris, France",International Monetary Fund; University of Amsterdam; Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris,"Favara, G (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,"Schroth, Enrique/0000-0002-6110-2575; Favara, Giovanni/0000-0002-7737-0128; Valta, Philip/0000-0002-9208-1332",,,,,61,50,59,1,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Key outputs from the simulation include the impact of tax-induced migration on state revenues, excess burden, and fiscal externalities. With modest migration elasticities, the costs of state-level redistribution are substantial, but state action may still be preferred to a federal policy that is at odds with preferences of a state's citizens. At higher migration elasticities, the costs of state action can be tremendous. Overall excess burden is greater, but this is dominated by horizontal fiscal externalities. Horizontal fiscal externalities represent a cost to the state pursuing additional redistribution, but not a cost at the national level.","[Giertz, Seth H.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Tosun, Mehmet S.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Giertz, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",giertz@unl.edu; tosun@unr.edu,,,,,,,29,1,1,1,21,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

This paper asks if the recapitalization program had a design flaw. We focus on regional banks with a unique panel dataset of 81 banking groups that allows us to observe the employment levels of subsidiaries, in addition to those of parent banks, over fiscal 1994-2006. We estimate a labor-demand equation with sluggish adjustment to compare the employment patterns of public capital recipients and other banks. The result indicates that the shuffling of personnel to subsidiaries was a common response among banks that received large capital injections. Our finding highlights a tension between a reconstruction program and labor law when a country has a tight law on dismissal. J. Japanese Int. Economies 26 (4) (2012) 495-517.

However, the financial crisis led ethical investors to take a riskier and less profitable portfolio.

Free school choice has led, in fact, to increased choice on the part of both advantaged and (to a lesser extent) disadvantaged families.

It argues that the main characteristics of infrastructure discourage private investment and necessitate state subsidies which dilute private risks and incentives and facilitate rent-seeking. As a result, PPI is characterized by public financing, selective private investments and inconclusive efficiency gains. This is reflected globally and in Malaysia where PPI continues to be promoted because it provides captive rents. The political factors that drive PPI invariably compromise institutional solutions as Malaysia's water sector reforms illustrate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to estimate the volume of international travel by the Swedish population, and the emissions of greenhouse gas associated with that travel. Data used are from a national travel survey for 2006 including 27,000 telephone interviews. It is shown that international travel by the Swedish population amounted to 37 billion passenger-km, or 4100 km per capita in 2006. This corresponds to 22.5% of total travel by Swedes, an increase from 16.6% in 1994. Emissions of greenhouse gases from international travel by the Swedish population in 2006 amounted to 8.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, of which 92% stems from air travel. This is approx. 11% of total Swedish emissions including international transport. It is concluded that a continued growth of international travel at current pace hardly may be reconciled with long-term climate targets.

The observations falling below a given threshold of the empirical distribution of the Shareholder Value Ratio proxy bank financial distress. We employ a panel probit regression and, given the presence of overlapping data giving rise to residual autocorrelation, we use the Bertschek and Lechner (1998) robust estimator of the covariance matrix of parameters. We show that credit risk, liquidity risk and bank market power are the most influential determinants of distressed Shareholder Value Ratio.

All three scenarios are related to the area of services, namely real estate, retail, cultural services and hotel services. In order to expose the scenario that leads to the best use of the former BCHb a classical model of development appraisal was elaborated. For each scenario, market and financial analysis were conducted. In order to obtain a complex and well documented pre - feasibility study regarding the BCHb three scenarios have been designed, as follows: the first is a mix between offices at the upper levels and retail space at the ground floor of the BCHb; the second is composed of offices at the upper levels and museum at the ground floor; and the third scenario is projected for hotel destination. Starting from the national perspective and continuing with the analysis up to the particular area of the BCHb, the major characteristics of the office, retail and hotel markets were revealed. The financial analysis implied calculations of the most representative indicators used in this type of study, such as net present value, internal rate of return or payback period. Considering the financial indicators comparison, the pre-feasibility study pointed out that the BCHb should follow the scenario with the mix between offices and retail space.","[Constantin, Daniela Luminita; Dragusin, Mariana; Petrescu, Raluca Mariana; Iosif, Alina Elena] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Iosif, AE (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",alina.balalia@com.ase.ro,"Iosif, Alina-Elena/B-4435-2015; Grosu, Raluca Mariana/I-5331-2017; Constantin, Daniela/ABF-2896-2020","Grosu, Raluca Mariana/0000-0003-4246-2433; Constantin, Daniela/0000-0002-6839-7396",,,,,17,4,4,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2012,14.0,,,,6,,738,754,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,038UI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311199200011,0

Given that a significant amount of this debt is the result of governmental efforts to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis, the recession, and the anemic recovery it is tempting to think that the debt problem is a recent phenomenon. This article shows that the United States was on a collision course with a major debt problem for nearly four decades before the financial crisis. In particular, the debt problem began around 1970 when the government decided to significantly increase spending without a corresponding increase in revenue. The analysis suggests that the debt problem cannot be permanently resolved without creating a mechanism to prevent the government from running persistent deficits in the future.

We employ two different data sets that identify loan holdings for a large set of CLOs and find that adverse selection problems in corporate loan securitizations are less severe than commonly believed. Using a battery of performance tests, we find that loans securitized before 2005 performed no worse than comparable unsecuritized loans originated by the same bank. Even loans originated by the bank that acts as the CLO underwriter do not show under-performance relative to the rest of the CLO portfolio. While some evidence exists of under-performance for securitized loans originated between 2005 and 2007, it is not consistent across samples, performance measures, and horizons. Overall, we argue that the securitization of corporate loans is fundamentally different from securitization of other assets classes because securitized loans are fractions of syndicated loans. Therefore, mechanisms used to align incentives in a lending syndicate are likely to reduce adverse selection in the choice of CLO collateral.

Given that regulation may involve opportunity costs, this paper examines whether tighter futures price limits can reduce the effectiveness of a futures hedge. We propose a new model that uncovers the underlying spot-futures dynamics when futures prices are subject to limits. We use the model to determine the maximum number of limit days that can occur before minimum variance hedging outcomes are adversely affected. Application of this model to the US soybean and corn markets reveals that existing limits do not reduce hedge effectiveness. If the frequency of limit days increases from current levels of 1% to approximately 3-4%, conventional hedging approaches will experience economically and statistically significant increases in portfolio variance. These results are important for hedgers, clearing houses and regulators in light of the recent calls for derivatives regulation. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This form of regulatory arbitrage suggests there may be a destructive race to the bottom in global regulations, which restricts domestic regulators ability to limit bank risk-taking. However, we also find that the links between regulation differences and bank flows are significantly stronger if the recipient country is a developed country with strong property rights and creditor rights.

Using exploratory factor analysis on micro data from the third Community Innovation Survey in 13 countries, we identify four patterns that can be interpreted as research, user, external, and production ingredients of innovation. All too often it is assumed that how firm innovate can be represented by differences across sectors and/or countries. To put this proposition under scrutiny, we partition variability of the factors scores into components identified by these higher levels. Sectors and countries matter to a certain extent, but far more of the variance is given by heterogeneity among firms within both of them. However, groups of firms produced by cluster analysis account for much higher share of the variance, which indicates that the most relevant stratification of the data cuts across the established sectoral and national boundaries. We discuss implications of these findings for understanding of selection in evolutionary economics and for the literature on innovation systems.","[Srholec, Martin; Verspagen, Bart] Univ Oslo, Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture TIK, N-0851 Oslo, Norway; [Srholec, Martin] Norwegian Acad Sci & Letters, CAS, NO-0271 Oslo, Norway; [Verspagen, Bart] Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT, Dept Econ, NL-6211 LK Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Oslo; Maastricht University,"Srholec, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture TIK, Moltke Moes Vei 31, N-0851 Oslo, Norway.",martin.srholec@cerge-ei.cz; b.verspagen@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Srholec, Martin/C-4254-2012; Verspagen, Bart/ABE-6732-2020","Srholec, Martin/0000-0001-6115-4116; Verspagen, Bart/0000-0001-6975-8141",,,,,66,54,54,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Baton Rouge provides a very interesting case study because it is ranked the worst for congestion among medium sized urban areas in the nation. A travel demand model is used to estimate total travel for each alternative as well as for the status quo. Reduction in total travel resulting from implementation of each alternative over the status quo is evaluated in terms of the estimated change in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle hours traveled (VHT). The reduction in travel is compared with the estimated construction cost of each alternative. The analysis revealed that improving the existing road network was more effective in reducing traffic congestion and cost approximately one-third of the cost of the northern bypass. Applying tolls on the bypass did not improve the situation and further proved the superiority of the improved network in reducing traffic congestion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

But it would leave distortions in choices regarding many mutually exclusive discrete choices, such as location and profit shifting. The paper presents some evidence on the likely impact of introducing an ACE, which depends on how the government makes up for foregone corporation tax revenue.

The European Union has built the commoditization of natural gas through the socialization of several costs of trade.

These virtual hubs ignore most of the network and of the physical gas flows by the creation of entry/exit market zones. Thus the definition of such market zones has tied EU markets inside virtual trading zones (national or sub-national). We show the consequences and the challenges of this European choice, especially at the cross-zone level (often at country cross-border).

These tests allow for the construction of dynamic trading strategies based on nonparametric density forecasts of hedge fund returns. During the recent financial turmoil, our tests predict a superior performance for the Global Macro investment style compared with the other strategies of 'Directional Traders'. The Dedicated Short Bias investment style is stochastically dominated by the other directional styles. These results are confirmed by simple nonparametric tests constructed from realized excess returns. Further, by utilizing a cross-validation method for optimal bandwidth parameter selection, we discover the factors that have predictive power regarding the density of hedge fund returns. We observe that different factors have forecasting power for different regions of the returns distribution and, more importantly, that the Fung and Hsieh factors have power not only for describing the risk premium but also, if appropriately exploited, for density forecasting.

In this paper, we use data from a representative Dutch household panel to study the impact of uncertainty regarding one's savings adequacy on retirement savings contributions and information search processes. We combine ideas from the literature in psychology and economics that provide opposing predictions regarding the impact of uncertainty on retirement savings contributions. Our results indicate that the effect of uncertainty is moderated by two factors: an individual's perceived adequacy of current savings and that individual's financial constraints. In particular, we find that uncertainty increases retirement contributions for those who believe that they save adequately; however, it hinders retirement contributions for those who believe that they save inadequately. This effect of uncertainty is further moderated by the availability of financial means: a reduction in uncertainty results in greater contributions to savings only when financial constraints are absent. We also find that uncertainty has both indirect and direct effects on savings information search. In particular, uncertainty indirectly affects savings information search because it impacts individuals' intentions to save, which consequently forces individuals to engage in purchase-oriented information search; however, uncertainty also has a direct effect because individuals engage in ongoing information search processes to directly reduce uncertainty. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[van Schie, Ron J. G.; Donkers, Bas; Dellaert, Benedict G.

Its novelty lies in its focus on the interactions of local governments across national borders. We use panel data for the French and German municipalities in the Rhine Valley for the period 2000-2007. The local governments of each country influence firms' overall tax burdens, but the tax instruments available at the local level differ. We estimate panel models that distinguish between the effects of competing municipalities belonging to the same country and belonging to the other country. Our empirical model shows that local jurisdictions along borders choose their business tax rates based on those of their domestic neighbors and that foreign fiscal policy does not have an impact on the local domestic tax setting behavior in these contexts.

For this purpose, I estimate a stochastic dynamic model in which households facing income and survival uncertainty choose optimal levels of consumption, asset holdings and labor supply. In this model, social security pensions reduce private assets by less than 10%. Bequest and precautionary savings motives are the main reasons of this partial offset.

The findings provide evidence that the marginal effect of the transport efficiency and business environment improvement on exports appears to be decreasing in per capita income. In contrast, the impact of physical infrastructure and information and communications technology on exports appears increasingly important the richer a country becomes. We also find statistical evidence on the complementarity between hard infrastructure and soft infrastructure, as captured by our indicators.

To test the hypothesis, we use a unique data set that is merged from an insurance company and a vehicle manufacturer in Taiwan. We find weak evidence to support our hypothesis. Among all the proxies for proper maintenance, we indicate that proper maintenance defined by the recommended kilometers is significantly negatively correlated with the loss probability in compulsory automobile liability insurance. The average loss probability decreases by 0.23 percent when the insured vehicle is properly maintained according to the recommended number of kilometers in the previous years, whereas the average loss probability for the overall sample is 0.49 percent.

During times of recession, stock returns are explained differently for past losers and winners; the level of credit quality dominates the return dynamics for extreme losers, while levels of information-based trading activity and information ambiguity contribute to winners' medium-term returns. Such asymmetry is proposed as the source of insignificant profits achieved using conventional momentum strategies. On the other hand, in times of expansion, conventional asset pricing factors are found to affect stock returns with a dependence on the level of credit quality; this suggests that more profitable momentum strategies remain to be discovered.

J,"Calvo, F; De Oña, J",,,,"Calvo, Francisco; De Ona, Juan",,,Are rail charges connected to costs?,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rail charges; Railway costs; Marginal costs; Total cost; Charging principles,,"In rail pricing systems, variable charges and track usage or running charges are supposed to recover the costs that are most directly incurred as a result of operating a train service: the marginal costs of track renewal and maintenance. This paper studies a series of national charging systems to compare track usage costs and the charges that seek to recover those costs. It also examines the pricing levels applied to railway services to study the coherence between national charging systems and the charging principle on which they are based. The key conclusions are that, in general, the countries that adopt a full cost system recover more costs than those that adopt a marginal cost system. Moreover, the pricing system applied by marginal cost system countries varies, depending on the country and type of railway service provided. It has also been found that, no matter which charging principle is adopted, regional, local and suburban trains are the rail services on which more costs are levied, followed by long distance passenger trains and freight trains, with the latter making the lowest contribution to track costs. Another point in common among all countries is the small portion of costs recovered via charges. Finally, the study on coherence showed that some countries do not apply the charging principle of their choice coherently. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Less obvious and documented is that these 'soft variables' also influence other, non-travel related aspects such as residential choice. The result is that preferred residential neighborhoods not always match with the actual residential neighborhood. This residential dissonance (or mismatch) also has its influence on travel behavior since the preferred travel modes of dissonant residents may not be ideally available in their actual neighborhood. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of residential dissonance on travel mode choice in Flanders, Belgium. Residential dissonance clearly affects the ability of people in realizing their preferred travel behavior, albeit in different ways for urban and rural residents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While such policies are ubiquitous and likely inefficient, economists have not had access to sufficient data to estimate their economic impact. Using unique panel data on residential end-uses of water in 11 North American cities, we examine the welfare implications of urban water rationing in response to drought. Using estimates of expected marginal prices that vary both across and within markets, we estimate price elasticities specific to indoor and outdoor water use. Our results suggest that current policies do target water uses that households, themselves, are most willing to forgo. Nevertheless, we find that rationing outdoor water in cities has costly welfare implications, primarily due to household heterogeneity in willingness-to-pay for scarce water. We find that replacing rationing policies with a market-clearing drought price would result in welfare gains of more than 29% of what households in the sample spend each year on water.

Tuna fisheries are among the most highly capitalized and valuable fisheries in the world. This paper distinguishes between two relations that function simultaneously at the point of production in capture fisheries to investigate an empirical account of a commodity frontier in tuna (Moore 2010a,b). The first is the vertical relationship between capital and the environmental conditions of production. The second is the horizontal relations between competing fishing firms as they transform nature to produce commodities for the world market. The paper traces the emergence of the European tuna fleet in its search for new commodity frontiers, from the Bay of Biscay (1860s) to the Eastern Tropical Atlantic (1950s) and the Western Indian Ocean (1980s). The primary empirical focus is the Indian Ocean, where, after appropriating an initial, highly productive surplus, the European fleet intensified fishing activities and has partially undermined the natural conditions for the reproduction of its industrial-scale operations. I argue that the complex dynamics of capture fisheries can be better understood through the prism of a commodity frontier.","Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London E1 4NS, England",University of London,"Campling, L (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",l.campling@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,97,81,91,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

While the demand for autonomy is a purely psychological construct, the economic tradeoffs involved in its achievement are eminently amenable to quantification and analytical modeling characteristic of economic analysis. We use this setup to offer a multi factor utility formulation formalizing the notion of an explicit, autonomy-based preference for self-employment. We propose such a formulation as a theoretically-defensible alternative to the classic (and also psychologically-based) overconfidence hypothesis in explaining why self-employment is chosen despite evidence that newly self-employed individuals earn less than comparable individuals who continue their current employment. Our model, founded on utility maximization by a rational individual, demonstrates not only that newly self-employed individuals are willing to accept lower earnings outcomes in exchange for psychic benefits from self-employment, but also that the structure of their optimal launch-timing decision guarantees that they will quit at a time such that their income will (at least initially) be reduced. We conclude with implications for the design of empirical instruments to quantify the relative importance of autonomy and income. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The overriding theme of the book is to pose two approaches to attaining financial stability in the future. One approach is to establish a council of wise men and women supported by an army of highly skilled professional financial economists to formulate and implement regulations designed to prevent future financial crises that wreak havoc on the real economy and require financial support from taxpayers. This is the approach of the Dodd-Frank Act. The second approach proposed by the authors of this book is to design a taxing system that taxes systemically important financial institutions on the basis of their contribution to systemic risk. Borrowing ideas from the literature on the taxation of negative externalities their view is that financial institutions that create crises should pay for the clean-up. They also argue that requiring the financial polluters to pay for the creation of systemic risk will reduce the supply of systemic risk. The reader is invited to decide which approach is best.

We employ an original bank-level data set that splits bank credit portfolios in 21 granular categories, covering household and corporate loans. The results corroborate the presence of a strong procyclical behavior of credit quality, and show a robust negative relationship between the logistic transformation of non-performing loans (NPLs) and GDP growth, with a lag response of up to three quarters. The results also indicate that the procyclical behavior of loan quality varies across credit types. This is novel in the literature and suggests that banks with larger exposures to highly procyclical credit types and economic sectors would tend to undergo sharper deterioration in the quality of their credit portfolios during an economic downturn. Lack of sufficient portfolio granularity in macro stress testing fails to capture these effects and thus introduces a source of bias that tends to underestimate the tail losses stemming from the riskier banks in a system.

We provide evidence that government ideology, political institutions and globalization are important determinants of the choice of exchange rate regime. In particular, we find that left-wing governments, democratic institutions, central bank independence and financial development increase the likelihood of choosing a flexible regime, whereas more globalized countries have a higher probability of implementing a fixed regime.

In this paper we investigate the current state of bioenergy assessments and scrutinize the topics and perspectives explored in the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change. We suggest that an appropriate assessment requires a comprehensive literature review, the explicit exposition of disparate viewpoints, and exploration of policy-relevant content based on plausible storylines.

Unexpected Snow provides lending banks with the counterfactual of what would have been the ski hotel's operating performance in the absence of strategic default, allowing them to distinguish between ski hotels that are in distress due to negative demand shocks (liquidity defaulters) and those that are in distress due to debt overhang (strategic defaulters).","[Mueller, Holger M.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, NBER, CEPR, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Giroud, Xavier] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Stomper, Alex] Humboldt Univ Berlin HU, Berlin, Germany; [Westerkamp, Arne] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Vienna, Austria",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Mueller, HM (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, NBER, CEPR, 44 W 4th St,Suite 9-190, New York, NY 10012 USA.",hmueller@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,23,31,34,12,92,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Presentations made by a range of stakeholders as well as a specially commissioned play stimulated our thoughts on how to encourage better interaction between health and transport researchers. We chose school travel as a case study as it exemplifies two key aspects of the wider transport and health debates; (i) the increasing trend towards reliance on car travel, described here in the context of sedentary lifestyles, traffic congestion, pollution, and parental attitudes, and (ii) school travel occurs at a critical life-stage during which behaviour patterns are formed that are likely to be influential in later life, thus making it an important target point for interventions. Methods: We present evidence from four distinct, but complementary, theoretical perspectives: transport, exposure, behaviour and sustainability. We draw common lessons and identify challenges using a range of conceptual frameworks: integrated psychological model of transport choices, Dahlgren and Whitehead's 'layers of influence' model, Hosking et al.'s 'pathways from transport to health', and Hanlon et al.'s integral theory. We demonstrate the benefits and challenges of holistic interaction and collaboration between disciplines to better understand the key issues and develop policy interventions that are meaningful and effective. Results and conclusions: None of the pre-existing conceptual models were fully able to encompass the societal and individual level influences on school travel. However, we present an interim model for further discussion and debate.

When a current home owner's house price covaries positively with housing costs in a future city, changes in the future cost of housing are offset by commensurate changes in wealth before the move. Using Census micro-data, we find that the cross-sectional variation in house values subsequent to a move is lower for home owners who moved between more highly covarying cities. Our preferred estimates imply that an increase in covariance of one standard deviation reduces the variance of subsequent housing consumption by about 11%. Households at the top end of the covariance distribution who are likely to have owned large homes before moving get the largest reductions, of up to 40% relative to households at the median.

In this framework, this study describes the synthetic process of reviewing the scoring system used by IFN. The mechanism for evaluation of scoring system performance combines the indicators of discrimination power with econometric results of studying the functional relationship between risk variables integrated in the model and the credit status (default/reimbursement) based on logit model. The empirical analysis provides clear evidences that while the discriminatory power related to qualitative component (reputational scoring) respects the requirements of a good ex-ante identification of non reimbursement cases, the power of discrimination of quantitative scoring is only marginally superior to a random model. The added value of the study is completed by highlighting the importance of technical conditions of financing facility for anticipating events of non reimbursement. At the same time, the study tries to highlight the importance of scientific calibration of such a scoring system to perform effectively in the early detection of cases of default.","[Dardac, Nicolae; Chiriac, Petronel; Moinescu, Bogdan] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dardac, N (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",nicolae.dardac@fin.ase.ro,"Moinescu, Bogdan-Gabriel/C-4226-2012","Moinescu, Bogdan-Gabriel/0000-0003-2813-592X",,,,,13,1,1,0,23,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2012,14.0,31,,,,,258,271,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,900SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300910600019,0

Once the decision to commit resources has been taken, larger, older, foreign-owned, exporting and energy-intensive firms incur higher environmental expenditure.

Globally conducted studies have revealed a good understanding of and an increasing receptivity to sustainable forms of travel among tourists. Nevertheless, the place they hold in the structure of tourist circulation is still modest, mainly due to the insufficient supply, in its turn determined by ignorance of the demand and by the additional requirements the consumer of such holidays has to meet, especially in regard to behavior. In line with these developments and trends, this study aimed to identify the behavior of tourists in protected areas and its determinants, to encourage a responsible attitude towards the environment and its quality.

The paper begins with a typology of policies usable at low interest and inflation rates. They are: strategy (i), management of expectations about future policy rates; strategy (ii), targeted asset purchases; and strategy (iii), QE. Alternatively, QE may be decomposed into a pure attempt to inflate the central bank balance sheet, QE0, purchases of assets in dysfunctional markets, QE1, and purchases of assets to generate portfolio rebalancing, QE2. Strategy (ii), when nonsterilized, is either QE1 or QE2. Using this typology, I review the measures adopted by the BOJ and discuss evidence on the effectiveness of the measures. The broad conclusion is that strategies (i) and (ii) have affected interest rates, while no clear evidence exists so far of the effectiveness of the pure form of strategy (iii), or QE0. Strategy (ii) has been effective especially in containing risk/liquidity premiums in dysfunctional money markets; that is, QE1 has been effective. The effectiveness of QE2, however, is less clear-cut. The strategies, however, have failed to bring the Japanese economy out of the deflation trap so far.

Fair value also stirred significant debates in the context of EU's negotiation regarding IFRS adoption, finally generating the IAS 39 carve-out seen by many as the cost paid by the IASB. As if the standard setting process for fair value measurement was not challenging enough, the recent financial crisis raised even more questions born from difficulties proven in particular cases. Furthermore, we cannot neglect the forces at stake when discussing the politics in accounting, fair value again offering an extremely rich research venue. The banking industry's particular involvement in relation to fair value standards and regulations stands as a first indication in this direction. The main objective of our paper is to offer a synthesis on the current state of affairs in relation to fair value measurement in financial reporting. Our paper follows the standard setting process for fair value measurements starting with the international arena and further focusing on the particularities of an emerging economy. The analysis is completed by including the Romanian values regulations, as well as implementing a questionnaire survey involving Romanian professional values. Our paper contributes to the literature on the use of fair value in financial reporting; mainly arguing for the necessity of its consideration in relation to different information needs coming from different users. We finally conclude that if we are to continue the plan to expand the use of fair value measurement, significant clarifications remain necessary in approaching accounting standards, regulations and practices.

Although the regimes captured by regime-switching models are identified by an econometric procedure, they often correspond to different periods in regulation, policy, and other secular changes. In empirical estimates, the means, volatilities, autocorrelations, and cross-covariances of asset returns often differ across regimes in a manner that allows regime-switching models to capture the stylized behavior of many financial series including fat tails, heteroskedasticity, skewness, and time-varying correlations. In equilibrium models, regimes in fundamental processes, such as consumption or dividend growth, strongly affect the dynamic properties of equilibrium asset prices and can induce non-linear risk-return trade-offs.

This paper explores whether such features of cooperative federations lead to subnational soft budget constraints using panel data from the German States covering the 1975-2005 period. The methodology is based on the premise that subnational governments' borrowing will exhibit vertical and horizontal strategic interactions if they operate under soft budget constraints. Therefore, a test for strategic interactions in subnational borrowing can be used to infer whether a cooperative federation like Germany is susceptible to soft budget constraints. The results suggest that state borrowing in Germany exhibited horizontal but not vertical interactions during the time-frame of the analysis. This indicates (i) that German States faced soft budget constraints and (ii) that they were more concerned about the likelihood of a bailout than about its volume. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Applying a principal component analysis we distinguish between common factors and idiosyncratic components and determine whether non-stationarity stems from international or national stochastic trends. We find evidence that the common factors are l(1) while the idiosyncratic components are l(0). This finding indicates that cross-member cointegration exists and non-stationarity in exchange rates and fundamentals is mainly driven by common international trends. We find evidence that the common factors of the exchange rates and fundamentals are cointegrated. In addition, the estimated long-run coefficients of this common international relationship are in line with the suggestions of the monetary model with respect to income and money.

While this state contingency creates uncertainties, it likewise offers various possibilities to react to particular states of nature (e.g. through irrigation or pest management). A concept which in principle accounts for these contexts is the so called state contingent approach originally developed by CHAMBERS and QUIGGIN. This approach comprises the state contingent depiction of the production process under uncertainty as basis for a realistic representation of individual decision making as well as the resulting market reactions. The following article deals with the state contingent approach in the context of mathematical programming. It starts with the description of the conceptual foundations of the approach and subsequently focuses on its implementation in the context of mathematical programming under uncertainty. The comparison with conventional mathematical programming approaches using an example documents the conceptual advantage of the state contingent approach, but also clarifies the methodical challenges which result from its complexity.","[Berg, Ernst] Univ Bonn, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Berg, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Lebensmittel & Ressourcenokon, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",E.Berg@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,2,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Major emerging economies from Central and Eastern Europe are post-communist countries that faced transition after adopting market-based economy and become emerging markets. An important issue during transition was the creation of a two-pillar banking system (e.g. Central Bank and commercial banks), while bank restructuring involves not only profit performing banks but, more importantly, changes in lending practice. The difficulty of restructuring and the magnitude of recapitalization slowed significantly the achievement of independent governance by privatization in state-owned banks. After a short period of market-based economy, emerging countries had been affected by the crisis started in the developed countries (characterized by lower growth, higher unemployment and poverty, and changes in inequality). Through several channels, crisis had affected also emerging countries differently, depending on the extent to which they are vulnerable to particular canals. Romania's status in the context of transition bears the characteristics determined by the situation inherited from the centralized economy and the options of political forces after 1989. The starting point was unfavorable both from an economic perspective, but also social, economic inefficiency due to the existence of industrial projects and sometimes senseless economic, profound structural economic imbalances, sizing of industries and alarming social indicators. Developing countries were affected by the crisis that began in developed countries, characterized by low economic growth, boost unemployment and poverty and inequality changes. A number of transmission channels of the crisis also affected differently, also developing countries, according to the extent that they are vulnerable to certain channels. Emerging economies in Central and Eastern Europe are the post-communist economies that have experienced the transition, after the adoption of market-based economy. In the last part of the paper we are looking for some transmission channels of crisis and some possible effects on post-communist countries during crisis, using dummy variables and some OLS estimators of the major factors identified as transmission channels using a dataset from EBRD databases.

Yardstick competition is a name for the strategic interactions among sub-central governments, especially on the field of tax policy. It is the result of asymmetric information on the side of voters who can compare rate of taxation and quantity and quality of public goods more easily through looking at the neighbours' situation. The local incumbents then adjust their policy according the nearby sub-central governments. This problem has not been challenged to be applied to the Czech Republic situation. The reason may be that the fiscal autonomy of the Czech sub-central governments is remarkably low. But the current situation used to be completely different in the long period after the sub-central governments had been constituted in the middle of the 19th century. The peak of the rate of the tax autonomy was reached during the interwar era of the Czechoslovak republic so this period has to be logical theme of our interest. This paper considers the influence of the nearby sub-central governments' tax policy using correlation analysis and panel regression. It focuses on the overall and municipal additional rates on direct taxes.","[Haas, Jakub] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econ Hist, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,haasj@post.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,WOLTERS KLUWER CR A S,PRAHA 3,"U NAKLADOVEHO NADRAZI 6, PRAHA 3, PRAGUE 130 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7478-012-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,87,96,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJP92,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329534700009,0

Their patrilocal marriage was enmeshed in gender-based violence, influenced by drug addiction and problematic intergenerational power relations.

Even in the face of the current shale gas boom, however questions are raised about both the economics of this industry and the wisdom of basing future environmental policy on projections of large shale gas supplies. Analysis of the business model appropriate to the gas shales suggests that, though the shale future is uncertain, these concerns are overstated. The policy impact of the shale gas is analyzed using two scenarios of greenhouse gas control one mandating renewable generation and coal retirement, the other using price to achieve a 50% emissions reduction. The shale gas is shown both to benefit the national economy and to ease the task of emissions control. However in treating the shale as a bridge to a low carbon future there are risks to the development of technologies, like capture and storage, needed to complete the task.","[Jacoby, Henry D.; Paltsev, Sergey] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [O'Sullivan, Francis M.] MIT, Energy Initiat, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Jacoby, HD (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",Hjacoby@mit.edu,,"Paltsev, Sergey/0000-0003-3287-0732","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science [DE-FG02-94ER61937]","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","Special thanks go to Tony Meggs and Qudsia Ejaz for their work underlying the estimates of shale resources and economics.

The results support the mixture-of-distribution hypothesis (MDH), which endorses a significant contemporaneous relationship between volume and volatility, and the sequential-arrival-of-information hypothesis (SAIH), which advocates significant lagged volatility-volume relations. The net effect of trading number is positive, supporting the dispersed belief hypothesis, while the net effect of trading imbalance is negative, supporting the asymmetrical information hypothesis. Our results suggest that the four theories of volume-volatility relations are complementary, not competing. In addition, the largest effect of the trading imbalance on volatility is found during American regular trading hours, rather than the home asset market of the futures contracts, thus supporting the trading place bias.

We study efficient clearing arrangements for exchanges, where traders must clear with a clearinghouse, and for over-the-counter (OTC) markets, where traders can clear bilaterally. When clearing is costly, it can be efficient to subsidize OTC clearing by charging a higher clearing price for transactions conducted on exchanges. The clearinghouse then operates across both markets. Since clearinghouses offer credit, intertemporal incentives are needed to ensure settlement. When liquidity costs increase, concerns about default lead to a tightening of liquidity provision. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Since these hybrid securities are mandatorily converted into equity when banks are in need of a recapitalization, they are credited for reducing banks' likelihood of financial distress. In this paper, we show within a continuous-time framework that this allegedly beneficial impact hinges critically on the assumption of complete contracts. If contracts are incomplete in the sense that manager-owners enjoy discretion over the risk of the investment program, our analysis shows that CoCo bonds always distort risk taking incentives. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that there exist conditions under which Coco bond financing increases investors' wealth, but also increases the bank's probability of financial distress, so that the banking system as a whole will be destabilized. Thus, individually rational decisions can have systemically undesirable outcomes. Further results indicate that CoCos should be used only in conjunction with devices to control risk shifting incentives. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Further, the percentage of subprime ARM originations is significantly decreased with greater inflation uncertainty while the impact on prime ARM originations is statistically insignificant.

Such a review is overdue. Many non-tariff barriers to imports and exports have been abolished, though new import restraints on rice and sugar are notable exceptions to this trend. Import tariffs have been lowered, particularly through regional preferential trade arrangements. We account for such arrangements in two different ways. Export taxes persist in certain natural resources sectors, but most rates have been reduced. We find that more than half of the effective support provided to tradable products sectors now comes from subsidies on fuels, fertiliser, electricity and liquefied petroleum gas, rather than from trade policies per se.

Continued productivity benefits all the stakeholders that are involved in the process. Unfortunately, negative productivity levels have been reported in numerous South African land redistribution transfers in recent years. A game theoretic perspective is adopted to illustrate and argue that cooperation among key stakeholders, which could be enforced through long-term contracts between land buyers, sellers and new owners, may lead to maintenance and higher productivity levels and other benefits within the country's land redistribution process. Sugarcane farm transfer cases from two municipality districts in the KwaZulu-Natal province are used to show that the productivity rates in the post-transfer periods within cooperative land sales were more than 10% higher than the rates observed before such transfers. At the opposite end of the scale, the productivity rates in non-cooperative land sales dropped by 12% after the land was sold and taken over by new farmers. Also notable is that the prices paid by government for farms that became less productive after transfers were higher by more than 40% compared to prices paid for productive farms. The cases could be illustrative of the benefits of cooperation in land redistribution transactions.","[Antrobus, G.

Some studies found that males were more likely to use active transport modes, but other research found no association between sex and school travel. This study used data from the 1977, 1983, 1990, 1995, 2001, and 2009 US National Household Travel Surveys to examine sex differences in school travel and how they have changed over time. The analysis showed that males walked to and from school more than females, though differences were modest - between 1% and 2% points - and were statistically significant only in 1990. In contrast, males biked to school two to three times more than females. These modal differences may result from females' observed lower levels of independent mobility. Policy interventions, such as the Safe Routes to School program, can address gender differences by providing programs such as the Walking School Bus that provide adult supervision on the school trip. Bicycle interventions should ensure that females are participating in the programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reconsiders these problems from the perspective of heterodox institutionalist economics in the tradition of Veblen and Ayres. The property rights problems of agricultural cooperatives seemingly reinforce the new institutional economics presumption of the superiority of fully delineated private ownership. In contrast, the paper shows these problems to be likewise consistent with the heterodox institutionalist school, which is much more reserved about the societal role of private ownership. Toward this end, the paper elaborates the logical structure of the so-called institutionalist dichotomy.

Yet, control of vegetable safety is difficult in a situation of small-scale farming. Concerning linking farmers to market, many studies emphasized the vital role of farmer organization, but few studies focus on the specific activities of quality control by collective action. This paper aims to describe the present patterns of collective action by vegetable farmers involved in the development of vegetable safety, with a special focus on quality control. It is based on case studies of nine vegetable organizations. The study concludes that group leadership and farmers' sense of responsibility are the main ways for current Vietnamese farmer organizations to ensure producing a high-quality product associated with long-term acquaintance as well as the same residence area of the farmers because they cherish their reputation.

However, the added value accruing from this 'credit-plus' approach has been little analysed. We hypothesise that the extent of added value from credit-plus depends on the ability of the credit supplier to cultivate trust, or social capital, amongst clients. Applying difference-in-difference estimation, we exploit a natural experiment of two 'credit-plus' programmes in Mexico. The findings suggest that credit-plus is not universally effective, but that it is at its most effective, especially with low-income groups, where 'bonding' (within-group) social capital exists.","[Biosca, Olga] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Yunus Ctr Social Business & Hlth, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [Biosca, Olga] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow Sch Business & Soc, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [Lenton, Pamela; Mosley, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",Glasgow Caledonian University; Glasgow Caledonian University; University of Sheffield,"Biosca, O (通讯作者)，Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Yunus Ctr Social Business & Hlth, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",Olga.Biosca@gcu.ac.uk,,"Lenton, Pamela/0000-0002-8449-7207; Biosca, Olga/0000-0003-0422-0003",,,,,49,11,13,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

As a result, analyzing interest rate risk (IRR) is critical for financial institutions and supervisory agencies. We propose a new method for generating yield-curve scenarios for stress testing banks' exposure to IRR based on the Nelson-Siegel (1987) yield-curve model. We show that our method produces yield-curve scenarios with a wider variety of slopes and shapes than scenarios generated by the historical and hypothetical methods typically used in the banking industry and proposed in the literature. We stress test the economic value of equity of a bank balance sheet based on Call Report data from a large U.S. bank.

Our findings show that private-sector reorganizations do not deliver the expected cost-savings from 1986 to 1991, a period of industry distress. On a univariate basis, the net loss on assets is lower for a private-sector reorganization than for a liquidation in both a period of industry distress and of industry health. However, institutions with higher quality assets and higher franchise values are more likely to be resolved using a private-sector resolution. Once we control for this selection bias, we find that institutions that are resolved during periods of industry distress result in higher resolution costs than liquidation. During periods of industry health, private-sector resolutions are less costly than liquidations. We show that if a bank that failed during the post-crisis period instead failed during the crisis period, its net loss as a percent of assets would have been 3.232 percentage points higher. Given that the average net loss on assets ratio is 21.42 percent during our sample period from 1986 to 2007, the increase in costs is economically significant. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These shocks can be taken to reflect important market announcements, monetary policy regime changes and/or changes in business conditions affecting stock market. The model assumes that both the timing and size of breaks are stochastic. The last property of the model distinguishes it from other nonlinear models of the literature employed to capture level shifts in stock returns. Implementation of the model to the US stock market indicates that it can successfully capture level shifts in the mean of the aggregate return of this market which follow a cyclical pattern. Most of these shifts are triggered by negative large return shocks. The latter can be of smaller magnitude than that of the positive ones. Finally, the paper shows that the model can be employed to successfully forecast future expected stock returns. (C) 2014 Elsevier BAT.

For this purpose, we analyse and compare the determinants of international equity investment of institutional and noninstitutional investors from 20 OECD countries (US not included) in the period 2001-2009. The results show that there are significant differences in the determinants of international equity investment between institutional and noninstitutional investors. In particular, noninstitutional investors tend to exhibit a more pronounced preference for equities of geographical nearby, contiguous and more transparent countries than institutional investors. The preference for more developed equity markets and the contrarian behaviour are also significantly more pronounced for noninstitutional than for institutional investors. These results support the argument that international equity investment of less sophisticated investors is more affected by information costs and familiarity than that of more sophisticated investors. Moreover, business cycles exert an influence on international equity investment decisions of both institutional and noninstitutional investors. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Households that have little or negative equity are less likely to move because the proceeds from the sale of the home may not be large enough to pay off the original mortgage and provide a sufficient down payment on a new home. On the other hand, at sufficiently negative levels of home equity, household mobility may actually increase through the foreclosure channel. In this paper we develop and empirically test a model that incorporates both of these mechanisms. Our empirical results based on data for Florida homeowners provide evidence of a non-monotonic relationship between home equity and mobility. Although default-induced mobility did increase following the financial crisis, this increase did little to offset the substantial decline in voluntary moves due to home equity lock-in: we find that on net, household mobility declined by roughly 25% in our sample because of reductions in equity.

But structural transformation and urbanization patterns differ substantially, with some countries fostering migration out of agriculture into rural off farm activities and secondary towns, and others undergoing rapid agglomeration in mega cities. Using cross-country panel data for developing countries spanning 1980-2004, it is found that migration out of agriculture into the missing middle (rural nonfarm economy and secondary towns) yields more inclusive growth patterns and faster poverty reduction than agglomeration in mega cities. This suggests that patterns of urbanization deserve much more attention when striving for faster poverty reduction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

And then, as governor of an emerging economy's central bank starting in May 2005, he decided the monetary responses to the worldwide crisis of 2008-09 and its aftershocks. Fischer's unpublished Robbins Lectures, delivered at the London School of Economics late in 2001, drew lessons from his service at the IMF. Did emerging markets follow up on those lessons, and did their preparations help them weather the storm of 2008-09?

Leveraging a unique cross-national dataset on portfolio flows immediately following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, it shows that countries with better institutions - those with more (or less) democratic, more (or less) constrained or more accountable political systems - were no less vulnerable to portfolio outflows than countries with worse institutions. However, countries with better governance prior to the crisis - those with better regulatory apparatuses, rule of law, property rights, and those considered less politically risky - experienced lower net portfolio capital outflows after Lehman. Governance is in fact the strongest predictor of portfolio capital flows during the global flight to liquidity, while political institutions perform poorly. The findings shed light onto the political factors that mediated how the collapse of Lehman affected national financial markets the world over, and have implications for literatures on the political economy of foreign investment, as well as for broader topics of institutions, governance, and economic performance.","[Pepinsky, Thomas B.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Pepinsky, TB (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",pepinsky@cornell.edu,,,,,,,47,7,11,2,34,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Each mechanism, however, suffers from the financial trilemma, which is that cross-border banking, national financial autonomy and financial stability are incompatible. In this paper, we study the efficiency of different burden-sharing agreements for the recapitalisation of the 30 largest banks in Europe. We consider bank bailouts for these banks in a simulation framework with stochastic country-specific bailout benefits. Among the burden sharing rules, we find that the majority and qualified-majority voting rules come close to the efficiency of a bailout mechanism with a supranational authority. Even a unanimous voting rule works better than home-country bailouts, which are very inefficient. If we assume additional systemic risk benefits, the efficiency of burden sharing rules comes close to the supranational solution. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The result would be increased correlation among security valuations and therefore returns, and diminished benefits of diversification. We test this hypothesis by examining the patterns of security and portfolio returns surrounding the onset of the credit crisis in early 2007 and observe a significant postcrisis increase in the proportion of security and portfolio returns explained by market factors.

The passage of time also had a cost: 22 per cent of households did not recall test results by 2008. The loss of arsenic knowledge led to staying at unsafe wells and switching from safe wells.

According to our results, innovation strategy of the firm is one of the main factors which drive firms to collaborate with universities in the innovation process. Firms that adopts an open innovation strategy, collaborate with external organizations and exploit external knowledge are open to collaboration with universities to generate innovations. These firms focus more on intramural R&D investments.

Our modelling strategy makes three important contributions to the existing literature on household finances. Firstly, we model nine different types of household financial problems within a joint framework, allowing for correlation in the random effects across the nine equations. Secondly, we develop a dynamic framework in order to model the persistence of financial problems over time by extending our multi-equation framework to allow the presence or otherwise of different types of financial problems in the previous time period to influence the probability that the household currently experiences such problems. Our third contribution relates to the possibility that experiencing financial problems may be correlated with sample attrition. We model missing observations in the panel in order to allow for such attrition. Our modelling framework allows us to identify any persistence in financial problems over time as well as any interdependence that may exist between different types of financial problems. Our findings reveal interesting variations in the determinants of experiencing different types of financial problems including demographic and regional differences.

We examine the changes in R-square and stock price synchronicity upon compliance disclosures of earnings and regulatory reprimanding disclosures of special treatment status in China. Our results show that upon information arrival, R-square decreases because of the increase in firm-level information from the announcements, a result that is consistent with our hypothesis.

We find that, given the influence of the market beta, the relationship between size and returns is significant only in down markets. Further, we find a size effect in January regardless of the market state. In months other than January, a small-firm effect exists in down markets, but a large-firm effect exists in up markets. Out results are robust to different definitions of up and down markets using credit spreads and various estimations of beta. These results suggest that if payment to size is based on systematic risk then some other explanation should be developed. Alternatively, the explanation of the size effect may depend on payment to idiosyncratic risk or it might be associated with behavioral factors.

These are determined by mapping the probability that the debt-GDP ratio might exceed a maximum debt limit at some point in the future into a credit rating. The debt limit can be either ad hoc or based on the financial ability of a government to change fiscal policy in the future to meet its outstanding obligations. When applied to quarterly U.S. data from 1970 to 2011, two clear instances are found in which the U.S. sovereign credit rating would have been downgraded on this basis: during the 1970s oil crisis and in the aftermath of the Lehman collapse in 2008.

We revisit this issue by estimating the effect of changes over time in cross-border differences in state tax conditions on the tendency for new establishments to favor one side of a state border over the other. Identification is enhanced by taking account of previously overlooked reciprocal agreements that require workers to pay income tax to their state of residence as opposed to their state of employment. When reciprocal agreements are in force, higher personal income tax rates lure companies from across the border, while corporate income tax and sales tax rates have the opposite effect. Where reciprocal agreements are not in place, the results are largely reversed. These patterns are amplified in heavily developed locations, and differ in anticipated ways by industry and corporate/non-corporate status of the establishment. Overall, results strengthen the view that state-level tax policies do affect the location decisions of entrepreneurs and new business activity, but not in a way that lends itself to a one-size-fits-all summary.

The paper combines these margins in a model in which there is a continuum of fields with varying capital costs. Opening a new field involves sinking a capital cost, and the date of opening is chosen to maximize the present value of the field. Depletion of each open field follows a Hotelling rule, modified by the fact that faster depletion reduces the amount that can ultimately be extracted. The paper studies the equilibrium paths of output and price. Under specific but reasonable assumptions on demand and the cost distribution of deposits it is found that the rate of growth of price is constant and independent of the rate of interest, depending instead on characteristics of demand and geology.","[Venables, Anthony J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3QU, England",University of Oxford,"Venables, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3QU, England.",,"venables, anthony/JDW-7805-2023",,,,,,25,16,17,0,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

The focus is on bank stock returns in a multi-factor framework that includes interest rate risk and market risk as well as credit risk, real estate risk, sovereign risk, and foreign exchange risk. Our findings indicate that bank risk exposures are multi-dimensional and time-varying but well reflected in bank stock returns. Dynamic beta exposures and time-varying variance shares accompany structural changes in the banking industry and the recent financial crisis. During the last two decades, interest rate risk has changed but credit risk still represents a major factor for explaining bank stock returns. For the recent financial crisis we provide evidence of a change in the capital market's assessment of bank risk exposures with a significant revaluation of real estate and sovereign risks. Overall, our factor model offers a parsimonious approach for modeling the risk dynamics in the banking industry and provides evidence for the capital market's ability to assess bank risk exposures.

This region is particularly well suited for such a study because of the rapid change of the institutional framework and the possibility to use West Germany as a benchmark. It took about 15 years until self-employment levels in East Germany reached those of West Germany. Despite this catch up, we find a number of peculiarities in East German self-employment that appear to be a continuing legacy of the socialist period. There is also a considerable correspondence of the regional levels of self-employment before, during and after the socialist period, suggesting the existence of a long-lasting regional entrepreneurship culture that can be regarded as an informal institution. This is in line with the hypothesis that informal institutions change much more slowly than formal institutions.","[Fritsch, Michael; Sorgner, Alina; Wyrwich, Michael] Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Fritsch, Michael] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Fritsch, Michael] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Berlin, Germany; [Bublitz, Elisabeth] Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Fritsch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",m.fritsch@uni-jena.de; bublitz@hwwi.org; alina.sorgner@uni-jena.de; michael.wyrwich@uni-jena.de,"Fritsch, Michael/ABB-7526-2021; Fritsch, Michael/E-9321-2011","Fritsch, Michael/0000-0003-0337-4182; Sorgner, Alina/0000-0002-6876-5961",,,,,55,47,49,0,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Our analysis shows that exports account for much lower shares of overall sales in the services sectors than in manufacturing. This is because fewer firms are engaged in trade in the services sectors and also because within particular sectors firms trade a lower share of their sales on average. Services producers trade mostly goods, but in terms of value, trade in services is much more important to them than to manufacturers. Larger and more productive firms are more likely to be two-way traders and to engage in both goods and services trade. Trade by services firms is somewhat less dominated by firms that both export and import than trade by manufacturing firms. Few firms export many services or to many countries. The value of services exports is increasing in the number of markets served but not necessarily in the number of services traded.","[Haller, Stefanie A.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Damijan, Joze] Univ Ljubljana, Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Vives, Leuven, Belgium; [Kaitila, Ville; Maliranta, Mika] ETLA, Res Inst Finnish Econ, Helsinki, Finland; [Kostevc, Crt; Rojec, Matija] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Maliranta, Mika] Univ Jyvaskyla, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Milet, Emmanuel] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Mirza, Daniel] Univ Tours, LEO CNRS, Tours, France; [Mirza, Daniel] CEPII, Paris, France; [Mirza, Daniel] Banque France, Paris, France",University College Dublin; University of Ljubljana; KU Leuven; University of Ljubljana; University of Jyvaskyla; Paris School of Economics; Universite de Tours; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Haller, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.",stefanie.haller@ucd.ie,"Mirza, Daniel/Q-1795-2018","Mirza, Daniel/0000-0002-0685-2939; Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174; Kaitila, Ville/0000-0002-9050-3431",,,,,21,17,17,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Entrepreneurs in new firms but also in incumbent firms have a key role in local, regional and national economic development by taking risks to get things done by developing new combinations of ideas and/or doing things differently. In view of this, two of the main questions that are dealt with are: (1) which features make structural differences in institutions and innovation networks remain invariant between decades, and (2) how knowledge about such features can be employed in policy at the national and the regional level. The research questions highlighted in this special issue relate to many pertinent national and regional policy issues.

The empirical model is estimated for the panel of 21 OECD countries during the period 1975-2012. Apart from the previous studies, this study utilizes the advanced panel causality approach, which allows both cross-sectional dependency and heterogeneity across countries. The findings show that there is bi-directional causality between telecommunications infrastructure and economic growth. In addition to the casual relationship between telecommunications infrastructure and economic growth, this situation also gives way to the feedback effect. Thus, with the interactive impact of the economic growth on telecommunications infrastructure, policies will be much more effective. This seems to suggest that policies aimed at stimulating the OECD economies by accelerating investment in the telecommunications sector may be successful.","[Aytun, Cengiz] Cukurova Univ, Kozan Meslek Yuksekokulu, Finans Bankacilik & Sigortacilik Bolumu, Adana, Turkey; [Akin, Cemil Serhat] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Iktisat Bolumu, Antakya, Turkey",Cukurova University; Mustafa Kemal University,"Aytun, C (通讯作者)，Cukurova Univ, Kozan Meslek Yuksekokulu, Finans Bankacilik & Sigortacilik Bolumu, Adana, Turkey.",cengiza@cu.edu.tr; csakin@mku.edu.tr,"Aytun, Cengiz/AAW-8160-2020","Aytun, Cengiz/0000-0001-5704-0239",,,,,51,3,3,0,11,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Banks receive a risk signal when they exhibit substantially higher (semi-)volatility compared to the best performing bank(s) with similar characteristics, and a valuation signal when they are undervalued relative to the average bank with similar characteristics. We document, using a partial adjustment model, that bank managers adjust the long-term target value of key strategic variables and the speed of adjustment towards those targets following a risk and/or negative valuation signal. We interpret this as evidence of stock market influencing. We show that our results are unlikely to be driven by indirect influencing by regulators, subordinated debtholders, retail or wholesale depositors.

However, these measures present a weakness in that they typically capture aggregate patterns. To address this disadvantage, in this paper, social-based measures to transport exclusion from a media perspective are explored. The objective is to analyze the content of a transport-related blog initiated by a local newspaper in the city of Cali, Colombia to determine if any potential indicators of social exclusion can be gleaned from this source. A two-step content analysis is performed on the entries to determine if indicators are present that may be a current source of exclusion, or that may potentially cause individuals to exclude themselves from the system. Findings reveal that bloggers made reference to geographic, time, and fear-based exclusionary dimensions, as well as personal and societal. Such a forum thus holds the potential to inform policy makers of enhancements that can be made to the system that help make it more socially inclusive. The study is unique in its developing country setting where public participation in transport planning is rare. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Chronic joblessness has meant that many young, unemployed adults remain in the parental home. However, their productive labor is often not utilized in family farming.

Young, unmarried adults often have limited responsibilities to provide labor or income to the parental home, diminishing the overall viability of small-scale farming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In these periods, borrowing becomes a signal of illiquidity, exposing borrowers to predatory trading and possible insolvency. A stigma of borrowing thus arises, leading distressed banks to take on more illiquid positions than they would otherwise. The Fed's Term Auction Facility (TAF) can alleviate this problem. The TAF's competitive auction format allows auction winners to signal that they are illiquid but relatively strong. The TAF may therefore be an effective policy tool during financial crises: by altering the signal value of borrowing, this facility supports the injection of liquidity into distressed banks. In normal times, however, this auction facility becomes counterproductive: by cream-skimming the relatively strong banks, the weakest banks are left as potential prey for predators. This suggests that the TAF is a policy best reserved for times of crisis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical results support very strong links between the yield curves in the two countries, with the U.S. yield curve accounting for as much as 45 per cent of the variation of the movement in the level and about 30 per cent of the movements in the slope and the curvature of the Canadian yield curve. Canadian yield-curve factors are found to account for about 50 per cent of the variation in output and the monetary policy rate, and about 25 per cent of the variation in inflation, much larger than the yield curve effects found for future developments of the macroeconomies of other countries. A relatively strong bilateral relationship is found to exist between the yield curve and the instrument of monetary policy, supporting recent studies that find the dynamic relationship between the yield curve and the macroeconomy is due to the pivotal role that monetary policy plays in the macroeconomy.

This is particularly relevant in areas served by multiple alternative transportation options at different locations because mode choices in this case can largely modify visitation patterns. This study investigated mode choices in a popular hiking area of the Dolomites (Italian Alps) that is reachable by car, bus, and lifts (i.e. cable car and chairlift). A stated preference survey was used to elicit visitor sensitivities to a series of management and experiential conditions, while simulation was applied to predict mode choice as a consequence of various access policies. While indicating lift as the most preferred transportation option, results suggest the existence of two main kinds of visitor: one preferring road-accessible trailheads and another preferring lift-accessible trailheads. These two kinds seem to reflect a traditional view (i.e., very sensitive to fares, road closures, and overcrowding) and a more modern one (i.e., moderately sensitive to lift fares, relatively insensitive to crowding), respectively. Simulations performed for both groups led to four management principles: road traffic is not reduced significantly without disincentives for car use; overly cheap lift fares are counterproductive; fare-frequency trade-off is key to ensure adequate bus ridership within both groups; and road closures may be comprehensively more effective than road tolls. The findings of this study may support managers and administrators in setting up access policies that better preserve natural resources and visitors' recreational experience. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Crash risk, defined as the conditional skewness of return distribution, captures asymmetry in risk and is important for investment decisions and risk management. If socially responsible firms commit to a high standard of transparency and engage in less bad news hoarding, they would have lower crash risk. However, if managers engage in CSR to cover up bad news and divert shareholder scrutiny, CSR would be associated with higher crash risk. Our findings support the mitigating effect of CSR on crash risk. We find that firms' CSR performance is negatively associated with future crash risk after controlling for other predictors of crash risk. The result holds after we account for potential endogeneity. Moreover, the mitigating effect of CSR on crash risk is more pronounced when firms have less effective corporate governance or a lower level of institutional ownership. The results are consistent with the notion that firms that actively engage in CSR also refrain from bad news hoarding behavior, thus reducing crash risk. This role of CSR is particularly important when governance mechanisms, such as monitoring by boards or institutional investors, are weak. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The former measures are termed carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which we characterize as a low-leverage causative approach, and the latter are termed radiation management (RM), which we characterize as a high-leverage symptomatic approach. There are similarities between CDR and emission control. Accordingly, benefit-cost analysis can be used to assess certain CDR measures. By contrast, high-leverage RM represents a genuinely new option in the climate change response portfolio, at first glance promising insurance against fat-tail climate change risks. However, the persistent intrinsic uncertainties of RM suggest that any cautious climate risk management approach should consider RM as a complement to (rather than a substitute for) emission control at best. Moreover, the complexity of the earth system imposes major limitations on the ability of research to reduce these uncertainties. Thus we argue that a research strategy is needed that focuses on increasing our basic understanding of the earth system and conducting comprehensive assessments of the risk(s) associated with both climate change and the deployment of climate engineering.","[Klepper, Gernot; Rickels, Wilfried] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Klepper, G (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",gernot.klepper@ifw-kiel.de; wilfried.rickels@ifw-kiel.de,"Rickels, Wilfried/H-1706-2013","Rickels, Wilfried/0000-0002-5407-6364",,,,,95,20,20,0,43,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

Such a behavior destroys long-term incentives and hence is costly to outside shareholders. It is recommended that the unloading of incentives can be limited when the firm adopts a minimum executive shareholding policy. We provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of such policies in that respect. Using data for UK FTSE 350 companies we show that executives whose ownership is below the minimum set by the policy retain more newly vesting equity and the incentives to retain shares weaken when the holdings are above the minimum. We also document economic implications of compliance with the policy and we find higher firm valuations when actual ownership increases relative to the minimum holdings required. Our results have implications for the debate on executive remuneration regulations and practices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that when a group's political influence is increasing in its wealth, there is a strategic motive for redistribution: by taking money away from a group, its ability to influence future policy is reduced. Populism arises when the poor respond to this strategic motive, while neo-liberalism results when the rich use their wealth to limit redistribution. Assuming that wealth increases political influence because it enables a group to stage a coup, we find that populism is both more likely and more extreme when the military is biased in favor of the rich. We conclude by discussing the policies of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Alberto Fujimori in Peru in light of our findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An option pricing model is developed to evaluate the expected regulatory cost and predict a nonlinear relationship between regulatory pressure and insurers' risk taking. We then conduct an empirical test using the simultaneous threshold regression. The result shows that there is a threshold effect of regulatory pressure on insurer risk taking. Poorly capitalized insurers seem to be aware of their proximity to regulatory interventions but do not fully respond to the impending regulatory pressure. This implies either regulatory interventions are not costly enough or they are too late, or both.","[Lin, Wen-Chang] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Minxiong, Taiwan; [Lai, Yi-Hsun] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Douliu City, Taiwan; [Powers, Michael R.] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",National Chung Cheng University; National Yunlin University Science & Technology; Tsinghua University,"Lin, WC (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Minxiong, Taiwan.",finwcl@ccu.edu.tw,"Lin, Wen-chang/B-3100-2011; Powers, Michael/HHZ-2334-2022","Lin, Wen-chang/0000-0003-0194-1745;",,,,,34,11,12,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

These results remain robust to changes in estimation techniques in response to varying assumptions on the attitude variable. Assuming endogeneity of the attitude variable, the study estimates happiness and positive attitude equations simultaneously by a two-stage procedure and obtains interesting new results. These results indicate that positive attitude is not only a covariate of happiness, but also a determinant of happiness, especially in the sample of matured adults. To increase the personal happiness therefore the study recommends policies designed to help individuals not only increase their incomes, but also improve their attitudes.","Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Econ & Stat, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA",California State University System; California State University Los Angeles,"Mohanty, MS (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Econ & Stat, 5151 State Univ Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",mmohant@calstatela.edu,,,,,,,67,18,24,0,28,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

We use a difference-in-difference-in-differences strategy to compare older and younger workers, in states with stronger and weaker laws, before, during, and after the Great Recession. We find very little evidence that stronger age discrimination protections helped older workers weather the Great Recession, relative to younger workers. The evidence sometimes points in the opposite direction, with stronger state age discrimination protections associated with more adverse effects of the Great Recession on older workers. We suggest that during an experience such as the Great Recession, severe labor market disruptions make it difficult to discern discrimination, weakening the effects of stronger state age discrimination protections. Alternatively, higher termination costs associated with stronger age discrimination protections may do more to deter hiring when future product and labor demand is highly uncertain.","[Neumark, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Neumark, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA USA; [Neumark, David] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Neumark, David; Button, Patrick] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Neumark, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",dneumark@uci.edu; pbutton@uci.edu,"Button, Patrick/F-7448-2016","Button, Patrick/0000-0001-5414-9730",,,,,32,32,39,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

We consider the literature on information presentation through the theoretical lenses of the Construal Level Theory. We propose and find that providing product-related information in an attribute- rather than an alternative-based way shifts choices. The attribute-based pattern leads to high construal levels and choices driven by desirability-related, high-level attributes (e.g., design). But when the same information is acquired following the alternative-based pattern, it leads to low construal levels and choices driven by feasibility-related, low-level attributes (e.g., price). As a consequence, choice shares for products whose strength lies in convenience and other feasibility-related features are boosted by the presentation of alternative-based information. Conversely, choice shares for products whose strength lies in design and other desirability-related features are increased by the presentation of attribute-based information. We further find that consumers acquiring information in an alternative-based way envision consumption much closer in the future than those acquiring information in an attribute-based way. Finally, we find that attribute-based information leads to more clicking. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Although this assumption is a reasonable one for a great many commodities, it is less so for more perishable goods, especially food. In an attempt to develop this insight further, this article argues that transport geography needs to pay more attention to the relationship between space-time processes and the physical properties of goods in transit.

Based on Mundlak's formulation our model accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and differentiates within-individual from between-individual variation. With respect to household composition, we find that living with a partner and having a child under six years old is negatively associated with the likelihood of using public transport for family visits. Number of children is not associated linearly with mode choice. Walking and cycling is mainly associated with distance between family members: the shorter the distance the higher the likelihood of using slow-modes instead of a car. Those travelling between areas of high degree of urbanization have a higher likelihood of using public transport relative to using cars. Car ownership is negatively associated with all other modes. Using a car for commuting is also found to be negatively associated with other modes for family visits. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using Credit Default Swaps market data, which reflects the risk, markets attribute to banks, we calculate the default probabilities of banks over one, two, and three year periods. These results are then regressed with financial values such as total assets, total shareholders' equity and net income. Subsequently, the study is extended and the regression analysis repeated using Return on Assets as dependent variable. We find that markets place emphasis on profitability rather than size when pricing the riskiness of a bank. We conclude that the well-known concept of 'Too Big to Fail' cannot be considered as a concept with much validity, but the phrase 'Too Profitable to Fail' may provide a more accurate assessment of the situation.","[Binatli, Ayla Ogus] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, TR-35330 Izmir, Turkey",Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,,drarslan@ziraatbank.com.tr; ayla.ogus@ieu.edu.tr,"binatli, ayla ogus/AAD-1794-2019; binatli, ayla ogus/A-2699-2013","binatli, ayla ogus/0000-0002-8291-0010;",,,,,23,0,0,0,13,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We provide empirical evidence on the direct and indirect channels via which importing more varieties of intermediate inputs increases export scope: (1) imported inputs may enhance productivity and thereby help the firm to overcome export fixed costs (the indirect productivity channel); (2) low-priced imported inputs may boost expected export revenue (the direct-cost channel); and (3) importing intermediate inputs may reduce export fixed costs by providing the quality/technology required in demanding export markets (the quality/technology channel). We use firm-level data on imports at the product (HS6) level provided by French Customs for the 1996-2005 period, and distinguish the origin of imported inputs (developing vs. developed countries) in order to disentangle the different productivity channels above. Regarding the indirect effect, imported inputs raise productivity, and thereby exports, both through greater complementarity of inputs and technology/quality transfer. Controlling for productivity, imports of intermediate inputs from developed and developing countries also have a direct impact on the number of exported varieties. Both quality/technology and price channels are at play. These findings are robust to specifications that explicitly deal with potential reverse causality between imported inputs and export scope.","[Bas, Maria] Sci Po, F-75007 Paris, France; [Bas, Maria] CEPII, F-75007 Paris, France; [Strauss-Kahn, Vanessa] ESCP Europe, F-75011 Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Bas, M (通讯作者)，Sci Po, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.",maria.bas@sciences-po.org; vstrauss-kahn@escpeurope.eu,,,,,,,63,133,144,3,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

But firms may also need external finance to shoulder the costs of entering foreign markets. We develop a model of multinational firms facing real and financial barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI), and we analyze their impact on the FDI decision. Theoretically, we show that financial constraints can affect highly productive firms more than firms with low productivity because the former are more likely to expand abroad. We provide empirical evidence based on a detailed dataset of German domestic and multinational firms which contains information on parent-level financial constraints as well as on the location the foreign affiliates. We find that financial factors constrain firms' foreign investment decisions, an effect felt in particular by firms most likely to consider investing abroad. The locational information in our dataset allows exploiting cross-country differences in contract enforcement. Consistent with theory, we find that poor contract enforcement in the host country has a negative impact on FDI decisions.","[Buch, Claudia M.] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Germany; [Buch, Claudia M.] Univ Magdeburg, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany; [Kesternich, Iris] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Lipponer, Alexander] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Schnitzer, Monika] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80799 Munich, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Otto von Guericke University; University of Munich; Deutsche Bank; University of Munich,"Schnitzer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany.",schnitzer@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,"Kesternich, Iris/0000-0001-9265-6573",,,,,37,52,63,3,56,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

In this paper we examine if this is also the case for transfers from regional to central governments in the context of the German fiscal equalization system. We examine the factors that contribute to differences in tax revenues across German states. The evidence indicates that both fiscal incentives and political factors can explain these differences, although in Germany the former are more important. Moreover, accounting for fiscal institutions has important consequences for the empirical assessment of political influences on taxation. Overall we find that the political affiliation of the state governor is an important factor in explaining differences in state tax revenues. Thus, the right-wing party (CDU/CSU) is effective in relaxing the tax burden at the state level. In contrast, partisan alignment between the state government and the federal government loses its importance once fiscal conditions enter the empirical model.","[Herwartz, Helmut] Univ Gottingen, Inst Stat & Econometr, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus, Spain; [Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Reus, Spain",University of Gottingen; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Theilen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Av Univ 1, Reus, Spain.",HHerwartz@uni-goettingen.de; bernd.theilen@urv.es,"Theilen, Bernd/Z-1589-2019","Theilen, Bernd/0000-0001-7141-2780",,,,,32,10,11,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2014,159.0,1-2,,,,,121,139,,10.1007/s11127-012-0031-0,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AD3OX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333156600009,0

More specifically, we explored mindset effects on decision makers' confidence ratings, risk preferences, and susceptibility to anchoring effects. As earlier research on mindsets showed that individual differences sometimes moderate mindset effects, we also tested for interaction effects of mindset and gender. For confidence ratings, we found a main effect of mindset and a main effect of gender. For risk preferences and anchoring effects, mindset interacted with gender. When being in an implemental mindset, the judgments of female decision makers came closer to their actual performance compared to being in a deliberative mindset where they were observed as underconfident. Male decision makers were already overconfident in the deliberative mindset and showed even more overconfidence when being in an implemental mindset. Concerning risk attitudes it was found that female decision makers were more prone to choose the less risky, but also less profitable option (in terms of expected payoffs) when they were in the deliberative compared to the implemental mindset. For men the opposite effects were observed. When investigating anchoring effects, male but not female participants' judgments were influenced by mindset: In an implemental mindset, male participants followed an irrelevant anchor more strongly (i.e., made more anchor-consistent judgments) compared to being in a deliberative mindset.

This article shows that job turnover and firm growth vary systematically across firm size groups and that smaller firms do indeed make an important contribution to new job creation. There is a significant caveat, however; we find that it is not firm size per se that is driving these results but rather firm age. We show that younger firms are consistently more dynamic than older firms. We also find a strong inverse relationship between employment growth and size for young firms, but this declines very markedly for older age groups. This provides some support for the Gibrat's law prediction that size and growth are independent, but only once the firm has moved beyond the start-up stage.","Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Lawless, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",martina.lawless@centralbank.ie,,"Lawless, Martina/0000-0002-3484-8670",,,,,22,63,79,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

However, the use of the automobile is still widely accepted and even vindicated among a high number of citizens. Solving this social dilemma requires analysing the reasons behind private transport use along with the perceptions of its users. This paper examines the individual motivations for using private transport to reach the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB); a single suburban node inside Barcelona's Metropolitan Region. We used data gathered by the Mobility Survey of the UAB to measure the use of private transport and to select a group with homogeneous characteristics for which we could perform qualitative analysis based on in-depth interviews. The analysis was focused on university staff (teaching, researchers and administrative) the university group which is using the private transport the most. Qualitative methodology identified three main stages of travel by private car upon which interviewees projected their perceptions. A strong link between car commuting and social status was revealed but unlike other studies, on this case users were compelled to use private transport because of their social standing, and not as a way to progress. Finally, time travel and convenience were also found significant but always in relation with social position. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We study one particular IEA-the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. In this special case we do have data prior to the agreement, enabling us to identify the treaty's effects using annual bilateral waste shipments among countries before and after one of the trading partners ratifies the agreement.

This trend has particularly affected low-income families. At the same time, owners of thousands of privately owned, publicly subsidized rental housing units have left, or opted out, of subsidy programs across the country. The efforts of local governments to preserve these properties as affordable housing are handicapped by a lack of understanding of the underlying factors that drive owners' decisions to opt out. This paper employs a unique dataset on subsidized properties in New York City and uses hazard models to explore why property owners in the Mitchell-Lama program, a New York State affordable housing program, choose to opt out. Our results suggest that properties located in neighborhoods with high property value growth, those with for-profit owners, and those past the affordability restrictions on all subsidies, are more likely to opt out. While our study focuses on Mitchell-Lama properties, the findings have broader implications for properties around the country that receive supply-side rental subsidies.

To do so, I compare how NGOs responded in an unusual case where, from 1999-2003, the Zapatista Movement demanded more say over projects. I compare 77 NG0s, some that dropped out and others that accommodated the movement's demands. I argue that funders' reporting requirements inhibited NGOs from being responsive to beneficiaries. However, living alongside the movement pushed inner-circle NGOs to practice downward accountability to sustain their legitimacy. In turn, horizontal pressure among NGOs influenced organizations further afield, especially those that identified closely with the movement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the experiences with the debt crisis of the 1980s, Russia 1998, Argentina 2001, and Greece 2010 indicate that orderly debt restructurings remain elusive, even with high-powered official intervention. When solvency problems are present, the chances of success increase if official money is lent at the risk-free rate, reflecting its low risk, and if private creditors receive an upfront haircut. The paper examines the obstacles, which include moral hazard, difficulty in distinguishing between solvency and liquidity crises, and the political economy resistance to upfront haircuts.

The distance separating different types of locations plays a crucial role in these interactions. Distance is the major factor that influences the values of interaction intensities. The question is how the intensities decrease with distance, since this decrease is usually not linear. This paper pursues the issues of the shape and parameters of the distance-decay functions based on daily travel-to-work transport movements, taking regional centres in the Czech Republic as the example. First the special distance-decay functions for individual regional centres are presented and discussed, followed by the expression of the universal distance-decay function approximating generally to the traits of the Czech settlement system and the nature of the interaction flows, i.e., travel-to-work. The expression of the universal function is based on the application of two easily accessible variables: population and number of jobs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The model uses consumer theory to construct both food and non-food poverty thresholds and ensures that the poverty line is consistent across regions. Namely, it is of great importance to review a new unique measure for transition countries because there is a lack of statistics and research in these countries because their governments denied the existence of poverty during the socialist years. The methodology developed in this paper is used to illustrate the construction of a poverty threshold and poverty rates in Croatia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Latvia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Slovenia and Russia for the period 2000-2010. The focus on poverty in transition countries was placed in the former Soviet bloc; for that reason, the benchmark country used to illustrate the methodology for the above period was Russia. Because there are considerable differences in the methods used for poverty estimates, as well as insufficient and incomplete statistics, proposal for a new unique measure would serve as a tool for the prompt application of adequate social policies for transition countries.","[Skare, Marinko; Druzeta, Romina Prziklas] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019; Družeta, Romina Pržiklas/X-7993-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692;",,,,,39,5,5,0,11,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,368,389,,,,,,22,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300025,0

I solve a heterogeneous firms model with financial constraints and distortions to the marginal rental-rate of capital, and develop a measure for the intra-industry misallocation of factors of production. The distribution of capital rental rate and two types of firm-level balance sheet characteristics (pledgeability and liquid asset positions) determine the extent of misallocation and industry level total factor productivity (TFP). I calibrate the model using firm-level balance sheet data from seven major industry clusters of the US economy. The counterfactual policy experiments show that weakening the observed balance sheet positions for financially constrained firms leads to a reallocation of production factors from firms with high cost distortions to firms with low cost distortions and cause quantitatively important industry level TFP losses.

These findings suggest that the mechanisms that link inequality to growth are likely to operate differently in different circumstances, an element that may offer important guidelines for both policy makers and researchers.","[Neves, Pedro Cunha] Inst Super Serv Social Porto, P-4460362 Senhora Da Hora, Portugal; [Neves, Pedro Cunha; Tavares Silva, Sandra Maria] CEF UP, Oporto, Portugal; [Neves, Pedro Cunha; Tavares Silva, Sandra Maria] Fac Econ Porto, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Neves, PC (通讯作者)，Inst Super Serv Social Porto, Av Dr Manuel Teixeira Ruela 370, P-4460362 Senhora Da Hora, Portugal.",pedro.neves@isssp.pt,"Silva, Sandra T./M-9110-2019; Neves, Pedro/C-1178-2017","Silva, Sandra T./0000-0002-8843-3999; Neves, Pedro/0000-0001-5103-2799",,,,,60,58,66,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Because of the frictions, firms and workers find themselves in bilateral monopoly positions when determining wages. Although workers are not at each instant perfectly mobile across cities, in the baseline model we assume that workers flows are sufficient to equate expected utility across markets. We use the model to explore the joint determination of wages, unemployment, house prices and city size (or migration). A key role of the model is to clarify conditions under which this type of spatial equilibrium setup can be estimated. We then use U.S. data over the period 1970-2007 to explore the fit and quantitative properties of the model. Our main goal is to highlight forces that influence spatial equilibria at 10-year intervals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Empirical analysis shows that the degree of market power in the Moldavian banking market in the period 2006-2013 followed a slight upward trend. The author estimated results demonstrated a slight decrease in market force in 2008-2009, caused by financial crisis.

Precisely, the timber trade had been challenged the most as till 1989 the state authorities controlled trade and competition was all but absent. This was also reflected in relevant legislation and strategic documents. Accordingly, the transformation process brought besides the general institutional changes also alterations of formal institutions affecting timber trade. One might therefore ask question: which legislation and which strategic documents challenged forestry and wood processing sector between 1989 and 2013? The goal of the proposed paper was to investigate the institutional context in which the timber trade takes place. In particular, the formal institutions were identified and subsequently characterized in respect to timber trade. This all was done with assistance of document characteristics of legislation and strategic documents of Slovakia.","[Dobsinska, Zuzana; Brodrechtova, Yvonne] Tech Univ Zvolen, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,,dobsinska@tuzvo.sk,"Dobsinska, Zuzana/AAE-1399-2020","Dobsinska, Zuzana/0000-0001-7080-8249",,,,,18,0,0,0,1,INT ASSOC ECON & MANAG WOOD PROCESS & FURNITURE MANUF-WOODEMA I A,ZAGREB,"SVETOSIMUNSKA 25, ZAGREB, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-57822-1-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,24,30,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB1BM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340945200004,0

In this paper I look at the different meanings for the concept with a particular focus on individual resilience examined from a psychological perspective. Individual resilience is compared and contrasted with community resilience in an attempt to answer the question, is community resilience greater than the sum of the parts of individual resilience found within that community? In psychology, resilience research has developed from work looking at how people cope with the negative impact of crisis, disaster or trauma. In recent years this psychopathological perspective has been accompanied by an increasing interest in the positive outcomes that can follow trauma. For example families may grow closer following their survival of a traumatic event. This positive perspective would include work done on Post Traumatic Growth (PTG), Benefit Finding (BF), Positive Psychological Change (PCC) and of course psychological resilience. This paper will examine these different facets of resilience from a positive psychology perspective and look at how they may help in understanding the relationship between individual and community resilience. It will also look at how positive psychological interventions may be used to enhance the resilience of individuals and communities. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The cross-sectional empirical evidence for the traditional motivations behind firms paying out (agency, signaling, and taxes) is most persuasive with regard to agency considerations. Studies centered on the May 2003 dividend tax cut confirm that differences in the taxation of dividends and capital gains have only a second-order impact on setting payout policy. None of the three traditional explanations can account for secular changes in how payouts have been made over the past 30 years, during which repurchases have replaced dividends as the prime vehicle for corporate payouts. Other payout motivations, such as changes in compensation practices and management incentives, are better able to explain the observed variation in payout patterns over time than the traditional motivations. The most recent evidence suggests that further insights can be gained from viewing payout decisions as an integral part of a firm's larger financial ecosystem, with important implications for financing, investment, and risk management.","[Farre-Mensa, Joan] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Michaely, Roni] Cornell Univ, Samuel Curtis Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Michaely, Roni] Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC Herzliya, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel; [Schmalz, Martin] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Harvard University; Cornell University; Reichman University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Farre-Mensa, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",jfarremensa@hbs.edu; rm34@cornell.edu; schmalz@umich.edu,,,,,,,11,118,129,5,46,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4806-9,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

The student samples for this study were collected from an online travel diary survey conducted by Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan. The ArcGIS Network Analyst was used to construct spatial network datasets and reconstruct trajectories from the origin-destination trip dataset. In addition, line densities of estimated trajectories were calculated and displayed on maps for geovisualization. These maps helped us understand the precise locations of congestion and spatial patterns of student commuting, unlike linear representations of people's movements that connect origins and destinations. Our study also showed that estimated trajectories can simulate quantitative impacts on travel time by promoting walking or the use of public transportation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, the literature on aid for trade (AfT) has often neglected the fact that exporters in the donor countries may be among the main beneficiaries. We simultaneously estimate and compare the effects of AfT on trade in both directions. We find that AfT increases recipient exports to donors as well as recipient imports from donors. The first effect tends to dominate the latter, which contradicts the sceptical view that donors grant AfT primarily to promote their own export interests.","[Huehne, Philipp] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Hamburg, Germany; [Meyer, Birgit] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University; University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Nunnenkamp, P (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",peter.nunnenkamp@ifw-kiel.de,,"Meyer, Birgit Elisabeth/0000-0003-4883-7937",,,,,30,63,67,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

To achieve our goal we have employed the directional output distance function in addition to the Lagrangian function that allows the specification of an optimal production plan for each non-life insurance system. At the beginning, based on a sample of 175 non-life insurance companies, dispersed in nine European countries over the period 20022008, we have estimated the parameter of our stochastic technology frontier. Then, we have used the Lagrangian function and its attached conditions to assess an optimal profit level for each non life insurance system based on the market prices of inputs and outputs. From optimal quantity of inputs, desirable outputs and undesirable outputs determined in our model we have proposed inefficiency indices for profit and production factors. Our results show that owners of European non-life insurance companies are under-paid because these companies have the possibility to attain a bigger level of profit efficiency while changing their production plan. While trying to search the sources of this profit inefficiency we find that European non life insurance companies sustain additional charges in their operating expenses and they have to enhance both equity and debt capitals.

The past decade saw little change in the general behaviour of smallholder farmers, and the stumbling blocks faced by smallholder farmers who want to participate in commercial agri-food chains. A possible reason may be that researchers tend to focus on the current behaviour and performance of the farmers while neglecting the influence of the incentive structure on their behaviour. The aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that allows for a more holistic analysis of farmers and their value chains to better understand the reasons underlying current behaviour, and to identify potential solutions to change the behaviour of the farmers and relevant role-players to better match the requirements for successfully participating in competitive agri-food chains. The integrated value chain, New Institutional Economics - Structure-Conduct-Performance framework, does allow for a comprehensive analysis of the incentive structure embedded in the social, physical and institutional environment within which the farmers operate. Special attention is also awarded to the relationship between the farmers and their buyers to identify the appropriate coordination strategy that will minimise transaction costs.","[Jordaan, Henry; Grove, Bennie] Univ Orange Free State, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Backeberg, Gerhard R.] Water Resource Commiss, ZA-0031 Pretoria, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Jordaan, H (通讯作者)，Univ Orange Free State, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",,"Jordaan, Henry/AAF-8722-2019; Grove, Bennie/E-5395-2015","Jordaan, Henry/0000-0003-4845-1727; Grove, Bennie/0000-0002-5325-2637",Water Research Commission (WRC),Water Research Commission (WRC),"The paper is based on research conducted as part of a solicited research project, Assessment of the contribution of water use to value chains in agriculture (Jordaan and Grove, 2012), that was initiated, managed and funded by the Water Research Commission (WRC).

By adding long-term bond futures to the information set of inflation-indexed and nominal bonds, inflation risk is measured as an incremental time-varying covariance obtained from a trivariate GARCH model with dynamic conditional correlations (DCC). The time-varying inflation risk premium and inflation expectations are extracted from the breakeven yield using the risk premium obtained from the previous step. We find that the risk premium has been decreasing over the sample period, with an average value of 87 basis points. The estimated long-run inflation expectations suggest that credibility has been improving over the period of inflation targeting policy, and are in line with the role of inflation targeting policy in anchoring expectations.

Therefore, this paper presents a conceptual framework between health care and globalization based on the works of David Woodward and Nick Drager, with the purpose to serve as a guideline for the synthesis of existing papers in this field, as well as the search for new cognitions, which can ultimately contribute to the development of national policies on health. When we talk about the conceptual framework, then by all means we need to pay attention to the indirect effects on health, as well as the direct impact on the population on the level of individual risk factors on health and the health care system as a whole.

The pressure of high unemployment, especially high youth unemployment is growing.

VET is designed to enable participants to develop practical skills and understanding needed to find employment in a particular occupation. It is at the core of Europe's response to the economic crisis and is an essential part of the Europe 2020 strategy. In Europe, about half of all jobs require a medium level qualification, primarily acquired through VET. There is no single European VET system. It is very diverse with the variations in systems, providers, regions and sectors. Croatia is involved in VET modernization through new regulations in order to speed up the process of change.

The parsimonious model is flexible enough to accommodate the behavior of both caps and swaptions. For the joint estimation we use a comprehensive data set spanning the financial crisis of 2007-2010.

Since inferences from prior studies may be confounded by research design choices, we use the quantile regression (QR) approach and assess the hidden non-monotonic relations between dispersion and stock returns within a broader sample. The empirical results show that dispersion is negatively associated with subsequent stock returns when the latter is in lower quantiles. In contrast, when the stock returns are in high quantiles, dispersion is positively associated with subsequent stock returns. Moreover, the association between dispersion and stock returns is trivial when the mid-range return quantiles are concerned. These non-uniform connections between dispersion and stock returns reflect the different status of overpricing correction process. Our findings help to reconcile the mixed results reported by prior research concerning the relation between analysts' forecast dispersion and subsequent stock returns.","[Li, Ming-Yuan (Leon)] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Wu, Jyong-Sian] Yuanta Secur Investment Banking Dept, Taipei, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; Yuanta Financial,"Li, MY (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Management, Dept Accountancy, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",lmyleon@mail.ncku.edu.tw,"Li, Leon/H-9013-2016","Li, Leon/0000-0002-2865-6568",,,,,39,17,18,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

We find that the Romanian mutual funds managed under banking sector have defined the trend of the mutual find market.

We define extreme sells as ask quotes that involve large percentages of total depth, selling orders executed at prices much closer to bids than to asking prices, and consecutive sell-initiated trades. Sell trades tend to demand higher liquidity than buys, while extreme trading conditions demand more liquidity than non-extreme ones. In extreme sells, liquidity demand surpasses supply. We show that asymmetric liquidity (quote demand vs. supply) better explains the asymmetric volatility observed in high-frequency data than trade information does. Ask-depth share plays a dominant role in asymmetric volatility, while order flow (sell-initiated volume share) makes a far smaller contribution.

Economic growth has been solid, inflation has been contained and government finances have strengthened. Indonesia weathered the global financial crisis better than many countries, and it subsequently benefited from the low global interest rates resulting from highly stimulatory monetary conditions in many advanced economies, especially the US.In the middle of 2013, however, speculation on when the US Federal Reserve would begin to unwind its program of quantitative easing saw global interest rates jump. Short-term capital flowed out of Indonesia, causing the stock market to fall, the currency to depreciate and interest rates to rise. On top of this, GDP growth appeared to be slowing, the trade balance worsening and inflation increasing. In late September and October, the failure of the US to raise its legislated debt ceiling led to speculation that it might fail to meet some of its debt obligations, which fuelled financial-market volatility.It is yet to be seen whether the Indonesian economy and its financial markets are sufficiently flexible to make a smooth transition to the new external reality. The policy tools available to the government to deal with the short-term economic challenges are limited: it introduced an economic policy package in August, and Bank Indonesia (BI) raised official interest rates in August and September, following two increases earlier in the year.These pressures from global financial markets have drawn attention to the need for further structural reforms in Indonesia, including those aimed at deepening financial markets, strengthening financial-sector supervision, freeing up trade and encouraging competition, and maintaining the government's revenue base in the face of falling commodity prices. While some reforms, particularly in financial-sector supervision, are already in train, it may be difficult for Indonesia to make serious gains on longer-term economic reforms before the 2014 presidential elections.","[Allford, Jason] The Treasury, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Soejachmoen, Moekti P.] TNP2K, Jakarta, Indonesia",,"Allford, J (通讯作者)，The Treasury, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

When the central bank (CB) cannot pay interest, away from the zero lower bound its (real) balance sheet is limited by the demand for money. Furthermore, if securities are not marked to market and the central bank holds its bonds to maturity, it is impossible for the CB to make losses, and it always obtains profits from being a monopoly provider of money. When the option of paying interest on liabilities is allowed, the limit on the CB's balance sheet is lifted. In this case, the CB is free to take on interest-rate risk - for example, by buying long-term securities and financing those purchases with short-term debt that pays the market interest rate. This is a risky enterprise that can lead to additional profits but also to losses. To the extent that losses exceed the profits of the monopoly operations, the CB faces two options: either it is recapitalised by Treasury or it increases its monopoly profits by raising the inflation tax.","[Bassetto, Marco] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Bassetto, Marco; Messer, Todd] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA",University of London; University College London; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Bassetto, M (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",m.bassetto@ucl.ac.uk; todd.messer@chi.frb.org,,"Bassetto, Marco/0000-0001-8325-8450",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,21,11,11,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

These results imply that cost-effectiveness analysis using a fixed monetary value per LYM is not consistent with economic welfare theory and that the benefit of a health improvement cannot be calculated by multiplying the change in a LYM by a constant.","[Hammitt, James K.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Risk Anal, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hammitt, James K.] Toulouse Sch Econ, LERNA, INRA, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Harvard University; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Hammitt, JK (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Ctr Risk Anal, 718 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jkh@harvard.edu,,,,,,,55,40,40,2,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

This is the first empirical study which sheds light on the extent and magnitude of the association among these financial markets used by the Granger causality test of Toda and Yamamoto (1995), generalized impulse response approach, and generalized variance decomposition in a multivariate setting. Our empirical results illustrate that there are indeed various patterns of dynamic relationships. The direction of causality appears to differ across countries. While investigating these interactive relationships under unexpected shocks, there is a one-way significant influence between the life insurance premium and long-run interest fate. These empirical findings serve as valuable applications not only for investors to diversify their risk away as well as to earn the abnormal return, but also for policy-makers to allocate resources more efficiently.

Most evaluations select sites purposively following a process that is nonrandom. Unfortunately, purposive site selection can produce a sample of sites that is not representative of the population of interest for the program. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model of purposive site selection. We begin with the proposition that a purposive sample of sites can usefully be conceptualized as a random sample of sites from some well-defined population, for which the sampling probabilities are unknown and vary across sites. This proposition allows us to derive a formal, yet intuitive, mathematical expression for the bias in the pooled impact estimate when sites are selected purposively. This formula helps us to better understand the consequences of selecting sites purposively, and the factors that contribute to the bias. Additional research is needed to obtain evidence on how large the bias tends to be in actual studies that select sites purposively, and to develop methods to increase the external validity of these studies.

We employ the Swiss Economic Institute's Monetary Policy Communicator to measure the future stance of the European Central Bank's monetary policy. Our results indicate, first, that communication has an influence on inflation (expectations) similar to that of actual target rate changes. Communication also plays a noticeable role in the transmission of monetary policy to output. Consequently, future work on monetary policy transmission should incorporate both a short-term interest rate and a communication indicator. A second finding is that the monetary policy transmission mechanism changed during the financial crisis as the overall effect of monetary policy on (expected) inflation and output is weaker and of shorter duration during this period compared to the overall sample period.

Our results show that risk-weighted assets (the regulatory measure of portfolio risk, which determines minimum capital requirements) are ill-calibrated to a market measure of bank portfolio risk. We show that this low-risk sensitivity of capital requirements permits banks to build up capital buffers by underreporting their portfolio risk and undermines banks' ability to withstand adverse shocks.

This paper finds similarly small renegotiation rates for securitized loans and loans held on banks' balance sheets that become seriously delinquent, in particular during the early part of the financial crisis. We argue that information issues endemic to home mortgages, where lenders negotiate with large numbers of borrowers, lead to barriers in renegotiation.

One explanation for this trend emphasizes the importance of congressional redistricting. This paper analyzes the relationship between political polarization and redistricting in the context of two trade liberalization bills. The results of the paper indicate that redistricting has not contributed significantly to party polarization over trade policy although it has produced a partisan shift in favor of trade liberalization. Redistricting does not appear to impact political polarization largely because district-level characteristics currently are dominated by broader, national factors such as party affiliation. The results of the paper clearly demonstrate this point by showing that changes in party affiliation have a much greater impact on voting behavior than changes in district characteristics. The paper also finds, however, that institutional control of the redistricting process at the state level has influenced political polarization with respect to trade policy.","Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA",Lafayette College,"DeVault, JM (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",devaultj@lafayette.edu,,,,,,,19,3,3,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2013,157.0,1-2,,,,,207,221,,10.1007/s11127-012-9938-8,0.0,,,15,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,213WI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324090700013,0

Tobit regression was used to estimate the determinants of MSE participation in tourism, as well as the proportion of products purchased by hotels from MSEs. The results indicated that older, larger MSEs and those that were members of associations were more likely to participate in tourism. The determinants of hotel procurement from MSEs included age of the hotel, bed capacity, and management characteristics.

However little research has been undertaken looking at the views and attitudes of those making the mobility decisions, namely the parents and care givers with the responsibility for getting children 'from A to B'. This paper presents the results of 25 in-depth interviews which were undertaken with parents in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing mode choice, more specifically whether scope exists to achieve modal shift from car to rail for long distance journeys with young children. The key findings indicate that whilst mode choice is made predominantly for reasons relating to convenience, the way in which travel time is utilised and experienced during long distance journeys indicates considerable scope to attract more families to rail. This is however contingent on the employment of more family-focussed marketing and 'child friendly' initiatives on the part of the rail industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We explore this issue by presenting the results of two related analyses that suggest positive answers on both counts. First, we apply reference class weights to unique data on adult capabilities in the UK and show that relative weights vary across some groupings. Furthermore, in some cases, deprivation rankings of groups vary depending on which weights are used. Second, we explore possible behavioural consequences of different weights by examining the extent to which groups respond differently to three economic and social shocks (unemployment, widowhood and ill health). In this case, we find that weights and responses vary noticeably with age and region and sometimes with gender. We conclude that whilst equal weighting may be practically unavoidable when constructing indices of welfare in the absence of information on weights, their estimation from survey or experimental data is likely to be justified and may change views about policy needs or efficacy.","[Anand, Paul] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Anand, Paul] London Sch Econ, Ctr Philosophy Nat & Social Sci, London, England",University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,,luna.bellani@ceps.lu; wmgh@talktalk.net; p.anand@open.ac.uk,"Bellani, Luna/AAM-5873-2020","Anand, Paul/0000-0002-7701-6903",ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,17,3,3,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Since the legislature must typically authorize new debt, divided government can make these fiscal rules credible.

Using data collected fromChina's maize farmers, we find that households with debt, in general, sell their maize much earlier than debt-free households, thus potentially losing inter-temporal arbitrage opportunities. Segmenting our sample into wealthy and poor households, we find that the relationship between a liquidity constraint and postharvest sales is apparent only among poor households. Using the occurrence of an illness in children or an elderly household member as an instrument for liquidity, we control for potential endogeneity associated with liquidity.

A substantial number of papers provide estimations of average treatment on the treated effect for insured persons. We summarize papers that correct for the problem of self-selection into insurance and papers that estimate the average intention to treat effect. Summarizing the literature was difficult because of the lack of (1) uniformity in the use of meaningful definitions of outcomes that indicate welfare improvements and (2) clarity in the consideration of selection issues. We find the uptake of insurance schemes, in many cases, to be less than expected. In general, we find no strong evidence of an impact on utilization, protection from financial risk, and health status. However, a few insurance schemes afford significant protection from high levels of out-of-pocket expenditures. In these cases, however, the impact on the poor is weaker.

Overall, we find that the USA net fiscal stimulus was modest relative to peers, despite it being the epicenter of the crisis, and having access to relatively cheap funding of its twin deficits. Of the 28 countries in the sample, the USA is ranked among the bottom third in terms of the rate of expansion of consolidated government consumption and investment expenditures. Contrary to historical experience, emerging markets had strongly countercyclical policy during the period immediately preceding the Great Recession and the Great Recession itself. Federal unions, emerging markets and countries with very high gross domestic product (GDP) growth during the pre-recession period saw larger net fiscal stimulus on average than their counterparts.

We explore this make or buy decision in the offshoring context when offshore input production involves costly technology transfer. The burden of technology transfer cost that falls on the sourcing firm depends not only on the technological complexity of the offshored input but also on the mode of organizing offshoring. Outsourcing entails low technology transmission cost but a higher distortion in input production by the arm's length supplier while vertical FDI involves a higher technology transmission cost but a lower distortion in input production by the affiliated supplier.

However, not all German banking institutions necessarily face fierce competition. Because the industry is highly fragmented, strict separation of the three existing banking pillars may impede competition, with negative effects on financial stability. We assess the competitive stances of 1,888 universal banks from 2001 to 2009 by using the Panzar-Rosse revenue test. We find evidence that measuring competition at an average country level does not necessarily generate valid evaluations of fragmented markets. In addition, we find no clear indication that either the particular objectives of cooperative and savings banks or the legal protection of these institutions impedes competition or discriminates against private banks. Therefore, as long as the relationship between competition and financial stability is dubious, the overall effect and the social costs or benefits of political measures that influence the structure of the German banking market are at least questionable.

This suggests that key variables pertaining to their markets, including their exchange rates, will be marked by greater likelihood of extreme observations and large fluctuations. We focus on the hypothesis that compared to developed country exchange rates, emerging country exchange rates will be more pronouncedly heavy-tailed. We find support for the hypothesis using recently proposed robust tail index estimation methods which, in particular, perform well under heavy-tailed dependent GARCH processes that are often used for modeling exchange rates. According to the estimation results reported in the paper, variances may be infinite for several emerging country exchange rates. Tail index values zeta = p is an element of (2.6,2.8) appear to be at the dividing boundary between the two sets of countries: while the moments of order p is an element of (2.6,2.8) are finite for most of the developed country exchange rates, they may be (or are) infinite for most of the emerging country exchange rates. We also study the impact of the on-going financial and economic crisis, and find that heavy-tailedness properties of most exchange rates did not change significantly with the onset of the crisis. At the same time, some foreign exchange markets have experienced structural changes in their heavy-tailedness properties during the crisis. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Such factors are approximately linear functions of the sorted portfolios, and including them into regressions adds linear restrictions on the intercepts. These restrictions mechanically reduce significance of the time-series regression intercepts, increase the regression R-2, and lead to a good fit in the cross-sectional regressions. Our simulation evidence confirms these propositions. Moreover, we show that popular size and value factors do not work in the sets of asset portfolios, which they are not mechanically related to. These results cast doubt on the interpretation of characteristics-sorted factors as the true risk factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike in the USA, there are no guidelines for transportation planners in coping with post-disaster situations in Japan. There is a substantive literature on institutions, concepts of urban sustainability and resilience, community engagement and travel behavioral adjustments to natural disasters and man-made disruptions to transportation supply in the emergency phase but only limited research into travel demand modeling in the recovery phase. This paper focuses on the recovery phase - and constructs conceptual and operational demand and supply models for the recovery phase to help seek options for more sustainable outcome. The methodology is applied to the city of Ishinomaki, Japan, one of the many regional communities devastated by the March, 2011 earthquake and tsunami where only limited capacity and data are available. Future hypothetical scenarios for the city are analyzed to illustrate the potential practicality of the proposed methodology with the indicators of travel performance of the scenarios in the case study area. The paper concludes with implication to planning, including the full re-location of peninsular villages, and further research needs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Its aim is modest: to investigate whether the analysis of the Indian economy by the underground Communist Party of India (Maoist), or the Naxalites, maps on to agrarian transformations in the heart of their revolutionary struggle, in one of their guerrilla zones in Jharkhand. The Maoist concern with the agrarian question is shown to be first and foremost an issue of politics, determining their strategy and tactics; the question of identifying who is the enemy', who to form alliances with and how to progress the struggle. A principal contradiction is established by the Maoists as being that between feudalism and the masses. Analysing the political economy of the hills and forests of Jharkhand, this paper reveals first how feudal relations were not established there. Second, it shows the persistence of non-capitalist relations of production in farming. And, third, it illuminates the emergence of class differentiation through processes that bypass the development of capitalism in agriculture. The argument is that it is the modern state itself that has played a crucial role in these slow processes of class differentiation in the Adivasi-dominated hills and forests of India. Analysing the agrarian transition in this guerrilla zone, this paper offers a critical analysis of Maoist strategy and tactics.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Shah, A (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.m.shah@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,62,31,31,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The MFD is an empirically observed relationship between traffic flow and traffic density at the level of an urban region, including hypercongestion, where flow decreases as density increases. This approach is consistent with the physics of traffic and allows the parsimonious modeling of intra-day traffic dynamics and their connection with city size, land use and network characteristics. The MFD can accurately measure the inefficiency of land and network resource allocation due to hypercongestion, in contrast with existing models of congestion. The findings reinforce the 'compact city' hypothesis, by favoring a larger mixed-use core area with greater zone width, block density and number of lanes, compared to the peripheral area. They also suggest a new set of policies, including the optimization of perimeter controls and the fraction of land for transport, which constitute robust second-best optimal strategies that can further reduce congestion externalities.

Not much research attention has been paid to the social aspect of the living environment, which may impact activity-travel decision making or be an important mediating factor for the built environment. This paper makes an attempt to fill the gap by simultaneously considering the built and social environment in studying their impacts on activity-travel behavior. Using the sample data from an activity-travel diary survey conducted in Hong Kong in 2010, this study employs a structural equations model to investigate the effects of built and social environments on social contacts and activity-travel behavior in time allocation between in-home and out-of-home activities, trip generation and travel time. The study reveals that people living in public and private housing in Hong Kong have significantly different built and social environments, and that built environments significantly determine social environments and exert significant influences on social contacts and activity-travel behavior.
