Several authors have developed specialized solutions algorithms to solve these models under rational expectations. We demonstrate that it is also possible to implement this class of models in Dynare-a widely used software package for solving dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Using the Dynare macro language one can easily construct and change the required large number of lagged expectation terms. We assess the accuracy of simulations run with different truncation points for the lagged expectations terms and find that the solution is reasonably precise even for moderate truncation points.,"[Verona, Fabio] Bank Finland, Monetary Policy & Res Dept, Helsinki, Finland; [Verona, Fabio] Univ Porto, CEF UP, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Wolters, Maik H.] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Wolters, Maik H.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Bank of Finland; Universidade do Porto; University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Verona, F (通讯作者)，Bank Finland, Monetary Policy & Res Dept, Helsinki, Finland.",fabio.verona@bof.fi; maik.wolters@ifw-kiel.de,,"Verona, Fabio/0000-0003-2722-8462",,,,,16,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Using the GPN framework, we focus on the role of the national state as an active inter-scalar mediator in the dynamic strategic coupling process between global leading firms and local actors in globalizing regional development. We argue that the role of the national state as an inter-scalar mediator was crucial in coordinating localized growth factors with globalizing external factors to create and develop the LCD industry. This was achievable because of the legacy of the developmental state and the top-down implementation of policy in South Korea. Using the idea of the inter-scalar mediator, we specify the role of the state as a container of laws and practices and as a constructor of regional innovation systems to globalize regional development in the context of a centripetal society. A multi-strategy approach, which included one month of participatory observation, in-depth interviews and secondary data collection, was adopted in order to enhance the validity and reliability of the data.","[Lee, Yong-Sook] Korea Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Heo, Inhye] Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Hyungjoo] Sci & Technol Policy Inst, Seoul, South Korea","Korea University; Korea University; Science & Technology Policy Institute (STEPI), Republic of Korea","Lee, YS (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Heo, Inhye/GWM-4465-2022","Heo, Inhye/0000-0002-5424-1710",,,,,36,31,37,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The evidence is carefully chosen to show how safety nets have the potential to overcome constraints on growth linked to market failures, and is organized into four distinct pathways: i) encouraging asset accumulation by changing incentives and by addressing imperfections in financial markets caused by constraints in obtaining credit, and from information asymmetries; overcoming such failures helps households to invest into their human capital or productive assets; ii) failures in insurance markets especially in low income setting; safety nets are assisting in managing risk both ex post and ex ante; iii) safety nets are overcoming failure to create assets and other local economy complementary factors to household-level investments; iv) safety nets are shown to relax political constraints on policy. Safety nets have a dual objective of directly alleviating poverty through transfers to the poor and of triggering higher growth for the poor. However, the trade-off between the dual objectives of equity and growth is not eliminated by the potential for productive safety nets; this remains critical for designing social policies.","[Alderman, Harold] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Yemtsov, Ruslan] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); The World Bank,"Alderman, H (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",h.alderman@cgiar.org; ryemtsov@worldbank.org,,,,,,,89,33,35,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

It was built at the initiative of its most prominent bishop, Josip JurajStrossmayer (1849-1905). The blueprint for the Cathedral was ordered from Karl Rosner, a famous Viennese architect, who signed a construction contract on 17 April 1866. Although it had been planned to build the Cathedral within a five-year period, the construction lasted until 1882, and the Cathedral was consecrated on 1 November of the same year. Early severe damage to the Cathedral was inflicted by the earthquake in 1884. Its renewal began in 1933 after more destruction caused by the fire on the choir of the Cathedral. At the beginning of World War II, the Cathedral suffered minor damage but this was followed by massive destruction in the last year of the war, 1945, when serious damage was incurred to the roof and facade. Essential repairs were carried out after the War (truss, glass rose windows), whereas other repairs were indefinitely suspended in the next 15 years due to a lack of financial means. They were resumed thanks to bishopStjepanBauerlein, who turned to the Cathedral Chapter for help in finding means for vital repairs. In line with financial resources available some repairs were made in the next three years, but in 1964 both the Cathedral and the whole of Dakovo region were struck by a new disaster. On 13 April 1964 the East of the Socialist Republic of Croatia was hit by an earthquake measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale, and subsequent damage to the Cathedral ran into 12 million Yugoslav dinars. This paper is an attempt to reconstruct the process of the Cathedral renovation in 1960s, and to explain the role of bishop Bauerlein, of the authorities and government of the Republic of that time, as well as of the engagement of numerous parishes and dioceses in the Republic in raising money for the earthquake stricken area.","Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Osijek 31000, Croatia",,"Batorek, SJ (通讯作者)，Fac Humanities & Social Sci, L Jagera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",sjosipovic@ffos.hr,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,546.0,552,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600054,0

User knowledge about public subsidies may affect their willingness to pay for public transport services and alter demand and related passenger fare revenues. This is especially relevant in view of the increasing availability of information about public subsidies. An empirical study reveals a crowding-in effect, on average, on WTP (willingness to pay) as a result of access to information about public subsidies that generates concerns of fairness. Crowding-out effects also occur, caused by considerations of double financing and free-riding, although they are minor. Study results show that public transportation companies as well as financing institutions should highlight the existence of subsidies to produce crowding-in effects in the WTP for public transportation, to maximize public valuation (WTP) of public transportation. This should increase self-generated revenues of public transportation services. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results demonstrate that regional growth is positively affected by domestic and international tourism flows on regional growth.","Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Publ Adm, Kosice, Slovakia",University of Pavol Jozef Safarik Kosice,"Hrabovská, Z (通讯作者)，Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Publ Adm, Kosice, Slovakia.",,,"Hrabovska, Zuzana/0000-0003-4513-5868",,,,,8,2,2,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,843.0,849,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900108,0

Rural tourism often represents one of the most popular and also controversial solutions for rural spaces in difficulty. At the same time, it is known that the tourism products centred on rural areas with socioeconomic difficulties often lack applicability and strategy, due mainly to a poor understanding and adaption to the tourist needs. The paper is based on the results of a survey applied in Moldavia, a historic region situated in North-Eastern Romania, at the European Union periphery. The attention given to the tourism phenomenon in this region has been quite low, despite the constant growth of tourist arrivals during the recent years. Our survey revealed several key-aspects such as: the elements motivating the destination choice, the tourists' visions of rural space, as well as the level of tourist satisfaction, the transport means used or the selection of tourist activities. The results indicated a surprisingly high interest for the accommodation quality features and for accessibility issues. On the other hand, there was a much lower interest for the tourist attractions usually associated with rural areas and national authenticity, such as local traditions or gastronomy. Overall, the research showed a lack of coordination between the tourism promotion strategies and the visitors' expectations, all these within the general context of the progressive transformations affecting this peripheral tourist destination.","[Ibanescu, Bogdan; Stoleriu, Oana Mihaela] Univ Alexandru Ioan Cuza Iasi, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Ibanescu, B (通讯作者)，Univ Alexandru Ioan Cuza Iasi, Iasi, Romania.",,"Ibanescu, Bogdan/AAT-2248-2020; Stoleriu, Oana/HTO-5700-2023",,,,,,10,2,2,0,18,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,797.0,804,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900103,0

First, it is claimed that the shift from the pre-marginalist uses of Robinson Crusoe in political economy to the neoclassical Robinson only signifies a change in theory but not in method. The aim is to emphasize the unifying and overarching methodological feature of different schools of economic thought in their use of metaphors and stories as illustrative and persuasive devices. Secondly, it is argued that on a hypothetical plane Robinson might be considered as a first approximation to the idealized economic man as conceived by the founding figures of the marginalist revolution. However, such a construction of economic theory is far from reflecting the versatile behavior of economic agents, the strategic nature of social interaction, and the institutional constitution of the economy; a matter that has become particularly important in the wake of the global financial crisis.","Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Karagöz, U (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",karagozufuk@gmail.com,,,,,,,131,4,4,0,5,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

By using a VAR/VEC model we estimate the effects of budget deficit and real interest rate shocks on the financial account balance of the balance-of-payments and output for the 2000-2013 data sample. Our estimates lead to several conclusions: (i) a rise in the budget deficit induces a capital outflow, (ii) the budget balance seems to be neutral in respect to GDP, (iii) real interest rate initially decreases in response to a budget deficit shock and increases after a year, (iv) capital inflows and output growth are important factors behind a decrease in the real interest rate, (v) a higher real interest rate is associated with worsening of both budget balance and output. Regarding recent macroeconomic developments in Ukraine, it is realistic to assume that expansionary fiscal policy has led to a decrease in capital inflows, which in turn has brought about an increase in the real interest rate and subsequent worsening of budget balance and output to follow.","[Kopych, Roman] Ivan Franko Natl Univ Lviv, Dept Int Econ Anal & Finance, Lvov, Ukraine; [Bardyn, Iryna] Lviv Acad Commerce, Dept Int Econ Relat, Lvov, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Ivan Franko National University Lviv; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Lviv University of Trade & Economics,"Kopych, R (通讯作者)，Ivan Franko Natl Univ Lviv, Dept Int Econ Anal & Finance, 1 Univ St, Lvov, Ukraine.",Kopych_r@bigmir.net; Irusik-Bardyn@i.ua,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-43-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,77.0,86,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367244900008,0

The study sampling represents three villages situated in the remote areas affected by timber exploitation where attitudes to NTFPs collection and use are strong. Data collection was carried out during September and October 2011 through interviews, semi structured questionnaires and direct observation followed by participatory techniques. Significance of used NTFPs were determined by cultural and economic values. Field study was conducted in 40 randomly selected households in three villages of the Abujao river basin, out of which 17 belonged to the ethnic households of the Shipibo-Conibo tribe and 23 were populated by migrants called the mestizos. During the survey 57 plant based and 20 animal based NTFPs collected and used by both ethnic groups were identified. Results show that NTFPs play an important role in enabling forest dependent households to realise a part of their cash income. Shipibo-Conibo collect higher number of NTFPs, i.e. 67 out of total number 77 identified NTFPs, in comparison to the mestizo households. Shipibo-Conibo harvests NTFPs particularly in the secondary forest (29.41%), while most of them (64.18%) are used for subsistence purposes. In contrast, mestizo households use the collect 61 NTFPs, of which 73.77% are for auto-consumption.

Research has been conducted among graduated (alumni) students at the University of Osijek who by using knowledge and skills acquired in the study successfully perform work in the profession. This target group of respondents is particularly interesting because the five year lag of working in the profession, can give a clear picture of the quality of educational programs which are important for development of the individual, on one hand, and for development of the local community, on the other hand. Reliable and validated KVALIMETAR measuring instrument has been used to compare perception results, among graduated (alumni) students, in two waves of measuring: 2009 year and 2014 year. By comparing the results of the research it will be detected critical points in the quality management system as well as to ensure quality guidelines for increasing the level of satisfaction of all stakeholders as well as the overall quality level of the University.

Only wind is capable of competing with biomass technologies. The main shortcomings of the RES bill are: (1) the limitation in the auctions for so-called unstable technologies; (2) the absence of a real support system for microinstallations; (3) cause further concentration of the declining RES technologies on the market and the overuse of the renewable yet limited power source, biomass.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Ligus, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",,"Ligus, Magdalena/P-2958-2018",,,,,,12,0,0,1,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,435.0,442,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900056,0

While most scholarly works downplay the role of the European Union (EU) in this process, this article claims that in an attempt to manage the economic opportunities and threats that ECE posed after the regime change, the EU has actively shaped foreign capital inflows to the region. First, the EU triggered a liberal shift in ECE's FDI policies. Second, after enlargement, the EU has reinforced ECE's locational advantages through its practice of approving most of the incentive schemes offered to foreign investors. While investors mainly coming from the old EU Members began to dominate ECE economies, the region's heavy reliance on FDI has also produced a reverse effect: ECE investments have enhanced the global competitiveness of western European firms.

Recently, consumers started to explore the disproportion in money allocation. While farmers receive only minimal price for their product, gains go up to the top players. This is evident for Indonesia, which nowadays belongs to the top global coffee producers. Particularly region of North Sumatra is region with unique, world-known, coffee brands such as Lintong and Mandheling coffee brands. Thus, the aim of our survey was to analyze the situation of the small-holder farmers in the North Sumatra province and to examine their role in the coffee value chain. By revealing the power relation in-between the fanners and next levels of local value chain, various options of their empowerment will be determined with emphasis on fanners' livelihood, production and coffee processing opportunities. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews with farmers in July and August 2012, descriptive statistical analyses were applied in order to examine small-holders' role in the coffee value chain at North Sumatra and determine possibilities of farmers' empowerment appropriate due to local conditions and situation. For the local farmers, coffee cultivation showed the highest economic profitability and low amount of inputs. This finding could explain increasing adoption of coffee among especially poor farmers. However, farmers were largely dependent on their own capacities and they did not receive much support from government authorities to compete poor-quality fertilizers supplies, low and fluctuating purchasing price and poor access to credit. Moreover, entry of new market players has been changing the traditional coffee value chain towards the newly emerged global one based on large multinational companies. From different methods of increasing the share of total price in favour of coffee smallholders, the most widespread at North Sumatra is variety specialty and certified coffees. Small number of interviewed farmers are already profiting from these kinds of coffee marketing with the growing tendency among the other smallholders. It is very suitable method within the special conditions at North Sumatra when the Arabica coffee, they are producing, already reached various certification or specialty criteria and is still sold at the global market as a normal coffee for average prices. It is the easiest possibility for the rural poor to reach sustainability in the value chain and it promotes their social and economic security as well as natural heritage conservation.","[Nadvornikova, Iva; Verner, Vladimir; Valesova, Libuse] Czech Univ Life Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Verner, V (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,13,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,91.0,98,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800011,0

Tourism development causes not only positive effects but also negative ones. Therefore, there is a need to address the problems brought by these effects according to the concept of sustainable tourism. However, in Russia this concept is not currently being realized despite all the officially taken measures, in particular, the fact that the concept of the Russian Federation transition into Sustainable Tourism approved by number 440 Presidential Decree on 1 April 1996. Taking into consideration the regulations relating to this concept there have appeared three basic approaches in the Russian economy: Economic approach, based on the theory of aggregate maximum flow; The social component dedicated to human rights and aimed at preserving stability; Environmental approach focused on providing sustainable development based on the biological systems' integrity. The basic principles of sustainable tourism are: Ecological correctness of business or eco-efficiency; The balance of all elements of sustainable tourism as a socio-ecological-economic system; Equitable access to the resources for different generations. These principles dictate the need to adopt and implement the following principles in tourism: Travel and tourism should help people achieve harmony with nature, should contribute to the conservation, protection and restoration of ecosystems; The application of protectionism policy in selling tourist product should be completely changed; Protection of the environment should be a major task for sustainable tourism; Tourism development issues should be resolved together with the concerned citizens (locals). Having analyzed the sources on this subject, we determined that there exist two concepts to assess the optimal amount of sustainable tourism: Anthropocentric optimum, which applies the rule of providing growth, where the marginal benefits increment from additional physical capital for people equals marginal costs increment; Biocentric optimum where you must avoid environmental collapse or degradation. We believe that the optimal amount of tourism development must comply the biocentric optimum. Having studied the material on this issue, we can conclude that the concept of sustainable tourism should ensure the optimal amount and level of economic activity. Therefore, we suggest the following measures should be developed for the popular tourist destinations: Coordination of efforts and promoting individuals' concern; Development of ways to assess the impact of tourism on the environment; Developing the rules of tourists' behavior approved at the regional authorities level.","[Svetlana, Muhamedieva A.; Svetlana, Zolotareva A.; Karina, Kulagina E.] Kemerovo State Univ Culture & Arts, Kemerovo, Russia",,"Svetlana, AM (通讯作者)，Kemerovo State Univ Culture & Arts, Kemerovo, Russia.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,8,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,99.0,104,,,,,,6,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800012,0

Bankruptcy should be seen as a natural component of market economies, and it is well-known that about a fifth of successful entrepreneurs failed in their first business. Bankruptcy is usually resolved in two ways, i.e. liquidation or restructuring. The European Union emphasizes the efficient and timely restructuring of businesses and the creation of opportunities for a second chance to business. The European Commission adopted, on the 12th March 2014, a recommendation on a new approach to business failure and insolvency (2014/135/EU).

Although a large number of port security control measures have been proposed which have greatly enhanced security performance, the voice of requiring further justification on their effectiveness from various maritime stakeholders remains strong. Indeed, different ports around the world still have very diversified practices and standards regarding secure facilities, with a generally accepted assessment methodology found wanting. Despite the existence of previous research works, few have been done to address this issue, which clearly exposes a significant research gap. Understanding such deficiency, this paper introduces a novel fuzzy evidential reasoning approach to facilitate the quantitative analysis of port facility security assessment (PFSA). To achieve it, the major key security performance indicators (KSPIs) used by designated authorities in port facility security plan are identified; the current PFSA practices are reviewed with particular attention to the grades used by port operators when assessing the KSPIs; and a fuzzy evidential reasoning approach is applied to quantify port facility security risks and to conduct the cost benefit analysis of the associated security control measures.

In this paper, we try to contribute to this debate by admitting an approximate factor model with a common component comprising global and country-specific factors. Although it is arguable to allow for common factors shared by all the euro area member countries in the context of the European economic integration, it is also reasonable to admit that there may be country-specific factors. Hence, we end up with a two-level factor model allowing for both global and country-specific factors. We discuss the consistency of the principal components estimator within such framework and propose criteria for determining the number of global and group-specific factors. The consistency of the suggested criteria is established and the small sample properties are assessed through Monte Carlo simulations.

However, the empirical basis for judging trade reforms is weak. Econometrics are mostly ad hoc, results are typically not judged against models, policies are poorly measured, and most studies are based on pre-1990 experience. We address these concerns by employing a model with capital and intermediate goods, compiling new disaggregated tariff measures, and employing treatment and control regression analysis with differences-indifferences. We find that a specific treatment, liberalizing tariffs on imported capital and intermediate goods, led to faster growth, consistent with the model.","[Estevadeordal, Antoni] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Taylor, Alan M.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Taylor, Alan M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Inter-American Development Bank; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Estevadeordal, A (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,66,59,68,0,26,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

However, the paper presents evidence that interest rates of the GCC countries did not converge to the interest rates of the US implying that the assets of the GCC countries are not perfect substitutes to the US assets. This imperfect asset substitutability has allowed the GCC countries to manoeuvre their monetary policies and the central banks of the GCC countries have had some control over their money growth rates by sterilising the changes in international reserves. Results indicate that the monetary authorities of these countries used domestic credit policy to attain some domestic policy objective while engaging in sterilised foreign exchange intervention. This result implies that the proposed GCC central bank should be able to maintain the monetary independence as a group and can reap the benefit of monetary efficiency of the proposed Gulf Monetary Union.","[Hassan, M.

Microlevel data show that German manufacturers accounted for nearly 30 billion euros of service exports in 2005. I have found that particular construction, engineering and R&D services are exported. The machinery industries, motor vehicles and chemicals producers dominate the overall pattern. The types of services exported vary strongly across industries. Service exports of advertising, data processing, management and R&D services are found to likely support foreign affiliates of firms. However, these headquarter services are only infrequently observable. Much more important are construction and engineering services exported by machinery firms. These might represent installation and maintenance services complementing exported machinery. R&D services exports generally represent the transfer of knowledge and technology, which is found to be particularly relevant for motor vehicle producers. Beyond the support of foreign production of firms, R&D services might be relevant also in R&D cooperations of firms or when firms have partnerships with foreign suppliers or buyers of intermediate products.","Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Duisburg, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Kelle, M (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Duisburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,33,31,32,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2013,36.0,12,,,,,1494.0,1515,,10.1111/twec.12111,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,273CN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328511500003,0

New technologies that provide information about various modes and environments can help to inform choices regarding travel and accessibility. In this paper we describe the development of a web-based accessibility calculator prototype for the Greater Montreal Area in Canada. The core of this tool is a statistical model of trip length developed using the spatial expansion method. The model is used to obtain estimates of trip length for a desired profile, based on attributes such as age, gender, family structure, and mode of travel, as well as geographical location. These estimates are used to calculate a cumulative opportunities accessibility measure to different types of essential destinations. Travel behavior information is drawn from Montreal's 2008 Household Travel Surveys. Geocoded information about trip origins and destinations is used to calculate trip length. A broad array of covariates related to individual and household attributes, and urban form are used. A geocoded business point database is used for the calculation of cumulative opportunities. To simplify the use of the accessibility calculator, the model is implemented in a user-friendly way using Google Maps API v3 and a convenient interface. Different possible uses of the accessibility calculator are illustrated in the paper. The accessibility calculator can be used by members of the public or planners/policy makers to measure the level of accessibility for a specific address and personal profile by various modes of transportation.

The key initiative was lean working, which involved redesigned workflow, task fragmentation, standardization and individual targets. Utilizing a holistic model of white-collar OHS and in-depth quantitative and qualitative data, the evidence of widespread self-reported ill-health symptoms is compelling.

Following Born and Breitung (2011), we introduce general methods to modify the standard LM tests so that they become robust against heteroskedasticity and non-normality. The idea behind the robustification is to decompose the concentrated score function into a sum of uncorrelated terms so that the outer product of gradient (OPG) can be used to estimate its variance. We also provide methods for improving the finite sample performance of the proposed tests. These methods are then applied to several popular spatial models.

Drawing on theories of international institutions and corporate action, it develops a theoretical approach toward EU actorness that demonstrates under which conditions third parties gain an interest in recognizing this actor as a relevant party to international institutions and how the EU can become an actor in its own right. The EU is expected to be recognized as a relevant actor in an international institution if it has acquired action capability in the relevant governance area, while formal status plays an inferior role. This hypothesis is subsequently assessed for six international institutions that vary regarding the degree of EU action capability and the EU's formal status, including the WTO and IMF, FAO and WHO as well as two international environmental regimes. Empirical results confirm the fruitfulness of the theoretical approach.","[Gehring, Thomas; Muehleck, Marc] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany; [Oberthur, Sebastian] Free Univ Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Gehring, T (通讯作者)，Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",thomas.gehring@uni-bamberg.de,,"Oberthur, Sebastian/0000-0001-8626-5082",,,,,67,43,50,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The article addresses this divergence and emphasises the necessity of overcoming the dualism of an ideal type of property rights on the one hand and the way property is handled in everyday life on the other. It argues that concrete situations as well as the necessary justifications of practices have hitherto both been widely neglected as empirical foci in studies on property relations. Five brief episodes from the privatisation of collective farms in rural Russia serve as examples to illustrate how situations and justifications are reflexively linked by drawing on and negotiating about differing orders of worth'.,"Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Lindner, P (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,71,4,4,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,SEP 1,2013,65.0,7,,,,,1275.0,1294,,10.1080/09668136.2013.822698,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,265DE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000327929100003,0

There has been extensive research on the linkage between transport infrastructure and economic performance since the late 1980s, characterised by widely varying evidence. We conduct a meta-analysis of the empirical evidence on the output elasticity of transport infrastructure, based on a sample of 563 estimates obtained from 33 studies. Previous meta-analyses have focused on total public capital and hence cannot appropriately explain the wide variation in the productivity effect of transport infrastructure nor provide guidance to policymakers on the returns to investment in different types of transport infrastructure. Our results indicate that the existing estimates of the productivity effect of transport infrastructure can vary across main industry groups, tend to be higher for the US economy than for European countries, and are higher for roads compared to other modes of transport. The variation in the estimates of the output elasticity of transport is also explained by differences in the methods and data used in previous studies. Failing to control for unobserved heterogeneity and spurious associations tends to result in higher values, while failing to control for urbanisation and congestion levels leads to omitted variable bias. These findings can be used to inform future research on the choice of model specification and estimation and transport-related policy making. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The classic results of Dasgupta and Stiglitz (Rev Econ Stud 39:87-103, 1972) (of firm-specific profit taxation) and Diamond and Mirrlees (Am Econ Rev 61:8-27, 1971a; Am Econ Rev 61:261-278, 1971b) and Guesnerie (A contribution to the pure theory of taxation, 1995) (of uniform 100 % profit taxation) follow as special cases of our model. Moreover, second-best analysis shows that optimal profit taxation is a substitute for optimal intermediate input taxation. In smooth economies, proportional, lump-sum, and affine modes of profit taxation are equivalent. We rework Mirrlees (Rev Econ Stud 39:105-111, 1972) counterexample, which is posed in the context of a non-smooth economy, to show that second-best production efficiency continues to remain desirable under an affine structure of profit taxation.","Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Murty, S (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",s.murty@exeter.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2013,41.0,3,,,,,579.0,604,,10.1007/s00355-012-0694-y,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,202XT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323254900006,0

However, recent evidence suggests that China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are in fact stronger than ever. In this paper, we examine over 78,000 manufacturing firms between 2002 and 2006 to investigate the relationship between ownership structure and the degree of firm-level exposure to export markets and firm-level productivity. Using a conditional stochastic dominance approach, we reveal that although our results largely adhere to prior expectations, the performance of SOEs differs markedly between those that export and those that supply the domestic market only. It appears that China's internationally focused SOEs have become formidable global competitors.","[Elliott, Robert] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Zhou, Ying] Aston Univ, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; Aston University,"Elliott, R (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,"Elliott, Robert/0000-0002-3966-2082",ESRC [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,66,14,14,1,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2013,36.0,8,,,,,1000.0,1028,,10.1111/twec.12078,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,198JJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322918500002,0

In particular, via a randomization exercise, we reject the null hypothesis of a global pool of technology and show that there are partitions of countries associated with relatively strong/weak knowledge spillovers. Then, we estimate a nonlinear specification that includes simultaneously geographical distance and international trade among the determinants of domestic TFP.

Bike-friendly environments should be constructed to innovatively increase the use of bicycles as a significant transportation mode. From this perspective, the scientific and effective monitoring of bicycling environments is of keen interest. An important technical challenge for monitoring is to evaluate the performance of bicycling environments. This study proposes a novel monitoring method that can be used for evaluating bicycle performance in terms of safety and mobility. An instrumented probe bicycle (IPB), which is equipped with a set of sensors including a global positioning systems (GPS) receiver, accelerometer, and gyro sensor, was used to develop the proposed monitoring method. The IPB provides useful bicycle maneuvering data for identifying longitudinal, lateral, and vertical maneuverings of the bicycle, which are affected by environmental factors such as heavy vehicle volume, surface conditions, grade, crossings, humps, and curbs. Regarding safety monitoring, an index to predict bicyclist's perceived safety and comfort with the predictors derived from the measurements by the IPB was developed. A questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain actual responses from bicyclists for perceived safety and comfort during the field experiment. In addition, a method to evaluate the bicycle mobility using GPS speed data was devised. Then, a fault tree analysis (FTA) technique, which is a well-known technique for risk analysis, was adopted to integrate safety and mobility monitoring. As a result, the bicycling monitoring index (BMI) was proposed. Data derived from the proposed method is expected to be effectively used for promoting the bicycle use by supporting the development and evaluation of various bicycle-related policies.

We divide the data between those veterans who entered the pension system early because of war injuries and those who entered the pension system after the 1890 reform that made it available to many more veterans. We examine the correlation between specific medical conditions rated by the surgeons and death causes to gauge support for the hypothesis that death is attributable to something specific. We also examine the correlation between the accumulation of rated conditions to the length of time until death to gauge support for the insult hypothesis. In general, we find support for both hypotheses. Examining the hazard ratios for dying of a specific condition, there is support for the idea that what ail'd ya' is what kill'd ya'.

Tourist expenditure in a given destination is the result of considering both the length of stay and the daily expenditure. The objective of this research is to analyse daily tourist expenditure determinants using a survey of foreign tourists visiting one leading destination in Southern Europe: the Spanish Mediterranean coast. It focuses on two aspects: how the length of stay influences daily expenditure and how the different activities of tourists during their stay affect tourist expenditure. The research employs a dataset of nearly 184,000 observations covering 2004-2009 and includes tourist socio-economic characteristics and elements related to the trip. The results confirm that tourist expenditure is explained by a set of tourist-related social and economic factors and these factors shed light on the consequences of strategies to extend the length of stay of tourists. Finally, the effect on the daily expenditure of tourists' activities helps to determine the complementary supply (health, culture, gastronomy, etc) that must accompany mature sun-and-sand destinations.","[Garcia-Sanchez, Antonio; Fernandez-Rubio, Ester] Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Econ, Cartagena 30201, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Collado, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Dept Econ, Campus San Vicente, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",a.garciasanchez@upct.es; efernandezrubio@gmail.com; collado@ua.es,"Collado, M.

The deterioration in operating performance of REITs is similar in magnitude to that found for industrial firms in prior studies. We find evidence of mean reversion in operating performance and timing by issuing firms, and that information asymmetry plays an important role in the results. Notably, in using a longer sample period and a variety of cash flow measures and benchmarks, this study finds evidence that is in contrast to results found in an earlier analysis of REIT operating performance.","[Ghosh, Chinmoy] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Storrs, CT USA; [Roark, Scott] Boise State Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Finance, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Sirmans, C.

The first path causes intra-regional interdependence, the second path reinforces dependence on extra-regional actors, and the third path reinforces asymmetries in the region. The article illustrates this argument using diachronic network visualization of trade networks in three world regions. The European Union (EU) corresponds to the first path, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to the second and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to the third. The theoretical argument and empirical analysis in the article demonstrate how regional organizations get locked into these developmental paths, and how regional integration reinforces rather than changes existing economic structures.","[Krapohl, Sebastian; Fink, Simon] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Krapohl, S (通讯作者)，Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Dept Int Relat, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany.",sebastian.krapohl@uni-bamberg.de,"Krapohl, Sebastian/AAB-1091-2021; Fink, Simon/D-5598-2016","Krapohl, Sebastian/0000-0001-7990-5416; Fink, Simon/0000-0002-3730-5137",,,,,34,32,42,1,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This paper conducts a meta-analysis on empirical estimates from 23 studies (102 observations) that analysed the impact of rail on land/property value changes. Variation in the estimated impacts is calculated and discussed in relation to key dimensions of study-design characteristics. The results show that a number of factors produce significant variations in the estimates. These include the type of land use, the type of rail service, the rail system life cycle maturity, the distance to stations, the geographical location, accessibility to roads, methodological characteristics, as well as whether the impacted area is land or property. On the other hand, we observe that changes in purchase price and rent values due to rail projects are statistically similar to each other, that there is no evidence of change in values over time nor due to the location of land/property within the city, and that including property characteristics and neighbourhood type in the estimation model do not change values significantly. Publication bias tests are also performed and show that although researchers tend to report both positive and negative results, they tend to be biased towards statistically significant estimates.

For this purpose, we use a unique employer-employee panel dataset covering the entire Belgian employment population over 9 years (1998-2006). Like several other European countries, e.g. Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, Belgium has a relatively centralised wage bargaining system, with the industry level playing the most important role. Regression results confirm that wage increases collectively decided at the industry level are, on average, fully passed on to individual wages. In addition to industry-level bargaining, we are interested in the supplementary wage increases granted at the firm level, referred to as wage drift or wage cushion in the literature. Our estimates show that wage drift is affected by company size, by the economic performance of the industry and to a much lesser extent by labour market tensions as measured by the local unemployment rate. Interestingly, our results show that industry-level bargaining also takes most of these features into account.","[Novella, Maritza Lopez; Sissoko, Salimata] Fed Planning Bur, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Sissoko, Salimata] Free Univ Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Novella, ML (通讯作者)，Fed Planning Bur, Ave Arts 47-49, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",mln@plan.be; nsissoko@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,,32,4,5,0,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Hodrick in 1992 proposed a remedy that is based on running a reverse regression of short-horizon returns on the long-run mean of the predictor. Unfortunately, this only allows the null of no predictability to be tested, and assumes stationary regressors. In this paper, we revisit long-horizon forecasting from reverse regressions, and argue that reverse regression methods avoid serious size distortions in long-horizon predictive regressions, even when there is some predictability and/or near unit roots. Meanwhile, the reverse regression methodology has the practical advantage of being easily applicable when there are many predictors. We apply these methods to forecasting excess bond returns using the term structure of forward rates, and find that there is indeed some return forecastability. However, confidence intervals for the coefficients of the predictive regressions are about twice as wide as those obtained with the conventional approach to inference. We also include an application to forecasting excess stock returns.

Moreover, it is not clear when and to what extent the influence of the workplace zone and accessibility to employment affect the residential location choices made by households; in other word, whether the residing choice is conditional to the workplace, or vice versa; or if such choices (residence and work place) are joint. In this paper, Nested Logit (NL) and Cross-Nested Logit models of residential location choice are specified and compared to MNL, to investigate the existence of spatial correlation between different locations. Furthermore, different assumptions are tested, considering the choice of residential zone and the joint choice of residential zone and work place zone. The models were estimated for the urban area of Santander (Spain). The results indicate that the inclusion in the model specification, of the spatial correlation between zones fit the data significantly better. Home-work journey times were a statistically significant factor in household location choice, whereas accessibility to employment had the correct sign but it was not statistically significant.

The United States and the EU, by contrast, rely mainly on antidumping duties to shield domestic industries.

Our key identifying assumption is that the marginal benefit of parking duration does not depend on this choice. The endogeneity of parking duration is acknowledged in the estimation procedure. We apply the methodology during daytime hours to an area where cruising for parking is absent, street parking is ubiquitous and garage parking is discretely located over space. So, in this area, the average distance to the final destination is longer for garage parking than for street parking. We find that drivers are willing to pay a premium for street parking which ranges from (sic) 0.37 to (sci) 0.60. Given a parking duration of 1 h, we find that the demand for street parking is price elastic: the price elasticity of demand for the share of street parking is -5.5. However, this price elasticity is much smaller for shorter parking durations. Our estimates imply that even small reductions in street parking prices induce a strong increase in the stock of cars parked on-street. Our estimates also imply that a policy which contains a street premium (so street prices exceed garage prices) is welfare improving, because drivers with longer parking durations are induced to use parking locations that are, on average, farther away, so this policy reduces total walking time.

We develop a model and demonstrate how compensation incentives interact and influence a special servicer's foreclosure decisions. Our model takes into consideration the dynamic nature of such a decision by viewing is as a dynamic programming problem whereby foreclosure represents a discrete terminal state of an optimal stopping problem.

It argues that existing ideas-based approaches either fail to define idea' with any precision, or explain both the causes and resolution of the crisis in terms of competition between ideas, and therefore appear tautological. Instead, the article develops an Open Marxist framework suggesting that crises should be understood as an inherent systemic feature of capitalist social relations, which requires constant management so that governments can simultaneously achieve international financial market credibility and domestic political legitimacy. It uses this framework to produce an interpretation of economic policy change in Britain during the 1970s that argues policy-making was problematised in terms of the competing demands of international financial market credibility and domestic political legitimacy, and not in terms of a debate about economic ideas conducted in a context of crisis.","Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Rogers, C (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",chris.rogers@york.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H025855/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H025855/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,52,12,14,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It is extremely important to seasonably analyze these ethical dilemmas and explore its causes for finding a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas of technological risks.","[Ai Zhi-qiang; Shen Yuan-jun] Liaoning Univ Technol, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Jinzhou, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Liaoning University of Technology,"Ai, ZQ (通讯作者)，Liaoning Univ Technol, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Jinzhou, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",7907909@qq.com; 393000136@qq.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,21.0,,,,,,298.0,302,,,,,,5,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA3ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335241700055,0

In the case of a Nimby (Imby) facility, the smaller is the distance, the smaller (larger) is the individual benefit. Multiple solutions may arise in both cases, and we derive sufficient conditions for uniqueness in both cases. Optimal decisions on location and size are interrelated and depend on the complementarity or substitutability properties of size and distance in the utility function. Then we introduce a common-agency lobbying game, where agents attempt to influence the location and provision decisions by the government. Even when only a subset of households lobbies, the solution of the lobbying game can replicate the optimal solution. Under-provision or over-provision of the public good may be obtained both in the Nimby and the Imby cases. Finally, some non-lobbying households may be better off than in the case where all households lobby, which raises the possibility of free-riding at the lobbying stage. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Slavonski Brod was a major center and market town once, but today there are more different developed economic activities that are not fully exploited, such as a border river Sava which should be used for the formation of a logistics center. Projects for the creation of logistic center are prepared, the implementation of this type of center would increase the standard of living and increase employment in one of the least developed counties in the Croatian. There is an insufficient interest of the relevant institutions and administrative bodies for investment in inland transport infrastructure that would create the basic conditions for recognizing Slavonski Brod as the international logistics center. There are projects in the city that promote the interests for the development of the international port in it, but they are awaiting realization because of the lack of financial resources. Apart the port activities, it will contribute to investments in machinery and equipment of industrial plants which are waned by the advent of privatization. The aim of this paper is to analyze and determine the objective reasons for untimely implementation of projects which would help creating and strengthening the Port Brod, and provide measures and activities of relevant authorities for the affirmation of international logistics center in Slavonski Brod. Analysis of the problem and research objectives definition leads to two research objects. The first object of the research is Slavonski Brod, whose historical and current analysis of economic and logistics activities will determine the consequences of the current economic situation in the Brod-Posavina County. Another object of research is an international logistics center which should affirm Slavonski Brod with the proposed guidelines.

We also study whether large lenders are better informed, or better at interpreting information for lending purposes, and hence have lower foreclosure rates; whether lenders have more information on larger borrowers than smaller borrowers, and hence have lower foreclosure rates on larger loans; and whether commercial mortgage defaults are related to debt service coverage and loan-to-values, both initial and contemporaneous. The paper's main findings are fourfold. First, holding all else equal, there is evidence that tax considerations influence investors' decisions about when to put assets to lenders. The results are consistent with the argument of Constantinides (J Financ Econ 13:65-89, 1984). Second, the evidence suggests that large lenders are especially knowledgeable about commercial mortgage borrowers and commercial property markets, in that they have lower foreclosure rates than smaller lenders. Third, on the question of whether lenders have more information on larger borrowers than smaller borrowers, we find that larger loans have, on average, lower default rates than smaller loans.

This paper is based on a dataset previously unexploited: the individual records of nearly 10,000 Indonesian men conscripted into the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) used together with individual data on another 10,000 Indonesians, recorded as part of the Indonesian Family Life Surveys (IFLS). These two sets of records provide the height and place of birth of members of birth cohorts spanning nearly the entire 20th century. Our aim in this paper is to trace the development of average height in Indonesia over the course of the twentieth century. Whereas both average height and average income increased during the second half of the century, we find that this was only after they had diverged in the first half: a divergence similar to the one (frequently discussed in the literature) that had occurred in several other countries toward the end of the 19th century. Using a newly developed height accounting method, we estimate that in Indonesia increasing income inequality accounts for about half of this divergence, which gradually disappeared after the Second World War, as income inequality decreased and average height increased until it was rising in tandem with average income.

Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to discuss how to develop logistics in Yibin more rapidly and better from the perspective of industrial agglomeration theory through the analysis on Yibin's logistics industry status, and then promote its economic competitiveness. Yet port is the core strategic resource that drives the development of logistics industry in the whole city and even the overall regional economic development. Thus it takes port logistics industry as its research object, and analyzes as well as discusses its current situation and countermeasures.","[Hou Dongmei; Chen Chuanxiong] Yibin Univ, Econ & Management Dept Off, Yibin, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Yibin University,"Hou, DM (通讯作者)，Yibin Univ, Econ & Management Dept Off, Yibin, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",36159945@qq.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,9,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,19.0,,,,,,226.0,231,,,,,,6,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA3ZX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335235900040,0

The discrete nature of an EC can be successively smoothed using Bernstein polynomials approximation to obtain differentiable estimate of underlying copula or its density. In practice, however, some components of some observations are often missing. In this case the marginal distributions of individual vector components can be estimated with-out any changes using all available information, whilst the second step is not so straightforward. One can employ only complete observations to capture the dependence but then the mapping of estimated copula on individual marginal quantiles is not reflected appropriately. In the article the author suggests to generalize the classical EC to be applicable also on incomplete observations and further shows that Bernstein approximation based on this generalized EC is only slightly modified and all its important attributes remain unchanged.","[Kubetta, Adam] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,,kubetta@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,482.0,487,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000082,0

But this relation is not straightforward, and there is an empirical evidence that for weaker economies a high degree of capital mobility is not desirable. To measure a degree of capital mobility, a Feldstein - Harioka hypothesis is usually applied: Under perfect capital mobility, domestic savings and investment rates should be uncorrelated. In econometric models, a possible long-run relation between savings and investment is studied by the help of the concept of cointegration.

By definition, we can see that the democratic centralism has two basic processes, one is the democratic centralism on the basis of democracy, and the other is democracy under centralized guidance. The principle of democratic centralism consists of two basic elements: democracyand centralism; to understand correctly the connotation of democratic centralism, we must handle properly the relationship between democracyand centralism. Scientific and rational treatment of the relationship between the two is the key of the Democratic centralism. The most important thing is to clear the dialectical relationship between democracy and centralization. The centralism on the basis of the democracy should be subordinated to the overall will obeying the majority, obey the decision of the unification of the people, subject to Party discipline, obey command center representing the interests of common authority. Democracy is under centralized guidance, centralization is the basis of democracy; democracy is the basis of centralization, centralization is democracy.

With abundant vitality, it plays an important role in the construction and development of China's Communist Party of China. The reason is that the content of democratic centralism is scientific, and is the effective ways to strengthen the organization construction and system construction of the Communist Party of China.

Research shows that, the significant economy promoting effect of export trade is the eastern region and the Midwest import growth effect is more apparent than in the east. There is a crowding out effect of foreign direct investment on economic growth of Midwest regions, but the linkage function of FDI and import and export can effectively promote economic growth.

The impact will vary according to the regions. High temperatures and water shortages will be the major problems of the west, southwest and southeast. The east will have milder winter climates that will affect the snow melt and river flows. These effects will get stronger towards the second (2041-2070) and third (2071-2100) periods. Organic agriculture is practiced in all regions of Turkey mainly based upon the existing ecological and socio-economic factors. Changes in climate will affect perennials the most whether be cultivated fruit species or harvested from nature. The paper evaluates the expected effects of climate change on Turkish organic agriculture at regional level based upon common findings revealed by different scenarios.","[Aksoy, U.; Can, H.

In this opaque product design, customers are randomly assigned to travel to one of approximately ten destinations; however, for a fee they may exclude one or more destinations from the choice set (or a particular package design) prior to learning which destination they will travel to. We use a multidimensional binary logit model to predict the probability that one or more alternatives will be chosen by a customer. Results show that customers are more likely to pay to exclude destinations located close to the origin airport and destinations that speak the same language as the origin airport. Length of stay, cost of living at the destination, and measures of destination attractiveness are also found to be significant predictors for some package designs. Based on these findings, we offer general recommendations for how to design opaque packages for airline customers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The article provides one test of the permanent-income hypothesis (PIH) that infers that temporary changes in income have little effect on consumer spending, at the initiation of the child tax credit in 1997, and a second PIH test when the credit was increased in 2003. The evidence supports the PIH in both 1997 and 2003, even using three different proxies for liquidity-constrained households. Separate from any PIH implications, our findings suggest the child tax credit did not provide a short-term consumption stimulus in either of the time periods studied. Our results therefore cast some doubt on whether this type of tax credit should be considered sound fiscal policy.","[Ahmad, Nazneen] Weber State Univ, Dept Econ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA; [Michel, Norbert] Nicholls State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Thibodaux, LA 70310 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University; University of Louisiana System; Nicholls State University,"Ahmad, N (通讯作者)，Weber State Univ, Dept Econ, 3807 Univ Circle, Ogden, UT 84408 USA.",Norbert.Michel@nicholls.edu; nazneenahmad@weber.edu,,,,,,,16,2,3,1,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

(Econometrica 63:841-890, 1995). In particular, the SML estimator is better than the GMM estimator in recovery of heterogeneity parameters which are often of central interest in marketing research. With the GMM estimator, the analyst must determine what moment conditions to use for parameter identification, especially the heterogeneity parameters. With the SML estimator, the moment conditions are automatically determined as the gradients of the log-likelihood function, and these are the most efficient ones if the model is correctly specified. Another limitation of the GMM estimator is that the product market shares must be strictly positive while the SML estimator can handle zero market share observations. Properties of the SML and GMM estimators are demonstrated in simulated data and in data from the US photographic film market.","[Gupta, Sachin] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Park, Sungho] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Cornell University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Gupta, S (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",spark104@asu.edu; sg248@cornell.edu,"Gupta, Sachin/F-2515-2011; Gupta, Sachin/L-4384-2019","Gupta, Sachin/0000-0001-9459-5233",,,,,26,3,4,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Presently, Iraqi institutions are becoming stronger and it is possible to imagine a more participatory approach to policy design. Organic agriculture, for several reasons, is one of the likely options, but it needs to be framed within a comprehensive agricultural policy. For this purpose, a SWOT analysis has been conducted with a group of Iraqi MoA officers attending a training program in Italy.

Such behavior was observed in numerous metropolitan areas throughout the southeastern and southwestern United States in the years leading up to financial crises, resulting in inventories of tens of thousands of lots in cities such as Atlanta, Las Vegas and Orlando, just to name a few. The model presented in this paper explores the rationale behind the choices made by developers in these markets and others by extending the real options framework to concurrently estimate optimal phasing and inventory decisions for large-scale residential development projects. Modeled interactions between several variables indicate that full development, smooth phased development and lumpy development can all be optimal under different market conditions, with each pattern feeding back into inventory levels and lot pricing.","[Ott, Steven H.; Hughen, W.

To respond to this question, we use four indicators of international trade in services since 1990 to 2005, namely foreign direct investment (FDI) inward stock, services imports, domestic sales of foreign affiliates (FATS) and FDI inflows, to examine what type of services trade forms a direct determinant. Subsequently, we analyse what type of sector-specific regulation has played an inhibiting effect on services TFP growth. Such analysis contrasts with former studies in which mainly factor inputs and economy-wide regulation are used to explain services TFP. This paper provides evidence that neither trade nor entry barriers are robust determinants to explain cross-country differences. Instead, regulations on operational procedures affecting the variables costs structure of the firm seem to play a more important role in explaining TFP growth between countries, particularly in combination with information and communication technology (ICT) capital.","London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"van der Marel, E (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London, England.",,,,,,,,57,10,10,2,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2012,35.0,11,,,,,1530.0,1558,,10.1111/twec.12004,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,041FX,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311385400006,0

The new estimates reduce growth during the First World War, making the Italian case comparable to the other belligerent countries, while improving the performance of the 1920s. The 1929 crisis looks more profound than before, but the recovery after 1933 is now stronger. During the 1920s and the 1930s, a significant shift from traditional to more advanced activities took place, and the cycles of consumption related industries grew in importance: after linking the available estimates with those produced by Fenoaltea for liberal Italy, both descriptive statistics and cointegration analysis suggest that some of these movements began with the turn of the previous century, a finding in line with institutional interpretations of Italy's economic growth. When confronted with the rest of Europe, in industrial production Italy's first half of the twentieth century was a relative success, which laid the ground for the following economic boom.

A major open problem is the fact that non-compensability implies the analytical cost of loosing all available information about intensity of preference, i.e. if some variables are measured on interval or ratio scales, they have to be treated as measured on an ordinal scale. Here this problem has been tackled in its most general formulation, that is when mixed measurement scales (interval, ratio and ordinal) are used and both stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties are present. Objectives of this article are first to present a comprehensive review of useful solutions already proposed in the literature and second to advance the state of the art mainly in the theoretical guarantee that weights have the meaning of importance coefficients and they can be summarized in a voting matrix. This is a key result for using non-compensatory Condorcet consistent rules.

We will explore several factors which might explain this dynamics and give an overview of mergers and acquisitions in the Mediterranean region, including the establishment of new plants of northern multinational firms in southern countries, in partnership with local players. Consolidation has significantly been accelerated in the 2000s by refocusing on the core business of the beer industry and this trend can be mainly explained by the maturity of the European market.

Cross-national differences in wage-setting institutions, along with other institutional differences linked to family roles and disparate shopping cultures in the two countries, are key causes.

The dilemma is that with scarce data a low-frequency return index (such as annual) is necessary to accumulate enough sales data in each period. This paper presents an approach to address this problem using a two-stage frequency conversion procedure, by first estimating lower-frequency indexes staggered in time, and then applying a generalized inverse estimator to convert from lower to higher frequency return series. The two-stage procedure can improve the accuracy of high-frequency indexes in scarce data environments. In this paper the method is demonstrated and analyzed by application to empirical commercial property repeat-sales data.","[Bokhari, Sheharyar; Geltner, David] MIT, Ctr Real Estate, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Geltner, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Ctr Real Estate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Deitsch, Haysha/C-2019-2017","Deitsch, Haysha/0000-0002-0215-4340",,,,,17,20,20,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Transit agencies have a need to explore mechanisms to improve connectivity by improving transit service. This requires a systemic approach to develop measures that can prioritize the allocation of funding to locations that provide greater connectivity, or in some cases direct funding towards underperforming areas. The concept of connectivity is well documented in social network literature and to some extent, transportation engineering literature. However, connectivity measures have limited capability to analyze multi-modal public transportation systems which are much more complex in nature than highway networks. In this paper, we propose measures to determine connectivity from a graph theoretical approach for all levels of transit service coverage integrating routes, schedules, socioeconomic, demographic and spatial activity patterns. The objective of using connectivity as an indicator is to quantify and evaluate transit service in terms of prioritizing transit locations for funding; providing service delivery strategies, especially for areas with large multi-jurisdictional, multi-modal transit networks; providing an indicator of multi-level transit capacity for planning purposes; assessing the effectiveness and efficiency for node/stop prioritization; and making a user friendly tool to determine locations with highest connectivity while choosing transit as a mode of travel. An example problem shows how the graph theoretical approach can be used as a tool to incorporate transit specific variables in the indicator formulations and compares the advantage of the proposed approach compared to its previous counterparts. Then the proposed framework is applied to the comprehensive transit network in the Washington-Baltimore region. The proposed analysis offers reliable indicators that can be used as tools for determining the transit connectivity of a multimodal transportation network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We use data for Swedish men born between 1955 and 1967 for whom we measure the distribution of long-run income, as well as several important background circumstances, such as parental education and income, family structure and own IQ before adulthood. We address the question: in Sweden, given its present constellation of social policies and institutions, to what extent is existing income inequality due to circumstances, as opposed to 'effort'?

Historical studies usually apply non-experimental methods that may produce substantial bias. Modern experimental controlled studies may provide high quality evidence supporting a causal relationship between consumption of dairy products and physical growth. This paper provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials investigating the effect of supplementing usual diet with dairy products on physical growth. Twelve studies provided sufficient, independent data for meta-analysis. Seven studies were conducted since the 1990s. The other studies were conducted between 1926 and 1980. Studies were conducted in Europe, USA, China, Northern Vietnam, Kenya, Indonesia and India. Many studies had some internal validity problems such as lack of randomisation or dissimilarity of groups at baseline regarding height and age, which affects the quality of evidence. Meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis showed that the most likely effect of dairy products supplementation is 0.4 cm per annum additional growth per ca 245 ml of milk daily. Meta-regression analysis indicated that milk might have more effect on growth than other dairy products while lower height-for-age and being a teenager increased the effect of supplementation. In conclusion, there is moderate quality evidence that dairy products supplementation stimulate linear growth supporting hypotheses that changing levels of consumption of dairy products in the 19th and 20th centuries contributed to trends in height.

Loosely speaking, this condition says that whenever a profile moves closer to some individual's point of view, then the social choice cannot move further away from this individual's point of view. We apply this idea in two settings: merging functions and preference aggregation. The precise formulation of the proximity condition depends on the setting. First, restricting attention to merging functions that are interval scale invariant, we prove that the only functions that satisfy proximity are dictatorships. Second, we prove that the only social welfare functions that satisfy proximity and a version of the Pareto criterion are dictatorships. We conclude that either proximity is not an attractive normative requirement after all, or we must give up some other social choice condition. Another possibility is that our normative intuition about proximity needs to be codified using different axioms.","[Duddy, Conal; Piggins, Ashley] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Duddy, Conal] London Sch Econ, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, London WC2A 2AE, England",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Piggins, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Galway, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",conal.duddy@gmail.com; ashley.piggins@nuigalway.ie,"Duddy, Conal/IYS-6034-2023","Duddy, Conal/0000-0002-7801-9305",,,,,16,2,3,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2012,39.0,2-3,,,SI,,353.0,369,,10.1007/s00355-011-0630-6,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,968FR,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305963200007,0

The theoretical basis for our tests comes from the overvaluation conditions created by a combination of costly short selling and heterogeneous beliefs. This article exploits the unique characteristics of REITS as they are similar with respect to high dividend payouts and differentiated by underlying real asset investments. An innovative aspect of the methodology involves partitioning firms based on investment focus as a proxy for transparency and as a determinant of heterogeneous beliefs regarding valuation. The findings (i) affirm the information content of REIT short interest and (ii) highlight the importance of investment focus in resolving the divergence in investor opinions of value. Overvaluation conditions exist among REITs with greater short interest and less transparency, whereas such valuation conditions do not appear among transparent REITs, regardless of the level of short selling.","[Chen, Honghui] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Finance, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Downs, David H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Patterson, Gary A.] Univ S Florida, Dept Finance, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Virginia Commonwealth University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Chen, HH (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Dept Finance, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",hchen@bus.ucf.edu; dhdowns@vcu.edu; pattersg@mail.usf.edu,"Chen, Honghui/F-5048-2012",,,,,,30,23,24,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2012,40.0,2,,,,,249.0,283,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2011.00312.x,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,945YL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304313400003,0

The series of four reforms has radically changed the face of the CAP and today we are moving to a new act on this long road, but one which seems set in a vet), different scenario from that experienced in the past. We present the reasons and implications of the unusual scenario in which the post-2013 CAP is set. An era of declining prices had accompanied the so-called green revolution and the formulas used in government intervention to stabilize agricultural markets had been rendered anachronistic. Today the situation is different and the rise and volatility in agricultural commodity prices recorded in recent years are pushing us towards a horizon of systematic market instability, in which the issue of security of supply has returned to the top of the agenda. In this context, we emphasized both the new institutional framework into which the reform is set, and the 2020 Strategy and the financial prospects of Europe against the backdrop of the economic crisis. We analyzed in details the key points of the Commission's proposal, in the light of the evolution of the economic and institutional scenario, underlining the implications of the reform proposal for the Mediterranean areas.","[De Castro, Paolo; Adinolfi, Felice; Di Pasquale, Jorgelina] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Capitanio, Fabian] Univ Naples Federico II, I-80138 Naples, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Naples Federico II,"De Castro, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",,"Capitanio, Fabian/E-7806-2011; Capitanio, Fabian/J-2815-2016","Capitanio, Fabian/0000-0003-0327-8019; ADINOLFI, FELICE/0000-0002-8181-5492",,,,,22,13,13,0,25,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2012,11.0,2,,,,,4.0,11,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,003SD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308630700002,0

Three features are incorporated into the proposed model. First, default is a Poisson jump process defined by a function of mortgage rating information. Second, property risks are modeled using a high dimensional Brownian motion process that captures both systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk in property value. Third, default dependence structure is built into the extended model. Based on a set of input parameters, we simulate various pricing effects on a hypothetical CMBS using the proposed model structure. The results of the base-line intensity model show that yield spreads on CMBS bonds increase in the recovery rate, but decreases in the hazard rate. Security structured with smaller subordination tranche exposes CMBS bonds to higher default risks. The model predicts that default clustering increases required yield spreads of CMBS bonds. At a 70% recovery rate and a 3% default hazard rate, yield spreads of Junior bonds are expected to increase by 169 basis points when counterparty risks increase by 50%. The results highlight the importance of clustering risks associated with counterparty default when valuing CMBS bonds.","[Sing, Tien Foo; Ong, Seow Eng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Sch Design & Environm, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Fan, Gang-Zhi] Konkuk Univ, Dept Real Estate, Seoul 143701, South Korea",National University of Singapore; Konkuk University,"Sing, TF (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Sch Design & Environm, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",rststf@nus.edu.sg,"Ong, Seow Eng/ABB-9098-2020; Sing, Tien Foo/J-9381-2013","Sing, Tien Foo/0000-0002-4101-851X",,,,,37,5,6,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The latest example is the Policy Support Instrument (PSI), a certification mechanism established in 2005 for which only poor members are eligible. Based on a formal game-theoretic model, I argue that it is unlikely that the PSI will serve well the intention of facilitating capital market access for members requesting the service. Their low income, the lack of significant consequences for markets, the IMF's traditional reluctance to criticize members, as well as the need to promote the use of the new arrangement indicate that the Fund could emphasize participants' welfare over the interests of private lenders. The continued importance of foreign aid in eligible countries also puts the IMF in the role of gatekeeping such flows, which might conflict with sending clear signals to commercial actors. All these reasons imply that in many cases its seal of approval will be of little use to third-parties, despite the high standards to which PSI-countries are supposed to adhere. The best argument in favor of the PSI being a useful addition to the Fund's tool kit for low-income members is the fact that several countries have already signed a second one.","Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, N-5007 Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Hagen, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, Fosswinckelsgate 14, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",Rune.Hagen@econ.uib.no,"Hagen, Rune Jansen/I-8522-2019",,,,,,50,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

A disclosure law may address the information asymmetry in housing transactions shifting risk from buyers and brokers to the sellers and raising housing prices as a result. We combine propensity score techniques from the treatment effects literature with a traditional event study approach. We assemble a unique set of economic and institutional attributes for a quarterly panel of 291 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) across 50 US States spanning 21 years from 1984 to 2004. The study finds that the average sales price of houses in a metropolitan area increases by an additional 3 to 4% over a 4 year period if the state adopts a Property Condition Disclosure Law, which is consistent with approximately a 19 basis point or 6.4% reduction in the risk premium associated with purchasing owner-occupied housing. When we compare the results from parametric and semi-parametric (propensity score) event analyses, we find that the semi-parametric analysis generates moderately larger estimated effects of the law on housing prices.","[Nanda, Anupam] Hiranandani Meadows, Bombay 400607, Maharashtra, India; [Ross, Stephen L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Nanda, A (通讯作者)，Hiranandani Meadows, 101 Meridian, Bombay 400607, Maharashtra, India.",nanda.anupam@gmail.com,"Nanda, Anupam/L-4226-2019","Nanda, Anupam/0000-0002-3036-5890",,,,,38,30,33,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This paper analyzes the private returns to these investments, evaluating the premium in asset values they command in the market. We analyze almost 37,000 transactions in the Singapore housing market to estimate the economic impact of the Green Mark program on Singapore's residential sector. We adopt a two-stage research design; in the first stage, a hedonic pricing model is estimated based on transactions involving green and non-green residential units in 697 individual projects or estates. In the second stage, the fixed effects estimated for each project are regressed on the location attributes of the projects, as well as control variables for a Green Mark rating. Our results suggest that the economic returns to green building are substantial. This is one of the first analyses of the economics of green building in the residential sector, and the only one analyzing property markets in Asia. Our results provide insight about the operation of the housing market in one country, but the policy implications about the economic returns to sustainable investments in the property market may have broader applications for emerging markets in Asia.

Coherence and Effectiveness in European Union Foreign Policy,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT; VOICE,"Although scholars and practitioners have long argued that greater political coherence will make the European Union a more effective international actor, the relationship between coherence and effectiveness has not been well defined or tested. This article defines the two concepts, proposes three hypotheses regarding the relationship between them, and examines the extent and consequences of EU coherence on an issue that the EU has highlighted as essential to its foreign policy mission: the good functioning of the International Criminal Court (ICC). It finds that the EU exhibited considerable coherence in its response to the United States' campaign for ICC 'nonsurrender agreements', yet failed in its effort to shape the behaviour of other states. Coherence may be necessary for the EU to exert its influence abroad, but it is not sufficient in a multi-centric world order where many others do not share the EU's collective policy preferences and are ready to deploy vast resources in pursuit of their goals. The article also considers the implications of this study for future research on EU foreign policy actorness, coherence and effectiveness.","Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Thomas, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland.",daniel.thomas@ucd.ie,,,,,,,35,83,86,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

It is not clear whether this holds for men with an immigrant background and whether differences in employment positions and earnings between men of different ethnic origins are more or less pronounced in female-traditional occupations than in male-traditional professions. This article compares individuals educated in nursing and engineering (i.e. archetypical examples of female- and male-traditional professions, respectively). Results show that findings based on men with a majority ethnic background cannot be generalized to male immigrants. Differences in the likelihood of being employed outside professional nursing and engineering are pronounced between native-born Norwegian men and men with a non-western immigrant background.

The methodology proposed in this article is easy to implement and provides more accurate estimates of the standard errors of returns under serial correlation. The repeat-sales methodology is generally used to construct an index of prices or returns for unique, infrequently traded assets such as houses, art and musical instruments, which are likely to be prone to exhibit serial correlation in returns.

Using a large panel of firm-level data for the EU, we are able to examine not only the aggregate factor content of trade but also to identify differences in the factor of trade between heterogenous firms. Our empirical results suggest that because of transaction costs and market imperfections, the factor content of agricultural trade is heavily distorted in the CEE transition economies.

Our results provide evidence that equipment investment and exports are two of the most important determinants of both labour productivity and output in the long run even after controlling for other sources of growth in China.

A key issue is how such an agenda can be advanced that does not compromise the integrity of the researcher or the quality of research output. This, we argue, is worth exploring as a means for putting union research onto a more interventionist footing.

There are basically two reasons for being concerned with this. One is that a small number of companies may have exclusive access to first rate sites for wind power generation. The other is that withdrawal of a small number of TGCs implies a multiple reduction of electricity consumption, with corresponding increases of end user prices. We formulate both an analytical model to investigate economic principles and a numerical model based on that to investigate the Swedish TGC market operating in a setting of a common Nordic electricity market. The analysis shows that Swedish producers may exercise market power using the TGC-market but that this problem will be eliminated by opening the TGC-market for other Nordic countries.","[Amundsen, Eirik S.] Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Bergman, Lars] Stockholm Sch Econ, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Bergen; Stockholm School of Economics,"Amundsen, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, Fosswinckelgate 6, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",eirik.amundsen@econ.uib.no; Lars.Bergman@hhs.se,"Amundsen, Eirik S./E-4986-2015","Amundsen, Eirik S./0000-0002-0090-4996",SNF; Elforsk; Nordic Energy Research Program; EU Commission,SNF; Elforsk; Nordic Energy Research Program; EU Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors are grateful to Gjermund Nese, SNF for compiling cost data and updating the numerical model, and to SNF, Elforsk and the Nordic Energy Research Program for financial support.

The decision rule that governs the collective action of a voting body induces a hierarchy in the set of players in terms of the a-priori influence that the players have over the decision making process. In order to determine this hierarchy in a swap robust game, one has to either evaluate a power index (e.g., the Shapley-Shubik index, the Banzhaf-Coleman index) for each player or conduct a pairwise comparison between players, whereby a player i is ranked higher than another player j if there exists a coalition in which i is more desirable as a coalition partner than j. In this paper, we outline an alternative mechanism to determine the ranking of players in terms of their a-priori power. This simple and elegant method uses only minimal winning coalitions, rather than the entire set of winning coalitions.","[Roy, Sonali] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Bishnu, Monisankar] Indian Stat Inst, Planning Unit, New Delhi 110016, India",Iowa State University; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi,"Roy, S (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",mbishnu@iastate.edu; sroy@iastate.edu,,"Bishnu, Monisankar/0000-0003-2034-8066",,,,,18,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2012,38.0,1,,,,,11.0,22,,10.1007/s00355-010-0504-3,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,859AM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297846100002,0

Therefore, crisis management is aimed at indentifying problems and finding effective solutions to promote economic development during the recession. The current global economic crisis, as well as the perennial Croatia's economic crisis, Sets a number of challenges for the creation of adequate tourism policy. Incentive impulse of economic policy leaders is slow to reflect on the tourism aggregate, so a valid question is: is it not to late for the blue ocean strategy. The concept of socially responsible business forms latest trends in tourism development that should be considered in the context of the development of tourism and the latest economic and socio-cultural trends. Changes in the global tourism market had a lesser effect on the intensity of travel and more on the structure of tourism consumption. Croatian tourism has good foundation in its selective forms for development in times of crisis, by that thinking of the attractive tourist potential, unique natural and culturo-historical heritage. Focus of tourism is moving from sun and sea to the cities as centers of cultural development of regions. It is necessary to more intensively evaluate this potential in order to create a recognizable identity of Croatian tourist offer which would increase the competitiveness and facilitate market positioning. Key hypothesis of this paper is that Croatian tourism should focus on developing centers (cities) and their cultural tourism, which is becoming the main motivator of arrivals to destinations and the initiator of tourism development within the whole region. The study was conducted on 25 town's tourist associations in Croatia. Aim is to point out that the responsible management and crisis management in the recessionary economic environment is requirement for the competitiveness of tourist destinations and potential opening of blue ocean to Croatian tourism.","[Blazevic, Zrinka; Tubic, Dejan; Brdar, Mladen] Virovit Coll, Virovitica, Croatia",,,zrinka.blazevic@gmail.com; dejan.tubic@vsmti.hr; mladen-brdar@live.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,6,35,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,207.0,215,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600023,0

The increasing demands of tourism consumers initiated the development of specific forms of tourism which are trying to, through organizing special forms of rest, recreation experiences, experiences, and other special facilities, adjust the travel and tourism product offer to immediate tourists, or a specific group of tourists. Consequently, it can be said that modern tourism development which is characterized by, among other things, segmentation and directing of tourist demand toward specific forms of tourism represents an opportunity for the development of river tourism as one of the specific forms of tourism. Despite the fact that the rivers are still highly neglected aspect of the global tourism industry, in recent times interests of tourists for river tourism is growing. Rivers as complex ecosystems affect many human businesses, including tourism. With the main activities that take place on rivers such as cruises, sailing and rafting, the attractiveness of its banks as diverse landscapes, and rich cultural - historical heritage of the nearby towns should be pointed out. When it comes to river tourism of eastern Croatia, and in general river Danube should be noted since it has a central role in river cruise market. Also, for the development of this form of tourism there are also potentials on the rivers Sava and Drava. Therefore, the fundamental purpose of this paper is to analyze the opportunities and constraints for tourism development on eastern Croatian rivers and provide guidance for further development of this form of tourism. The work will by interviews with operators of the tourism industry gather information needed to identify the key elements of offer of river tourism. Since the current potential for the development of river tourism is not evaluated properly and no proper infrastructures were built, offers of additional services as well as a recognizable tourist product of river tourism, based on the results of research recommendations will be defined for the sustainable development of river tourism, with emphasis on eastern Croatia.","[Bosnic, Irena] Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Virovitica 33000, Croatia",,,irena.bosnic@vsmti.hr,"Bosnić, Irena/JHS-4977-2023",,,,,,9,0,0,1,13,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,216.0,222,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600024,0

Klein's claim is that his empirical model (the Klein-Goldberger model) vindicates Keynes's theoretical insights, in particular the existence of involuntary unemployment. While praising Klein for having succeeded in making Keynesian theory empirical and dynamic, we argue that he paid a high price for this achievement. Klein and Goldberger's model is less Keynesian than they claim.

These goals are difficult to implement not only because they are expensive public goods but in addition their enforcement is typically at variance with powerful interests in the political settlements of developing countries. The historical evidence and much institutional theory suggests that during their social transformations successful developing countries had a different set of 'developmental' or 'growth-enhancing' governance capabilities that enabled their states to support critical property rights transformations and assist firms in acquiring and learning to use new technology. The institutions and policies they used differed because their political and institutional starting points were different. There are therefore no blueprints for Africa or anywhere else, but certainly the good governance menu is unrealistic. Rather African countries have to experiment and develop institutional and policy solutions that work in their context and which are appropriate for transforming property rights and accelerating technology adoption.","Univ London, Dept Econ, SOAS, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Khan, MH (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Econ, SOAS, London WC1H 0XG, England.",mk100@soas.ac.uk,"Khan, Mushtaq/JZD-4163-2024",,,,,,15,9,11,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The popularity of using the principles of lean production in the Czech Republic is gradually increasing, not only in the automotive industry but also in other sectors. The trend of downsizing not only production processes leads mainly to changes in the work of employees. The enforcement and subsequently the introduction of lean thinking principles into the company are primarily dependent on human resources. It can thus be unambiguously stated that on the loyalty and hard work of people in the company depends also their subsequent success. The methodology used to create the article is based mainly on data collection and research of secondary and primary data.

Yet capitalism is not monolithic. The Varieties of Capitalism approach suggests that capitalist states fall within a spectrum between liberal market economies (LMEs) and coordinated market economies (CMEs). How do the relative styles of technological innovation in LMEs versus CMEs affect their ability to reduce carbon emissions? This article addresses this question by investigating the relative technological styles and strengths of LMEs and CMEs, and comparing them to the technological development needed to combat climate change. While technological change in CMEs tends to be more incremental, LMEs, with their greater orientation to competitive markets, are said to better support radical technological change. This article finds that the US's LME variety of capitalism hampers its ability to address climate change by comparison to CMEs such as Germany and Japan, and therefore suggests that the US's lack of leadership on climate change is as much a consequence of its variety of capitalism as an absence of political will.","[Mikler, John] Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Harrison, Neil E.] Sustainable Dev Insitute, Laramie, WY USA",University of Sydney,"Mikler, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, 253 Merewether Bldg H04, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",john.mikler@sydney.edu.au; harrison@sd-institute.org,"Harrison, Neil/A-5704-2010","Harrison, Neil/0000-0002-9597-1998",,,,,161,43,46,2,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In this article, we consider the mathematical approach to building dynamic economics developed in the us in the twenties and in Italy in the following decade by mathematicians and economists with substantial mathematical and statistical backgrounds. Despite important differences, the versions developed in the us and Italy can be treated jointly because they shared the same view of dynamics as an equilibrium phenomenon. In the us, in a context still largely dominated by institutionalism, the dynamic equilibrium approach was carried forward by two mathematicians, G. Evans and Ch. F. Roos. In Italy, this strand of analysis became the principal area of inquiry for the Paretian School, which during the 19305 made major contributions through L. Amoroso and G. La Volpe. In attempting to dynamize general equilibrium theory, these authors made important contributions mainly in mathematical terms, introducing functional calculus in economic dynamics, a tool that in the postwar period proved essential for research in this field of inquiry.","Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali M Fanno, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Pomini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali M Fanno, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",mario.pomini@unipd.it,,"POMINI, Mario/0000-0001-5046-2228",,,,,52,1,1,0,6,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

To test the stability of rupiah after monetary and fiscal liberalization, we employed the Chow test. The results revealed that the rupiah was overshooting during the crisis' period and there was a structural change of rupiah after 1998. Due to the significant effects of interest rate and exchange rate on the currency stability, it is important to the Indonesia's monetary institution to be aware of these two variables, especially in stabilizing the economic performance after the financial liberalization.

These are examined to uncover the causes of legislative zigzags and ascertain the applicability of existing citizenship theories to Russian realities.","Tufts Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Shevel, O (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",Oxana.shevel@tufts.edu,"Shevel, Oxana/ABB-6836-2020","Shevel, Oxana/0000-0003-2318-7798",,,,,67,18,19,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Although the dedicated international literature is highly diverse and there is nothing like a unified concept of innovation that has been developed, some common approaches can be identified. A key feature of the core literature is that much of it is focusing on the key role of knowledge and innovation today as the most important engines of growth and development. Among policy specially dedicated to stimulate innovation and knowledge, education is considered an important way to empowering people to innovate. Entrepreneurial education is very important to support the innovation. It challenges also the traditional business models by highlighting the importance of the innovation driven business model. The paper presents the open innovation model targeting the crowd sourcing method developed by NineSigma, known also as Linked Innovation.

Aspects for an emerging structure of global governance are congealing into a form of 'financial governmentality' as a means to secure society and to isolate criminal and terrorist money. Efforts to defend society from organised crime and transnational terrorism extend into financial services and introduce increased levels of surveillance over all forms of financial exchange. The paper begins with an explication for the power relations between international organisations (created by select states to manage and direct the global economy) and the non-member jurisdictions that are, in turn, subjected to their guidance. The experience of the Philippines with the international campaign against money laundering directed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is presented as a case study for the governmentality present in global financial governance. Initially the Philippine government sought to retain a measure of autonomous action while satisfying the FATF's demands for legislative change. The initial failure to meet the expectations of international standards impacted international financial flows to the Philippines, including migrant remittances. It was with this specific experience in mind that the government of the Philippines crafted new regulations to cover emerging technologies that facilitate money transfer via mobile phone, positioning the Philippines as the leader for this form of governance to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, this case represents an emerging practice for self-discipline by states seeking to demonstrate compliance with internationally produced standards and best practices for banking and finance.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Int Relat, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Vlcek, W (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Int Relat, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",,,"Vlcek, William/0000-0001-8647-5258",,,,,74,12,15,0,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The report highlights Cambodia's rapid economic growth after one of the world's worst cases of genocide in the second half of the twentieth century. This growth has been underpinned by open trade and investment policies, in the context of dynamic neighbourhood growth effects. The trade regime is mainly tariff-based, with modest intersectoral variations in rates. Cambodia has limited trade policy space. It is a signatory to the 10-nation ASEAN Free Trade Agreement, soon to become the ASEAN Economic Community. Moreover, given its long and porous borders with the much larger, dynamic economies of Thailand and Vietnam, any major cross-border price differences will quickly result in informal trade with these economies, and nearby China. Most of the country's trade policy challenges are to do with behind-the-border' issues, a legacy of its generation of civil war and conflict. These include weak bureaucratic capacity, high levels of corruption, poor infrastructure and limited human capital.","[Hill, Hal] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Menon, Jayant] Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Manila, Philippines",Australian National University; Asian Development Bank,"Hill, H (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,13,14,17,2,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2014,37.0,12,,,SI,,1649.0,1668,,10.1111/twec.12206,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AW4KC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346249000001,0

As an example, to stimulate sales of energy efficient vehicles (EEVs) in Sweden, some of these automobiles were exempted from Stockholm's congestion tax. In this paper the effect this policy had on the demand for new, privately-owned, exempt EEVs is assessed by first estimating a model of vehicle choice and then by applying this model to simulate vehicle alternative market shares under different policy scenarios. The database used to calibrate the model includes owner-specific demographics merged with vehicle registry data for all new private vehicles registered in Stockholm County during 2008. Characteristics of individuals with a higher propensity to purchase an exempt EEV were identified. The most significant factors included intra-cordon residency (positive), distance from home to the CBD (negative), and commuting across the cordon (positive). By calculating vehicle shares from the vehicle choice model and then comparing these estimates to a simulated scenario where the congestion tax exemption was inactive, the exemption was estimated to have substantially increased the share of newly purchased, private, exempt EEVs in Stockholm by 1.8% (+/- 0.3%; 95% C.I.) to a total share of 18.8%. This amounts to an estimated 10.7% increase in private, exempt EEV purchases during 2008, i.e.; 519 privately owned, exempt EEVs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper distinguishes between the commutes performed by residents and those generated by the jobs located in a municipality. The contribution of the paper is twofold. Firstly, it shows that the CO2 emissions of commutes differ greatly depending on whether one considers residents or jobs: hence focusing on the travel behaviour of residents can lead to significant errors in the assessment of the CO2 emissions generated by a municipality, and therefore its environmental sustainability. Secondly, the paper explores the relationship between commuting trips and several indicators of urban form: density, compactness, jobs-to-residents ratio, accessibility to public transport and distance from Paris. We highlight that high jobs-to-residents ratios tend to increase the proportion of jobs held by residents. Density and compactness are associated with more sustainable travel behaviour among residents, but not non-residents. Finally, the shape of the public transport system, which mainly connects the municipalities of the NTMV with Paris, tends to decrease the proportion of jobs held by residents, especially in the municipalities that are close to Paris, and does not allow nonresidents, most of whom do not travel from Paris, to use public transport.

In contrast to this federal law, several states have passed legislation explicitly allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates. We use a difference-in-difference estimation methodology to assess some of the intended and unintended consequences of this tuition policy. Consistent with past studies, we find evidence of increases in postsecondary enrollment rates of Mexican non-citizens in treatment states relative to control states that are not accompanied by reductions in enrollment rates of natives. Additionally, the empirical evidence suggests that the granting of instate tuition for undocumented immigrants might be associated with increased tuition and fees at flagship universities and comprehensive schools, though it does not appear to have raised tuition at community colleges. Finally, the largest costs of these state-level policies seem to be borne by non-Mexican foreign-born groups, many of which have seen lower enrollment rates coupled with increased borrowing to fund their schooling. Some of the enrollment and tuition results are sensitive to the inclusion of state-specific time trends, however. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By eliminating passport requirements for workers, the compact ostensibly produces gains from travel, ease of market access and economies of scale. Yet despite these optimistic predictions, scholars know little about the actual effects of Schengen on trade. We fill this void by identifying why labour mobility should expand the cross-country exchange of goods and services and then test our theory with data from Europe spanning the period 1980 to 2011. We argue that labour mobility resulting from Schengen yields positive effects on trade by increasing demand for foreign goods, improving awareness of low-cost producers abroad and lowering the risks associated with buying and selling outside the country. Using the gravity model of trade, we show empirically that Schengen membership makes European states more robust trading partners.","[Davis, Dane] CRU Grp, London, England; [Gift, Thomas] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC USA",Duke University,"Davis, D (通讯作者)，CRU Grp, London, England.",,,,,,,,29,12,14,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2014,37.0,11,,,,,1541.0,1557,,10.1111/twec.12158,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AU3JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345510100003,0

Then the analysis is extended to derive the pass-on rates and activity reductions caused by an output tax when firms care both about profit and consumer surplus, produce symmetrically differentiated services and compete simultaneously in quantities and fare and when they collude. The pass-on rates and activity reductions are highest under collusion and lowest under Coumot competition when they produce complementary services. When they produce substitute services, the result is ambiguous and the competitive situation that yields highest pass-on depends on the firms' objective functions and how fiercely they compete. Two important counterintuitive results are that the more intensely the firms compete and the more weight they put on consumer surplus, the higher the pass-on rates are. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This legislative proposal is puzzling since it moves the centre of decision-making regarding the cultivation of GMOs from the EU level back to the domestic level and it also contradicts the generally acknowledged behaviour of the Commission as a competence maximizer. Using a multilevel governance perspective and based on an extensive literature review and semi-structured interviews, the article examines the dynamics and relationships between the various levels of governance that generated pressures on the Commission to issue this counterintuitive proposal. The findings suggest that the Commission is making a (necessary) trade-off between, on the one hand, the respect of international obligations and the preservation of the internal market, and on the other hand, internal pressures towards stricter regulation of GMOs.","[Randour, Francois; Delreux, Tom] Univ Louvain, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Janssens, Cedric] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Randour, F (通讯作者)，Univ Louvain, Inst Sci Polit Louvain Europe ISPOLE, Coll Jacques Leclercq, Pl Montesquieu,1-L 2-08-07, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",francois.randour@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,45,5,5,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The core idea is to use the Path Flow Estimator (PFE) to estimate current and forecast future traffic demand while taking into account of various field and planning data as modeling constraints. Specifically, two versions of PFE are developed: a base year PEE for estimating the current network traffic conditions using field data and planning data, if available, and a future year PFE for predicting future network traffic conditions using forecast planning data and the estimated base year origin-destination trip table as constraints. In the absence of travel survey data, the proposed method uses similar data (traffic counts and land use data) as a four-step model for model development and calibration. Since the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates and Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) are both utilized in the modeling process, the analysis scope and results are consistent with those of common traffic impact studies and other short-range, localized transportation improvement programs. Solution algorithms are also developed to solve the two PFE models and integrated into a GIS-based software called Visual PFE. For proof of concept, two case studies in northern California are performed to demonstrate how the tool can be used in practice. The first case study is a small community of St. Helena, where the city's planning department has neither an existing travel demand model nor the budget for developing a full four-step model. The second case study is in the city of Eureka, where there is a four-step model developed for the Humboldt County that can be used for comparison. The results show that the proposed approach is applicable for small communities with limited resources.

The analysis indicates considerable differences between these three groups of countries and shows that over time Europeanization served as an intra-cohort mechanism of social change: it smoothed over intergenerational differences and led to a trend of convergence in values between new Eastern members of the EU and Western Europe. Europeanization also appears to have some harmonizing power on intergenerational differences in countries with EU membership prospects. At the same time, the rough post-communist transition process and the lack of consolidation mechanisms created considerable intergenerational differences in European countries without EU membership prospects, as revealed by the dominance of cohort replacement mechanism in these countries.","[Turkina, Ekaterina] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Surzhko-Harned, Lena] Mercyhurst Coll, Erie, PA USA",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Turkina, E (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Int Business, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",ekaterina.turkina@hec.ca,,"Surzhko Harned, Lena/0000-0001-7329-4108",,,,,36,7,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Regarding the debate on optimal market structures in German potable water supply, we use a cross-sectional sample of 364 German water utilities observed in 2006 to derive a nonparametric measure of scale elasticity for the water industry. The data sample is validated by applying a super-efficiency approach and a statistical testing procedure for outlier detection. Besides using a standard data envelopment analysis approach, a conditional efficiency approach is applied to account for the water utilities' operating environments. The results indicate non-decreasing returns to scale for the majority of water utilities and constant or non-increasing returns for larger utilities. Optimal firm size is found to be generally larger than the current sample median firm size. Efficiency improvements could be realized by increases in firm sizes and through a consolidation of the industry.","DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Zschille, M (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",mzschille@diw.de,,,,,,,83,12,12,0,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Lagged firm-level information also improves aggregate productivity forecasts when we combine results from a variety of different multivariate forecasting models using Bayesian model averaging techniques.","[Bartelsman, Eric J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bartelsman, Eric J.] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bartelsman, Eric J.] IZA, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wolf, Zoltan] US Bur Census, Suitland, MD USA",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Bartelsman, EJ (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"Bartelsman, Eric/ABE-2895-2021","Bartelsman, Eric/0000-0001-7099-8513",,,,,37,13,14,1,21,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

A good illustration is home care in Japan where the government introduced a Long Term Care Insurance scheme (LTCI) (2000) focused on offering affordable almost universal care by extending existing home care services. Japan's home care services were privatized in 2006 and, while this is not unique to Japan, the combination of cost-cutting measures and the client-driven model encompassed in the LTCI has had a significant impact on employment conditions and the organization of work in home care services. This research assesses the impact on employment conditions and the organization of work in Japan's former government-run home care sector compared with the pre-LTCI period and argues that privatization has resulted in work intensification and deteriorating employment conditions.","Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Broadbent, K (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",k.broadbent@griffith.edu.au,,,Australian Federal Government,Australian Federal Government(Australian Government),The research for this article was funded by the Australian Federal Government through the Endeavour Award scheme.,,49,12,13,1,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, which include a numerical measure of subjective survival probability, are used to estimate a joint recursive system of equations that describe the relationships among survival expectations, subjective health status and smoking duration. A finite mixture model is used to address endogeneity and unobservable heterogeneity. This approach allows for two types of individuals with different observable characteristics to be identified in the examined population. We find that only in the population of the first type, current and former smokers incorporate the effects of smoking duration into their assessments of survival probabilities. For both types, quitting smoking affects current perceptions of smoking risks, causing the overestimation of both survival probability and subjective health.","[Balia, Silvia] Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Balia, Silvia] CRENoS, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Balia, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Viale S Ignazio 78, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",silvia.balia@unica.it,,"Balia, Silvia/0000-0003-0154-4942",,,,,60,16,17,0,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Nurul",,,Assessing social equity in distance based transit fares using a model of travel behavior,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Distance based fares; Social equity; Transit; Spatial expansion; Ordinal/continuous model,ELASTIC DEMAND; POVERTY; TOOL,"The goal of this study is to develop and apply a new method for assessing social equity impacts of distance-based public transit fares. Shifting to a distance-based fare structure can disproportionately favor or penalize different subgroups of a population based on variations in settlement patterns, travel needs, and most importantly, transit use. According to federal law, such disparities must be evaluated by the transit agency, but the area-based techniques identified by the Federal Transit Authority for assessing discrimination fail to account for disparities in distances travelled by transit users. This means that transit agencies currently lack guidelines for assessing the social equity impacts of replacing flat fare with distance-based fare structures. Our solution is to incorporate a joint ordinal/continuous model of trip generation and distance travelled into a GIS Decision Support System. The system enables a transit planner to visualize and compare distance travelled and transit-cost maps for different population profiles and fare structures. We apply the method to a case study in the Wasatch Front, Utah, where the Utah Transit Authority is exploring a switch to a distance-based fare structure. The analysis reveals that overall distance-based fares benefit low-income, elderly, and non-white populations. However, the effect is geographically uneven, and may be negative for members of these groups living on the urban fringe. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This article locates the origins of these features in the historical processes towards the 1991 social partners' agreement through some primary and secondary documents as well as a series of structured questionnaire studies and hearings. It is discussed that, contrary to what some conventional interpretations assume, the social protocol was an original model of horizontal subsidiarity, with actors' different preferences on the desirability of labour market order governed by both legislation and negotiations in its background.","Toyohashi Sozo Univ, Toyohashi, Aichi 4408511, Japan",,"Nakano, S (通讯作者)，Toyohashi Sozo Univ, 20-1 Ushikawa Cho, Toyohashi, Aichi 4408511, Japan.",nakano@sozo.ac.jp,,,,,,,48,4,4,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The issue is of particular interest for those monetary authorities that target headline consumer price inflation, which has been heavily influenced by pronounced swings in international commodity prices in the past decade. The empirical analysis is based on two distinct but complementary approaches. We first use a structural model, identify a shock to commodity prices and check through formal econometric tests whether the Impulse Response Functions of food consumer prices is invariant to the sign of the commodity price shock. Next, we employ predictive regressions and examine the relative forecasting ability of linear models with respect to that of models that allow for sign-dependent nonlinearities. Overall, the empirical analysis uncovers very little evidence of asymmetries.","[Porqueddu, Mario; Venditti, Fabrizio] Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Venditti, F (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",fabrizio.venditti@bancaditatia.it,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

This article examines the influence of entrepreneurship and technology concentration on employment growth in U.

The findings are in support of the efficacy of entrepreneurship together with high technology expansion in job creation. The findings question the view that entrepreneurship in and of itself, or a high but not growing high technology concentration, can be strong contributors to employment growth. In contrast, this analysis indicates that MSAs with growing high-tech activities and above-average entrepreneurship can be expected to add jobs much faster than other MSAs. The findings suggest a need for a more targeted approach to economic development and job creation.","[Gittell, Ross] Community Coll Syst New Hampshire, Concord, NH 03301 USA; [Sohl, Jeffrey] Univ New Hampshire, Ctr Venture Res, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Sohl, Jeffrey] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Tebaldi, Edinaldo] Bryant Univ, Smithfield, RI USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Bryant University,"Gittell, R (通讯作者)，Community Coll Syst New Hampshire, 28 Coll Rd, Concord, NH 03301 USA.",rgittell@ccsnh.edu,"Tebaldi, Edinaldo/D-6065-2019","Tebaldi, Edinaldo/0000-0003-3670-3245",,,,,37,7,8,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The segregation index is a generalization of the isolation index and a homophily index introduced in Currarini, Jackson, and Pin (2009), and it has a closed-form relation to PageRank that facilitates its computation. We also show that the Spectral Segregation Index proposed by Echenique and Fryer (2007) is not continuous with respect to the network structure.

Yet their overtly rationalist nature means that they may underestimate the contingent and socially constructed nature of integration principles and norms. One recent theory that tries to adopt a more socially nuanced explanation of task allocation is cryptofederalism. This article further develops its central arguments by adding insights drawn from social constructivism, then applying them to the animal welfare sector - a deeply controversial policy area where task allocation has always proven difficult to explain. It reveals that, once retooled', cryptofederalism adds a new but incomplete dimension to federal accounts of task allocation. Several scenarios of the potential future relationship between federalism and constructivism are then explored with respect to the changing mosaic' of European integration theory.","[Benson, David] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Exeter TR10 9EZ, Devon, England; [Benson, David] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Exeter TR10 9EZ, Devon, England; [Jordan, Andrew] Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter; University of East Anglia,"Benson, D (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Penryn Campus, Exeter TR10 9EZ, Devon, England.",d.i.benson@exeter.ac.uk,,,,,,,63,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Following the analysis of vote outcome and plenary debates in 11 euro states, it is found that the financial position of a state (creditors versus debtors) does not explain the patterns of support and opposition. Rather, two other factors account for these differences: Euroscepticism, and the government and opposition cleavage. In particular, whereas Eurosceptic MPs voted and argued against the EFSF, the parliamentary majorities supported it. Surprisingly, although the legal basis of the EFSF draws on solidarity among the European Union Member States, the supporters of the EFSF did not refer to this principle in their speeches but rather to pragmatic considerations such as national economic interests.","[Closa, Carlos; Maatsch, Aleksandra] CSIC, E-28037 Madrid, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC),"Closa, C (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies IPP CCHS, C Albasanz 26-28, E-28037 Madrid, Spain.",carlos.closa@csic.es,"Closa, Carlos/H-7863-2019; Closa, Carlos/F-2064-2011","Closa, Carlos/0000-0002-2935-1926; Maatsch, Aleksandra/0000-0002-0408-2176",,,,,30,44,45,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

To explore the comprehensive transmission mechanism of Takahashi's macroeconomic policy package, including the expectation channel, we construct a structural vector auto-regression (S-VAR) model with three state variables (output, price, and the inflation expectations) and three policy variables (fiscal balance, exchange rate, and money stock). Our analysis reveals that the exchange rate adjustment undertaken as an independent policy tool had the strongest effect, and that changes in people's expectations played a significant role for escaping from the Great Depression. During the second half of 1931, in particular, speculation on Japan's departure from the gold standard and the inflation that was likely to follow reversed the existing expectations: instead of expecting deflation, people began to expect inflation, months ahead of the actual departure from the gold standard. As a whole, the choice of the level of the exchange rate was crucial for changing people's expectations as well as promoting exports. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Secrecy becomes a danger when it undermines the very values invoked to protect it: democratic self-government and security.

The speculative component of the real price of oil is identified with the help of data on oil inventories. Our estimates rule out explanations of the 2003-2008 oil price surge based on unexpectedly diminishing oil supplies and based on speculative trading. Instead, this surge was caused by unexpected increases in world oil consumption driven by the global business cycle. There is evidence, however, that speculative demand shifts played an important role during earlier oil price shock episodes including 1979, 1986 and 1990. Our analysis implies that additional regulation of oil markets would not have prevented the 2003-2008 oil price surge. We also show that, even after accounting for the role of inventories in smoothing oil consumption, our estimate of the short-run price elasticity of oil demand is much higher than traditional estimates from dynamic models that do not account for for the endogeneity of the price of oil.

With rare exception, efforts to introduce significant reform in road pricing, aimed at raising sufficient revenue to ensure that road investment and ongoing maintenance is secured, without an additional impost to users above current outlays, while at the same time reducing traffic congestion, has fallen largely on politically non-supportive ears. The big challenge is to convince politicians (and their advisers) that it is possible to reform road pricing so that users are made better off (at least the great majority) in terms of time spent travelling and monies outlaid, and that government secures growing levels of revenue, but with at least some funds being used to improve public transport and the existing road network. This paper identifies the major issues that make much of the academic research into road pricing somewhat limited in terms of achieving real change. Staging reform is an appealing way forward, but ensuring the order and timing of events to secure progress is the big challenge. We offer some suggestions, including some ideas on new language designed to increase the level of buy in, and recognise that progress through action will require compromises in respect of an 'ideal' economically efficient pricing reform agenda.

I find that the increasing earnings inequality of men and women is driven by both the transitory and permanent components of earnings. In addition, I find considerable differences in the earnings dynamics of men and women, that have been largely neglected in previous studies of earnings dynamics. The inequality among men is dominated by the permanent component. Conversely, permanent and transitory components are of comparable magnitudes to women. As a corollary, men experience more stable income paths but display larger permanent earnings differences. Women, on the other hand, face more unstable earnings profiles but show smaller permanent differences in earnings.","[Kassi, Otto] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Kassi, Otto] HECER, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Kässi, O (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.",otto.kassi@helsinki.fi,,"kassi, otto/0000-0002-8666-200X",,,,,35,2,2,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Six UK ports are selected for the analysis: Hull/Immingham, Liverpool, Felixstowe, Southampton, Dover and Bristol. Through an origin-destination analysis, the cost and CO(2)e impacts of UK port trade patterns are compared using the actual situation against three proposed Scenarios: (1) the re-direction of containers by a combined expansion of Hull and Immingham; Liverpool; and Bristol, (2) moving containers by rail facilitated via expanded capacity at Southampton, and (3) moving containers by rail through expanded capacity at Felixstowe.

The present paper asks how both transfer schemes should be optimally designed in a society where individuals differ in productivity and rationality. Rational agents (if not liquidity constrained) smooth consumption over lifetime while myopic agents suffer from self-control problems and overconsume in young age, even though, ex post they regret their earlier decisions. The government's aim is twofold. On the one hand, it wants to redistribute income from high- to low-productivity agents. On the other hand, it aims to secure old-age consumption possibilities for myopic agents. Analytical and numerical results show that, redistribution of the income tax scheme is increasing in society's prevalence of self-control problems while it is decreasing in the pension scheme. The two transfer schemes are perfect substitutes when individuals do not suffer from self-control problems.","Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Roeder, K (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Ludwigstr 28, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",kerstin.roeder@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,27,1,4,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2014,42.0,3,,,,,597.0,618,,10.1007/s00355-013-0743-1,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AD1XZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333028300005,0

To incorporate this competitive dimension, we assume that the pioneer may lose the competitive dividends if the real option is not exercised. According to Majd and pindyck (1987) (Journal of Financial Economics 18(1):7-27), in a real options context, dividends are the opportunity costs inherent in the decision to defer an investment project and so deferment implies the loss of project's cash flows. Concerning this, Trigeorgis (1996) (Real Options: Managerial Flexibility and Strategy in Resource Allocation, The MIT Press, Cambridge, (1996) incorporates the preemption effect through the competitive dividends which are the cash flows that can be eroded by anticipated competitive arrivals. In particular way, we propose the valuation of a pioneer's R&D investment assuming that the Development cost can be spent in two moments: or . If the Development cost is realized in no firms enters in the market since the rivals' R&D plan is not yet concluded otherwise, if the Development cost is delayed until time waiting better market conditions, other rivals may enter in the market and so the opportunity costs, namely dividends, increase. Moreover, we analyze the optimal timing to realize the Development investment, i.e. we determine the conditions for which the pioneer prefers to invest the Development cost at time l(2) or l(3).","Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, I-71100 Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia,"Villani, G (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Largo Papa Giovanni Paolo 2,1, I-71100 Foggia, Italy.",g.villani@unifg.it,,"VILLANI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-3024-436X",,,,,21,4,4,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The policy packaging process is divided into six stages, starting with (1) the definition of goals and objectives, (2) the creation of an inventory of measures, (3) the formulation and assessment of the initial package, (4) the modification of the initial package through adding, adjusting or removing measures, (5) package implementation, and finally (6) the monitoring and evaluation of the package. The process stands as a generic, comprehensive framework developed as a means of guiding policy formulation and increasing the likelihood of efficient, effective and acceptable policy interventions. The approach is compared to practice, examining whether it can support policy formulation in relation to the EU 2011 White Paper on transport. It shows that several principles of the design process are already reflected by the White Paper, with some important differences also observed. While objectives, targets, and an inventory of measures are part of the White Paper, policies recommended for implementation are treated separately as discrete interventions. The White Paper hence lacks examples or recommendations as to how various measures might be combined in order to achieve the policy objectives. Based on a policy example from the White Paper, it is attempted to apply the heuristic framework and offer recommendations on how to best construct a policy package. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis focuses on the long memory parameter d that allows us to obtain different convergence classifications depending on its value. Our analysis allows for the presence of smooth structural breaks and it does not rely on the use of a benchmark. Overall the evidence strongly points to the presence of a long memory process, where 0.5<1. The implication of our results is that we find long memory mean reverting convergence, something that is also consistent with Pesaran, M. H., R. P. Smith, T. Yamagata, and L. Hvozdyk. 2009. Pairwise Tests of Purchasing Power Parity. Econometric Reviews 28: 495-521. In explaining the speed of convergence as captured by the estimated long memory parameter d we find impediments to trade such as distance between neighboring countries and sticky prices to be mainly responsible for the slow adjustment of real exchange rates to PPP rather than nominal rates for all country groups but Asia, where the opposite is true.","[Stengos, Thanasis] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Yazgan, M.

This problem is one of the biggest problems in the European Union. Sources for financing energy efficiency projects could be represented as a part of the solution to this problem. Furthermore, solution key could be knowledge of housing sector structure and energy products that could be appropriate for households at risk of poverty. Countries in the region that are longer faced with this problem have developed a series of products, through which they encourage new investments, but also substantially reduce its impact. Croatia, as a new member of the European Union adopted The energy renovation of residential buildings in the area for the period from 2013th by 2020. Program is aimed at improving the energy performance of existing buildings in Croatia. Measures described in the Program are encouraging renewal of the outer shell (increase thermal protection of the outer shell and windows replacement) encouraging the replacement of the heating system (replacement of existing heating systems that use electricity or fossil fuels new systems with condensing gas boilers), and encouraging the use of renewable energy (installation of solar thermal collectors, heat pump installation and installation of small biomass stoves). The Program defines forms of financing these measures from the national level, but also the role of other stakeholders in their implementation. The question is if measures listed in the Program are for themselves sufficient to address the issue of energy poverty? Second question is if some other measures used in neighboring countries could be used in Croatia. This paper will analyze the measures implemented/ or measures that are planned to be implemented in Croatia. Further analysis will show measures implemented by countries in the region. After that further conclusion will be made about the possibility of extending the measures, or product that could be of interest to the target group.

The benefit of the globalization in economy of the country presents the issue not only between professionals and laics, but also in academics or people working in European or Word organizations. We expect rather positive influences of globalization in agrarian sector of Slovakia when it comes to increase of work productivity, work quality, enlargements of product lines, increase of export and increase of value of land in Slovakia. Indifferent effect of globalization is expected in prices of agri-food commodities. Negative effects will be translated into higher unemployment in agrarian sector of Slovakia and decreasing value of agrarian sector on GDP as well as remaining negative trade balance of Slovakia.","Metropolitan Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Metropolitan University Prague,"Cheben, J (通讯作者)，Metropolitan Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Cheben, Juraj/O-2699-2014","Cheben, Juraj/0000-0002-2624-8659",,,,,15,1,1,1,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,349.0,356,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900045,0

For the determination the index of economic development the three indicators were used: indicator of gross national income per capita, indicator of foreign direct investment per capita and indicator of employment. The research shows that the amount of foreign direct investment decreased in Estonia and the EU-27 significantly after year 2005 and global financial crisis that lowered common development of economic activities.

The indicator of foreign direct investment per capita in Latvia increased during all the analyzed period with the only exception in year 20092010, compared with the base year 2005 that did not negatively affect economic activities and index of economic activity. The indicator of foreign direct investment per capita in Lithuania increased in comparison with Latvia less, about 10-40 % each analyzed year, with the exception in year 2009-2010, when the level of foreign investment was bigger in Lithuania, due to this the index of economic development of Lithuania is smaller than this index in Latvia, but bigger than in base year 2005.","Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Ciburiene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,685.0,692,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900089,0

It extends the stochastic growth model developed in Binder and Pesaran (1999) by including oil exports as an additional factor in the capital accumulation process. The paper distinguishes between the two cases where the growth of oil income, g(o), is less than the natural growth rate (the sum of the population growth, n, and the growth of technical progress, g), and when g(o)g+n. Under the former, the effects of oil income on the economy's steady growth rate will vanish eventually, while under the latter oil income enters the long-run output equation with a coefficient which is equal to the share of capital if it is further assumed that the underlying production technology can be represented by a Cobb-Douglas production function. The long-run theory is tested using quarterly data on nine major oil economies. Overall, the test results support the long-run theory, with the existence of long-run relations between real output, foreign output and real oil income established for six of the nine economies considered.

Third party supporters normally have an incentive to vote strategically in the election by voting for one of the major candidates. But these voters would vote third party if the third party candidate is doing surprisingly well in the polls. Because voters are more likely to vote third party if the third party candidate is doing well in polls, voters who like the third party candidate best have an incentive to claim they will vote third party in the polls so that more voters will ultimately vote third party in the election. The differing incentives faced during polls and elections accounts for why third party candidates do better in polls than in elections.","Google Inc, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA",Google Incorporated,"Hummel, P (通讯作者)，Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA.",phummel@google.com,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2014,42.0,1,,,,,77.0,98,,10.1007/s00355-013-0724-4,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,294FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330028700004,0

In recent years, the competitiveness of the Russian Federation has been limited. For instance, the Global Competitiveness Index, calculated by experts at the World Economic Forum, shows slightly better competitiveness of the Russian economy. In 2013-2014, its 64th place is not very prestigious, although compared with the last year, Russia has climbed from the 67th position to the 64th one among 148 countries in the international ranking. Obviously, today our country is pursuing a path of unbalanced development, with its oil and gas industries still being key manufacturing areas. It is necessary to diversify production, create technology intensive products with high added value. This will not only improve the standard of living, but also ensure national security, and independence from world market conditions. However, accelerated productivity growth may lead to labor shortage. Therefore, there is a need for investments in human capital. It is the condition of human capital that shapes competitive strengths of nations in the globalizing world. According to the UN 2012-2013 report, Russia is listed in the group of countries with a high Human Development Index (HDI = 0.816 before calculation methods have been reviewed) and ranks 55th among 186 states. The position occupied by Russia among other countries such as Bahrain (48th), Belarus (50th), and the Republic of Palau (an island nation) (54th) and others, is not the most appealing in this ranking. The index value, that reflects the quality of life, has dropped to 0.788 after new indicators were introduced in the calculation methodology, which is associated not only with the worse education levels but shorter life expectancy as well. Thus, for the normal reproduction of workers, the state should assume part of investments in human capital. One of the target areas should become better public spending on housing and government support for development of this industry. To improve Russia's competitiveness and enter a new trajectory of sustainable growth, it is necessary to remember that increasing productivity and developing innovative economy require the primary focus on social and economic policies.",,,,,"Lenkovets, Olga/AAG-5877-2019; Kirsanova, Natalia/AAE-3479-2019","Lenkovets, Olga/0000-0003-4144-1331; Kirsanova, Natalia/0000-0003-1012-4763",,,,,6,2,2,1,9,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,413.0,420,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900053,0

Strictly speaking, just price isconceptually the same as the current market price. Of concern is whether the meaning behind the label is the same in both scholastic and liberal traditions. There are different interpretations among scholars. One is that the just price is merely the current market price, and common estimation plays the same role as market forces in a competitive context. Another group states that the just price is quite different from the market price; the fundamental reason is that the ethical framework of the scholastic paradigm sets a corpus of principles that greatly differs from the neoclassical homo economicus. Is it possible to speak of a collaborative market price (scholastic tradition) and competitive market price (liberal tradition)?

Despite their importance, obtaining a reasonable proxy for such expectations is a challenge. The existing literature on mortgage research either does not include housing expectation proxies in empirical models, or uses backward-looking proxies such as past housing appreciation or time series forecasts based on past housing appreciation. This paper proposes to use the transaction prices of Case-Shiller housing futures as an alternative forward-looking proxy. As an example, we compare the performances of four different expectation proxies in explaining mortgage default behavior. The loan level analysis shows that the futures based expectation proxy outperforms other proxies by having the highest regression model fit and being the only proxy that shows a significant negative effect on mortgage default behavior, as theory suggests. Out of sample predictions also show that futures have better prediction accuracy than other proxies. In addition, the paper shows that futures contain additional information that is not present in the backward-looking proxies.","[Zhu, Shuang] Kansas State Univ, Dept Finance, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Pace, R.

Metaphors inspire more specific analogies and ontological assumptions, and Marshall used the guiding metaphor of Spencerian evolution. But unfortunately, the further development of a Marshallian evolutionary approach was undermined in part by theoretical problems within Spencer's theory. Yet some things can be salvaged from the Marshallian evolutionary vision.

Stock market reactions to key events in the political conflict between 1995 and 2004 unravel whether investor beliefs about the distribution of power in the EU follow the basic conjectures of neofunctionalism, intergovernmentalism or institutionalism. The event studies show that particularly judicial proceedings and the involvement of the ECJ send credible integration signals to financial markets. This supports the hypothesis that investors consider the subtleties of the EU's decision-making apparatus carefully and only react to developments that definitively alter the political regime and thus also the market situation.

We test whether increasing shareholder control may be an effective checking mechanism to rein in such excessive risk-taking.

This analysis, drawing on the Regional Authority Index, is the first to use regional-level data disaggregating between regional authority as self-rule and shared-rule. It also uses data that measure the lobbying capacity of regions' Brussels-based lobbying offices. Controlling for a battery of competing and control variables, Tobit regression analyses of 181 regions receiving funds in the 2007-13 period suggest that regional authority expressed as shared-rule, but not self-rule, has a significant impact on the allocation of structural funds in the EU.","[Chalmers, Adam William] Leiden Univ, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Chalmers, AW (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands.",a.w.chalmers@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,"Yoon, DongJoon/E-9146-2014",,,,,,29,28,30,0,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Drivers have general scheduling preferences for time spent at home and at work They independently choose morning departure times from home to maximize expected utility without knowing whether an incident has occurred. The resulting departure time pattern may be compressed or dispersed according to whether or not the bottleneck is fully utilized throughout the departure period on days without incidents. For both the user equilibrium (UE) and the social optimum (SO) the departure pattern changes from compressed to dispersed when the probability of an incident becomes sufficiently high. The SO can be decentralized with a time-varying toll, but drivers are likely to be strictly worse off than in the UE unless they benefit from the toll revenues in some way. A numerical example is presented for illustration. Finally, the model is extended to encompass minor incidents in which the bottleneck retains some capacity during an incident. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The main conclusion of this paper is that the impact of immigration on welfare systems is weak. Thus, if we compare, on a given date, immigrants' global contribution to the public administration budget with the volume of transfers they receive, immigrants appear to be relatively favoured by the redistribution system. At the same time, even if immigrants seem to pay less taxes and receive more transfers than natives, the difference in distribution between the two populations, with a higher concentration of immigrants in the active age groups and a sparser concentration among the net beneficiaries of the social transfer system, leads to a slightly positive long-term impact of immigration on public finances. However, the impact of immigration remains very slight compared with the global effort that would have to be undertaken to reduce budgetary imbalances.","Univ Lille 2, Lille, France",Universite de Lille,"Chojnicki, X (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 2, Lille, France.",,"Chojnicki, Xavier/AFQ-5884-2022",,,,,,14,14,15,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2013,36.0,8,,,,,1065.0,1090,,10.1111/twec.12057,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,198JJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322918500005,0

It is known that standard cointegration tests perform poorly when a cointegration relationship has nonlinear adjustments or structural breaks. However, it is not clear how some cointegration tests allowing for nonlinearity perform under other classes of nonlinear cointegration models. This paper investigates which cointegration tests help detect a cointegration relationship with nonlinear adjustments or structural breaks. Our Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate that the cointegration test with threshold adjustment generally has better power performance under most cointegration relationships with nonlinearity. We also provide empirical applications to the money demand and term structure of the U.S. interest rates. The empirical results show that the test allowing for threshold adjustment provides strong evidence of the cointegration relationships of money demand and the term structure of interest rates.","Ryukoku Univ, Fac Econ, Fushimi Ku, Kyoto 6128577, Japan",Ryukoku University,"Maki, D (通讯作者)，Ryukoku Univ, Fac Econ, Fushimi Ku, 67 Tsukamoto Cho, Kyoto 6128577, Japan.",maki@econ.ryukoku.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23730220] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,41,5,6,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This article focuses on the way that employees use information and communication technologies to attend to personal life matters during the workday. It examines whether employees take advantage of the technical features of the devices and applications to erode the spatial and temporal boundary or, alternatively, whether they engage in practices that otherwise reconfigure the relationship, such as controlling the flow of communication passing between work and personal life. The article argues that the latter is the case. It demonstrates that employees engage in multi-faceted strategies to restrict boundary permeability.

Digestion costs arise because the body has difficulty digesting certain components of food. Incorporating digestion costs reduced the calories available per capita by 12.7 per cent in 1700 but only by 4.9 per cent in 1909 because of changes in diet. The energy costs of pregnancy and lactation were lower only reducing calorie consumption by 2.5 per cent.

Using several econometric techniques, this study attempts to answer three questions relevant for monetary integration of the WBC and similar transition countries: What are the constraints on an independent monetary policy? What is the need for operating an independent monetary policy? and What is the ability to conduct an independent monetary policy? The constraints on independent monetary policy in most of the WBC at this stage are relatively serious because of high levels of openness and euroization. They limit the ability of the central bank, which is oriented to price stability, to use the nominal exchange rate for achieving other goals (for example, output stabilization). Regarding the second question, the results from structural VAR framework suggest a low synchronization for supply and demand shocks between the WBC and the euro area, indicating potentially high costs of losing independent monetary policy. Furthermore, the results from Kalman filter technique inform that the shock convergence process is slow or absent in the WBC vis-A -vis the euro area. Regarding the last question, the results from cointegration and VAR analysis suggest that the ability to conduct an independent monetary policy, assessed by analyzing the interest rate channel as the most prominent transmission channel in the euro area, is relatively weak in the WBC.","[Velickovski, Igor] Natl Bank Republ Macedonia, Skopje 1000, Macedonia; [Velickovski, Igor] Univ Amer Coll Skopje, Skopje 1000, Macedonia",,"Velickovski, I (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Republ Macedonia, Kuzman Josifovski Pitu 1, Skopje 1000, Macedonia.",velickovskii@nbrm.mk,,,,,,,54,4,4,1,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This interstitial status creates a situation in which there are different and sometimes conflicting organizational principles and practices introduced within the organization of the EEAS and different and sometimes conflicting sets of expectations in relation to the Service from actors within the organization as well as from outside. Based on empirical data collected in interviews with EEAS officials and study of official documents in 2011 and 2012, the article documents the interstitial nature of the EEAS. In broader terms, the emergence of the EEAS hence provides a fertile ground for studying patterns of institutional innovation in organizational fields via the establishment of interstitial organizations.","Comenius Univ, Inst European Studies & Int Relat, SK-82105 Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Bátora, J (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Inst European Studies & Int Relat, Mlynske Luhy 4, SK-82105 Bratislava, Slovakia.",batora@fses.uniba.sk,"Batora, Jozef/ABC-7499-2021","Batora, Jozef/0000-0003-1566-7652",,,,,49,44,47,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

However, they seldom include persistence as a factor that can influence income, and the few that do always treat it as homogeneous across individuals. In spite of this, the importance of persistence should not be undermined because it is vital to understanding long term effect of variables on income, in addition to explaining the likelihood of a person to be trapped in a low income trap and the time taken to recover from a negative shock. As an extension to this literature, I add individual-level heterogeneity in income persistence and show it can be affected by childhood neighborhood variables. By applying a two-step correlated random effects GMM on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics dataset, I find that persistence is a significant factor in determining adult income, with average being about 0.38. However, I find that the poor have a higher persistence of income than the rich, implying that the poor are affected more when the macroeconomy changes. The poor also take a longer time to recover from a negative shock. Furthermore, I find that improving childhood neighborhood, especially neighborhood idleness rate, can help to increase adult income by lowering its persistence. My simulation exercise also shows that reducing idleness rate in childhood neighborhood by 1 percentage point of those earning in the bottom quartile of the income distribution can help to increase overall social welfare the most.

Using a sample of 114 respondents, this research studies how pedestrians perceive LOS on sidewalks shared with bicycles under various urban-street conditions. To do this, 15 carefully constructed video clips of Chinese urban sidewalks are presented to respondents and, after each 60-s video clip, respondents were asked to assess the pedestrian level of service in the video on a scale from LOS A (the most comfortable pedestrian environment) to LOS F (the least comfortable pedestrian environment). By estimating random parameters ordered probability models of respondents' LOS assessments (to account for unobserved heterogeneity across respondents) we found, as expected, that pedestrian perceptions of LOS are strongly influenced by the pedestrian flow rate. However, many other factors were found to significantly affect LOS perceptions including sidewalk width, the presence of a barrier separating the sidewalk from motor-vehicle traffic, the presence of parking next to the sidewalk, the presence of businesses along the sidewalk, the bicycle flow rate, the speed of bicyclist, whether or not bicycles were riding against the flow of pedestrians, weather conditions, time of day, and age of the respondent. The specific impacts of the wide variety of factors that affect pedestrian perceptions of LOS suggest that a number of important tradeoffs need to be considered when planning pedestrian facilities.

This article analyses the implications of this evolution for theories of work and employment. It critically reviews some key notions that are taken for granted in the research literature on service work and elaborates an alternative conceptual model. A deeper understanding of service work is possible only if the worker-customer interaction is conceived as part of the social structure that shapes it, namely the employment relationship. This article throws light on the interconnections between management control and customer demands and suggests that these have a mutually reinforcing effect which puts pressure on employees. It insists on both the distinctive features of front-line service work and the founding principles of the employment relationship that still apply beyond such categories.","[Belanger, Jacques] Univ Laval, Dept Relat Ind, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Edwards, Paul] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Laval University; University of Birmingham,"Bélanger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Relat Ind, Pavillon DeSeve, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",jacques.belanger@rlt.ulaval.ca,"Edwards, Paul/JMC-7544-2023",,,,,,58,72,87,0,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This article considers whether theories developed for European regionalism, such as neo-functionalism and liberal inter-governmentalism, provide a suitable framework for analysing the Mercosur case. The article argues that economic and policy asymmetries as well as institutional, social and economic deficits hamper deepening regionalism. These asymmetries and deficits also jeopardise the further benefits that could arise from building on Mercosur's considerable achievements. Finally, the analysis warns against the dangers of politicisation of Mercosur and the importance of societal inclusion. It suggests that top-down state-led Mercosur regionalism could benefit from being turned upside-down by bottom-up societal interest in deeper integration in the current shifting international economic context.","Univ Hull, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Kingston Upon Hull, Yorks, England",University of Hull,"Doctor, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Kingston Upon Hull, Yorks, England.",,"Doctor, Mahrukh/E-9210-2015","Doctor, Mahrukh/0000-0001-8221-2522",,,,,32,31,32,3,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Since the landmark rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the years 1999, 2002 and 2003, entrepreneurs in the European Union (EU) have been able to choose the country of incorporation independently of their real seat. As a result, the proliferation of the United Kingdom private company limited by shares has posed a competitive threat to many European legislators. The article analyzes whether the reforms adopted in Spain, France, Hungary, Germany and Poland have promoted the popularity of domestic legal forms and encouraged entrepreneurship more generally.

The analysis is rooted in the Europeanization literature, specifically the external incentives model. In addition to providing a systematic review of recent political developments in this area, the analysis leads us to question some of the model's basic premises. Most notably, it is found that credible EU commitment, rather than low adoption costs and weak veto players, has constituted a necessary and sufficient condition for the reform process.

In this connection, the proposed method (except for one of the given variants) carefully distinguishes a lack of information about a given pair of options from a proper tie between them.

The benefits of estimating autoregressive models on lightly revised data are related to the nature of the data revision process and the underlying process for the true values. Empirically, we find improvements in root mean square forecasting error of 24% when forecasting output growth and inflation with univariate models, and of 8% with multivariate models.

We employ various conventional and advanced econometrics methods to examine the interrelationships of steel prices in three related markets during the time period June 2002 to May 2010: Mainland China (CH), Taiwan (TW), and the United States (US). We adopt the Gregory and Hansen (GH) test and regime-switching (RS) model for cointegration, both of which accommodate endogenous structural break(s), to produce a more accurate analysis of a period in the presence of structural change(s). The empirical result of the RS cointegration test with respect to multiple structural breaks suggests a long-run equilibrium relationship among the three variables considered. This finding differs from the result of the GH test but confirms the result of the conventional Johansen test. Furthermore, the results of the Granger causality test indicate that both CH and US steel prices have great influence on the TW steel price; the Taiwanese steel market is closely linked with China and US steel markets in the long run.","[Nieh, Chien-Chung; Ou, Hong-Kou] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Yau, Hwey-Yun] Natl Taipei Coll Business, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hung, Ken] Texas A&M Int Univ, Jr Sch Business, Laredo, TX 78045 USA; [Hung, Shine May] Western Washington Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA",Tamkang University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M International University; Western Washington University,"Hung, K (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Int Univ, Jr Sch Business, Laredo, TX 78045 USA.",niehcc@mail.tku.edu.tw; yauhy@webmail.ntcb.edu.tw; hungkuen@gmail.com; ouhongkou@gmail.com; shinemay@hotmail.com,"Hung, Ken/I-5910-2018","Hung, Ken/0000-0002-3753-7149",,,,,35,6,6,0,36,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Some asymptotic theory is developed for maximum and average CUSUM detection tests. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that these both provide an improvement in detection relative to a univariate detector over a wide range of experimental parameters, given a sufficiently large number of co-breaking series.

The analysis is based on a unique combination of national travel survey data for Sweden and official register data With detailed, geo-referenced information about the Swedish population and the location of service amenities in 1995 and 2005/2006. The results show that spatial access to service amenities increased in general over the study period, both locally (i.e., within ranges of 1 km and 5 km, respectively, of residential areas) and regionally (within 50 km). Despite increased spatial accessibility, the observed average travel distance also increased. We find strong and differing associations between spatial access to service amenities and travel distance, depending on level of scale. While the association was negative on the local scale (i.e., a numerically large supply of amenities was related to shorter travel distance), it was the opposite and positive, on the regional scale. In terms of implications for policy,, the results imply that land use planning measures to promote local access, and thereby reduce traffic volumes, may per se be insufficient for attaining more sustainable levels of mobility.

Product innovation is a key factor for successful market entry in models of creative destruction and Schumpeterian growth. Process innovation helps securing a firm's market position given the characteristics of its product supply. Both modes of innovation are expected to raise a firm's propensity to export. According to new trade theory, we conjecture that product innovation is relatively more important in that regard. We investigate these hypotheses in a rich survey panel data set with information about new innovations of either type. With a set of indicators regarding innovation motives and impediments and continuous variables at the firm and industry level at hand, we may determine the probability of launching new innovations and their impact on export propensity at the firm level through a double treatment approach.","[Becker, Sascha O.] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Egger, Peter H.] ETH, KOF, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Stirling; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Becker, SO (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",sascha.becker@stir.ac.uk,"Becker, Sascha O./B-2463-2012","Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207; /0000-0002-0672-4865",,,,,58,181,196,3,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Our applied analysis of unilateral EU abatement illustrates the potential pitfalls of climate policy design which narrowly focuses on competitiveness concerns about EITE industries. The sector-specific gains of differential emission pricing in favour of these branches must be traded off with the additional burden imposed on other industries. From the perspective of the unilaterally abating region preferential EITE emission pricing can induce non-negligible excess cost as policy concedes (too) low emission prices to EITE industries and thereby foregoes relatively cheap abatement options in these sectors. With respect to global cost-effectiveness of unilateral climate policy, we find that differential emission pricing in favour of EITE industries can reduce emission leakage and thereby provide global cost savings compared with uniform pricing. However, the scope for cost savings is limited and may change into substantial cost increases if unilateral reduction targets are moderate and EITE industries get close to exemptions.","[Boehringer, Christoph] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Alexeeva-Talebi, Victoria] Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Böhringer, C (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,71,3,4,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2013,36.0,2,,,,,121.0,154,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01470.x,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,090KI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314977600001,0

In a field test during two weeks 60 participants predicted the departure time and trip length of their upcoming trips after having arrived at home with their own gasoline-powered cars. Actual mobility behavior was assessed by means of logbooks and GPS tracking devices. The results show that participants are on average able to accurately predict their departure times and trip lengths although for some outliers their prediction errors would potentially have led to insufficient battery levels. The type of trip (work, leisure, shopping) significantly influenced the accuracy of mobility predictions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Hahnel, Ulf J.

We define a new property called respect for recursive unanimity. This property requires that if every agent matches with its first choice among its really possible choices that are based on a recursive procedure like the well-known top trading cycles algorithm, then we should respect it. More precisely, given a matching problem, we exclude the agents whose first choices are satisfied without any discrepancy among them, and consider the restricted matching problems of the remaining agents. If we reach a state in which all agents are excluded by repeating this procedure, then we should respect the outcome. This property is weaker than stability and is stronger than respect for unanimity (that is also known as weak unanimity).

We assemble and analyse three separate types of evidence. First, we find that countries that were initially relatively poor prior to planning benefited more, as measured by long-run GDP per capita levels, from infrastructure and human capital than they suffered from weak market incentives. For initially relatively rich countries the opposite is true. Second, using various measures of physical stocks of infrastructure and human capital we show that at the end of planning, formerly planned countries had substantially different endowments from their contemporaneous market economy counterparts. However, these differences were much more important for poor than for rich countries. Finally, we use firm-level data to measure the cost of a wide range of constraints on firm performance, and we show that after more than a decade of transition in 2002-05, poor ex-planned economies differ much more from their market counterparts, in respect to both good and bad aspects of the planning legacy, than do relatively rich ones. However, the persistent beneficial legacy effects disappeared under the pressure of strong growth in the formerly planned economies in the run-up to the global financial crisis.

As the composition of export in favor of commodities has been relatively stable over the last decade, it is proven to be a factor facilitating growth of primary exports at the expense of manufactured exports, as suggested by the income and import elasticity of exports and production sectors. In order to assess robustness of the results, the empirical estimation is conducted by alternative statistical methods, such as the two-stage least-squares (2SLS), vector autoregression (VAR), and the Kalman filter. The main finding is that devaluation of the hryvna does not contribute to the growth of manufactured exports, which is highly dependent upon the import of capital goods. The exports of non-traditional commodities with higher value-added have higher import sensitivity but lower real exchange rate elasticity. Asymmetrical impact of exchange rate dynamics on the industrial production and exports in the primary and technological branches of industry is established.","[Cherkas, Natalia] Lviv Acad Commerce, Dept Int Econ Relat, UA-79005 Lvov, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Lviv University of Trade & Economics,"Cherkas, N (通讯作者)，Lviv Acad Commerce, Dept Int Econ Relat, Tershakivciv St 2a, UA-79005 Lvov, Ukraine.",natsanex@yahoo.com,"Cherkas, Nataliia/AAD-9350-2020","Cherkas, Nataliia/0000-0002-8921-1589",,,,,14,2,2,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-52-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,41.0,48,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367243900005,0

This paper will point out two facts. First one is that social entrepreneurs can be unusual kind of leader ahead of its time, which will encourage new initiatives, create certain transformations within their sector, and gather and connect people who want to contribute to the creation of social value on the principle of permanent sustainability. Another is that the society creates new values and attitudes, and finally provides opportunity to people with different types of intellectual disabilities to get a chance to be equal, and not isolated or rejected. In this paper will be conducted primary research by survey and interview in enterprises in the metal industry and API in 2013 in order to: analyze aspects of social entrepreneurship, with an entrepreneurial orientation within creating of social value; analyze the benefits of social entrepreneurial activities and need for the formation of additional social entrepreneurial activities; explore the activities performed by API members, their pleasure, and satisfaction and needs of their tutors.","[Duspara, Lena; Knezevic, Sanja] Veleuciliste Slavonskom Brodu, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,,lena.sigurnjak@vusb.hr; sanja.knezevic@vusb.hr,"Knezevic Kusljic, Sanja/ABB-6174-2021","Knezevic Kusljic, Sanja/0000-0003-1298-4281",,,,,4,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,30.0,35,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400003,0

Most notably, we survey small sample properties of the most commonly applied endogenous break tests developed by Brown et al. (J R Stat Soc B 37:149-163, 1975) and Zeileis (Stat Pap 45(1):123-131, 2004), Nyblom (J Am Stat Assoc 84(405):223-230, 1989) and Hansen (J Policy Model 14(4):517-533, 1992), and Andrews et al. (J Econ 70(1):9-38, 1996). Power and size properties are derived using Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the Nyblom test is on par with the commonly used F type tests in a small sample in terms of power. While the Nyblom test's power decreases if the structural break occurs close to the margin of the sample, it proves far more robust to nonnormal distributions of the error term that are found to matter strongly in small samples although being irrelevant asymptotically for all tests that are analyzed in this paper.","[El-Shagi, Makram; Giesen, Sebastian] Halle Inst Econ Res, Dept Macroecon, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"El-Shagi, M (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res, Dept Macroecon, Kleine Maerkerstr 8, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",Makram.El-Shagi@iwh-halle.de; Sebastian.Giesen@iwh-halle.de,,,,,,,43,4,4,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This paper develops a technology diffusion model, relying on rank effects or firm heterogeneity, to explain the adoption of scrubbers, a SO2 abatement technology. Using survival analysis, empirical results show that generating units regulated under Phase I of Title IV, units facing more stringent state regulations, and units with low expected installation costs are much more likely to install a scrubber In addition, there is evidence of positive scale effects of adoption, meaning larger units are more likely to adopt because expected installation costs are lower Tradable permit systems should give firms more flexibility in choosing abatement technologies, but results show that when command-and-control regulations overlap with a market-based system, the technology choice is restricted.","Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Econ, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Frey, EF (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Econ, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",Elaine.Frey@csulb.edu,,,"U.S. EPA, National Center for Environmental Economics; Dennis J.

The motivation for this paper stems from the assumption that diverging views on authorship of the principle are caused by diverse definitions of its satisfactory formulation. We argue a complete definition of the principle of comparative advantage rests on seven elements and suggest four of them are sufficient to deem a definition satisfactory. Taking into account specifics of the early nineteenth-century economics, only two elements namely comparison of ratios and statement of gains from trade were necessary We analyze ten early nineteenth-century works and determine whether they include these elements. Our research confirms the view that Ricardo was the first to successfully state the principle.","[Grancay, Martin; Szikorova, Nora] Ekon Univ, Fak Med Rodnych Vztahov, Katedra Med Rodnych Ekon Vztahov, Bratislava, Slovakia",,"Szikorova, N (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ, Fak Med Rodnych Vztahov, Katedra Med Rodnych Ekon Vztahov, Bratislava, Slovakia.",Martin_grancay@yahoo.com,"Grancay, Martin/N-9889-2014","Grancay, Martin/0000-0002-7006-147X",,,,,41,4,4,0,13,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

EZs are a set of generous tax incentives and grants aimed at small, economically depressed areas of large U.S. cities. We find areas that border or are economically similar to EZ locations experience a decline in the number of establishments and employment compared to areas that border or are similar to rejected EZ applicants. We also demonstrate that using spillover prone areas to estimate program effects causes upward bias when the spillover is negative. We find that for many of our estimates, spillovers more than offset positive program effects, although there are instances when the net effect is small and positive. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Decisive change could be realized by establishing a development paradigm. This includes joining producers and processors of fruits and vegetables by direct involvement of science and state in the development process. This state would be initiator of the development model and guarantor of public interest. Development potential of the SliB region can and should be the fruit and vegetable processing industry. It would also serve as a stabilization engine for agricultural production as well as a development all related industries such as trade, services and transport.

The study models relations with foreign partners using a Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive approach. The following five long-run equilibrium relations are examined and adjusted for the case of Slovakia: relative purchasing power parity, money supply, output relations, uncovered interest rate parity, and Fisher inflation parity. The foreign partners are characterized by their aggregate domestic demand, consumer prices and interest rate. Also the importance of convergence of Slovakia's economic development to its foreign trade partners is investigated considering its inclusion into the model.

Tourism potential of the Brod Fortress is not nearly used up. Devastated during the Homeland war, and because of the large area occupied (approximately 33 hectares), for the reconstruction of the Brod Fortress is needed almost 100 million euros. By initial budget of the Ministry of Tourism, the city of Slavonski Brod has approached making the project documentation required for applying fortress revitalization towards the European Union. As the European Regional Fund regulations provide for the possibility of applying for individual stages of nominated buildings recovery, under the condition that each phase of the project is feasible in terms of creating separate functional units with their own values, the city authorities are negotiating with the authorized ministries to carry out the Brod Fortress restoration candidacy successively, since the expenditure cover of full restoration in the near term would not be possible. The purpose of the primary questionnaire research which will be conducted will be to find out the views and opinion of local inhabitants about it if it is realistic to expect that the relevant European institutions would recognize cultural, touristic and economic potentials of the Fortress and give financial help in fortress rebuilding based on the previously made feasibility studies.

This paper is also an attempt at combining the physical phenomenon of a harmonious oscillator with the theory of economic growth by Dunning [2]. In his theory, Dunning distinguished stages of economic growth of countries that imply the dependency between the investment position of countries and their GDP per capita, while the graph presenting this dependency reminds a trajectory of oscillating motion of a damped harmonic oscillator. This analogy has given inspiration to reinterpret the theory of economy on the grounds of the mechanism of a physical model. In this paper, the harmonious oscillator motion equation was adapted to the description of dependencies shown in the theory of economic growth by Dunning. The mathematical solution of this equation is properly parameterised and parameters are estimated with the use of the Gauss-Newton algorithm. The main objective of this paper is to allocate a specific stage in the economic growth to each country on the basis of the values of parameter estimations of the proposed cyclical models of changes in the net investment indicator.","[Salamaga, Marcin] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Salamaga, M (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",salamaga@uek.krakow.pl,"Salamaga, Marcin/T-3370-2018","Salamaga, Marcin/0000-0003-0225-6651",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-52-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,141.0,148,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367243900017,0

I find that forecast inflation uncertainty strongly intensifies the reaction of the interest rate decisions to a forecast deviation of inflation from target. Conversely, forecast output growth uncertainty attenuates the reaction of the interest rate decisions to a forecast deviation of output growth from its long-run mean. Asymmetries in forecast uncertainty are highly relevant for inflation. Forecast upward risks to inflation contribute strongly to the intensifying effect of forecast inflation uncertainty, while forecast downward risks have hardly any significant impact. Moreover, I find that forecast risks to inflation have a direct effect on the interest rate decisions, in particular when inflation is forecast close to target.

It is expected that increased exchange rate volatility increases the risk of exporters and reduces foreign trade. For this purpose we employ extended trade gravity model approach. In the basic form of the gravity equation, trade volume between a pair of countries is modeled as an increasing function of their sizes (GDP) and a decreasing function of the distance between the two countries. Additional factors included in extended model are population, dummies for common border; membership in EU and EMU and proxy for exchange rate volatility. The measure of exchange rate volatility is estimated by standard deviation. This paper explores relationship between trade and exchange rate uncertainty using quarterly data over the period 1997:1 - 2012:2. In order to obtain the objective result, we use the panel data regression with 19 trading partners. Based on a gravity model that controls for other factors likely to determine bilateral trade, the results suggest that nominal exchange rate volatility of Polish zloty has a significant negative effect on bilateral trade over the sample period.","[Simakova, Jana] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,simakova@opf.slu.cz,"Šimáková, Jana/ABF-8573-2020","Šimáková, Jana/0000-0002-4194-9971",,,,,16,1,1,1,3,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,909.0,914,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000154,0

The analysis considers coal prices set by the largest exporter (fob RB) and importer (cif ARA ports) on the Atlantic market. A diverse character of ARA and RB prices and their subsequent different behaviour results from several reasons. A presence of financial institutions on the Euromarket is the first reason. Therefore, ARA prices are strongly connected with the financial markets. Next, the specificity of RB prices results from the fact that coal from the Republic of South Africa is sent both to the Atlantic and to the Pacific regions. Therefore, RB prices depend directly on the situation on the market in the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. The data used in the analysis consisted of weekly prices from the period from October 2006 to February 2013. The analysis was based on two models: two-regime threshold cointegration approach (TAR and M-TAR) proposed by Enders and Siklos [7] and asymmetric error correction model with threshold cointegration proposed by Sun [14]. The results obtained revealed that, in the long run, there is asymmetry in price transmission. Prices come back to long run equilibrium sooner after the decrease then after the increase.","[Smiech, Slawomir] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Management, Dept Stat, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,,smiechs@uek.krakow.pl,"Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018",,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,826.0,831,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000140,0

There has been a huge surge in empirical studies claiming rebound effects of hugely varying magnitudes. The contention of this paper is that the lack of consensus in the literature is grounded in a rush to empirical estimation in the absence of solid analytical foundations. Focus on measuring a single rebound measure has led to a neglect of detail on precisely what type of change in energy use is considered in any one study and on the range of mechanisms governing the economy-wide response. This paper attempts to bring a reflective pause to the development of the rebound literature, with a view to identifying the key issues that policymakers need to understand and analysts need to focus their attention on.","Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Management & Languages, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Turner, K (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Management & Languages, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",K.Turner@hw.ac.uk,,,UK ESRC [061-25-0010],UK ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper draws on earlier research supported by the UK ESRC (grant reference: 061-25-0010).

What they have in common is the idea that the development of production is closely linked to the growth and fickleness of human wants. It follows that during a process of economic growth, there will always be businesses and sectors of production which age and disappear, although the take-off associated with the more innovative sectors can also lead to some opportunities for modernization within the declining sectors. The three economists named in the title of this paper shared an awareness of the fact that money not only serves as a numeraire and a means of exchange, but also as a store of value. While Gossen's diminishing marginal utility is lacking in Jenkin, it holds the stage for the two Italian economists. In their turn, Pareto highlights the fact that the vastness and fickleness of wants prevents money's marginal utility from descending below a certain threshold, whereas Einaudi proposes that the diminishing marginal utility of goods acts to hamper the reabsorption of unemployment generated by 'mechanicism', and, more generally, by technical and organizational innovations. The vast Italian literature on Einaudi has downplayed the originality of his theory; this gap has not been filled, not even by a polyglot and renowned Pareto's scholar like Georgescu-Roegen. Among the Italian economists of the past, a special mention of Pantaleoni is finally made.","Univ Florence, I-50121 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Zanni, A (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

It is thus necessary to specify the rules of how demand is assigned to individual firms when the market does not clear, known as rationing rules. One of the popular approaches is proportional rationing, which is justified using a notion of randomly ordered consumers coming to the market. Such a process would render the resulting firm-specific demand a random variable, which is ignored in the existing deterministic models. In the paper, we (a) formalize the notion of randomly-ordered consumers into a new stochastic version of the proportional rationing scheme, (b) derive the probabilistic properties of firm-specific demand under this new scheme, and (c) study whether the results of the stochastic and deterministic versions are consistent.","[Zouhar, Jan] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,honza.zouhar@gmail.com,"Zouhar, Jan/E-9659-2013","Zouhar, Jan/0000-0002-1164-7948",,,,,8,1,1,0,4,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1063.0,1068,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000180,0

We use unique Swiss survey data that contain measures of individuals environmental concerns and different aspects of trade policy preferences to examine whether those who are more concerned about the environment also hold more protectionist trade policy preferences. Our results support this expectation. Individuals who are more concerned about the environment tend to think that globalization has more negative than positive effects, more strongly support jobs-related protectionism, and place more emphasis on aspects that go beyond price and quality when evaluating foreign products. Our results suggest that also the expected environmental consequences of free trade matter for trade policy preferences and not just the potential effects on the domestic wage distribution.","[Bechtel, Michael M.; Bernauer, Thomas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Meyer, Reto] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Sociol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bechtel, Michael M.; Bernauer, Thomas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bechtel, MM (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Bechtel, Michael M./T-9309-2019","Bechtel, Michael M./0000-0002-6080-5367; Bernauer, Thomas/0000-0002-3775-6245",,,,,50,40,47,2,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Eurobonds may contribute to stabilization in the short-run but would imply destructive disincentives and incalculable risks for joint and several guarantors. Monetary interest rate equalization through the ECB government bond purchase program poses risks for central bank credibility and price stability. This contribution proposes fiscal interest rate equalization (FIRE) as an alternative. With FIRE, countries that benefit from low interest rates as a consequence of market panics would transfers some of their savings to subsidize the borrowing of crisis countries within a conditional fiscal scheme. The paper presents FIRE's principles and discusses its advantages over alternative stabilization approaches. Furthermore, a simulation of a FIRE specification is presented which would shield Italy and Spain against interest rates above 5 percent.","[Heinemann, Friedrich] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Heinemann, F (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",heinemann@zew.de,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

There are two types of labor: skilled labor, which is mobile, and unskilled labor, which is immobile. Upon choosing its factory site, a final goods firm that is managed by skilled labor can produce these goods using local unskilled labor and a variety of intermediate goods produced by productivity-heterogeneous producers. We characterize world equilibrium and establish the conditions under which industrial agglomeration arises as a stable equilibrium outcome. We show that when the unskilled labor force is small, the role played by the selection of intermediate firms becomes less important, and trade liberalization induces dispersion. When the unskilled labor force is large and the selection effect becomes influential, trade liberalization can generate non-monotonic effects on industrial agglomeration. The dispersion effect of trade liberalization arises when unskilled labor-intermediate input complementarity matters to firm selection to a greater degree. When this is the case, trade liberalization may induce less selective firm entry and cause average productivity to fall. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These phases trace the process of expanding existing knowledge bases; diversification; and the acquisition of new skills; consolidation and the integration of these skills into institutional structures; thus completing one cycle of organisational learning and setting the stage for the next.","Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia",Deakin University,"Keneley, MJ (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia.",,", Monica Keneley/JWP-4382-2024","Keneley, Monica/0000-0002-2569-4948",,,,,51,3,3,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

It compares trans-Tasman integration with European experience with reference to deepening economic integration and supranational institutional arrangements, and explores similarities and differences with other regional arrangements. Adding this second case of deep integration to the comparative field enhances the understanding of regional integration in different contexts.","[Leslie, John] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Hist Philosophy Polit Sci & Int Relat, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Elijah, Annmarie] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Victoria University Wellington; Australian National University,"Leslie, J (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Hist Philosophy Polit Sci & Int Relat, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",john.leslie@vuw.ac.nz,,"Elijah, Annmarie/0000-0002-3013-0493",,,,,68,13,13,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Various development policies have been pursued to achieve this convergence. We test for this convergence in two economies that represent alternative models of implementing market-oriented development policies: the Czech Republic and Russia. Using 1992-2000 panel data on virtually all medium and large industrial firms in each country and accounting for endogeneity of ownership, we find that foreign ownership markedly improved the efficiency of firms, whereas domestic private ownership did not; domestic firms are not catching up to the (world) efficiency standard given by foreign-owned firms. This is due in part to a slower growth of efficiency in domestic firms over time. However, foreigners' acquisitions of more efficient domestic firms are also contributing to the gap. Domestic firms closer to the frontier are not more likely to catch up than firms farther from the frontier, although foreign firms do exhibit this behavior. The distance of Russian firms to the efficiency frontier is much larger than that of Czech firms. Nevertheless, after nearly a decade of reforms, neither model of development has resulted in convergence of domestic firms to the world standard.","[Peter, Klara Sabirianova] Univ N Carolina, CEPR, IZA, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Svejnar, Jan] Columbia Univ, CERGE EI, CEPR, IZA, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Columbia University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Peter, KS (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, CEPR, IZA, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",,"Svejnar, Jan/H-2924-2014",,,,,,47,21,22,0,28,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The analysis is based on a microsimulation model, which includes a detailed description of the German social assistance programme. Our findings suggest a moderate decrease in non-take-up compared to estimates before the reform. In order to identify the determinants of claiming social assistance, we estimate a model of take-up behaviour which considers endogeneity of the benefit level. The estimations reveal that the degree of needs, measured as the social assistance benefit level a household is eligible for, and the expected duration of eligibility are the key determinants of the take-up decision, while costs of claiming seem to play a minor role.","[Bruckmeier, Kerstin; Wiemers, Juergen] Inst Employment Res, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Bruckmeier, K (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",kerstin.bruckmeier@iab.de; juergen.wiemers@iab.de,,,,,,,24,20,21,0,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

One hypothesis is that foreign multinationals are less linked into the Irish economy, so more likely to leave once the economy is hit by a negative shock. The paper discusses background hypotheses before giving empirical evidence from first, aggregate data and second, firm-level observations. The analysis of the latter suggests that foreign firms are not more likely to leave during the crisis than Irish firms.

Using a game-theoretical analysis of suppliers' pricing strategies, we assess the social welfare effects of traffic information under various ownership regimes. The results show that the distortive welfare effect of monopolistic information pricing appears relatively small. Collusion of the road operator and information provider yields higher social welfare than independent pricing by two firms. The intuition behind this result resembles that behind the welfare effects of double marginalization, but is not exactly the same, as traffic information is not strictly complementary to road use.

A deeper understanding of the capabilities that underscore the economy at present is needed to determine the strengths to build on and how they can be cultivated for future economic growth. In particular, this study focuses on the evolution of capabilities, both technological and those that are more intangible, such as managerial expertise and their source of development. The argument underpinning this study is that analysing industrial dynamics using aggregate data on employment, trade and numbers of firms in distinct sectors provides an incomplete picture. Such an approach fails to capture evolving technologies that may cross sectoral boundaries. Therefore, in this study, a unique methodological approach that uses an analysis of highly specified products and services produced in the economy is employed to identify high-tech capabilities. More specifically, the approach is applied to the case of medical technology activity in Ireland. The evolution and nature of capabilities is examined using an exploratory analysis of the medical technology cluster in the West of Ireland in particular.","[Ryan, Paul] Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Ctr Innovat & Struct Change, Galway, Ireland; [Giblin, Majella] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Dublin, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Trinity College Dublin,"Ryan, P (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Ctr Innovat & Struct Change, Galway, Ireland.",,,"Ryan, Paul/0000-0001-7467-5391; Giblin, Majella/0000-0002-1931-9025",,,,,30,5,5,1,88,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2012,35.0,10,,,SI,,1322.0,1339,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01486.x,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,021MY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309890100008,0

Instead, each turned to discriminatory trade barriers and trade blocs to try to revive domestic output. Persuaded that trade discrimination exacerbated the political tensions that erupted in World War II, policy makers constructed a postwar economic order that institutionalized nondiscrimination. Thus, Article 1 of the charter of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) mandates most-favored nation (MFN) treatment. We argue here that the MFN clause itself encouraged the adoption of practices and policies that actually recreated discrimination. In particular, we argue, developing countries, long regarded as victims of discrimination, institutionalized it in their negotiations with each other. We examine two developing country PTAs that included about 80 percent of all developing-country GATT members by output (the Global System of Trade Preferences and the Protocol Relating to Trade Negotiations). We show that as in the GATT writ large, their patterns of tariff cuts and trade expansion were highly skewed toward a small number of their largest members. In trying to avoid discrimination, policy makers actually encouraged its de facto adoption.","[Gowa, Joanne; Hicks, Raymond] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Princeton University,"Hicks, R (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Bendheim Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",jgowa@princeton.edu; rhicks@princeton.edu,,,,,,,33,5,7,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

It derives from Kornhauser and Sager's doctrinal paradox and List and Pettit's discursive dilemma, two problems that we distinguish emphatically here. The current theory has developed from the discursive dilemma, rather than the doctrinal paradox, and the final objective of the paper is to give the latter its own theoretical development along the line of recent work by Dietrich and Mongin. However, the paper also aims at reviewing logical aggregation theory as such, and it covers impossibility theorems by Dietrich, Dietrich and List, Dokow and Holzman, List and Pettit, Mongin, Nehring and Puppe, Pauly and van Hees, providing a uniform logical framework in which they can be compared with each other. The review goes through three historical stages: the initial paradox and dilemma, the scattered early results on the independence axiom, and the so-called canonical theorem, a collective achievement that provided the theory with its specific method of analysis. The paper goes some way towards philosophical logic, first by briefly connecting the aggregative framework of judgment with the modern philosophy of judgment, and second by thoroughly discussing and axiomatizing the 'general logic' built in this framework.","HEC Paris, Ctr Natl Rech Sci GREGHEC, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris,"Mongin, P (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, Ctr Natl Rech Sci GREGHEC, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France.",mongin@greg-hec.com,,,,,,,93,23,24,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2012,73.0,3,,,,,315.0,355,,10.1007/s11238-012-9310-y,0.0,,,41,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,985OL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307276100001,0

Apart from including three sets of control variables (macroeconomic, financial, and institutional) in the regression to avoid omitted variable bias, we additionally examine whether there is a disparate interaction between gross capital inflows and the current account and between net foreign inflows and the current account. Our empirical results show that for EMs, it is mostly true that foreign capital inflow Granger causes the current account, while for ICs, it is the other way around for causality although when using gross foreign capital inflows, there is less evidence of causality detected. We also find that for EMs, after the 1997-1998 currency crises, capital inflows change the nature of their effects on the current account, particularly for Asian EMs.","[Yan, Ho-don] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Yang, Cheng-lang] Nanhua Univ, Dept Managerial Econ, Dalin Township, Chiayi County, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; Nanhua University,"Yan, HD (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, 100 Wen Hwa Rd, Taichung, Taiwan.",hdyan@fcu.edu.tw; chenglang@mail.nhu.edu.tw,,,,,,,55,6,7,1,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In models including demographic covariates and indicators for state, year, and quarter, more hours of darkness is associated with poorer HRQOL, which in turn is associated with a lower likelihood of employment. The relationships between the darkness index and HRQOL measures are stronger overall for women than for men. Inclusion of both the darkness index and the HRQOL measures in models of employment status determinants provides some evidence that the former operates through the latter in predicting a lower likelihood of employment. When specifying the darkness index as an instrument for HRQOL, each additional day of poor mental health per month leads to a 0.76 percentage point increase in the probability of unemployment among women.

This article describes the history of the energy regime complex as it has changed over the past 40 years, and interprets this history in light of an interpretive framework of the sources of institutional change. One of its principal contributions is to highlight what Stephen Krasner referred to as a pattern of punctuated equilibrium reflecting both periods of stasis and periods of innovation, as opposed to a gradual process of change. We show that the timing of innovation depends on dissatisfaction and shocks and that the nature of innovation-that is, whether it is path-dependent or -depends on interest homogeneity among major actors. This paper is the first to demonstrate the empirical applicability of the punctuated equilibrium concept to international regime complexes, and contributes to the eventual development of a dynamic theory of change in regime complexes.","[Van de Graaf, Thijs] Univ Ghent, Ghent Inst Int Studies, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Keohane, Robert O.] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Colgan, Jeff D.] American Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Ghent University; Princeton University; American University,"Van de Graaf, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Ghent Inst Int Studies, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",thijs.vandegraaf@ugent.be,"Van de Graaf, Thijs/J-5280-2016","Van de Graaf, Thijs/0000-0003-3372-3830",,,,,47,134,151,1,68,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Although there is a burgeoning empirical literature on presales agreements, only a few papers actually address their theoretical foundations. We create a set of interrelated theoretical models for explaining how and why developers and buyers engage in presale contracts for non-completed residential dwellings. Given heterogeneous consumer beliefs about future market prices, developers and buyers enter into presale agreements to mitigate, two intertwined, fundamental risks: those of real estate market valuation and default. Our analyses are consistent with prior empirical findings and provide additional theoretical insights for understanding the market for presales.","[Liu, Peng] Ctr Real Estate Finance, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Wu, Fang] Citadel Asset Management, Chicago, IL USA; [Liu, Peng] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ctr Real Estate Finance, Ithaca, NY USA; [Edelstein, Robert] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA USA",Cornell University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Liu, P (通讯作者)，Ctr Real Estate Finance, 465 Statler Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",peng.liu@cornell.edu,,,,,,,18,19,23,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The main hypothesis is drawn from the theory of issue ownership: public opinion is likely to shift to the left in times of high unemployment combined with a leftist government. Research on issue ownership has typically focused on case studies of particular countries. We extend the discussion to a much larger setting. Relying on data from the International Social Survey Programme from 23 OECD countries in the time period 1985-2007 we find a combined effect of issue ownership and agenda setting. An increase in unemployment leads the public to hold more leftist economic opinions when the government belongs to the left. However, ownership of an issue cannot be guaranteed to last if a party fails to deliver outcomes that are promised and expected from its historical legacy.","[Jakobsen, Tor G.; Listhaug, Ola] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Jakobsen, TG (通讯作者)，NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",tor.g.jakobsen@svt.ntnu.no,,,,,,,39,6,7,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The article takes a critical look at the way much of the literature prescribes spiritual values with the subtext that human resource practices infused with spiritual values, inter alia, improve organizational performance. This article demonstrates how 'symbolic violence' provides an analytical tool to unravel the theoretical make-up of organizational spirituality. This critique posits that the 'top-down' approach to organizational spirituality relies on a Bourdieusian 'cultural arbitrary' and the 'power of pedagogy' to seek the active consent of organizational members. The article proceeds to identify the ideological underpinnings of this process, thus paving the way for new critical theorizing on organizational spirituality.","[Kamoche, Ken] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Pinnington, Ashly H.] British Univ, Fac Business, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",University of Nottingham,"Kamoche, K (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",ken.kamoche@nottingham.ac.uk,"PINNINGTON, ASHLY/C-6454-2011","PINNINGTON, ASHLY/0000-0002-4814-6960",,,,,94,22,27,1,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The results are very surprising given the enormous amount of public attention that derbies with their special character attract: we find that there are no significant differences between derbies and normal matches.

As this model class includes the Gaussian copula with stochastic correlation process, it can be viewed as a generalization of multivariate stochastic volatility models. Despite the complexity of the model, the decoupling of marginals and dependence parameters facilitates estimation. We propose estimation in two steps, where first the parameters of the marginal distributions are estimated, and then those of the copula. Parameters of the latent processes (volatilities and dependence) are estimated using efficient importance sampling. We discuss goodness-of-fit tests and ways to forecast the dependence parameter. For two bivariate stock index series, we show that the proposed model outperforms standard competing models.

Together, these data are modeled in a series of logistic regressions that compare the importance of both individual and contextual attributes.

A new solution concept that better fits the choice function framework is then introduced. Using this, we investigate what behavioral assumptions are needed for the full characterizations of Nash implementable social choice correspondences to still hold.

Using a novel methodological approach, I empirically identify legislative voting coalitions to investigate whether the president's preference for party-based legislative bargaining prevailed. I find that in contrast to the 1996-1999 Duma, legislative voting coalitions closely followed party lines and that factions representing narrow interests were less relevant. The results demonstrate that presidential politics dominates electoral incentives in this political system and, more broadly, that political parties could be indispensable for regimes in transition to authoritarianism.","Univ Houston, Dept Polit Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Bagashka, T (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Dept Polit Sci, 447 Philip G Homan Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",tbagashka@uh.edu,,,,,,,68,2,3,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,1,,,,,91.0,113,,10.1080/09668136.2011.635891,0.0,,,23,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,912DO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301775100004,0

Sourcing capital goods from foreign countries is costly and requires internal or external financial resources. A simple model of foreign technology adoption shows that credit constraints act as a barrier to importing capital goods under imperfect financial markets. In our study, we investigate this prediction using detailed balance-sheet data from Indian manufacturing firms having reported information on financial statements and imports by type of good over the period 19972006. Our empirical findings shed new light on the micro determinants of firms choices to import capital goods. Baseline estimation results show that firms with a lower leverage and higher liquidity are more likely to source their capital goods from foreign countries. Quantitatively, a 10 percentage point improvement of the leverage or liquidity ratio increases the probability of importing capital goods by 11 percent to 13 percent respectively. Different robustness tests demonstrate that these results are not driven by omitted variable bias related to changes in firm observable characteristics as well as ownership status. These findings are also robust to alternative specifications dealing with the potential reverse causality issues.",,,,maria.bas@cepii.fr; antoine.berthou@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,44,41,45,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

This individual is often identified as the primary decision maker and is asked to provide responses as a proxy for the group given that the cost of interviewing each member individually is impractical and/or expensive. The collection of joint preferences is rarely undertaken, with the use of proxy responses not uncommon in travel behaviour research. Under such a framework, there exists an assumption that the primary decision maker has perfect knowledge of other group member preferences, and bargaining behaviour, and is able to synthesise this information when providing a response on their behalf. The validity of such an assumption however remains an open question, with recent research calling the reliability of proxy responses into account (Bateman and Munro, 2009). In this paper, using three models estimated in willingness to pay space, we examine the accuracy of proxy responses in a stated choice experiment. We find that there is overlap between a proxy response and the own preferences of the individual providing the proxy choice, but while the proxy responses fail to represent the full preference heterogeneity that exists in the actual choices made by individuals, the proxy responses in aggregate provide a suitable replacement for actual data, subject to a number of caveats.

In contrast to most contemporary writers - particularly David Hume and Adam Smith - Steuart had a balanced opinion about these two financial experiments. On the one hand, Steuart considered them worthwhile, since they were attempts at public debt restructuring by reducing its expense and increasing its liquidity. Moreover, according to Steuart, a well-managed public debt favours the liquidity of both banks and the financial market. These worked together for the growth of wealth. However, on the other hand, Steuart claimed that the failure of these experiments was due to: (i) a poor management of money; (ii) a violation of credit rules and its corollary, the weakness of banks; (iii) the adoption of contestable dividend and financial information policy. This article presents Steuart's proposals for creating the liquidity of both banks and the financial market via a well-managed public debt.","Univ Paris Est, IRG, Inst Rech Gest, F-94010 Creteil, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Bentemessek, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, IRG, Inst Rech Gest, Pl Porte Champs,4 Route Choisy, F-94010 Creteil, France.",nesrine.bentemessek-kahia@u-pec.fr,,,,,,,36,6,6,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The study of Nash equilibria of the oligopoly game, together with an analytical and numerical investigation of the different kinds of attractors of the dynamical system, shows how the presence of production constraints generates so called border collision bifurcations, a kind of global bifurcations recently introduced in the literature on non-smooth dynamical systems, which gives rise to a quite rich spectrum of dynamic scenarios, characterized by drastic changes in the qualitative dynamic properties of the system.","[Bischi, Gian Italo] Univ Urbino, I-61029 Urbino, Italy; [Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Calabria, I-87030 Commenda Di Rende, Italy",University of Urbino; University of Calabria,"Bischi, GI (通讯作者)，Univ Urbino, I-61029 Urbino, Italy.",gian.bischi@uniurb.it; lamantia@unical.it,,"Lamantia, Fabio/0000-0003-2147-0979",,,,,51,13,12,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Resolving this problem involves both theoretical and experimental considerations. Among the theoretical studies the classical mechanical approach, based on Newton's law, offers a useful tool to describe the trajectories of water droplets travelling from the sprinkler nozzle to the ground. Within this context, a mathematical model for irrigation sprinkler droplet ballistics has been presented and validated. Moreover, a new approach has been proposed, the so-called quantum mechanical picture based on the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and the wave function. This procedure leads to a new concept of quantum ballistics, in analogy to the well-established concept of classical trajectory, and represents a versatile tool for the description of the motion and of the dynamical properties of falling particles, as well as an exciting area of research in the years to come.","[De Wrachien, D.] State Univ Milano, Dept Agr Engn, Milan, Italy; [Lorenzini, G.] State Univ Parma, Dept Ind Engn, Parma, Italy; [Mambretti, S.] Politecn Milan, DIIAR, Milan, Italy",University of Milan; University of Parma; Polytechnic University of Milan,"De Wrachien, D (通讯作者)，State Univ Milano, Dept Agr Engn, Milan, Italy.",,,"Mambretti, Stefano/0000-0002-3116-7466",,,,,23,5,5,0,1,AGRONOMSKI FAKULTET SVEUCILISTA U ZAGREBU,10000 ZAGREB,"SVETOSIMUNSKA 25, 10000 ZAGREB, CROATIA",1848-4425,,,ACT TASKS AGRIC ENG,,,2012,40.0,,,,,,85.0,96,,,,,,12,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BCA45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309447100008,0

The present paper shows how satisfaction measures can be exploited to gain insights on the relationship between personal attitudes, transit use and urban context. We consider nine satisfaction measures of urban transit services, as expressed by a representative sample of Italian multimodal travelers (i.e. users of both private cars and public transport). We use correlations and correspondence analyses to show if and how each attribute is related to the levels of use of public transport, and how the relationship is affected by the urban context. Then we apply a recently developed method to combine ordinal variables into one score, by adapting it to work with large samples and with satisfaction measures which have a neutral point in the scale (i.e. neither satisfied nor dissatisfied). The resulting overall satisfaction levels and frequency of use were not correlated in our sample. We also found the highest satisfaction levels in smaller towns and the lowest ones in metropolitan cities. Since we focus on multimodal travelers, an interpretation paradigm is proposed according to which transit services must be well evaluated by car drivers in smaller towns in order to be considered a real alternative to cars. On the other hand, transit is more competitive on factual elements in larger cities, so that it can still be used by drivers, even if it is not very well evaluated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This article argues that the police follow a patrimonial logic. Neo-patrimonialism is mostly understood as an authoritarian regime with a personal ruler at the top. By contrast, here a concept will be suggested which reformulates patrimonialism as the practice of the acquisition of offices and material resources. Based on this, two case studies analyse the police administration in Albania and Georgia. The findings suggest that patrimonial practices play a central role in the recruiting and financing of law enforcement officers. The result is a hybrid administration, which is significantly subject to special interests.","[Hensell, Stephan] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Hensell, Stephan] Univ Hamburg IFSH, Inst Peace Res & Secur Policy, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Hamburg,"Hensell, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,112,10,11,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,5,,,,,811.0,833,,10.1080/09668136.2012.681244,0.0,,,23,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,958AJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305208000001,0

We use propensity score matching to find treatment effects on metered electricity consumption for different types of households. We find effects for single men and couples without children, while we find no effect for single women and households with children. We suggest that this could be because of differences in saving potential (e.g. some households do not have appliances where using a plug is relevant), differences in the skills relevant for installing the technology and differences in the willingness to spend time and effort on installation.

However, when specifying trade regressions, spatial issues are typically not accounted for in a satisfactory way. We specify a trade model which relates to the effects that the introduction of the euro had on exports for the euro countries. Our model contains country pair fixed effects and error terms which are spatially and time autocorrelated, as well as heteroskedastic. Our spatial weighting matrix has unique characteristics. Our model also allows for endogenous regressors, and so we estimate it by an instrumental variable procedure. We find that the results of estimation are substantially affected when one accounts for statistical complications. Specifically, the intra euro effects on exports are significantly reduced and are only borderline significant. Also, dummy variables measuring the effects of EU membership on exports become insignificant. The results relating to other variables do not seem to be substantially affected. All of this suggests that, perhaps, the effects of currency unions on trade as described in the previous literature have been overstated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Historical analyses tend to indicate a very strong correlation between institutional development and economic growth. Today's high-income and good-governance countries generally had bad-governance environments at low levels of income. Moreover, some of today's most successful economies still exhibit sub-optimal governance indicators. By focusing on the search for the determinants of some global governance standards that often reflect particular political, ideological and philosophical conceptions of power, the traditional literature on governance has so far failed to offer a set of actionable policies that poor countries could implement to foster inclusive growth in a pragmatic and incentives-compatible way. This article acknowledges that governance problems are indeed major impediments to economic growth. But contrary to conventional wisdom, it argues that the well-known governance problems in African countries are mainly the reflection of their low level of development, and the results of failed state interventions and distortions originating from erroneous economic development strategies. Instead of posing 'good' governance as the main prescription and a prerequisite for sustained growth, development economists should design policy frameworks that offer the maximum likelihood of success because they are consistent with comparative advantage while providing minimum opportunities for rent-seeking and state capture.","[Lin, Justin Yifu] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Monga, Celestin] World Bank, Dev Econ Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Peking University; The World Bank,"Lin, JY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",justinlin@ccer.pku.edu.cn; cmonga@worldbank.org,,,,,,,27,6,7,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The integration into global financial markets determines an acceleration of debt-creating capital inflows that boosts growth and the prospect of future profits, and leads to the building-up of large imbalances in the public and private sectors. Financial fragility undermines the state of confidence and determines an endogenous capital reversal. At this stage, the strong commitment to maintain the peg leaves no room for stabilization purposes and leads to systemic instability. We run a continuous-time estimation of the non-linear differential equations system of the model, with reference to Argentina during the years of the currency-board arrangement. We find two steady-state solutions, corresponding to a high-interest rate and a low-interest rate equilibrium, respectively. The local stability and sensitivity analysis show that both equilibria are unstable and that the system is intrinsically fragile. We show that even a tighter fiscal policy, according to the prescriptions of international institutions, results ineffective in improving stability.","[Maggi, Bernardo; Cavallaro, Eleonora] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy; [Mulino, Marcella] Univ Aquila, I-67100 Laquila, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of L'Aquila,"Maggi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.",bernardo.maggi@uniroma1.it; eleonora.cavallaro@uniroma1.it; marcella.mulino@ec.univaq.it,"Cavallaro, Eleonora/E-9273-2015","Cavallaro, Eleonora/0000-0002-8293-803X; MULINO, Marcella/0000-0002-7045-242X",,,,,33,1,1,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The goal is to find a consensus ranking expressing an opinion of a group. The aim of this article is to present a model for OCRP solution with uncertain rankings. This approach is more suitable than classic approach with certain rankings, as the latter case doesn't allow for imprecise information or uncertainty often involved in real decision-making processes. In this paper uncertain ranking g(ij) is defined as a decision maker's confidence that an alternative i is ranked at the j(th) position, where g(ij) is an element of [0,1] and Sigma(j)g(ij) =1 for all i. In the model for OCRP solution with uncertain rankings generalized means operator is used for ranking aggregation and the final consensus ranking is obtained by the use of a binary dominance relation. The model can be extended to multiple criteria or different weights of decision makers, and it can handle the cases with certain rankings as well. Also, the model's setting enables to evaluate decision makers' preferences in terms of inconsistence and indecisiveness.","[Mazurek, Jiri] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,mazurek@opf.slu.cz,"Mazurek, Jiri/Z-1303-2019",,,,,,13,3,3,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,552.0,557,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900095,0

Accordingly, the European policy of network unbundling (either transmission or distribution) results in synergy losses between 2 and 8 percent due to coordination losses, while an unbundling option that includes a separation between retail and generation, as observed in some U.S. states, may lead to a permanent cost increase of 20 percent or more due to a significant risk increase.","Univ Bremen, Bremer Energie Inst, Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Meyer, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Bremer Energie Inst, Bremen, Germany.",ro.meyer@jacobs-university.de,,,,,,,79,26,27,0,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2012,33.0,4,,,,,161.0,185,,10.5547/01956574.33.4.8,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,012QL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309251500008,0

The reason for this is that the various groups might differ with respect to the risks they are exposed to and the type of security information to be presented. The preference for receiving information might also differ from one user group to the next. In general, the design of an information security awareness programme might differ from one user group to the next. Yet most awareness programmes today focus on the home user in general rather than on specific types of home users. This research focuses specifically on home users segmented according to age due to the limited amount of attention that is paid to the categories. The study is aimed at improving security awareness among home users segmented according to age and culminates in the development of an information security awareness and education framework. The proposed framework attempts to simplify the process of designing an information security awareness and education programme by providing a set of guidelines to the designer that will help him/her to establish who should be receiving what information and the manner in which this information should be received how the information should be received. It also identifies other design factors that should be considered when creating an information security awareness and education programme. The author believes that the information security awareness and education programme that is designed when using the step-by-step guide presented in this framework is more likely to attract the attention of the specific user that it is designed for.

The field site, a small provincial town in European Russia, was visited in 2009 and 2010. Informants were mainly families dependent on a single non-professional wage. Research materials-semi-structured interviews and participant observation-comprising an ethnography of internet use, are supplemented by survey data. Qualitative social research on new media use has critically examined technologically determinist assumptions about social effects of the internet, including the so-called 'digital divide'. The present research also seeks a contextualised understanding of new media use by considering how it is embedded in established everyday social settings and practices. The ethnographic materials and survey data collected indicate that Woolgar's rules of virtuality hold true in the Russian margins: use of new media depends on the local social context and supplements, rather than replaces real activities. Most users in the group surveyed are highly instrumentalist and have little interest in the communicative and non-grounded aspects of the media. At the same time the impetus for initial access to the internet is closely related to issues of esteem and peer recognition within a social network rather than actual need.","Univ Birmingham, CREES, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Morris, J (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, CREES, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",j.b.morris@bham.ac.uk,"Morris, Jeremy/I-1616-2019","Morris, Jeremy/0000-0002-8861-9929",,,,,44,3,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,8,,,SI,,1546.0,1564,,10.1080/09668136.2012.712275,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,008TA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308978300011,0

The analysis draws on a three-level research design, combining a variable-oriented regression analysis with case-oriented comparisons among similar cases, and within-case analysis of individual countries.","[Myant, Martin] Univ W Scotland, Ctr Contemporary European Studies, Paisley PA1 2BE, Renfrew, Scotland; [Drahokoupil, Jan] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of West Scotland; University of Mannheim,"Myant, M (通讯作者)，Univ W Scotland, Ctr Contemporary European Studies, Paisley PA1 2BE, Renfrew, Scotland.",martin.myant@uws.ac.uk; jan.drahokoupil@gmail.com,,"Drahokoupil, Jan/0000-0003-1686-1748",,,,,38,86,90,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,1,,,,,1.0,33,,10.1080/09668136.2012.635478,0.0,,,33,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,912DO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301775100001,0

While most studies focus on how individuals, companies, interest groups or non-governmental organizations try to exert influence via state actors, we know much less about whether and how frequently states themselves engage in lobbying. How effectively do state actors seek to further their own preferences informally in lobbying institutional key actors in governance arrangements beyond the nation-state? To shed light on these blind spots, this article draws on the example of the European Union and analyses the conditions under which states are especially inclined to use this informal influence strategy as well as the conditions for lobbying success. Is shows that states use lobbying strategies more often, the more capacities they possess, the lower the transaction costs of lobbying and also the stronger their incentives of getting active are for particular policies. Additionally, it is not only a high frequency of lobbying that increases the chances of informally influencing policies, but also the type of reasoning applied, its quality and its fit to the nature of the issue at stake.","Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Panke, D (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland.",diana.panke@ucd.ie,"Yoon, DongJoon/E-9146-2014",,,,,,24,26,30,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this framework, their primary objective is to maintain price stability and other objectives of economic policies are supported only when the primary one is not compromised. To achieve their goals, the central banks have to manipulate the key monetary policy interest rate. Usually, the decision on setting this interest rate is claimed to be based on the output of some sophisticated model. Nevertheless, the recent experience has shown that it is not always the case and interest rate changes are still heavily relied on the judgements of central bankers. Then one should ask how the interest rate is set. And one possible answer to this question is the use of fuzzy control to appropriately quantify it. This approach then is verified with the decisions on 2W reporate of the Czech Central Bank from period 2000 up to now.","[Quang Van Tran] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague 3, Czech Republic; [Radova, Jarmila] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Banking & Insurance, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Tran, QV (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",tran@vse.cz; radova@vse.cz,"Radová, Jarmila/ABB-6317-2021; Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022","Radová, Jarmila/0000-0002-9845-1840;",Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G097],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The authors are grateful for the financial support of Czech Science Foundation No. P402/12/G097.,,4,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,926.0,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900159,0

These needs have to be caused by harmful implications occurred against the will of the insured person and are independent and unpredictable in advance. For the insured person the insurance is an economical instrument which bears a very low cost (insurance premium) for an unpredictable financial loss that would exist if there was no insurance. The insurance is an economical instrument for lowering and eliminating the risk through a process of combining sufficient number of homogeneous exposures in a group, so the losses would become predictable for the group as a whole. The purpose of this paper is to show the main task of each 'risk management', i.e. to take all the measures in order to manage the pure risks and insure the events. Financial losses can be caused by variety of reasons and mostly by incorrect business decisions. However, they could also be caused by insuring different hazards to which the company is exposed because of the risk of fire, breaking of machines and earthquake, which can cause a stop in the process of production and sales and a complete stoppage of the work for a longer period. The stoppage of work, I. e. production and sales, can lead to losses of income. A reasonable management of the company which wants to achieve income even in situations like these will protect its interests by insurance. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

While the focus of most research to date has been at economy or utility level, there has been much less research on regional outcomes. India presents a unique case, as its states share a common economic and political system, whilst having been given considerable flexibility in how they implement reform, thus allowing a comparative analysis of alternative approaches to reform. This study presents an econometric analysis of the determinants and impact of electricity reform in India, giving special regard to its political economy and regional diversity. It assesses how electricity reform in India has affected key economic variables that determine sectoral efficiency, prices and investment flows. We use panel data for 19 states, spanning 1991-2007, using dynamic panel data estimators. Results show that individual reform measures have affected key economic variables differently; thus the nature of reform in individual states would determine these economic outcomes. Findings suggest that due to political economy factors, outcomes have tended to be adverse in the initial stages of reform, as previously hidden distortions become apparent. The performance of reforms, however, may improve as the reform progresses beyond a 'baseline' level. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol33-No1-4","[Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Jamasb, Tooraj] Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Econ, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sen, Anupama] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England",University of Cambridge; Heriot Watt University; University of Oxford,"Jamasb, T (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",T.Jamasb@hw.ac.uk,,,ESRC Electricity Policy Research Group; Nehru Trust for Cambridge University; Cambridge Commonwealth Trust; Suzy Paine Fund; Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; British Federation of Women Graduates,ESRC Electricity Policy Research Group(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Nehru Trust for Cambridge University(University of Cambridge); Cambridge Commonwealth Trust; Suzy Paine Fund; Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; British Federation of Women Graduates,"We extend a special and grateful acknowledgement to Peter Tyler, University of Cambridge.

The first is the data base from which it will build and second is a set of equations describing the events in the selected parts of economy. Data base is usually called Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). Choice of equations depends on the author of a particular model and its focus.

Within public participation research there appears to be an international dearth of knowledge concerning such written submissions. The possible impact of such responses on an EIS is - with few exceptions - seldom put in focus. The aim in the present brief communication is to study one aspect of public participation within transport infrastructure planning, namely the role of written submissions sent to the applicant by individuals, Non-governmental organisations, companies and authorities. By comparing 34 written submissions with road planning documents (including EIS) the impact of the public views has been analysed in a south Swedish case study. At a time when the new Environmental Code only had been in force for less than one year, it does not appear as if the Road Administration's regional office accepted most of the written submissions just to show that the new regulation concerning participation had a direct impact on the planning. Sweden's long tradition of public access to official documents may explain why written submissions as one aspect of public participation worked well in the E18 highway planning process, because civil servants have long been taught to promptly furnish information and guidance, as well as to giving advice and other assistance to individuals in matters concerning an authority's activity. This study shows, then, that - if properly managed by the developer's street-level staff - the use of written submissions may improve the EIS from a stakeholder perspective and also make the stakeholders feel they are being taken seriously.

Five ambiguous decision tasks are analyzed theoretically, where an individual faces two-stage lotteries with binomial, uniform, or unknown second-order probabilities. Theoretical predictions are then tested through a 10-task experiment. In (unambiguous) tasks 1-5, risk aversion is elicited through both a portfolio choice method and a BDM mechanism. In (ambiguous) tasks 6-10, choice-ambiguity aversion is elicited through the portfolio choice method, while value-ambiguity aversion comes about through the BDM mechanism. The behavior of over 75% of classified subjects is in line with the KMM model in all tasks 6-10, independent of their degree of risk aversion. Furthermore, the percentage of coherent-ambiguity-averse subjects is lower in the binomial than in the uniform and in the unknown treatments, with only the latter difference being significant.

Using a nonlinear decomposition method, we decompose these differences across gender within race and then across race within gender. Less than one third of the differences in obesity and underweight across gender are explained by differences in covariates. In contrast, at least 70% of the obesity differences across race are explained by differences in covariates. Behavioral variables such as smoking and exercise explain the largest part of the bodyweight differentials across gender. For bodyweight differentials across race within gender, however, socioeconomic status and background variables have the largest explanatory power for obesity differentials, while background variables play the key role in explaining the underweight differentials. These results indicate that eradicating obesity and underweight differentials will require targeting policies to specific groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a sharp discontinuity in the price of child care in Norway, we are able to isolate the effects of child care subsidies on both parental and student outcomes. We find very small and statistically insignificant effects of child care subsidies on child care utilization and parental labor force participation. Despite this, we find significant positive effect of the subsidies on children's academic performance in junior high school, suggesting that the positive shock to disposable income provided by the subsidies may be helping to improve children's scholastic aptitude.","[Black, Sandra E.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Black, Sandra E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Devereux, Paul J.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Devereux, Paul J.] CEPR, London, England; [Loken, Katrine V.] Univ Bergen, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Salvanes, Kjell G.] Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; National Bureau of Economic Research; University College Dublin; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Bergen; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Black, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,"Devereux, Paul/0000-0003-0221-8241",,,,,37,36,45,1,26,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The empirical results indicate that, except for Australia and the UK, the inbound tourists from the sampled countries suffered from varying degrees of crowding-out effect as a result of Taiwan's opening-up to Chinese tourists. This is particularly noticeable with tourists from Korea, Singapore and the USA. In terms of regional effects, Asia is the most affected by the opening-up policy, while Europe and Oceania are less affected. However, the number of inbound tourists from different countries has not dropped, but shows an upward trend.","[Chou, Chin-Mei] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, PhD Programme Business, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Shu Fen] Jinwen Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Travel Management, New Taipei City 231, Taiwan; [Tseng, Hsi Peng] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Leisure Studies & Tourism Management, Puli 545, Nantou, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University; National Chi Nan University,"Tseng, HP (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Leisure Studies & Tourism Management, 1 Univ Rd, Puli 545, Nantou, Taiwan.",chouchinmei@yahoo.com.tw; hsiehfe@just.edu.tw; hptseng@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,34,9,10,1,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

However, this topic has drawn limited attention from the scientific community, and the equity concept remains ambiguous and often undefined. This paper deals with the equity among users of an irrigation system in a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. A non-linear stochastic, static mathematical programming model has been used to maximise farmers' utility. It takes into consideration several conditions and is subject to a specific set of constraints. Two scenarios have been selected, both of them of the on-demand water distribution: an area-based water allocation system associated with a binomial water tariff (SC1); and a farm-based water allocation system (5C2). Based on the field visits and the understanding of the case study, SC2 is believed to increase equity among farmers. Results calculated farmers' income in both scenarios and showed that the economic cost of a socially equitable policy in the study area could be around 5% decrease in farmers' income. Such a policy could have effects on the total volume of irrigation water between 2% and 4% less in SC2 than in SC1, while the change in the irrigated surface is insignificant. The implementation of such scenarios would improve the governance of water policies in Lebanon generating a sustainable development for the agricultural sector","[El Cham, Daniel] Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Scardigno, Alessandra; Khadra, Roula] Int Ctr Adv Mediterranean Agron Studies CIHEAM IA, Valenzano, BA, Italy",University of the Free State; CIHEAM; CIHEAM BARI,"El Cham, D (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, POB 339, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",,"Khadra, Roula/U-3862-2019; Chami, Daniel El/L-3607-2013","Khadra, Roula/0000-0003-2117-1557; Chami, Daniel El/0000-0002-0712-858X",UNDP Lebanon,UNDP Lebanon,The authors would like to acknowledge UNDP Lebanon for funding this study and the LRA for their support.

This evidence supports promoting rich and thriving neighbourhoods in order to encourage short distance mobility. In this context, we use a wide travel survey (EMQ06), undertaken in Spain, to measure short-distance travelling within Barcelona and to assess how distinct social groups make use of the local scale for their everyday mobility. The effects of socioeconomics and access to transport are discussed, prior to applying a Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) method, in order to explore heterogeneity among the different social groups, in terms of local travelling. We found that nearly a quarter of all daily mobility in Barcelona is performed with a local trip, and that short trips are more frequently undertaken for personal purposes. Also, age, gender and access to private transport appear as significant factors. Overall, our results suggest that a proximity scale is being used by those groups with greater time-space constraints, such as working women or low income people without access to private vehicles, opening important implications on transport policy regarding the design of proximity-prone environments.

It occurs when coalitions dissatisfied with existing institutions combine threats of exit, voice, and the creation of alternative institutions to pursue policies and practices different from those of existing institutions. Contested multilateralism takes two principal forms: regime shifting and competitive regime creation. It can be observed across issue areas. It shapes patterns of international cooperation and discord on key security concerns such as combating terrorist financing, halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and banning certain conventional weapons. It is also evident on economic issues involving intellectual property, on environmental and energy issues, and in the realm of global public health. The sources of dissatisfaction are primarily exogenous, and the institutions used to challenge the status quo range from traditional treaties or intergovernmental organizations to informal networks, some of which include non-state actors. Some institutions are winners from the process of contested multilateralism; others may lose authority or status. Although we do not propose an explanatory theory of contested multilateralism, we do suggest that this concept provides a useful framework for understanding changes in regime complexes and the strategies that generate such changes.","[Morse, Julia C.; Keohane, Robert O.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Morse, JC (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Robertson Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",jcmorse@princeton.edu; rkeohane@princeton.edu,,,,,,,58,280,301,17,137,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

This article engages with this debate by reporting on a qualitative, empirical study undertaken in a domain that has been largely neglected by sociology: professional accounting. Focusing on the elite Big 4' accounting firms, the ways in which partners and other senior accountants embody institutional logics into their habitus are analysed. It is shown that the embodiment of different logics is inextricably linked to the establishment of hierarchy within the Big 4, with a commercial-professional logic accorded a significantly higher status than a technical-professional logic. Further, the article responds to critics of Bourdieu's notion of habitus, highlighting how habitus does not merely denote the passive internalization of external structures, but is also capable of disembodying constraining institutional logics, thereby highlighting scope for professional self-determination.","[Spence, Crawford] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Carter, Chris] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Warwick; University of Edinburgh,"Spence, C (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Gibbet Hill Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",crawford.spence@wbs.ac.uk,,"Carter, Chris/0000-0003-1610-7577; Spence, Crawford William/0000-0003-0355-8002",,,,,37,113,117,3,54,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We consider Italy as a case study, given that: at the national level caesarean sections are above OECD average but regional variation is significant; almost all childbirths are managed within the National Health Service, in a public or a private hospital; regional governments are in charge of managing and funding (at least partially) health care services. Controlling for average patients' characteristics and the riskiness of births, in the attempt to separate appropriate from inappropriate treatments, we find that regional policies and institutions do matter. In particular, our results suggest that decentralised DRG tariffs might be an effective policy tool to control inappropriateness, once the role of private providers is taken into account Also the degree of fiscal autonomy in funding regional health expenditure, and the experience of regional government's president are important.

Using Engel curves, AlmAyens (Am Econ Rev 102:1093-1117, 2012) was, however, able to show that PPPs contain substantial bias. Since constructing conventional estimates is expensive and time consuming, AlmAyens' idea of employing Engel curves is welcome. This article examines the viability of the Engel curve approach to PPP and its sensitivity to differences in relative prices and preferences by estimating Engel curves not only between countries but also for regions within a given country. My empirical evidence from the United States and Norway suggests that the differences can be problematic, but not sufficiently to discredit the new methodology. A pragmatic approach to PPP estimation between countries that are different is to compute a PPP band, rather than a point estimate. I present a practical example of this using expenditure data from 2001, which yields a band for NOK and US dollar.","BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, N-0442 Oslo, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School,"Larsen, ER (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, N-0442 Oslo, Norway.",erling.roed.larsen@bi.no,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We find that homeowners are easily persuaded to follow the herd and adopt a strategic default proclivity consistent with that of their peers. Herding behavior is stronger when a Maven, or thought leader, is involved and weaker when the person finds strategic default to be morally objectionable. Homeowners appear to herd more for informational gains rather than for social reasons, and do not herd differentially based on signal strength. In a robustness check using a sample of real estate professionals, the strong mimetic herding result continues to hold.","[Seiler, Michael J.; Lane, Mark A.] Old Dominion Univ, Coll Business Adm, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Harrison, David M.] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business Adm, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Old Dominion University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Seiler, MJ (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Coll Business Adm, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",mseiler@odu.edu; malane@odu.edu; david.m.harrison@ttu.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,36,21,22,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This paper extends this discussion by using more detailed hourly ridership data to model the weather effects. For this purpose, the daily and hourly subway ridership from New York City Transit for the years 2010-2011 is utilized. The paper compares the weather impacts on ridership based on day of week and time of day combinations and further demonstrates that the weather's impact on transit ridership varies based on the time period and location. The separation of ridership models based on time of day provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between trip purpose and weather for transit riders. The paper investigates the role of station characteristics such as weather protection, accessibility, proximity and the connecting bus services by developing models based on station types. The findings indicate substantial differences in the extent to which the daily and hourly models and the individual weather elements are able to explain the ridership variability and travel behavior of transit riders. By utilizing the time of day and station based models, the paper demonstrates the potential sources of weather impact on transit infrastructure, transit service and trip characteristics. The results suggest the development of specific policy measures which can help the transit agencies to mitigate the ridership differences due to adverse weather conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, we show that when the men's preference domain is unrestricted, the no-detour condition is also a necessary condition for the existence of stable and strategy-proof rules. As a result, under the assumption that the men's preference domain is unrestricted, the following three statements are equivalent: (i) a preference domain satisfies the no-detour condition, (ii) there is a stable and group strategy-proof rule, (iii) there is a stable and strategy-proof rule.","Waseda Univ, Dept Math, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1698555, Japan",Waseda University,"Akahoshi, T (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Dept Math, Shinjuku Ku, 3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan.",akahoshi@suou.waseda.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730177] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,16,4,5,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2014,43.0,3,,,,,683.0,702,,10.1007/s00355-014-0803-1,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AO6WX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341494500010,0

Unlike any other period in recent history, during the boom LIMM homeowners refinanced their mortgages more frequently than non-LIMM homeowners. This occurred primarily among borrowers for whom the refinance option was not in-the-money, and it is likely attributable to the concurrent growth of subprime, cash-out refinancing. Following the 2007 mortgage market collapse, however, LIMM homeowners were less likely to refinance.

Characterizing personality by use of seven complementary measures (Big Five personality traits, locus of control, and a measure of reciprocity), the empirical findings show that personal characteristics are important determinants of occupational choice. Associated with that, identical personality traits are differently rewarded across occupations. Hence, breaking down the analysis on the level of occupational groups provides more detailed results of returns to personality. By evaluating different personality profiles, we additionally estimate the influence of personality as a whole. The estimates establish occupation-specific patterns of significant returns to particular personality profiles.

It appears that these amounts could be reduced substantially, with benefits to both household budgets and the environment's well-being. This paper's goal is to evaluate the alternative mechanisms that could expedite energy efficiency retrofits for U.S. housing. We begin by evaluating the evidence that significant improvements in the energy efficiency of existing U.S. housing are feasible, both technologically and financially. We compare the relatively optimistic positions taken in McKinsey and Company (2009a,b), EPRI (2009), and Harcourt, Brown, and Carey (2011) versus the less optimistic appraisal in Allcott and Greenstone (2012). We conclude that significant energy savings do appear to be both technologically and financially feasible. The remainder of the paper considers the bottlenecks that hamper energy-saving investments for the residential sector. We focus on imperfect information and loan market failures as the two key factors. We evaluate the state of the art with respect to scoring and assessment tools for energy-saving investments and the On-Bill, PACE, and Solar programs to facilitate secured loans. The discussion concludes with a series of proposals to overcome the bottlenecks. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we examine this issue from the developers' perspective, and draw on data from Singapore's Green Mark (GM) system, which was introduced in 2005 to evaluate the sustainability and energy-efficiency of buildings. We find that the green price premium of residential developments arises largely during the resale phase, relative to the presale stage. The market premium of GM-rated units is about 10% at the resale stage, compared to about 4% during the presale stage. This implies that, while developers pay for almost all of the additional costs of energy efficiency during construction, they only share part of the benefits associated with such green investments. We also find no evidence that the development of green housing can immediately and significantly improve the corporate financial performance of Singaporean residential developers. These results provide the first evidence of the mismatch that developers face between outlays and benefits in the residential green building sector. This mismatch may impede further development of green residential properties. The emerging green real estate markets should be encouraged to introduce innovative business arrangements and financial products that allow residential developers to capture the future benefits associated with green properties.

Adapting a political economy perspective, this paper attempts to discover the impact of political economic variables on the liberalization process in electricity markets. Empirical models are developed using panel data from 55 developed and developing countries covering the period 1975-2010. The research findings clearly show that political variables have a significant impact on the reform progress. Consistent with public choice theory and economic theory of regulation, our results suggest that a portion of the differences in the reform experiences of reforming countries in the past three decades can be explained by differences in the relative strength of interest groups. We find that industry sector has a significant impact on the pace of power market liberalization process; and as its size gets larger, so does its influence. Our results also imply that countries receiving foreign financial support are more likely to liberalize their electricity markets, which underlines the point that reforms may not be always voluntary. In addition, our findings suggest that government ideology is one of the determinants of the progress in electricity market reform process. Finally, the paper also questions whether politicians' education and profession matter for the electricity market reforms. Overall, the results show they do.","[Erdogdu, Erkan] Energy Market Regulatory Author, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey; [Erdogdu, Erkan] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",Ministry of Energy & Natural Resources - Turkey; University of Cambridge,"Erdogdu, E (通讯作者)，Energy Market Regulatory Author, Muhsin Yazicioglu Cd,51-C, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey.",erkan@erdogdu.net,"Erdogdu, Erkan/A-5234-2011","Erdogdu, Erkan/0000-0001-6788-1090",Cambridge Overseas Trust,Cambridge Overseas Trust,"I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr. Michael Pollitt and Prof. David Newbery, for all their helpful comments and suggestions.

The results provide evidence of a positive and significant relationship between the hourly day-ahead electricity price (relative to the natural gas price) and the subsequent actual hourly load.

Thus, alternative vehicle technologies and energy pathways are being considered in order to overturn this trend and electric mobility is considered one adequate possibility towards a more sustainable transportation sector. In this sense, this research work consisted on the development of a methodology to assess the economic feasibility of deploying EV charging stations (Park-EV) by quantifying the tradeoff between economic and energy/environmental impacts for EV parking spaces deployment. This methodology was applied to 4 different cities (Lisbon, Madrid, Minneapolis and Manhattan), by evaluating the influence of parking premium, infrastructure cost and occupancy rates on the investment Net Present Value (NPV). The main findings are that the maximization of the premium and the minimization of the equipment cost lead to higher NPV results. The NPV break-even for the cities considered is more easily reached for higher parking prices, namely in the case of Manhattan with the higher parking price profile. In terms of evaluating occupancy rates of the EV parking spaces, shifting from a low usage (LU) to a high usage (HU) scenario represented a reduction in the premium to obtain a NPV = 0 of approximately 14% for a 2500 epsilon equipment cost, and, in the case of a zero equipment cost (e.g. financed by the city), a NPV = 0 was obtained with approximately a 2% reduction in the parking premium. Moreover, due to the use of electric mobility instead of the average conventional technologies, Well-to-Wheel (WTW) gains for Lisbon, Madrid, Minneapolis and Manhattan were estimated in 58%, 53%, 52% and 75% for energy consumption and 66%, 75%, 62% and 86% for CO2 emissions, respectively. This research confirms that the success of deploying an EV charging stations infrastructure will be highly dependent on the price the user will have to pay, on the cost of the infrastructure deployed and on the adhesion of the EV users to this kind of infrastructure. These variables are not independent and, consequently, the coordination of public policies and private interest must be promoted in order to reach an optimal solution that does not result in prohibitive costs for the users.

Starting from this evidence, Italian import flows of woody biomasses for energy use were analyzed over the period 1991-2011 both in quantitative and economic terms. Then, the environmental impacts of these flows have been estimated by means of a Life-Cycle Analysis to determine whether, and to what extent, the increased transport distance reduces the environmental sustainability of these materials with respect to conventional fossil fuels.

However, these benefits will not be realized if consumers do not adopt this new technology. Several agent-based models have been developed to model potential market penetration of PHEVs, but gaps in the available data limit the usefulness of these models. To address this, we administered a survey to 1000 stated US residents, using Amazon Mechanical Turk, to better understand factors influencing the potential for PHEV market penetration. Our analysis of the survey results reveals quantitative patterns and correlations that extend the existing literature. For example, respondents who felt most strongly about reducing US transportation energy consumption and cutting greenhouse gas emissions had, respectively, 71 and 44 times greater odds of saying they would consider purchasing a compact PHEV than those who felt least strongly about these issues. However, even the most inclined to consider a compact PHEV were not generally willing to pay more than a few thousand US dollars extra for the sticker price. Consistent with prior research, we found that financial and battery-related concerns remain major obstacles to widespread PHEV market penetration. We discuss how our results help to inform agent-based models of PHEV market penetration, governmental policies, and manufacturer pricing and marketing strategies to promote consumer adoption of PHEVs.

In this paper, we provide these long-overdue insights using data from a large-scale phone survey (over 7000 samples) conducted in the aftermath of hurricane Irene in the Hampton Roads region in Virginia. Via aggregate and disaggregate analyses, we start to unravel the behavior of this heavily understudied, and potentially vulnerable population group. Special emphasis will be placed on the differences between the medically fragile and non-medically fragile population. Two alternative definitions for what constitutes medically fragile are examined in this paper. Using the broader definition, it was found that a key difference between these two groups relates to the importance of having a strong network of family members in the area.

The reasons why MDBs set their prices at a given level and why those prices might vary from one MDB to another has received scant attention in academia, even though inexpensive loan costs are the primary reason countries borrow from MDBs. The paper explores these issues in three MDBs, each with a different composition of shareholding countries - the World Bank (controlled by wealthy non-borrowing countries), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) (more evenly balanced between non-borrowing and borrowing countries) and the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) (controlled by borrowing countries). Evidence indicates that MDB shareholder composition has a major impact on loan prices, in sometimes unexpected ways. While the backing of wealthy countries allows the World Bank and IADB to raise resources on capital markets more cheaply than the CAF, the interests of those same non-borrowing countries in using MDB net income make loan costs significantly higher at those MDBs - especially the World Bank - than they would be otherwise. These results provide support to an institutionalist approach in focusing on the importance of shareholding and voting rules to better understand MDB activities.","Univ Zurich, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Humphrey, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,57,28,32,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In this paper we attempt to address an often neglected issue in these models: The problem of outliers in the data. Most papers take an ad-hoc approach to this problem and simply screen datasets prior to estimation and remove anomalous observations. We investigate whether forecasting performance can be improved by using the original unscreened dataset and replacing principal components with a robust alternative. We propose to use an estimator based on least absolute deviations (LAD) as this alternative and establish a tractable method for computing the estimator. In addition to this we demonstrate the robustness features of the estimator through a number of Monte Carlo simulation studies. Finally, we apply the estimator in a simulated real-time forecasting exercise to test its merits. We use a newly compiled dataset of US macroeconomic series spanning the period 1971:2-2012:10. Our findings suggest that the chosen treatment of outliers does affect forecasting performance and that in many cases improvements can be made using a robust estimator such as the proposed LAD estimator.","[Kristensen, Johannes Tang] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Kristensen, Johannes Tang] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",CREATES; Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Kristensen, JT (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",jtang@creates.au.dk,"Kristensen, Johannes Tang/C-3025-2013","Kristensen, Johannes Tang/0000-0002-9494-6619",,,,,36,4,4,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The degree of sticky information is estimated using a GMM estimator that matches the covariance between inflation and the shocks that affect firms' pricing decisions. Although the SIPC contains an infinite number of terms, the theoretical covariances derived from the model have finite dimensions, thus allowing the estimation of the structural parameters without any truncation of the original model. This work shows that sticky information is significantly different if the model is estimated by matching inflation persistence or inflation variance. Previous empirical literature found that the SIPC model does not provide an accurate representation of the US postwar inflation. This paper qualifies such a finding by demonstrating that the SIPC is able to match the inflation persistence only at the cost of mismatching the inflation variance.","Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Molinari, B (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville 41013, Spain.",molinari@upo.es,"Molinari, Benedetto/ABF-6822-2021","Molinari, Benedetto/0000-0002-6212-2412",,,,,23,0,1,1,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Innovation depends on an enterprise's ability to generate new knowledge and absorb external knowledge, and KIBS are external providers of knowledge. The process ends when the acquired knowledge has an effect on innovation and the impact is reflected in increased productivity. This approach assesses learning through interaction and space. It applies multidimensional scaling to detect associations between variables and LTPS. The results indicate that most changes in productivity are caused by a combination of tacit and codified knowledge, but this differs depending on the LIPS. Labour productivity also increases in the LIPS, winch further increases the supply of KIBS.","[Antonio Alvarez-Gonzalez, Jose; Olga Gonzalez-Morales, Ma] Univ La Laguna, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Inst Econ Stat & Econometr, Tenerife 38071, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"González-Morales, MO (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Inst Econ Stat & Econometr, Camino Hornera S-N,Campus Guajara, Tenerife 38071, Spain.",josalvar@ull.es; olgonzal@ull.edu.es,"Gonzalez-Morales, Olga/L-9500-2014","Gonzalez-Morales, Olga/0000-0002-3754-2300",,,,,45,4,5,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In contrast to existing contributions, the multiple values are reflected by partial (viz. incomplete) orderings. It is shown that a slight modification of the conditions employed by Arrow implies a spread of the dictate of one identity to its 'incomplete parts'. The second result reveals that if one requires the decision making power to be spread a bit more equally across the various parts of a person's identity, then even the derivation of an acyclic all-things-considered preference is rendered impossible. A third result shows that requiring some minimal consistency among a person's plural identities, introduced via a domain restriction, allows the avoidance of the highlighted impossibilities.","Erasmus Univ, Dept Philosophy, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Binder, C (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Philosophy, Campus Woudestein,Postbus 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",binder@fwb.eur.nl,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2014,42.0,4,,,,,959.0,976,,10.1007/s00355-013-0761-z,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AG1FT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335161200011,0

In this paper, we demonstrate that air pollution in Chinese cities is degraded by cross-boundary externalities. We use this exogenous source of variation in a city's air pollution to present new robust estimates of the real estate impact of local air pollution. We find that reductions in cross-boundary pollution flows have significant effects on local home prices. On average, a 10 % decrease in imported neighbor pollution is associated with a 0.76 % increase in local home prices.

There is an increasing tendency towards legitimization and formalization of these circuits by integrating traditionally manufactured products, mainly butter, Raib (curd) and L'ben (fermented milk) into marketing channels (groceries, stores, etc).","[Belhadia, Mohamed; Djermoun, Abdelkader] Univ Chlef, Chlef, Algeria; [Yakhlef, Hacene] Ecole Natl Super Agron Alger, Algiers, Algeria; [Bourbouze, Alain] Inst Agon Mediterraneen Montpellier, Montpellier, France",Universite Hassiba Ben Bouali de Chlef; CIHEAM; CIHEAM IAM Montpellier,"Belhadia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chlef, Chlef, Algeria.",,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,3,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2014,13.0,1,,,,,41.0,49,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AG2VW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335276200006,0

The Case of Immigration Policy,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FOREIGN-POLICY,"In the absence of an international migration regime, the rising salience of migration issues and the limits of unilateral policies led the European Union to seek appropriate venues for co-operation with the sending and transit countries of migrants. Many of the newer relevant multilateral or regional venues are soft law frameworks. Conversely, trade agreements provide a formal, hard law instrument for inserting migration clauses. Based on a quantitative analysis of EU trade agreements and expert interviews, this article investigates how far the EU is engaging in strategic issue-linkage when including migration clauses in its trade agreements.

Particularly in metropolitan areas during morning peak hours, many studies have revealed a considerable difference in the crowding of specific cars on a single train. To accommodate the impact of this phenomenon in calculating metro capacity, a loading diversity factor has been adopted in many transportation studies. However, the underlying causes behind the uneven nature of carriage loading have rarely been examined in a systematic manner. In particular, there has been no trial to explain the nature of choice within a framework for individual passengers. Under the assumption that the uneven selection might stem from each passenger's intrinsic preference for a specific car, the present study established a nested logit model to investigate the potential factors affecting the choice of a specific car on a train. Passengers were interviewed as they boarded from the platforms of line 7 of the Seoul Metro during the morning peak hours. Results show that the motivation to minimize the walking distance at destination stations turned out to be the most decisive in determining a passenger's choice for a specific car of a train.

Existing studies, using OLS to estimate the supervisor gender effect, find wage penalties for both men and women associated with working for a female supervisor. We extend this research in two important ways. First, we control for gender segregation at job level as opposed to the broader occupation level. This is important because of the concern that supervisor gender is simply a proxy for the gender-type of the job. Second, we apply fixed effects estimation to control for selection effects of supervisor gender. When using OLS we find estimates of the supervisor gender effect similar to those in the existing literature. However, when using fixed effects we find no evidence of a supervisor gender effect for women and only a small, marginally significant effect for men. We conclude that existing OLS estimates overstate the importance of the impact of supervisor gender on wages.","[Sicilian, Paul] Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Econ, Grand Rapids, MI 49504 USA; [Grossberg, Adam J.] Trinity Coll, Dept Econ, Hartford, CT 06106 USA",Grand Valley State University; Trinity College,"Sicilian, P (通讯作者)，Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Econ, 50 Front Ave SW, Grand Rapids, MI 49504 USA.",siciliap@gvsu.edu,,,,,,,20,1,3,1,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Previous studies have identified that public sector workers typically have a higher level of intrinsic motivation, compared to workers in the private sector. This paper compares (measures of) intrinsic motivation among 30,000+ workers in the two sectors across 51 countries using data from the World Values Survey. We find that public sector workers exhibit higher intrinsic motivation in many countries, but that this is not a universal relationship. One possibility is that public sector mission may influence whether or not motivated workers choose to work in the sector. In support of this, we show that the level of (public) corruption-which plausibly affects mission-can explain some of the variation across countries in the proportion of motivated workers in the sector.","[Cowley, Edd] Univ Bristol, Ctr Market & Publ Org, Bristol BS8 1TX, Avon, England; [Smith, Sarah] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol BS8 1TX, Avon, England; [Smith, Sarah] Univ Bristol, CMPO, Bristol BS8 1TX, Avon, England",University of Bristol; University of Bristol; University of Bristol,"Smith, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, 2 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TX, Avon, England.",sarah.smith@bristol.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,27,25,31,1,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2014,76.0,2,,,,,241.0,263,,10.1007/s11238-013-9371-6,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA1AW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330829500006,0

In this regard, the experience of Poland with its more flexible approach and relative success in weathering the storm is notable. Shortly before the tumult erupted, the country witnessed a dramatic decline in its unemployment rate from one of the highest in the EU-27 to a figure below the average. However, this turnaround was apparently driven by amendments to the country's Labour Code, which generated an enormous increase in temporary working. Using consecutive annual panels from the Labour Force Survey, a strong link between this development and the fall in unemployment is identified. A multinomial logit model reveals that the flows were most heavily concentrated among males, young workers of both sexes and the less well educated. There is also evidence that fixed-term work lured previously discouraged individuals back into the labour market. However, the requirement that Poland aligns its temporary employment legislation with that of the EU could conceivably lead to at least a partial reversal of fortune.","[Ingham, Hilary] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster, England; [Ingham, Mike] Ansdell Consulting, Lytham St Annes, England",Lancaster University,"Ingham, H (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster, England.",,,"Ingham, Hilary Clistina/0000-0003-1437-4444",,,,,52,2,2,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2014,37.0,2,,,,,290.0,310,,10.1111/twec.12106,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AA0OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330793500006,0

This paper evaluates the impact of an early nutrition policy, Los Angeles Unified School District's food-and-beverage standards of 2004, using two large datasets on food intake and physical measures. I implement cohort and cross-section estimators using synthetic control groups, combinations of unaffected districts that are reweighted to closely resemble the treatment unit in the pre-intervention period. The results indicate that the policy was mostly ineffective at reducing the prevalence of overweight or obesity 8-15 months after the intervention but significantly decreased consumption of two key targets, soda and fried foods. The policy's impact on physical outcomes appears to be mitigated by substitution toward foods that are still (or newly) available in the schools. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Assumingsufficient group size variation, this approach allows to control for correlated effects at the group level and to solve the simultaneity (reflection) problem. We clarify the intuition behind identification of peer effects in the model. We investigate peer effects in student achievement in French, Science, Mathematics and History in secondary schools in the Province of Quebec (Canada). We estimate the model using conditional maximum likelihood and instrumental variables methods. We find some evidence of peer effects. The endogenous peer effect is large and significant in Mathematics but imprecisely estimated in the other subjects. Some contextual peer effects are also significant. In particular, for most subjects, the average age of peers has a negative effect on own test score. Using calibrated Monte Carlo simulations, we find that high dispersion in group sizes helps with potential issues of weak identification.

However, in order to realize the benefits of the effects of tourism, the public sector must achieve certain prerequisites for the development of tourism. The public sector by its intervening in tourism development seeks to achieve its long-term sustainable development, i.e. the maximization of benefits from tourism activities while preserving the attractiveness of tourist destinations. After an overview of issues associated with measuring tourism, the paper describes some of the characteristics and possibilities for improving the Croatian tourism. Croatian public sector should adequately evaluate its tourism potentials. To bring about improving Croatian tourism, modern management practices will be needed, together with the creation of a desirable destination image, adequate valorization of natural, historical and cultural heritage, innovative forms of investment, and improvement in the infrastructure facilities. The next part deals with the role of the public sector in tourism. The fundamental role of the public sector in tourism lies in planning its development. The last part of the paper is based on conclusion that sustainable development is the reason for the public sector interventionism in tourism. However, the level to which the public sector can influence tourism flows is limited. Successful management of tourism as much as tourism planning and regulation of activities related to tourism, requires coordination between government bodies, interest groups, private sector and the involvement of local and regional government.","Univ Zadar, Dept Tourism & Commun Studies, Zadar, Croatia",University of Zadar,"Bunja, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zadar, Dept Tourism & Commun Studies, Zadar, Croatia.",,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,775.0,782,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900100,0

We empirically investigate the channels that favored the diffusion of southern Italian mafias to the northern Italian provinces. We focus our attention on two key factors: i) the large influx of southern migrants during the economic miracle period and ii) the application of the confino law which imposed mafiosi to resettle far from their province of origin. Our findings suggest that the interaction between forced resettlement and migration has represented a crucial factor in favoring criminal organization transplantation to central and northern regions.

The empirical analysis uses Australian data obtained in 2008 through the South Australian Health Omnibus Survey. A quantile regression analysis is used to allow the marginal effects of the explanatory variables on BMI to vary across the conditional BMI distribution. It is shown that an indicator of intertemporal discounting elicited from a hypothetical monetary trade-off has a significant positive relationship with BMI. This relationship appears to be stronger in the upper quantiles, but there is insufficient statistical evidence for this difference. Evidence is presented that intertemporal discounting is a risk factor for increased BMI with a magnitude of effect comparable to more commonly recognized risk factors such as income and education. However there is no significant relationship found between BMI and an alternative indicator of intertemporal discounting elicited from trade-offs in health status. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays both countries utilize their economic potential in a different ways that is reflected in their overall level of economic development and is determined by economic development of their regions. Both countries have a common feature that is socio-economic disparities in the development of the regions in each country. The issue of regional disparities has become a topic discussed not only in Slovakia and the Czech Republic but also in other EU countries. The goal of the paper is to identify similarities or disparities in the development according to the analysed indicators in the Slovak and Czech regions in a given periods of time, time series. The methods of time series analysis, comparison and synthesis are deployed in the research. Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic development and growth and it is an indicator of the efficiency of a country or a region. The economic development of a country and its regions is directly affected by the labour market situation and especially by the employment rate. The paper is aimed at monitoring the economic efficiency of the regions of Slovakia and the Czech Republic. We have selected and analysed indicators of gross domestic product per capita expressed in purchasing power parity and employment rate in selected Slovak and Czech regions. In the paper, a region is defined as a territorial unit meaning NUTS II. The period of time covers 2001-2012. The goal of the paper is to identify similarities or disparities in the development through indicators analysed in the regions. The methods of time series analysis, comparison and synthesis are deployed. The analyses, which have been carried out indicate, that the Czech Republic tends to mitigate a regional disparity mainly via unemployment, while Slovak disparities in both indicators have been becoming more extensive. This is caused by an over-development of Bratislava region, which has recorded the highest economic growth among all analysed regions.","[Ivanova, Eva; Koisova, Eva] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Trencin, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Ivanová, E (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Trencin, Slovakia.",,"Koišová, Eva/AIB-8438-2022","Koišová, Eva/0000-0003-1701-4217",,,,,8,7,7,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,405.0,412,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900052,0

This article will analyze how the innovation is implemented into industrial and competitiveness policies processes, how important role it plays within the current global economic recession to assure sustainable economic growth in the world economy and enhance the competitiveness within the world economy triad environment. By means of analysis, comparative analysis methods followed by logical deduction the main aim of this paper is to figure out how and in what way the technology and innovation implementation processes in business environment can affect the international economics system in terms of the international trade promotion measurements. The world economic triad subjects' position, such as European Union, USA and Japan, in international economic relations will also be the object of study with regards to their competitiveness enhancement possibilities within the global economic environment while using the latest science and technology achievements. The goal of all those efforts is supposed to lead to sustainable social and economic development and better quality of life in the global world economy environment.","[Kordos, Marcel; Karbach, Rolf] Alexander Dubcek Univ, Trencin, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Kordos, M (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ, Trencin, Slovakia.",,"Kordoš, Marcel/P-4568-2018","Kordoš, Marcel/0000-0002-1833-7096",,,,,15,14,14,1,11,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,653.0,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800081,0

Conducted research indicates that eastern Croatia, on average, is the least competitive and requires a significant investment to reach the other regions, especially in the development of entrepreneurship, business infrastructure and investment incentives. The paper aims to show the importance of entrepreneurship for the development of eastern Croatia compared to other counties and regions, the number, structure, composition and business activities of entrepreneurs, relevant financial statements, particularly the structure of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, financial results i.e. revenues, profits, loss, investment in fixed assets, and the main indicators of financial analysis specifically indicators of labour productivity, business efficiency and profitability of eastern Croatian enterprises. To this end the results of relevant research institutions have been analysed, as well as scientific and technical literature, policy documents and reports. Based on the analysis of available data, synthesis and deduction and in particular classification and comparison with other regions and counties, a conclusion about the position and importance of entrepreneurship for the development of eastern Croatia has been drawn. The research results indicate a low proportion of eastern Croatian entrepreneurs in the overall financial results of Croatian entrepreneurs and a heterogeneous structure of their financial results. Whereas Osijek-Baranjacounty plays a vital role in the development of entrepreneurship, other counties of eastern Croatia are entrepreneurially underdeveloped. The results highlight the problems of entrepreneurship development, particularly lengthy procedures of starting businesses, protecting investors, liquidity and insolvency problems, availability of external sources of financing and associated credit terms, underdevelopment of capital markets and other forms of financing. The importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in the development of eastern Croatia has been emphasized. The analysed area comprises eastern Croatian counties: Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Virovitica-Podravina, Brod-Posavina and Pozega-Slavonia.","[Kovacevic, Branko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Kovacevic, Marina] Coll Business & Management BA Krcelic, Zapresic 10290, Croatia; [Krsul, Svea] VERN Univ Appl Sci, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Kovacevic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",bkovacevic@efzg.hr; kovacevic.marina4@gmail.com; svea.krsul@vern.hr,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,65.0,74,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600006,0

A central property of these games is that they are potential games and hence posses a pure Nash equilibrium. In reality, it is often the case that some players cooperatively decide on their joint action in order to maximize the coalition's total utility. This is modeled by Coalitional Congestion Games. Typical settings include truck drivers who work for the same shipping company, or routers that belong to the same ISP. The formation of coalitions will typically imply that the resulting coalitional congestion game will no longer posses a pure Nash equilibrium.

Yet, Coase frequently argued late in his career that he had been misunderstood, and that the central message(s) of the article lay elsewhere. Though virtually all of the discussion in decades following the publication of The Problem of Social Cost focused on Coase's negotiation result, the fact is that Coase's message was not, at the start, misunderstood. This paper takes up a number of the treatments of The Problem of Social Cost in the years immediately following its publication to demonstrate that Coase's emphasis on the reciprocal nature of externalities, the importance of transaction costs, the possibility of merger solutions, the costs associated with state action, and the need for a comparative institutional approach were anything but lost on these early commentators. It was only later that the negotiation result became the major fixation of interpreters of Coase's work.","Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80217 USA",Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado Denver,"Medema, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",steven.medema@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,,51,9,9,0,9,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The scientific results are completed by the analysis of the structure of the tourism accommodation according to the comfort degree, beside its tourist function analysis, which outlines the general image of the tourism accommodation infrastructure in the region.","[Samoila, Eduardt] Hyperion Univ, Bucharest, Romania; [Alexe, Radita] Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Romania; [Mihaescu, Mariana] Constantin Brancoveanu Coll, Targoviste, Romania",Valahia University of Targoviste; Constantin Brancoveanu University,"Samoila, E (通讯作者)，Hyperion Univ, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,889.0,896,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900114,0

With the accession of Croatia in the European Union, environmental protection policies gained further significance. A swift increase in the number of inhabitants worldwide leads to faster depletion of natural resources, so the protection and restoration of natural resources, which are limited, are necessary. Based on the aim of the paper, we used (1) qualitative research method - analysis of the secondary data base (2) financial projection of project feasibility. The results of abovementioned research point to the fact that investments in ecological projects have multiple beneficial effects in the sense of: a) environmental protection, b) employment, c) implementation of technological innovation, d) stimulus to growing entrepreneurial business. This paper can prompt new entrepreneurs to enter the field of ecology which has the support of the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development (HBOR) via various programmes (the Programme for preparation of renewable energy projects and the Programme on funding environmental protection projects, projects on energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy) and to cooperate with foreign participants through Funds for environmental protection, for example, the Fond Green for Growth for South-Eastern Europe.","[Saracevic, Nerma; Bekic, Ivana; Kraljic, Tihana] JJ STROSSMAYER Univ, Doctoral Program Entrepreneurship & Innovativenes, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Saracevic, N (通讯作者)，JJ STROSSMAYER Univ, Doctoral Program Entrepreneurship & Innovativenes, Osijek, Croatia.",nermasa@bih.net.ba; ivana.bekic@gmail.com; tihana.kraljic@kc.t-com.hr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,499.0,509,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600049,0

To offer some insights, this article examines a timing decision from sports. The penalty shootout in football (soccer) has long been seen as problematic, among other reasons because it creates incentives for excessively cautious play during extra time. One proposal to alleviate this has been to alter the timing, and stage the shootout before (rather than after) extra time with the result binding only if the subsequent extra time offers no resolution. Carrillo's (2007) theoretical model shows that since the effect of this rule change is ambiguous in theory, the proposal's desirability needs to be assessed empirically. Using a comprehensive match data set, the authors compare scoring outcomes of various treatment and control groups, whereby the former simulate closely players' incentives from the proposed rule change, and the latter represent the current timing. Most importantly, the authors examine how extra time scoring probabilities depend on a goal being scored in the first 5 (or 15) min of extra time. Their estimates suggest that bringing the shootout before extra time would substantially alter the players' incentives in extra time and produce more overall attacking play. Quantitatively, the rule change is predicted to increase the odds of extra time scoring about threefold. Specifically, for the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA club competitions, the probability of scoring in extra time is estimated to increase on average by 45-60%, depending on various factors such as the result in regulation time, balancedness of the teams, and home ground advantage. In summary, all these results suggest that the case for trialing the proposed rule is strong. More generally, they highlight the incentive channels through which sequencing of policies may determine their effectiveness.","[Lenten, Liam J.

It is based on the records kept by the Government of Canada of 97,123 Chinese immigrants who were required to pay an entry tax between 1885 and 1949. While the study population included both sexes and all ages from infancy to old age, it was largely male, with most ages falling between 12 and 50. The data reveal an increase of over 4 cm in the adult heights of both sexes between 1850 and 1930. They also indicate an upward trend of over 5 cm in the heights of adolescent males. The mean heights of male immigrants fall in the lower range of those reported in other studies of stature in south China. The rising trends contrast with a pattern of stagnation and decline reported in other recent findings but are consistent with other recent evidence of increasing economic growth, real wages, and life expectancy in south China during this period. One likely cause of improved well-being is the influence of the migrants' remittances on socioeconomic change in south China. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Management of transboundary fish stocks is particularly problematic because national authorities can pursue different objectives. Supply regimes are also affected by biological variables, strategic interaction and management choices. In this paper, we present a bioeconomic model in the case of two fleets competing for two target species. A numerical application, using a surplus production model and game theory, is performed for the small pelagic fishery in the Adriatic Sea.

There are differences in productivity growth and investment spike patterns across different sub-industries and food manufacturing industry in general. Our study finds empirical support for the learning-by-doing hypothesis by identifying some cases where the impact of investment spikes on TFP growth presents a U-shaped investment age-productivity growth pattern. However, efficiency and the learning period associated with investment spikes differ among plants across industries. The most pronounced impact of investment age on productivity growth (5.3 % for meat products, 4% for dairy products, and 2.8 % in all food manufacturing plants) occurs during the fifth year of post-investment spike. Thus, in general, the productivity gains tend to be fully realized with a 5-year technology learning period for this industry.","[Geylani, Pinar Celikkol] Duquesne Univ, Dept Econ, Palumbo Donahue Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA; [Stefanou, Spiro E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Stefanou, Spiro E.] Business Econ Grp, University Pk, PA USA; [Stefanou, Spiro E.] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Duquesne University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Wageningen University & Research,"Geylani, PC (通讯作者)，Duquesne Univ, Dept Econ, Palumbo Donahue Sch Business, 821 Rockwell Hall,600 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA.",geylanip@duq.edu; spiros@psu.edu,"Stefanou, Spiro/V-5770-2017","Stefanou, Spiro/0000-0001-8366-6577",,,,,35,26,28,0,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The heart of the analysis is a major in-depth interview programme with 81 senior rail managers in 2008 followed by a survey of the same managers 4 years later (2012/2013). Our results reveal how rail managers perceive their transactions in the real world as opposed to pure transaction cost theory. For both snapshots, co-ordination and contractual aspects particularly related to timetabling and real time operations are seen as more crucial than the traditional investment hold up or lock in transaction cost economics issues. In all three systems good relationships are indicated as the most important contributor to making the system work. It does appear that having many of these issues resolved internally by members of a single group simplifies the transactions considerably. But there is a cost to this when competition is desirable, as it creates greater uncertainty and fear of discrimination on behalf of those train operators outside the group. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Financial internationalization has two components, the liberalization of cross-border capital flows and the liberalization of foreign ownership restrictions, yet most research to date has concentrated exclusively on the former. Building on existing theoretical work, this paper argues that in the developing world, domestic finance favors the joint abolition of restrictions on the inflow of foreign capital alongside continued restrictions on the ability of foreigners to own and operate domestic financial institutions. I test the argument on a unique dataset of foreign entry restrictions in developing economies and by examining interest group pressures for financial internationalization in Indonesia and Mexico. The findings complement and extend recent work on financial internationalization in the developing world and suggest further areas for research in the role of domestic interest group preferences for global economic integration.","[Pepinsky, Thomas B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Int Polit Econ Program, Ithaca, NY USA; [Pepinsky, Thomas B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Cornell Modern Indonesia Project, Ithaca, NY USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Pepinsky, TB (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Int Polit Econ Program, Ithaca, NY USA.",,,,,,,,73,29,39,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Pareto utility is a flexible yet simple and parsimonious two-parameter family. It exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion and increasing but bounded relative risk aversion. It is applicable irrespective of the probability distribution relevant to the prospect to be evaluated. Pareto utility is therefore particularly suited for catastrophic risk analysis. A new and related class of generalized exponential (gexpo) utility functions is also studied.

This study assesses the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors in community-based sample of 430 adult Roma, living in rural area of Croatia, by providing the actual and age-adjusted estimates using the European standard population. The most prominent classical CVD risk phenotypes (blood pressure, obesity, smoking, glucose and lipid profile) were selected, and the standard risk cut-offs were applied. The study has shown that compared to general population of Croatia, the Roma population bears a high CVD risk factors load related to smoking and high glucose level. The CVD risk factors prevalence in Roma also showed important sex and age patterns, the most imposing of which are the findings of higher prevalence of CVD risks in women (especially obesity and triglyceride levels) and the trend of higher body mass index (BMI) level in younger age group (18-34 years) which both stand in contrast to the trends characterizing the general population of Croatia. These findings are complemented by the trend of decreased risk in the oldest age group (65+ years) for all investigated CVD risk factors (with exception of triglycerides level) compared to the 50-64 age group. We conclude that the age and sex CVD risks pattern point to the health transition of this rural Roma population. As we expect the proportion of CVD in the Roma minority of Croatia to increase in the future along with further modernization of their lifestyle, the CVD prevention measures in this population are urgent and should be primarily targeted at women and at the younger segment of this population.

We challenge this depiction and argue that in large part, how you stand on ICM depends on how it is collectively seen as a consequence of empirically and contextually variable intersubjectively shared beliefs, or social facts. We therefore argue that researchers that fail to take social facts seriously run the risk of making unwarranted causal inferences and less effective policy recommendations. We advance the literature by specifying how the ontological novelty of a social facts perspective generates unique insights into key political economy questions concerning the causes and consequences of ICM. We develop an agent-centered perspective that stresses ideational contestation as a key area of analysis for those that take social facts seriously. We push forward this agent-centered perspective by outlining a set of features that winning ideas are likely to display. We then conclude by specifying an agenda for future research and opportunities for bridge-building among various perspectives on ICM.","[Chwieroth, Jeffrey M.] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Sinclair, Timothy J.] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Warwick,"Chwieroth, JM (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,,,,,,109,15,17,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In particular, this study focuses on non-democratic regional IOs and examines the empirical case of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). We investigate how the level of regime transition of each CIS member state affects its participation in the CIS. The paper utilizes an original dataset that contains information regarding the number of CIS-related agreements that have been signed by each CIS member state during the 1991-2010 time period, which can be used to measure the level of participation of each state in the CIS. We find that states with a lower level of democratization and a higher level of marketization are more likely to participate in agreements within the CIS. The paper contributes to the wider application of informal governance framework by demonstrating the usefulness of these theories for understanding the nature and dynamics of regional IOs, such as the CIS.","[Libman, Alexander] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany; [Obydenkova, Anastassia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Pompeu Fabra University,"Obydenkova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",anastassia.obydenkova@upf.edu,"Obydenkova, Anastassia/M-6916-2015; Obydenkova, Anastassia/AAD-5418-2019","Obydenkova, Anastassia/0000-0001-5099-5294; Obydenkova, Anastassia/0000-0001-5099-5294; Libman, Alexander/0000-0001-8504-3007",,,,,46,49,49,0,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We show that if some states face domestic pressure to negotiate a hard law treaty, their incentive to insist on hard law in the negotiations is maximized when less enthusiastic states expect that the hard law will probably not be enforced. Domestic proponents of hard law reward states for negotiating a hard law treaty, while states that oppose hard law can accept it because they expect no enforcement.

These frameworks are critically analysed along five dimensions: the conceptualization of finance; the relations between finance and the economy; the relations between finance and the state; the relations between finance and society; and the nature of the social system. A new framework for the analysis of finance in society is constructed from these elements.

In addition to the immediate environmental, health, and social consequences of the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis, the disaster will have profound political implications. This paper investigates the significance of these effects in one area: Russian-Japanese relations. Specifically, it is asked whether, in combination with pre-existing economic and strategic incentives, the closure of Japan's nuclear plants and resulting need to secure abundant new supplies of energy will finally prompt a sustained warming in ties between Japan and its resource-rich northern neighbor. The merits of this proposal are evaluated through close examination of developments in the energy and political fields between March 2011 and February 2013. Findings indicate that there has indeed been a significant increase in energy ties, accompanied by a remarkable turnaround in political relations. This demonstrates that large-scale improvements in this relationship can quickly be achieved when the incentives are right, although whether such progress can be translated into resolution of the territorial dispute remains doubtful.","Temple Univ Japan, Undergrad Program, Tokyo, Japan",,"Brown, JDJ (通讯作者)，Temple Univ Japan, Undergrad Program, Tokyo, Japan.",james.brown0002@tuj.temple.edu,,,,,,,165,4,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Yet, the rapidly growing literature on the subject often ignores the role that exchange rate regimes play in determining the effect foreign currency remittances have on a recipient economy. This study uses a theoretical model and panel vector autoregression techniques to understand the effect of remittances on GDP, inflation, real exchange rate (RER) and money supply, depending on the exchange rate regimes. Furthermore, it allows a more detailed description of the short-run dynamics as it considers yearly but also quarterly data for 21 emerging countries. Our theoretical model predicts that remittances should temporarily increase inflation, GDP, the domestic money supply and appreciate the RER under a fixed regime, but temporarily decrease inflation, increase GDP, appreciate the RER and generate no change in the money supply under a flexible regime. These differences are largely borne out in the data. This adds to our understanding of the true effect of remittances on economies by showing that exchange rate regimes matter for the effects of remittances, especially in the short run for monetary conditions in an economy and suggests that other results in the literature that do not control for regimes may be biased.","[Ball, Christopher P.] Quinnipiac Univ, Sch Business, Hamden, CT 06518 USA; [Lopez, Claude] Banque France, Int Macroecon Div, Paris, France; [Reyes, Javier] Univ Arkansas, Sam M Walton Coll Business, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Quinnipiac University; European Central Bank; Bank of France; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Ball, CP (通讯作者)，Quinnipiac Univ, Sch Business, Hamden, CT 06518 USA.",,"Lopez, Claude/C-3053-2013; Reyes, Juan/JAN-9859-2023; Reyes, José Antonio Reyes/GXZ-6957-2022","Lopez, Claude/0000-0002-6969-9193;",,,,,20,22,25,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2013,36.0,4,,,,,487.0,507,,10.1111/twec.12042,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,119VR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317127800007,0

This study assesses the impact of the mother being the main or an equal earner on her partner's hours of work. The performance of normative gender roles predicts that fathers increase their hours whereas specialization theories predict they will decrease their hours. Another possibility is that fathers work fewer hours because they have a relatively weak labour market position. We test these alternative propositions using panel data on co-resident parents from the UK's Millennium Cohort Survey. The results show that fathers with a female partner who is the main earner work considerably fewer hours than other fathers. This also holds for equal-earner fathers to a lesser extent. In part, fathers work fewer hours because their partner is the main or an equal earner, but they are also less likely to work in occupations entailing long hours.","[Kanji, Shireen] Univ Basel, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Kanji, S (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Dept Social Sci, Petersgraben 27, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",shireen.kanji@unibas.ch,"Kanji, Shireen/JMP-3043-2023","Kanji, Shireen/0000-0003-3512-2596",,,,,45,16,18,2,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

As detrending methods, we apply the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition, the Hodrick-Prescott filter, the Baxter-King filter, and the structural time series model. The detrended data are analyzed both in the time domain and in the frequency domain. The great advantage of an analysis in the frequency domain is that it allows to assess the relative importance of particular frequencies for the behavior of real wages. We propose to use the phase angle as a suitable measure to get detailed information about the correlation and the lead-lag behavior of real wages relative to GDP at different frequencies. In the time domain, we find that both real wages display a procyclical pattern and lag behind the business cycle. In the frequency domain, the consumer real wage lags behind the business cycle and shows an anticyclical behavior for shorter time periods, whereas for longer time spans a procyclical behavior can be observed. For the producer real wage, however, the results in the frequency domain remain inconclusive.","[Marczak, Martyna; Beissinger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Schloss Museumsfluegel, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Beissinger, Thomas] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University Hohenheim; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Marczak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Schloss Museumsfluegel, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",marczak@uni-hohenheim.de; beissinger@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Beissinger, Thomas/0000-0002-4126-1624; Marczak, Martyna/0000-0001-9397-2666",,,,,38,5,5,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Likewise, production models assume that prices are known a-priori. In reality prices depend on variable demands and supplies, while demand and supply depend on variable prices, and these two processes are interconnected. This paper describes a model that for the first time simulates a combined agent-based double auction market and production model. The model is built around von Neumann technology matrices (von Neumann, Rev Econ Stud 13(1):1-9, 1946) which provide the links between products. Agents possess one or more technologies to produce products from other products. They trade in order to acquire the inputs and sell in order to generate revenue, and the price is determined by a process of negotiation between buyers and sellers. The algorithm of negotiation is based on Cliff's Zero Intelligence Plus approach (Cliff, Minimal-intelligence agents for bargaining behaviors in market-based environments. Technical report, School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, University of Sussex, 1997), but instead of a single commodity with fixed limit prices the agents change their limit prices for multiple products based on the simulated economic situation. The combination of production and market provides a simple but complete bottom-up model framework for microeconomics. As the results show, the model employs a price mechanism that results in an appropriate allocation of resources without a central command.","[Straatman, Bas] Univ Calgary, ISEEE, Energy & Environm Syst Grp, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Marceau, Danielle J.] Univ Calgary, Dept Geomat Engn, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [White, Roger] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Straatman, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, ISEEE, Energy & Environm Syst Grp, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",bastraat@ucalgary.ca,"White, Roger/A-4834-2008","White, Roger/0000-0002-6998-3725","Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy (ISEEE) at the University of Calgary","Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy (ISEEE) at the University of Calgary","Funding for this research was provided by the Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy (ISEEE) at the University of Calgary.",,19,3,3,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Nowhere, however, has the notion of social housing been taken as far as in the countries that formerly were ruled by socialist regimes, most notably the Soviet Union. For this reason, it may be argued that the development of theorizations on housing has much to learn from this large but inconclusively studied example. One of the avowed virtues of socialism was that the system, in theory, guaranteed its subjects equal rights to housing. That this was not quite the case is well known in the literature, but in fact no robust evidence to support this view (or the contrary) has been presented so far. Therefore, this paper's aim is to investigate the functioning of the Soviet system of housing allocation, assessing its claims to social equity and justice. Based on a detailed case study of about 3500 Soviet-era housing allocation decisions made in Daugavpils, Latvia, at five points in time covering various stages in the development of Soviet power (full coverage of decisions made in 1953, 1960, 1970, 1980, and January-April 1990), we illustrate how much living space was allocated to whom. In addition, we detail the characteristics of the waiting times involved. We apply both descriptive and regression methods on our data-set, making a significant contribution to what is known about the outcome of housing allocation under socialism and, at a more general level, under strictly supply-constrained conditions.","[Gentile, Michael] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden; [Gentile, Michael] Sodertorn Univ, Stockholm Ctr Hlth Soc Transit, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sjoberg, Orjan] Stockholm Sch Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Umea University; Sodertorn University; Stockholm School of Economics,"Gentile, M (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden.",michael.gentile@geography.umu.se,"Gentile, Michael/AAL-8027-2021","Gentile, Michael/0000-0001-5224-788X",,,,,75,36,36,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The latter preferences are especially important when the legislator is not pivotal. We show that when the game follows the normal rules of legislatures-most important, that legislators can change their vote after seeing how their fellow legislators have voted-then the only possible equilibrium is one where all legislators ignore their policy preferences. That is, each legislator votes as if he or she is not pivotal. The result, consistent with empirical studies of Congress, suggests that legislators should tend to vote sincerely, rather than sophisticatedly. In this paper we examine how outcomes change if we change the rules for voting. Namely, instead of a simultaneous game, we consider a game where legislators vote sequentially in a pre-determined order. We show that, opposite to the simultaneous game, an alternative wins if and only if a majority of legislators' policy preferences favor that alternative. Our results suggest that if Congress adopted this change in rules, then sophisticated voting would become frequent instead of rare.","[Groseclose, Tim] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci & Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Milyo, Jeffrey] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Groseclose, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci & Econ, 4289 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",timothyg@ucla.edu; milyoj@missouri.edu,,,,,,,3,8,8,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2013,40.0,3,,,,,745.0,751,,10.1007/s00355-011-0639-x,0.0,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,072HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313662000007,0

Innovative survey data on the complete daily activity-scheduling adaptation process is used jointly with revealed scheduling information. The survey, conducted in Zurich, Switzerland, collected daily scheduling information together with stated adaptation responses corresponding to four adaptation scenarios. The four scenarios are defined by applying hypothetical increases in travel time of 50%, 100%, and 200% and a 50% decrease in travel time. Stated adaptation responses are collected in the context of 24-h activity scheduling. Data are used to estimate RUM based daily travel activity scheduling models. Models are estimated for one revealed schedule and four stated scheduling datasets. In addition, a joint model is estimated for pooled revealed and stated scheduling data. In the joint model, separate scale/variance parameters are estimated for revealed and stated information. Results clearly identify the nonlinear responses of activity travel scheduling to the changes in travel time. Asymmetric responses are shown for travel time increases and decreases. People become more conservative with time expenditures when scheduling activities subject to increased travel times. However, beyond a certain limit of travel time increase, scheduling behaviour becomes more unpredictable. The lessons learned from this investigation have implications in the application of activity-based models for forecasting and policy analyses. Models developed using only a revealed preference dataset should not be used to extrapolate to situations where travel times changes by large margins. The results also prove that significant improvements in capturing behavioural responses in the activity scheduling process are possible by pooling revealed preference and stated preference data sets and jointly modelling with an explicit representation of RP scale/variance differences.

This study explores the modal split between road freight transport and combined transport that is enabled by horizontal transshipment technologies, given a dependence on the changing transport mode characteristics that are caused by direct intervention through transport policies as well as by changing environmental factors such as increasing freight volume or diesel prices. In addition, the impact of the heterogeneous forwarders' business models is considered. To estimate the modal split between the road and the combined transport, we combine a Bass model with a discrete choice model. Based on the data derived from an online questionnaire distributed to German forwarders, the model estimates a maximum 42% market penetration ratio for the combined transport. This ratio is captured with the help of the direct subsidization of rail line hauling, which is consequently the strongest lever for the modal shift. This lever is followed by the introduction of long trains, bringing a maximum market penetration of approximately 35%. We reveal that the policies that directly promote combined transport have a stronger effect on the modal shift than the policies that discriminate against road transport. Furthermore, we find that the leverage of the transport policies for the medium range distances is significantly higher than for the long distances. These results can be used as a decision support by government officials for the configuration of their specific transport policies as well as by logistics service providers to adjust their technology investment decisions based on the anticipated user demand in different situations.

In this paper we analyze how these conflicts shifted from the political arena to private standard-setting sites, where two opposing coalitions of actors pursued competing initiatives an industry coalition which aimed at enforcing copyright protection through Digital Rights Management and an emerging coalition of civil society actors which sought to develop a digital commons based on copyleft licenses. Paradoxically, the industry coalition, which had very successfully lobbied international organizations, ran into trouble developing and enforcing private regulation in the market place, while the civil society coalition proved to be more effective in the market than in the political sphere. The findings of our analysis indicate that the strategic use of organizational forms and collective action frames can be more decisive for the mobilization of users than material resources, and that the success of collective action frames depends on their compatibility with user practices. Based on the argument that regime shifting from intergovernmental to private governance can open up new and favorable spaces for weak actors to experiment with alternative forms of regulation, the paper contributes to the literature on the politics of regime complexity. The paper furthermore highlights the importance of studying non-elite actors and their day-to-day practices to gain a better understanding of changes within the international political economy.","[Dobusch, Leonhard] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Management, Berlin, Germany; [Quack, Sigrid] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Res Grp Inst Bldg Borders, Cologne, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Max Planck Society,"Dobusch, L (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Management, Berlin, Germany.",,"Dobusch, Leonhard/J-6573-2019","Dobusch, Leonhard/0000-0002-5448-4683",,,,,121,28,30,3,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

If it is verifiable which partner is informed, the cake-cutting mechanism (CCM) generates a fair allocation by making the informed partner the proposer. If that information is not verifiable and the identity of the proposer is determined through a lottery, the CCM favors the informed partner, too. Moreover, CCM is fairer than the auctions for common distributions of the asset value.","[Li, Jianpei; Xue, Yi; Wu, Weixing] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Li, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, E Huixin St 10, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",lijianpei@uibe.edu.cn; yxue_uibe@163.com; wxwu@uibe.edu.cn,,"Xue, Yi/0000-0001-9418-6704",,,,,33,3,3,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2013,40.0,2,,,,,495.0,527,,10.1007/s00355-011-0610-x,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,072HT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313661600011,0

This article highlights that conflicts within the business community can be an important factor to explain policy outcomes. Drawing on the business conflict school literature from International Relations, studies on the politics of markets developed in Economic Sociology, and work on corporate political strategy undertaken in Management Studies, it develops the concept of the governance-competitiveness nexus to theorize how economic competition translates into political competition. The article demonstrates how such an analytical angle can add to our understanding of the global governance of intellectual property rights for pharmaceuticals. It helps explain the motives of different actors to become politically involved at specific points in time and the policy goals they promoted. Thus, the concepts of business conflict and governance-competitiveness nexus help explain the agenda setting process on global pharmaceutical IP governance.","London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Roemer-Mahler, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1, England.",,,"Roemer-Mahler, Anne/0000-0002-3016-3973",,,,,114,29,32,0,74,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We formulate a simple baseline model that allows for an arbitrary number of sectors with an arbitrary input-output structure. The practical obstacle to using the model in practice lies in the need to find approximate steady-state values of the variables. In the general case, finding a solution to the steady-state problem is diffucult; however, we do provide an analytic solution to a special symmetric case, which can sometimes provide a close enough approximation for non-symmetric problems as well.","[Bisova, Sara; Zouhar, Jan] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,xbiss00@vse.cz; xjave00@vse.cz; kristyna.vltavska@vse.cz; honza.zouhar@gmail.com,"Zouhar, Jan/E-9659-2013; Vltavská, Kristýna/J-1497-2017","Zouhar, Jan/0000-0002-1164-7948;",,,,,7,1,1,0,7,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,55.0,59,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000010,0

A decision maker sets an importance of criteria linguistically. Some criteria values can be stochastic, random variables with some probability distribution, respectively. The criteria values and weights are expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers. The method requires the ranking of fuzzy numbers which is made via modified McCohone's approach. The algorithm is computationally namely based on preference relations among alternatives and also differences in (non)fuzzy evaluations of alternatives. The proposed multiple attribute decision making method is able to choose primarily one effective alternative.

Standard corporate finance theory posits that firms go private when there is no longer a positive tradeoff between the expected benefits and the costs of being public, and it provides empirical evidence that going private decisions are motivated by potential gains from leverage, tax benefits, and expected improvements in corporate governance. Given the unique institutional environment for the REIT industry, this paper sheds new light on the going-private decision. Specifically, we examine the determinants of the going-private decision and document announcement wealth changes using a sample of 160 REITs from 1985 to 2009. We find firm performance and agency-related factors significantly impact the probability that a REIT announces to go private. We find that the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley and a proxy for differential performance in the private and public markets have no significant impact on the decision. The announcement day abnormal return is almost 12% and the three-day abnormal return is 15%, magnitudes that are both statistically and economically significant. Variations in the market reaction are associated with lower levels of cash and higher stock price volatility. Overall, we document a new set of going-private factors and wealth impacts for the REIT industry that are unique from those of previous corporate finance literature.","[Brau, James C.; Carpenter, J.

Using individual data from the 1999-2004 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey merged with tract-level data from the U.S. Census, we investigate several neighborhood characteristics, including neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES), education index of concentration at the extremes (ICE), and population density, as potential predictors of height. Employing a series of two-level random intercept models, we find a one standard deviation increase in NSES to be associated with a 0.6-1.4 cm height advantage for white and foreign-born Mexican-American females and for U.S. born Mexican-American males, net of individual-level controls. Similarly, a 10 point increase in neighborhood education ICE was associated with 0.23-0.32 cm greater height for white and foreign-born Mexican-American females and U.S. born Mexican-American males. Population density was nominally negatively associated with height for foreign-born Mexican-American females. Our findings reveal that lower physical stature for some ethnic and gender groups is clustered within neighborhoods of low SES and education, suggesting that contextual factors may play a role in influencing height above individual-level attributes.

The use of mobile phones is much greater than the use of internet in Ghana, hence m-learning. This project portrays all features of a traditional classroom in a distance learning environment through the use of smart phones. These devices are reshaping user's daily lives in a lot of positive ways. Going one step higher from social communication to mobile learning as a core pedagogical activity in higher institutions of learning is the aim of this paper. Distance learning and e-learning have come a long way, but m-learning will be the primary mode of delivery in future in all kinds of learning streams. UNESCO states the Gross Enrolment percentage for tertiary institutes in Ghana is around 8% of the country's population while the completion ratio could be a bit lesser due to various economic factors. The aim of m-learning is to increase the enrolment ratio in tertiary educational institutes by giving easier access to students for Universities from their own comfort zone in this era of massification in universities. The current International student population of Pentecost University College, is 136 which comes from Botswana, Burkina Faso, Chad, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Lesotho, Madagascar, Nigeria, Togo, Seychelles, Sierra Leone and Zambia. PUC is the chosen organization for the project m-learning which will equip the West Africans on a stronger footage in the tertiary educational level. A trial run of Moodle LMs is currently undertaken at PUC. M-learning will be done in two stages with the first one using BYOD concept. The second stage will see PUC establish study centres where the mobile reach is still not very viable due to poor telecommunication signals.","[Ebenezer, Eva Esther Shalin] Pentecost Univ Coll, Fac Business Adm, Dept Commerce, Kaneshie, Accra, Ghana",,,evashaline@gmail.com; kbomane@yahoo.com; cbandoh@hotmail.com; aboagyeampah@yahoo.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,6,17,"INFORMATION ENGINEERING RESEARCH INST, USA",NEWARK,"100 CONTINENTAL DR, NEWARK, DE 19713 USA",,,978-1-61275-049-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,3.0,7,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BGC88,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322346200001,0

However, agglomeration effects dissipated over the study period. While we do not identify the microfoundations of these patterns, the decline in the influence of agglomeration coincides with the dramatic expansion of secondary mortgage markets and development of information technology, both of which should have reduced regional disparities in access to credit.

The research illustrated some difficulties faced by the country and make suggestions to overcome it. The construction of the environmental legal framework began in the early 1960s and resulted in a very complex system, as a consequence of policies adopted by the country. Nowadays Brazilian environmental policies are developed in democratic and participative way, although with elevated degree of bureaucracy and lack of integration among the several governmental agencies, which makes the approval of environmental certifications demand several years for new port projects or improvements, which delays the economic development of the country. Efforts have been made to simplify the licensing process. As result of this research two flowchart for environmental licenses of ports installation are shown: The first shows the process until 2009 and the second shows the process nowadays. This become an important issue due the fact that inland navigation is one of the less pollutant modes of transportation, and although, the process of environmental certification was simplified, if compare with 2009, it is still complex and time-consuming, delaying the development of the infrastructure.

In the project scheduling, the two-criteria time-cost minimization problem, solved by fuzzy linear programming, is a basis of the program system created here, as well as a technique for deriving a time-periodical production schedule for a group of products in a group of workplaces having limited capacity, performing cost optimization by lot size alteration.

The Linder hypothesis postulates that countries with similar level of income will trade more than countries with dissimilar level of income. On the contrary, the supply side Heckscher-Ohlin hypothesis implies that countries with dissimilar level of income will trade more than countries with similar level of income. The Linder hypothesis is associated with high level of the intra-industry trade (similarity of demands) and the Heckscher-Ohlin theory with high level of the inter-industry trade (different factor endowments). The subject of this paper is an empirical investigation of the Linder hypothesis with using the gravity model of international trade in manufactured goods in the case of the Czech economy with other EU member countries. Motivations for this research are two-fold. First, new information is provided on verification of the Linder hypothesis of international trade in manufactured goods between the Czech Republic and other EU member countries.

In the mandate of the Government from 2008 by 2011 the ministry in charge of the issue was the Ministry of Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship. The government that was formed in December 2011 founded a new ministry -the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Crafts. Ministry of Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship implemented measures to encourage entrepreneurship through annual Operational plans, and the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Crafts through annual programs named Entrepreneurial impulse. The method in the paper is the method of analysis of paid support from the state level by county, as well as analysis of paid support of active businesses in every county. Normally the prevailing opinion is that, when it comes to incentives from the state level, eastern Croatia and Osijek-BaranjaCounty isdeprived. The analysis showed that was not the case with the implementation of measures to encourage entrepreneurship from the state level. Osijek-Baranja County is in the fourth place by the amount of paid support, and third by value of land that was owned by the Croatian Government, and which government has donated to local governments-cities and municipalities for the development of enterprise zones. This indicates that the Osijek-Baranja County as well as cities and municipalities on its territory were active in the implementation of measures to encourage entrepreneurship from the state level, and certainly in these processes played an important role supporting institutions for the development of entrepreneurship in the Osijek-Baranja County business centers and incubators, and the Regional Development Agency of Slavonia and Baranja. The aim of this paper is to present the implementation of measures to encourage entrepreneurship from the state level in the Osijek-Baranja County since 2008 by 2012 year, and show that Slavonia in these processes has not nipped. The reason for this is the allocation of state aid in a transparent manner and with clear criteria that are applied consistently, and proactive regional and local governments.","[Kraljic, Tihana; Saracevic, Nerma] Univ JJ Strossmayer, Doctoral Program Entrepreneurship & Innovativenes, Osijek, Croatia; [Bekic, Ivana] VERN Univ Appl Sci, Salzburg, Austria",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Kraljic, T (通讯作者)，Univ JJ Strossmayer, Doctoral Program Entrepreneurship & Innovativenes, Osijek, Croatia.",tihana.kraljic@kc.t-com.hr; ivana.bekic@gmail.com; nermasa@bih.net.ba,"KRALJIĆ, TIHANA/D-5549-2019",,,,,,0,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,101.0,108,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400011,0

The player who submits the last bid wins the right to buy the auctioned item at the current purchase price, which is normally substantially lower than the value of the item. While most of the existing studies examine the data on the international server Swoopo.com, we present a unique dataset retrieved from the Czech auction site Bonus.cz. In the paper, we introduce econometric models that explain the total number of bids and seller's revenue using data from the period between July 2009 and April 2010 where the basic properties of the auctions correspond to the stylized facts found in the US data. We compare the results with predictions of the model of pay-to-bid auctions introduced by [3].

Relocation of human resources regulates both a size and structure of population, supports regional labour markets, the demand for goods stimulation, etc. The objective of this paper is to discuss the impact of metropolitan areas on domestic migration flows concentrating on southern area of Poland. The empirical study covers subregions and counties and refers to the period of 2008-2010 corresponding to global financial and economic crisis. Ratio analysis as well as taxonomical analysis was applied in the research. Research results show that southern Polish subregions demonstrate low intensity of intraregional population movements while interregional flows are quite significant, in particular within the territory of southern Poland. The majority of migration flows occur in relation to the city of Wroclaw and the city of Cracow, due to their metropolitan capacity. Their scope is extensive and reaches not only the neighbouring areas, but also the remaining territory of Poland (excluding north and north-west areas).","[Pietrzak, Michal Bernard; Siekaniec, Marcin] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Wilk, Justyna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Comp Sci, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Pietrzak, MB (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Gagarina 11, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",Michal.Pietrzak@umk.pl; Justyna.Wilk@ue.wroc.pl; siekany@gmail.com,"Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014","Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478",,,,,20,21,21,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-52-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,124.0,132,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367243900015,0

The obtained results are applied to situations where some elements of the fuzzy preference matrix are missing. We propose a new method for completing fuzzy matrix with missing elements called the extension of the fuzzy preference matrix.

Then, by using an expansive industry-level data set and two functional forms, we show clear evidence of long run complementarily in all the analyzed industries, and with respect to the different types of capital that we consider (buildings and machinery). We identify the industries with the greatest degree of dependence between energy and capital. These are therefore, the industries in which a policy of increasing energy prices via taxes to reduce energy consumption may have a serious effect, reducing their investment levels.

Due to the numerous layers of history, this area indeed possesses such potentials. The core of the work is Osijek's history in the context of the Austro-Hungarian history, so that the historical context, in which Osijek became a macro-regional centre of the Slavonia region with its current potentials, can be understood in a better manner. These potentials put Osijek not only on the national, but also on the regional tourist map level, so it is crucial to understand how they occurred. Bearing in mind also the potentials of its corresponding county as a whole, the work assumes the presentation of the history of the area as a micro-region. This analysis, due to the limitations of the proposed work, does not strive to present minor aspects of its history, but it is rather presented in an understandable and meaningful manner of the historical circumstances in which the most relevant historical facilities in the Osijek region, were erected, namely castles, churches and a plethora of monuments. As each of the aspects is considered individually, none of these facilities were popular enough to attract larger numbers of people (receptive tourism) so far, but perceived as a whole, Osijek and its surrounding area do possess substantial contents to become a well-known and elaborate tourist destination. Therefore, it is rather substantial to conduct a historical analysis of the region which can enable a better understanding of the development of the spaces in the 18th and the 19th centuries. Furthermore, the once geographically united space can thus be merged and united in culture and history using the means of tourism. The work consists of two main chapters: the history of Osijek as a city, and the history of its surrounding and corresponding geo-political area. It is written in the manner that chronologically follows the development of Osijek and its area, so that the origins of the current state could be understood in an easier fashion.

Methods: From June 2011 to June 2012, 150 cases with hypertension were studied in the Hospital of Yulin Normal University, and they were randomly divided into the nursing group (75 cases) and the control group (75 cases). In the control group, the conventional nursing method was used, and the community nursing intervention was additionally applied to the nursing group based on the conventional nursing. Then, the clinical efficacy, blood pressure control and life quality of the hypertension patients in the two groups were compared. Results: After the community nursing intervention on the patients with hypertension, the summary data and statistics analysis showed that the hypertension control rate of the patients in the control group was significantly lower than that of the nursing group; the health education success rate of the patients in the control group was significantly lower than that of the nursing group, and the comparison between the nursing group and the control group was of significant differences. Conclusion: It is necessary for the nursing personnel to increase their own quality, and help related departments improve the special community nursing intervention institutions and the legal system. The community nursing intervention method is helpful for reducing the blood pressure of the patients with hypertension and improving the self-management ability and life quality of the patients, so it owns a good prospect and is highly feasible. Thus, community nursing intervention is worth popularizing widely.","[Zhu, Yu] Hosp Yulin Normal Univ, Yulin 537000, Guangxi, Peoples R China",Yulin Normal University,,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,18.0,,,,,,634.0,638,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BA4DZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335479600132,0

It investigates two dimensions of the sub-national systems. First, it studies the influence of democracy on economic performance, providing evidence of a non-linear relationship between democracy and economic growth. Regions with high levels of democracy, as well as strong autocracies, perform better than hybrid regimes. Second, this article considers the influence of the size of the bureaucracy on economic outcomes and confirms the grabbing hand view on bureaucracy rather than the Weberian idea. Increasing the size of the bureaucracy is associated with a decline in economic performance. In addition, this article analyzes the potential interaction between these two characteristics of sub-national politics as factors of economic growth, but does not establish any robust results.","Frankfurt Sch Finance & Managements, Frankfurt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Libman, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Managements, Frankfurt, Germany.",alibman@yandex.ru,,"Libman, Alexander/0000-0001-8504-3007",,,,,95,20,24,0,27,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Yet, this debate conspicuously overlooks the variable record of the arbitrary disruption of Eurasian energy transit. This article addresses these oversights by explicating pipeline politics as an international credible commitment problem. It focuses specifically on the different incentives among producer, consumer and transit states and on how insights into the economic and institutional dimensions of bargaining shape the value, risks and capacity of the parties to forge and uphold pipeline agreements. Accordingly, arbitrary disruption is more likely under conditions in which the primary stakeholders are not preoccupied by recouping returns on investment and face incentives to gamble on new terms, as well as operate within opaque national regulatory settings. Credible commitments to uphold cross-border transit arrangements are more likely when the opposite conditions obtain. These claims are probed in comparative cases of arbitrary interruption of Soviet legacy pipelines and curious non-events in Eurasian oil and gas transit.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, CISTP, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Stulberg, AN (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, CISTP, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",,,,,,,,72,17,17,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

However, real estate markets have recorded values that are significantly different from zero in both directions. Possible explanations might suggest non-rational behaviour by inexperienced market players or unusual features of the underlying asset market. We find that institutional characteristics in the underlying market lead to market inefficiencies and, hence, to the creation of a rational trading window with upper and lower bounds within which transactions do not offer arbitrage opportunities. Given the existence of this rational trading window, we also argue that the observed spreads can substantially be explained by trading imbalances due to the limited liquidity of a newly formed market and/or to the effect of market sentiment, complementing explanations based on the lag between underlying market returns and index returns.","[Marcato, Gianluca; Baum, Andrew] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Sch Real Estate & Planning, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England; [Lizieri, Colin] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Ogden, Paul] InProp Capital LLP, London EC2M 1RX, England",University of Reading; University of Cambridge,"Marcato, G (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Sch Real Estate & Planning, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England.",cml49@cam.ac.uk; g.marcato@reading.ac.uk; paul.ogden@inpropcapital.com; a.e.baum@reading.ac.uk,,"Marcato, Gianluca/0000-0002-6266-4676; Lizieri, Colin/0000-0002-7111-8052",,,,,36,9,9,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The Celtic Tiger economy was showing signs of ageing notably with inflation eroding competitiveness and with it Irelands attractiveness as a destination for FDI but there was little sense of the bubble economy that would fundamentally alter Irish economic fortunes over the following decade. The succeeding property-driven economy did sustain high growth for another half decade or so, if not at the spectacular rates of the preceding half decade. But it also sowed the seeds for the financial and economic crisis that has so rocked the economy over the last three years. This paper sets the scene for the papers in the symposium with a review of the property boom, bubble and eventual bust. It also reviews the prospects for crisis resolution and export-driven recovery.","Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"McHale, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.",,,"McHale, John/0000-0001-9132-1528",,,,,7,3,4,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2012,35.0,10,,,SI,,1220.0,1238,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01480.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,021MY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309890100002,0

For this purpose, we utilise the error-correction methodology in the Greek gasoline market. The sample consists of monthly data covering the period of January 1988 to June 2006. We also try to analyse by using impulse response functions the effect of competition on the dynamic adjustment of gasoline price to which has been paid scant attention in the past. The results favour the common perception that retail gasoline prices respond asymmetrically to cost increases and decreases both in the long and the short-run. At the wholesale segment, there is a symmetric response of the spot prices of gasoline towards the adjustment to the short-run responses of the exchange rate. Lastly, after the deregulation, wholesale prices of gasoline tend to gradually restore equilibrium triggered by a price shock compared to the regulated period.","[Polemis, Michael L.] Hellen Competit Commiss, Athens 15232, Greece; [Polemis, Michael L.] Univ Piraeus, Athens 15232, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Polemis, M (通讯作者)，Hellen Competit Commiss, 60 Papanikoli St, Athens 15232, Greece.",mpolemis@epant.gr,"Polemis, Michael/AAM-7918-2021","POLEMIS, MICHAEL/0000-0003-2223-0547",,,,,31,26,27,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In some of these contracts the public sector introduces economic incentives to the private operator to foster the accomplishment of social goals. One of the incentives that have been introduced in some PPP contracts is related to safety in such a way that the better the safety outcome the greater will be the economic reward to the contractor. The aim of this paper is at identify whether the incentives to improve road safety in highway PPPs are ultimately effective in improving safety ratios. To this end Poisson and negative binomial regression models have been applied using information from highway sections in Spain. The findings indicate that even though road safety is highly influenced by variables that are not much controllable by the contractor such as the Average Annual Daily Traffic and the percentage of heavy vehicles, the implementation of safety incentives in PPPs has a positive influence in the reduction of fatalities, injuries and accidents.

This paper argues that donors may exercise selectivity over the aid modality. Specifically, multilateral donors will cede more recipient control over aid by granting more budget support to those recipients with better expenditure systems and spending preferences (towards the poor) aligned with the donor. We test this for European Commission and World Bank budget support over 1997-2009 and find some support. Both donors have given budget support to almost half of the countries they give aid, and it is usually a significant share of their aid. The principal determinants of receiving budget support are having a poverty reduction strategy in place, which can be considered a good indicator of aligned preferences, and indicators of government efficiency. These variables did not, however, influence the amount of budget support given. Multilateral donors have been more likely to give budget support to countries with aligned spending preferences and better quality systems, even if they have not reallocated the total aid envelope in that way.","[Clist, Paul] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Isopi, Alessia] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Clist, Paul] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of Nottingham; University of Manchester; University of East Anglia,"Morrissey, O (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",paul.clist@uea.ac.uk; alessia.isopi@manchester.ac.uk; oliver.morrissey@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Clist, Paul/0000-0001-9338-9446",ESRC [ES/I021353/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I021353/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,31,32,38,2,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

However, disagreement about the appropriate relationship between these notions remains, so that compromises between principles may generate more agreement. Truncated utilitarianism is a prominent candidate. It demands maximising total wealth subject to a floor level of individual wealth for all people. Based on some well-known distributive notions, we developed a questionnaire setting and confronted student respondents with corresponding allocation problems, where an exogenously given poverty line served as a floor. However, support for allocations resulting from this specific interpretation of truncated utilitarianism remained rather low. This is surprising because the respective solution was close to an equal split of resources, and aspects of efficiency and responsibility were explicitly introduced to promote more general acceptance. We argue that people may either wish to see higher floor levels or are more inequality averse than probably expected. Moreover, high support for an unconditional consideration of the poverty line can be witnessed, even though aspects of responsibility, but not efficiency arguments, display an influence. In general, attitudes with respect to the equality-efficiency trade-off are found to remain heterogeneous, although different equality concerns are prominent. Furthermore, trade-offs are moderated by the responsibility principle.","Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Law & Econ, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Schwettmann, L (通讯作者)，Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Law & Econ, Univ Ring 3, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",Lars.Schwettmann@wiwi.uni-halle.de,,"Schwettmann, Lars/0000-0003-0935-6989",,,,,44,11,12,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2012,73.0,3,,,,,357.0,380,,10.1007/s11238-011-9289-9,0.0,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,985OL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307276100002,0

Existing location of activity centres, especially home and work, strongly influences the short-term individual-level decisions such as mode of transportation, and long-term household-level decisions such as change in job and residential location. Conditions in the built space market also affect households' and firms' location and relocation decisions, and hence influence the general travel patterns in an urban area. In this context, this paper addresses a very important, but at the same time, not very widely investigated dimension that plays a key role in the evolution of built space and population distribution: Market. A disequilibrium based microsimulation modelling framework is developed for the built space markets. This framework is then used to operationalize the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area's owner-occupied housing market within Integrated Land Use Transportation and Environment (ILUTE) modelling system. Simulation results captured heterogeneity in the transaction prices, due to type of dwellings and different market conditions, in a very disaggregate fashion. The proposed methodology is validated by running the simulation from 1986 to 2006 and comparing the results with the historic data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study provides empirical evidence that sellers using limited service brokers experience a trade-off between a higher selling price and longer marketing spans with accompanying lower probabilities of finding a buyer during a given marketing period.","[Zumpano, Leonard V.] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Goodwin, Kimberly R.] Univ So Mississippi, Dept Finance Real Estate & Legal Studies, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Johnson, Ken H.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Miami, FL 33199 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Southern Mississippi; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Zumpano, LV (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, POB 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",kimberly.goodwin@usm.edu; lzumpano@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,26,6,6,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This research contributes to the existing regional employment portfolio literature by using more disaggregated data at both the county and the commuting zone levels. Commuting zones in particular represent a broader spectrum of labor market agglomerations across both rural and urban areas to provide the most stringent and revealing tests of the interrelationship between local employment portfolios and the choice to pursue entrepreneurship. The authors find a U-shaped risk/return trade-off using employment variance and growth, consistent with the literature. They test their hypothesis with a model of regional entrepreneurship, incorporating the employment portfolio variables. This is the first known study to explore the hypothesized relationship between wage and salary employment portfolios and entrepreneurship, effectively synthesizing two previously disparate literatures.","[Low, Sarah A.] ERS, USDA, Farm & Rural Business Branch, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Weiler, Stephan] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Colorado State University,"Low, SA (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, Farm & Rural Business Branch, 1400 Independence Ave SW,MS-1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",slow@ers.usda.gov,"Low, Sarah A./AAO-4257-2021","Low, Sarah A./0000-0003-0089-9688",,,,,60,23,30,0,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Thus the role price plays is complex, and a particularly challenging aspect of this complexity is that its effect is not unambiguous, thereby negating the idea that the demand for tourism products and tourist activities can always be regarded as demand for ordinary goods. This article identifies and explains, as a novelty for the tourism industry, price sensitivities to tourism activities individual by individual. The operative formalization uses a mixed logit model to estimate the individual sensitivities to price, and then a regression analysis is applied to detect their determinants. The empirical application finds that motivations, influenced by age, and length of stay with a non-linear effect, are explanatory factors of tourists' price sensitivity to activities.","[Masiero, Lorenzo] Univ Lugano, Inst Econ Res IRE, Fac Econ, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Nicolau, Juan L.] Univ Alicante, Dept Financial Econ Accounting & Mkt, Fac Econ, Alicante, Spain",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Universitat d'Alacant,"Masiero, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lugano, Inst Econ Res IRE, Fac Econ, Via Maderno 24,CP 4367, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland.",lorenzo.masiero@usi.ch; jl.nicolau@ua.es,"Nicolau, Juan Luis/AAZ-6589-2021; Nicolau, Juan Luis/I-4982-2016; Masiero, Lorenzo/O-8734-2014","Nicolau, Juan Luis/0000-0003-0048-2823; Masiero, Lorenzo/0000-0002-6933-1700",,,,,39,29,34,3,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In-depth open interviews with top-level personnel were combined with a before after time-series analysis of key market data in order to identify any early effects of EgyptAir's strategic changes on important international markets for inbound and outbound tourism. The study's major finding is that EgyptAir has taken some significant steps to target higher-yielding tourist passengers travelling from Egypt to Europe, Asia and North America and vice versa by fortifying its position at Cairo, improving its overall service offering and joining the world's largest strategic airline alliance (Star Alliance). Some early gains have been noted in these markets for EgyptAir, while at the same time an avoidance strategy has been noted in relation to lower-yield package holidaymakers who, despite forming a growing share of total demand, are already served by a highly competitive mix of foreign charter and scheduled airlines. Tourist numbers were found to increase after the strategic changes at EgyptAir. This increase was either facilitated directly by EgyptAir or indirectly as other carriers took advantage of the additional opportunities to serve markets that were dominated or neglected by EgyptAir prior to its air policy induced change of strategic direction. The general push towards liberalization in the wider Middle East region also partly led to these strategic changes.","[O'Connell, John F.] Cranfield Univ, Dept Air Transport, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Warnock-Smith, David] Queensgate, Div Transport & Logist & Tourism, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England",Cranfield University,"O'Connell, JF (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Dept Air Transport, Bldg 115, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",frankie.oconnell@cranfield.ac.uk,"Warnock-Smith, David/AAO-1324-2021","Warnock-Smith, David/0000-0002-1887-3278",,,,,24,4,4,0,20,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

I present new data from the Midwest at the start of the twentieth century showing that the emerging public schools were helping farmers successfully adapt to a variety of agricultural innovations. I use a unique dataset of farmers containing detailed geographical information to estimate both the private returns to schooling and human capital spillovers across neighboring farms. The results indicate that public schools contributed substantially to agricultural productivity at the turn of the century and that a large portion of this contribution came through human capital spillovers. These findings offer new insights into why the Midwest was a leader in the expansion of secondary education. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis recognizes that, in the air transportation system where economies of density is an inherent characteristic, capacity change would trigger a complicated set of adjustment of and interplay among passenger demand, air fare, flight frequency, aircraft size, and flight delays, leading to an equilibrium shift. An analytical model that incorporates these elements is developed. The results from comparative static analysis show that capacity constraint suppresses demand, reduces flight frequency, and increases passenger generalized cost. Our numerical analysis further reveals that, by switching to larger aircraft size, airlines manage to offset part of the delay effect on unit operating cost, and charge passengers lower fare. With higher capacity, airlines tend to raise both fare and frequency while decreasing aircraft size. More demand emerges in the market, with reduced generalized cost for each traveler. The marginal benefit brought by capacity expansion diminishes as the capacity-demand imbalance becomes less severe. Existing passengers in the market receive most of the benefit, followed by airlines. The welfare gains from induced demand are much smaller. The equilibrium approach yields more plausible investment benefit estimates than does the conventional method. In particular, when forecasting future demand the equilibrium approach is capable of preventing the occurrence of excessive high delays. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Graduation from IBRD is not an automatic consequence of reaching a particular income level, but rather is supposed to be based on a determination of whether the country has reached a level of institutional development and capital-market access that enables it to sustain its own development process without recourse to Bank funding. This paper takes a positive approach to IBRD graduation policy, investigating what income and non-income factors appear to have influenced graduation status in recent decades, based on panel data for 1982 through 2009. Explanatory variables include the per-capita income of the country, as well as measures of institutional development and market access that are cited as criteria by the graduation policy, and other plausible explanatory variables that capture the levels of economic development and vulnerability of the country. We find that the observed correlates of Bank graduation status are generally consistent with the stated policy. Countries that are wealthier, more creditworthy, more institutionally developed, and are less vulnerable to trade, financial, and other shocks are more likely to be graduates. Predicted probabilities generated by the model conform closely to the actual graduation and de-graduation experiences of Trinidad and Tobago and Korea, among other countries, and suggest that Hungary and Latvia may have graduated prematurely-a prediction subsequently borne out by the large loans that they later received from the IBRD in the wake of the global financial crisis.","[Knack, Stephen] World Bank, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Rogers, F.

Since urban cities perform a multitude of functions, the space requirements of tourists can, at times, interfere with those of local users. This paper addresses the issue of disutilities of space congestion through a dichotomous choice experiment model in order to offer a monetary valuation of tourist crowding in urban public space. A resident survey was carried out in the city of Amsterdam in order to estimate a random parameter logit model through which the residents' willingness to pay to avoid unfavourable crowding situations could be assessed. Their willingness to pay in order to increase the use levels by visitors in the Dam area from 'not at all crowded' or 'not crowded' to 'crowded' was, respectively, (sic)1.36 and (sic)0.83 annually, while the mean willingness to pay for a decline in the use level from 'very crowded' to 'crowded' was estimated to be (sic)11.06 a year. While tourism is only partly responsible for these crowding levels, the results demonstrate that the social effects of tourist consumption can be positive as well as negative, depending on the existing use level and attitudinal perceptions of residents.","[Nijkamp, Peter; Van Leeuwen, Eveline] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Neuts, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Geog, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; KU Leuven,"Nijkamp, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",bart.neuts@ees.kuleuven.be; p.nijkamp@vu.nl; e.s.van.leeuwen@vu.nl,"; Neuts, Bart/E-4668-2017","Van Leeuwen, Eveline/0000-0002-3262-7030; Neuts, Bart/0000-0002-6518-650X",,,,,86,29,29,1,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Bank lines of credit or loan commitments, which are legally binding contracts arranged to provide debt at the call of the borrowers under prespecified terms, have been theorized to provide insurance protection against a credit crisis. This article examines whether bank lines of credit can indeed provide some insurance for REITs and allow them to access credit during bad times. Covering three credit crunch events, both the origination and utilization patterns of commitment loans by 275 REITs publicly traded between 1992 and 2007 are analyzed. We find that bank lines of credit insulated REITs from credit rationing at both the broad market level as well as at the firm level. However, the insurance value is qualified in the case of smaller and risky firms which may not get to extend their credit limit or draw down on their existing credit lines in a credit crisis.","[Ooi, Joseph T.

There is a debate about (i) the level of the tax levied on casinos and (ii) how the tax receipts should be used, as tourists rarely visit casinos. The paper contributes to this debate. The authors develop a dynamic general equilibrium model of a small open economy, comprising an industrial sector producing an internationally traded good, a tourism sector producing tourism services offered to both foreign tourists and residents and a casino sector supplying gambling services. Domestic residents derive utility from consuming the traded good, tourism services and gambling. The model is calibrated to the Portuguese economy. Using numerical simulations, the authors discuss the welfare effects of abandoning the taxation of casinos, as well as of different uses of casino tax receipts.","[Schubert, Stefan F.] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Sch Econ & Management, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Matias, Alvaro] Univ Lusiada Lisboa, Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Costa, Carlos M.

Furthermore, it tests for self-selection of more productive firms into exporting beyond the Euro-zone. The main contribution of the paper is to correct a serious flaw in hitherto published studies that ignore the potentially disastrous consequences of extreme observations, or outliers. The paper shows that estimates of the exporter productivity premium by destination are driven by a small share of outliers that comprises some five per cent of all firms. These outliers are identified by a recently developed highly robust estimator for models with fixed effects. Using a clean sample without these outliers, the estimated productivity premium of firms that export to the Euro-zone only is no longer statistically different from zero at a conventional error level, and the estimated premium of firms exporting beyond the Euro-zone, too, over firms that serve the German market only is tiny. Furthermore, an ex-ante differential that is statistically significant and large only shows up for enterprises that exported to the Euro-zone already and start to export to countries outside the Euro-zone. These conclusions differ considerably from those based on non-robust standard regression analyses.","[Verardi, Vincenzo] Univ Namur, CRED, Namur, Belgium; [Verardi, Vincenzo] Univ Libre Brussels, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Verardi, Vincenzo] Univ Libre Brussels, CKE, Brussels, Belgium; [Wagner, Joachim] Univ Luneburg, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",University of Namur; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Leuphana University Luneburg,"Verardi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, CRED, Namur, Belgium.",,"Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012; Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536;",,,,,26,19,19,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2012,35.0,6,,,,,694.0,712,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01414.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,944IB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304191600002,0

The view is that supply constraints have led to serious shortages in certain submarkets, and that these shortages have led to a rapid rise in house prices and to panic buying or inflation-induced investing and to further price increases. The estimation period of the test is November 1988-February 2007. The results suggest that house prices in Seoul are highly persistent because of these supply constraints. Additionally, we do what we can with the available data to determine if house price increases serve to increase demand further, and if rent-price ratios and nominal interest rates are a good predictor of how housing prices in Seoul will evolve over time.","[Shilling, James D.] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Kim, Kyung-Hwan] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Hoon] KAIST Grad Sch Finance, Seoul 130722, South Korea",DePaul University; Sogang University,"Shilling, JD (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, 1 E Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",hooncho@kaist.ac.kr; stamitzkim@yahoo.co.kr; shilling@depaul.edu,,"Cho, Hoon/0000-0003-2322-320X",,,,,13,4,4,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

J,"Grahn-Voorneveld, S",,,,"Grahn-Voorneveld, Sofia",,,Sharing costs in Swedish road ownership associations,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Road ownership associations; Game theory; Cooperative game theory,ALLOCATION; GAME,"Usually transport systems, and roads in particular, are viewed as public goods. However, this is not always the case. In Sweden a large part of the road system is privately owned. Most of these privately owned roads are rural roads used by farmers and summer cottage owners, or used for forest transport. These roads are mainly provided by ownership associations. An important difference between public roads and these privately owned roads is that all investments- and maintenance decisions are made by the users themselves, who also have to pay the costs, whereas the usual case is that the owners/providers of a road-system are different agents than the users. Here the question is not how to charge the roads but how to split the costs of the roads among the users in an efficient and fair way. The motivation of this paper is the practical problem of how such an ownership association can divide the costs for the road network among the members in an efficient and fair way. The problem is treated from a game theoretical point of view, making use of the Shapley value. This means that the problem is associated with a game - a mathematical representation of the conflict situation. The Shapley value is a very important solution concept for cooperative games, like the game in this case. For games corresponding to this specific type of problems, it is shown that the Shapley value has excellent properties, such as beeing an element of the core, and beeing very easy to compute.

In this paper, I argue against this compatibility claim. I show that LP violates core liberal principles, first because it limits freedom, and secondly because it fails to justify these limitations in ways acceptable to liberal positions. In particular, Libertarian Paternalists argue that sometimes it is legitimate to limit people's liberties if it improves their welfare. A closer look at the welfare notions used, however, reveals that they respect neither the subjectivity nor the plurality of people's values. Thus its justification of the liberty-welfare trade-off is not compatible with liberal principles. I conclude that to justify LP policies, one must appeal to traditional paternalistic principles-and thus, there is no categorical difference between libertarian and other forms of paternalism.","Royal Inst Technol KTH, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Grüne-Yanoff, T (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol KTH, Stockholm, Sweden.",gryue@kth.se,,,,,,,15,119,135,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2012,38.0,4,,,,,635.0,645,,10.1007/s00355-011-0636-0,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,918PI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302262200006,0

The main objective is to determine the effects of socio-economic, demographic and geographic factors on long distance travel. The estimated models express the distance travelled for long distance journeys as a function of income, gender, age, employment status, household characteristics, area of residence, size of municipality, type of residence and length of time living in the area. A time trend is also included to capture common changes in long distance travel over time not included in the explanatory variables. Separate models are estimated for total travel, travel by each of four modes (car, rail, coach and air), travel by five purposes (business, commuting, leisure, holiday and visiting friends and relatives (VFRs)) and two journey lengths (<150 miles and 150+ miles one way), as well as the 35 mode-purpose-distance combinations. The results show that long distance travel is strongly related to income: air is most income-elastic, followed by rail, car and finally coach. This is the case for most journey purposes and distance bands. Notable is the substantial difference in income elasticities for rail for business/commuting as opposed to holiday/leisure/VFR. In addition, the income elasticity for coach travel is very low, and zero for the majority of purpose-distance bands, suggesting coach travel to be an inferior mode in comparison to car, rail and air. Regarding journey distance, we find that longer distance journeys are more income elastic than shorter journeys. For total long distance travel, the study indicates that women travel less than men, the elderly less than younger people, the employed and students more than others, those in one adult households more than those in larger households and those in households with children less than those without. Long distance travel is also lowest for individuals living in London and greatest for those in the South West, and increases as the size of the municipality declines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that the minimal transfer rule is the only rule satisfying efficiency and Pareto indifference together with either one of our two main axioms, balanced consistency and balanced cost reduction.","[van den Brink, Rene] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van den Brink, Rene] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Chun, Youngsub] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151746, South Korea",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Seoul National University (SNU),"van den Brink, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jrbrink@feweb.vu.nl; ychun@snu.ac.kr,,"van den Brink, Rene/0000-0001-8570-3706",,,,,24,8,8,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2012,38.0,3,,,,,519.0,529,,10.1007/s00355-011-0533-6,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,902NG,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301044600008,0

We estimate a three-stage schooling decision model, focusing on the effect of expected earnings on major choice. We control for dynamic selection through the use of mixture distributions. Exploiting variations across the French business cycle in the relative returns to the majors, our results yield a very low, though significant, elasticity of major choice to expected earnings. This suggests that at least for the French university context, nonpecuniary factors are a key determinant of schooling choices.","[Beffy, Magali; Fougere, Denis] CREST INSEE, CNRS, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Beffy, M (通讯作者)，CREST INSEE, CNRS, Paris, France.",,"maurel, arnaud/K-9475-2019",,,,,,29,112,165,1,36,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

One main problem for the regulator in assigning the relative efficiency scores is unobserved firm-specific factors such as network and technological differences. Comparing the efficiency of different firms usually assumes that they operate under the same production technology, thus unobserved factors might be inappropriately understood as inefficiency. To avoid this type of misspecification in regulatory practice, estimation is carried out in two stages: in the first stage observations are classified into two categories according to the size of the network operators. Then separate analyses are conducted for each subgroup. This article shows how to disentangle the heterogeneity from inefficiency in one step, using a latent class model for stochastic frontiers. As the classification is not based on a priori sample separation criteria it delivers more robust, statistically significant, and testable results. Against this background, we analyze the level of technical efficiency of different subgroups from a sample of 200 regional and local German electricity distribution companies for a balanced panel data set (2001-2005). Testing the hypothesis if larger distributors operate under a different technology than smaller ones, we assess if a single step latent class model provides new insights to the use of benchmarking approaches within the incentive regulation schemes.","DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Cullmann, A (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",acullmann@diw.de,,,,,,,40,19,20,1,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

For the first part, I propose a non-linear learning algorithm that takes into account both proximity of opinions and network effects. Agents reach consensus of a final opinion that can be estimated given initial conditions under star and small-world networks. However, when the network structure is scale-free, simulation results show rather chaotic patterns. In the second half of this paper, a two-stage endogenous network formation mechanism is introduced. Opinion closeness is critical in establishing links. Existing neighbors also play an important role in connecting to new neighbors, which, combined with a growing population, contributes to a power-law degree distribution with coefficients that fit empirical findings extremely well. The correlation between opinion and degree is illustrated and formalized as well.","Virginia Tech, Virginia Bioinformat Inst, Network Dynam & Simulat Sci Lab, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Pan, ZZ (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Virginia Bioinformat Inst, Network Dynam & Simulat Sci Lab, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",zzpan@vt.edu,"Pan, Zhengzheng/D-2567-2010",,"NSF [CNS-0626964, OCI-0904844]; NSF HSD [SES-0729441]; NIH MIDAS [2U01GM070694-7]; DTRA [HDTRA1-0901-0017]; DTRA CNIMS [HDTRA1-07-C-0113]; NSF NETS [CNS-0831633]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF HSD; NIH MIDAS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); DTRA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Threat Reduction Agency); DTRA CNIMS; NSF NETS(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"I thank our external collaborators and members of the Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory (NDSSL) for their suggestions and comments.

Malaysia currently has two major retirement programs available that are the pension scheme and the Employee Provident Fund for the civil servants and the private workers respectively. Another retirement program that has a limited coverage is the Army Forces Fund, that is for the armed forces of different rank. The informal sectors; workers outside the formal sector, employed in small often family-based enterprises, owner of own business (self-employed), workers affected by the informalization of labor relations with their employers, self-employed and those engaging in the primary sector (agriculture and fishery) are often not covered by any formal retirement scheme. The aim of the paper is twofold: to evaluate the coverage and benefits of the current retirement program in Malaysia and to investigate the role of the newly introduced private retirement scheme (PRS). The study finds that there Malaysia's retirement program is not a universal coverage, in which the protection does not cover the entire population. The upcoming Private Retirement Scheme is a good opportunity for the informal sector workers to save for their old ages through fully governed-mechanism. Nevertheless, the success of the program to include the informal sector include proper planning in addition to better coverage and thorough understanding of the schemes by the recipients.","[Ameer, Muhammad Waqas; Mohd, Saidatulakmal] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Georgetown, Pulau Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,,"Mohd, Saidatulakmal/J-1535-2014","Mohd, Saidatulakmal/0000-0002-7947-7324",,,,,9,0,0,0,2,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,765.0,770,,,,,,6,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600067,0

Today Osijek is a city with 246 sports clubs, over 5000 active athletes and a vast number of amateur athletes, children and students; therefore we can state that 30 % of the population is engaged in some form of sport. To make those possible necessary premises were created, sports infrastructure was built, co-financing of program content in nine areas regulated by law has been ensured, for which 38.457.200,00 kn (around 5 million euro) or 7.77 % of the total city budget has been provided. Sport funding, regarding to the city budget in the last 19 years, adds up to 7,03 %. Sport in Osijek, as a recognizable brand, does not want to be a burden to the economy, on the contrary, it wants to and it can offer a partnership with a win-win system, for which we have positive examples of company Saponia and VK Iktus (rowing), or company Tito and clubs for so called basic sports: AK Slavonija (athletics), GD Osijek (gymnastics), PK Osijek (swimming). Law regulations present a specific problem of sport financing, which to a large extend discourage investing in sport, as a result of repudiation of tax relieves and small amount of direct state budget for sport. The aim of this paper is to draw attention to the historical role of sport in Osijek and eastern Croatia, analyze the current situation, perceive some of the problems and offer possible solutions.","[Dumancic, Darko] City Osijek, Social Serv Dept, Sport Sub Dept, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Siric, Zeljko] City Osijek, Assoc sports ogranizat, Head secretary, Osijek 31000, Croatia",,"Dumancic, D (通讯作者)，City Osijek, Social Serv Dept, Sport Sub Dept, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",darko.dumancic@osijek.hr; sport.sav.osijek@os.t-com.hr,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,280.0,288,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600031,0

Yet, Russia's behaviour sometimes seems to contradict the declared aim of improving this image. A particularly interesting case is the way the Russian authorities and Gazprom handled the dispute with Ukraine over gas prices in December 2008-January 2009, when the transit of Russian gas to a number of EU member states via Ukraine was seriously affected. This essay argues that in order to understand Russia's position during the crisis, one should take into account the impact of international images on Russian politics, in particular self-images and constructed images that the Russian authorities have been projecting in the West and in Russia itself.","Univ Newcastle Tyne, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Feklyunina, V (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle Tyne, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",valentina.feklyunina@newcastle.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,27,30,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,3,,,SI,,449.0,469,,10.1080/09668136.2012.661923,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,943ZT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304167900004,0

In addition, the donations congregate at some specific numbers, such as 100, 500, 1000, etc. All of these imply significant inequality in donation distributions. From both Zipf plot and Pareto figure, the mixed power law distribution has been clearly showed. The properties commendably correspond with our pervious analysis in Wenchuan earthquake donation.

We evaluate a conditional cash transfer program in rural Malawi which offered financial incentives to men and women to maintain their HIV status for approximately one year. The amounts of the reward ranged from zero to approximately 3-4 months wage. We find no effect of the offered incentives on HIV status or on reported sexual behavior. However, shortly after receiving the reward, men who received the cash transfer were 9 percentage points more likely and women were 6.7 percentage points less likely to engage in risky sex. Our analyses therefore question the unconditional effectiveness of CCT program for HIV prevention: CCT Programs that aim to motivate safe sexual behavior in Africa should take into account that money given in the present may have much stronger effects than rewards offered in the future, and any effect of these programs may be fairly sensitive to the specific design of the program, the local and/or cultural context, and the degree of agency an individual has with respect to sexual behaviors.","[Kohler, Hans-Peter] Univ Penn, Dept Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kohler, Hans-Peter] Univ Penn, Ctr Populat Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Thornton, Rebecca L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kohler, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Sociol, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",hpkohler@pop.upenn.edu; rebeccal@umich.edu,"Thornton, Rebecca/L-3820-2019; Kohler, Hans-Peter/HNP-6421-2023","Kohler, Hans-Peter/0000-0003-0639-4349","NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD044228, R21 HD050653, R01 HD053781] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,59,109,118,3,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

However, unlike in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, where the World Bank proved dominant, the regional environment of pension reform in Sub-Saharan Africa was characterized by a fierce competition between the World Bank and the International Labour Organization (ILO), with each institution promoting different policy preferences. As demonstrated, in Sub-Saharan Africa pension reform, the ILO has proved more influential than the World Bank. Theoretically, the paper stresses the role of transnational actors in the global diffusion of social policy ideas. Recognizing the need to explore the interactions between national and transnational actors, as well as between transnational actors themselves, the analysis explores the dialogical and competitive nature of the global politics of ideas.","[Kpessa, Michael; Beland, Daniel] Univ Saskatchewan Campus, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK 57N 5B8, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Kpessa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan Campus, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Diefenbaker Bldg,101 Diefenbaker Pl, Saskatoon, SK 57N 5B8, Canada.",,"Béland, Daniel/AAD-8642-2021; Kpessa-Whyte, Michael/AAI-1150-2020","Béland, Daniel/0000-0003-2756-5629; kpessa-whyte, michael/0000-0002-5504-3919",,,,,79,9,9,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Time series are often affected by special events such as legislative activities, policy changes, environmental regulations, and similar events, which we shall refer to as intervention events. You can incorporate one or more time series in a model to predict the value of another series, by using a transfer function. Transfer functions can be used both to model and forecast the response series and to analyze the impact of the intervention. The general transfer function model employed by the ARIMA procedure was discussed by Box and Tiao [2]. When an ARIMA model includes other time series as input variables, the model is sometimes referred to as an ARIMAX model. Panlcratz [4] refers to the ARIMAX model as dynamic regression.

The first part is built on the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index published by the World Economic Forum in order to assess the competitiveness of Macedonian tourism sector. The second part of the paper is dedicated to a projection of accommodation capacities, measured by the number of hotel beds and hotel rooms in Macedonia. In that respect, their optimal number is estimated by employing the standard formulas. The results point to a significant over dimensionof current hotel supply in Macedonia: the current number of hotel beds is 1.5-2 times bigger than the projected optimal needs, while the estimations regarding the number of hotel rooms imply an over dimension of 1.5 times.

Using data for four European countries, the results are, first, individual investors adapted to the institutional changes implemented by the STD before it became effective in 2005; second, the strategy of reallocating assets from debt to equity products in the same country is more important than shifting portfolio capital out of co-operating countries into third countries; third, countries opting for a retention tax did not experience an outflow of portfolio capital, whereas countries engaged in information exchange lost capital relative to third countries outside the scope of the STD; and finally, there is considerable heterogeneity across countries. While there are strong behavioural responses by French investors, no evidence was found of cross-border tax evasion by Italian investors, which may be explained by the absence of a national automatic reporting system on capital income in Italy. Overall, the findings show that the STD does not effectively prevent tax evasion and thus lend support to calls for tightening the directive.","[Rixen, Thomas] Social Sci Res Ctr Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Schwarz, Peter] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany",Jacobs University,"Rixen, T (通讯作者)，Social Sci Res Ctr Berlin WZB, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10758 Berlin, Germany.",rixen@wzb.eu,"Rixen, Thomas/I-6074-2016; Rixen, Thomas/AAZ-4571-2020","Rixen, Thomas/0000-0001-8777-5949; Rixen, Thomas/0000-0001-8777-5949",,,,,35,17,17,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

There is used the linear programming model to determine the optimal production structure. The built model is ecologic-economical it involves indicators which have the impact on the environment, precisely the gas wastes. This is the reason why the model is constructed for the companies which have the business based on the heavy industry. Only such firms have to involve the ecological costs in their calculations. The first part optimizes only the company profit from the sales which are put into the objective function. The ecological aspect of this part is given only by model constraints and the only source of the profit is the sold company products. The second section of the article extends the model by the second objective function. It supposes that the industrial company profit does not consist only of the product sales, but it involves the profit generated by the sales of the emission permits too. The model is tested on the historical but real data of one industrial company. Conclusions of the paper demonstrate the applicability of the model and possibilities of its extensions.","[Zapletal, Frantisek; Nemec, Radek] Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Syst Engn & Informat, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,Frantisek.zapletal.st@vsb.cz; radek.nemec@vsb.cz,"Zapletal, Frantisek/C-6677-2018; Zapletal, František/AAL-7815-2020; Němec, Radek/A-9036-2015","Zapletal, Frantisek/0000-0002-3223-3138; Němec, Radek/0000-0002-4613-8641",,,,,9,6,6,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,1010.0,1015,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900173,0

This paper improves on earlier contributions by covering all Italian migration outflows between 1876 and 1915 to the most significant destination countries, taking all countries separately and simultaneously and adopting the most consistent and up-to-date econometric approaches.

The strong and systematic county-level impact is equivalent to 0.35 standard deviations in health.

The estimation results suggest that the slot trades among partner carriers contributed to slightly increased competition measured in terms of the number of competitors per route, whereas the slot trades between rival carriers had a negative effect on the number of competitors at the route level. The results suggest that carriers seem to have used the slots obtained from their rivals not to compete with each other but to strengthen their dominance on their existing routes. This behavior is considered to be derived from the bilateral nature of slot trading, which facilitates mutual forbearance among competitors. To cope with the potential anticompetitive effect of mutual forbearance, it would be worthwhile to explore slot-trading schemes that make it harder for carriers to take advantage of multimarket contact as well as alternative methods of primary slot allocation.

We present a simple model that explains inflation divergence across regions in a monetary union with similar preferences as a consequence of the geographical allocation of producers in the different regions. Our results indicate that spatial allocation together with transport costs are important determinants of regional inflation, while macroeconomic common factors do not play an important role in this process. Existing literature had obtained the opposite result for Europe, and the reasons for this difference warrant further investigation. Moreover, we find that geographical distance seems to be a more appropriate measure of neighbourhood than the adjacency of regions. Our results are robust to different specifications, regression methods and product groupings.","[Marques, Helena] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Pino, Gabriel] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Antofagasta, Chile; [Tena Horrillo, Juan de Dios] Univ Sassari, DiSEA, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Tena Horrillo, Juan de Dios] Univ Sassari, CRENoS, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Tena Horrillo, Juan de Dios] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, Madrid 28903, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universidad Catolica del Norte; University of Sassari; University of Sassari; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Horrillo, JDT (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, DiSEA, Via Torre Tonda 34, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",helena.ferreira-marques@uib.es; gpino02@ucn.cl; jtena@est-econ.uc3m,,"Tena, J.D/0000-0003-3018-2442; Marques, Helena/0000-0002-9257-7848",,,,,33,10,11,0,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

To control for selection bias and unobservables, a data set is constructed such that intersections with cameras are compared to control groups of nearby intersections without cameras, matched on observable characteristics. To capture potential spillover effects of cameras, control groups at various distances from the intersections with cameras are considered. A Poisson panel data model with random coefficients is applied to these data and estimated using Bayesian methods. The program suffered from weaknesses in enforcement. The city's courts did not uphold citations and this dampened the effect cameras had on drivers. These problems are accounted for in modeling. Controlling for these concerns, results indicate that the cameras decreased red light running related collisions, but increased right-angle and injury collisions, as well as collisions overall.

The results showed that the traffic flow operating at LOS E had the highest crash potential, followed by LOS F and D. The traffic flow operating at LOS B and A had the lowest crash potential. For LOS A and B, the vehicle platoon and abrupt change in vehicle speeds were major contributing factors to crash occurrences. For LOS C, crash risks were correlated with lane-change maneuvers, speed variation, and small headways in traffic. For LOS D, crash risks increased with an increase in the temporal change in traffic flow variables and the frequency of lane-change maneuvers. For LOS E, crash risks were mainly affected by high traffic volumes and oscillating traffic conditions. For LOS F, crash risks increased with an increase in the standard deviation of flow rate and the frequency of lane-change maneuvers. The findings suggested that the mechanism of crashes were quite different across various LOS. A Bayesian random-parameters logistic regression model was developed to identify crash-prone traffic conditions for various LOS. The proposed model significantly improved the prediction performance as compared to the conventional logistic regression model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The context is a simple bargaining problem in which two players have to agree a choice from three alternatives. One alternative favours one player and a second favours the other. The third is an apparently reasonable compromise, but is in fact precluded as an agreed choice by the Nash axioms. Experimental results show that agreement on this third alternative occurs rather often. Our subjects' behaviour could be interpreted as the paying of an irrationally high price, according to the Nash axioms, in order to reach a compromise agreement.","[Bone, John; Hey, John D.; Suckling, John] Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Hey, JD (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",jdh1@york.ac.uk,"Suckling, John/ABD-7246-2021","Suckling, John/0000-0002-5098-1527",,,,,10,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2014,77.0,3,,,SI,,359.0,376,,10.1007/s11238-014-9465-9,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AO8VB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341632000007,0

However, empirical evidence suggests that innovative activities are procyclical. Theory proposes that firms shift R&D investments and innovation from recessions to booms to maximize returns by capturing high-demand periods before imitators compete away rents. This paper provides the first empirical test of these predictions. Results indicate that R&D spending is more procyclical in industries with faster obsolescence, where matching invention to demand is more valuable, and innovation is more procyclical in industries with weaker IP protection, where imitation poses a greater threat.","[Fabrizio, Kira R.] Boston Univ, Sch Management, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Tsolmon, Ulya] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Boston University; Duke University,"Fabrizio, KR (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Sch Management, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,,"Tsolmon, Ulya/0000-0002-9825-8231",,,,,32,49,55,4,38,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Researchers have focused mainly on disintermediation and re-intermediation processes fostered by the Web and on their implications for the organization of agencies and sales management. However, the hypothesis that Internet diffusion may have a negative impact on the consistency of the travel agency sector still needs to be proven. Moving on from an analysis of the Italian situation, this study first attempts to reconstruct the ongoing trends at industry level in other European countries. It then explores the relationship between online travel purchases and TAs' total frequency. The evidence gathered shows a significant degree of correlation between the two variables, suggesting that the growth of the online travel market can effectively prove to be a reduction of existing TAs.","Finanza Futura Srl, I-50123 Florence, Italy",,"Ginanneschi, M (通讯作者)，Finanza Futura Srl, Via Moro 19, I-50123 Florence, Italy.",ginanneschi.marco@alice.it,,"Ginanneschi, Marco/0000-0002-8341-8992",,,,,11,3,3,0,25,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

'Social influence' is defined as the process by which an individual's thoughts and actions are changed by the thoughts and action of others. Its role was investigated at three levels: the immediate family, household members and significant others (direct social influence); the extended family, friends, peers and colleagues (less direct social influence); and the wider cultural context (indirect social influence). Interviews with 61 individuals living in 12 towns and cities across England were analysed. Half of the interviewees were new regular bicyclists and the other half did not bicycle at all, or only occasionally. Social influence was found to be the dominant factor for a minority of the cases where participants started bicycling regularly. It played a role alongside other factors in other cases. It could take the form of direct influence from family, friends and peers or indirect influence from the social and cultural context. The analysis illustrates the difficulty of capturing social influence which is often hidden and emerges incidentally in the course of the interviews and interacts with other contributing factors. The role of social influence found in this research challenges the rational approach to explaining travel decision making that has traditionally dominated transport studies. The paper suggests that social processes could be harnessed to improve the efficacy of bicycling promotion programs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicate that the effect of state income per capita in the birth year on income and disability later in life varies with changes in income levels. Individuals born in the trough of the Depression in low-income states had substantially lower incomes and higher work disability rates later in life than workers born in those states in the peak year of 1929.

It specifically looks into that area of innovation which firms protect through patent registration and which arguably generates the greatest added value. A panel of 439 firms over the 1998-2008 period was used to that end, as well as econometric estimations with panel count data models. The explanatory variables are grouped into innovation assets, such as R&D activity and technological cooperation, and complementary assets such as technological, organizational, human, commercial and financial resources. The results show that both SMEs and large firms choose to register patents. Internal R&D plays a decisive role in the case of SMEs whereas large firms have a stronger relationship with external R&D. Agri-food businesses often resort to technological cooperation as well, though to a lesser extent. Human and commercial resources are further assets associated with patenting in the case of large firms.","[Alarcon, Silverio; Gonzalez Polonio, Luis] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Alarcón, S (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",,"Alarcón, Silverio/AAA-3166-2019; ALARCON LORENZO, SILVERIO/H-6828-2015","Alarcón, Silverio/0000-0001-5823-4238; ALARCON LORENZO, SILVERIO/0000-0001-5823-4238",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [AGL2012-39793-C03-01],Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain(Spanish Government),The authors express their gratitude for the funding received from Project AGL2012-39793-C03-01 of the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain.

It also introduces a new entropy-based methodology for the determination of the optimal level of the multiresolution decomposition, as opposed to subjective or ad-hoc approaches used hitherto. As an empirical application, the paper relies on wavelet analysis to reveal the complex dynamics across different timescales for one of the most widely traded foreign exchange rates, namely the Great Britain Pound. The examined period covers the global financial crisis and the Eurozone debt crisis. The timescale analysis attempts to explore the micro-dynamics of across-scale heterogeneity in the second moment (volatility) on the basis of market agent behavior with different trading preferences and information flows across scales. New stylized properties emerge in the volatility structure and the implications for the flow of information across scales are inferred.","[Bekiros, Stelios D.] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [Bekiros, Stelios D.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Athens 10434, Greece; [Bekiros, Stelios D.] RCEA, I-47900 Rimini, Italy",European University Institute; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Bekiros, SD (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Via Piazzuola 43, I-50133 Florence, Italy.",stelios.bekiros@eui.eu,"Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726",Marie Curie Fellowship under European Community [303854],Marie Curie Fellowship under European Community(European Union (EU)),"This research is supported by the Marie Curie Fellowship (FP7-PEOPLE-2011-CIG, No. 303854) under the 7th European Community Framework Programme.

Analyzing the mortgage lending booms and busts in Hungary and Estonia, the paper finds that different policy priorities did not matter too much for the build-up of the mortgage boom and the associated risks households had to face. Rather, early decisions for encompassing house privatization and the non-existence of mortgage markets have led to a pent-up demand for housing finance, while the transnationalization and EU convergence of the financial sector have provided the supply for mortgage lending from the early 2000s on. Policy-makers in both countries, albeit to different degrees, have supported the mortgage boom and have by-and-large failed to correct for the risks of their population. In the wake of the global financial crisis, however, policies started to sharply diverge. While the Estonian government has relied on market mechanisms and private market actors to cope with the crisis, the Hungarian government engaged in far-reaching interventionist policies to unmake some of its devastating consequences for indebted house-owners. The paper explains its findings by the combination of different welfare state traditions and patterns of party competition.","Cent European Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Bohle, D (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Budapest, Hungary.",,,,,,,,77,74,78,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Given the economic importance of the targets, however, this paper questions why the Merlin agreements were so ineffective. Three explanations are given: first, in light of the challenges in accessing wholesale funding for the largest UK-owned banks, there was a lack of capacity and incentive to lend more; second, the lack of decisive intervention by the British state to compel banks to lend was also a determinant; third, though, I argue that boosting actual lending figures was not the primary aim of Project Merlin. Instead, the targets were performative, rather than substantive. I argue that these three explanations have important implications for the varieties of capitalism (VoC) debate and the economic and political economic literature on foreign versus domestic bank ownership. To the first literature, the article explains the degree to which politics underpins the structure of even the UK's purportedly liberal market economy (LME), whilst to the second, it explores the limitations to political control over even domestically-owned banks.","Univ Manchester, Dept Polit, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Macartney, H (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Polit, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,107,11,14,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This research makes use of long-term hourly and daily counts collected automatically using inductive loop detectors.

Using regression models with autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) errors, the direct impact and lagged effects of weather variables on hourly and daily bicycle counts are investigated. Among the main findings, temperature and humidity are positively and negatively associated with cycling, respectively, with a non-linear association in most cases. Precipitation has a significant negative impact on cycling flows, and its effect was observed to increase with rain intensity. Lagged effects of rain were also observed, such as the effect of rain in the previous three hours, rain in the morning only, and rain in the afternoon only. Furthermore, urban bicycle flows are more sensitive to weather on weekends than on weekdays, and recreational facilities are more sensitive than utilitarian facilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the Rothschild-Stiglitz approach to model credit markets under asymmetric information, legal restrictions are shown to reduce the use and attractiveness of mortgage credit. Consistent with model predictions, empirical results indicate that originations of regulated high-cost mortgages were significantly less than predicted in states with more restrictive laws. The differences between predicted and actual originations of high-cost mortgages in states with less restrictive laws were not significant. These differences were also not significant for non-high-cost originations across all states. Thus, credit regulation was differentially associated with reduction in originations of high-cost mortgages, and non-high-cost lending did not consistently expand in areas where high-cost mortgages were restricted.","[Steinbuks, Jevgenijs] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Elliehausen, Gregory] Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Steinbuks, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jsteinbu@purdue.edu,,"Stenbuks, Jevgenijs/0000-0003-3548-2196",,,,,41,4,4,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The outcome may be a two-component duty where one duty addresses the unfairness' of the subsidy and the other the dumping behaviour. The philosophy behind this practice is that, at least to some extent, the observed dumping has been induced by the subsidy, and as the GATT Treaty, Article VI commits the claimant not to impose double remedies for the same misbehaviour', it is necessary to make an assessment of the hypothetical dumping without the subsidy. The EU quantification of the hypothetical dumping margin assumes that an export subsidy translates fully to the dumping margin, while a domestic subsidy leaves the dumping margin unchanged. Using an oligopoly model, we show in this paper that in case of an export subsidy, the EU anti-dumping duty is lower than the predicted hypothetical dumping margin from the oligopoly model. For a domestic subsidy, the results are ambiguous, and the difference between the size of the duty following the EU procedure and the model predictions is relatively small.","[Hansen, Jorgen D.] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark; [Nielsen, Jorgen U. -M.] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; Aarhus University,"Hansen, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.",,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2014,37.0,5,,,,,654.0,671,,10.1111/twec.12134,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AG4QQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335405700004,0

Typically, the degree of East-West trade integration is assessed by comparing actual trade volumes with potential trade volumes projected from the gravity model parameters estimated for a group of countries that best represent normal trade relations. This approach, however, does not compare trade levels against a maximum level of trade feasible for the group of eastern European countries. This paper using a stochastic frontier specification of the gravity model is able to identify the efficiency of trade integration relative to maximum potential levels. The findings, based on a panel data set of bilateral exports from 17 Western European countries to the 10 new member states over the 1994-2007 period, indicate a high degree of East-West trade integration close to two-thirds of frontier estimates, suggesting a low degree of trade resistances.","[Ravishankar, Geetha; Stack, Marie M.] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham, England",Nottingham Trent University,"Ravishankar, G (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham, England.",,"Stack, Marie/JOZ-9126-2023","Stack, Marie/0000-0002-9213-7607",,,,,28,58,63,10,109,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2014,37.0,5,,,,,690.0,704,,10.1111/twec.12144,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AG4QQ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335405700006,0

Theoretically, upper-caste dominance comprises a potential proximity gain and offsetting group-specific oppression effects. For SCs and other backward classes (OBCs), initial proximity gains dominate negative oppression effects because upper-caste-dominated villages are located in more productive areas: once agroecology is controlled for, proximity and oppression effects cancel each other out. Although the effects are theoretically ambiguous, we find large, positive own-dominance or enclave effects for upper castes, OBCs, and especially SCs. These village regime effects are restricted to the Hindu social groups. Combining pathway and income source analysis, we close in on the mechanisms underpinning identity-based income disparities; while education matters, landownership accounts for most enclave effects. A strong postreform SC own-village advantage turns out to have agricultural rather than nonfarm or business origins. We also find upper-caste dominance to inhibit the educational progress of other social groups, along with negative enclave effects on the educational progress of Muslim women and scheduled tribe men.","[Iversen, Vegard] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Kalwij, Adriaan] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Verschoor, Arjan] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Dubey, Amaresh] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi, India","University of Manchester; Utrecht University; University of East Anglia; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Iversen, V (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Vegard.Iversen@manchester.ac.uk,,"Verschoor, Arjan/0000-0002-7770-6832",,,,,48,15,15,0,25,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

Based on a penalty method, the system of complementarity problems are approximated by a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). We then introduce a fitted finite volume method for the spatial discretization along with a fully implicit time stepping scheme for the PDEs, which results in a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. We show that this scheme is consistent, stable and monotone, hence convergent. To solve the system of nonlinear equations effectively, an iterative solution method is established. The convergence of the solution method is shown. Numerical tests are performed to examine the convergence rate and verify the effectiveness and robustness of the new numerical scheme.","[Zhang, K.] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Business, Shenzhen 518060, Guandong, Peoples R China; [Teo, K.

By tracing the intricate relations among elements of business, civil society and the Workers' Party in the first years of the Forum, this article reveals the major role played by a corporate movement stemming from the Brazilian democratisation process in the 1980s, and how this combined with the transformed agenda of the Workers' Party as it gained higher political offices to constrain the Forum's activities from the outset. In so doing, this article challenges not only widespread conceptions of the Forum as a counter-hegemonic alternative but also current critiques concerning its subsequent limitations.

We propose a novel strategic selection model to study the growth effects of IMF programs, which allows for the possibility of adverse selection. We find that adverse selection occurs: the countries that are most interested in participating in IMF programs are the least likely to have favorable growth outcomes. Controlling for this selection effect, we find that countries benefit from IMF programs on average in terms of higher growth rates, but that some countries benefit from participation, while others are harmed. Moral hazard predicts that long-term users of Fund resources benefit least from participating in programs, while adverse selection predicts the opposite. Contrary to previous findings, we find that IMF programs have more successful growth performance among long-term users than among short-term users.","[Bas, Muhammet A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stone, Randall W.] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",Harvard University; University of Rochester,"Bas, MA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St CGIS N209, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mbas@gov.harvard.edu; randall.stone@rochester.edu,,,,,,,40,29,31,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Our proposed model advances the state of the art of RU-RR mixture models by (i) adding and simultaneously estimating a membership model which predicts the probability of belonging to a RU or RR class; (ii) adding a layer of random taste heterogeneity within each behavioural class; and (iii) deriving a welfare measure associated with the RU-RR mixture model and consistent with referendum-voting, which is the adequate mechanism of provision for such local public goods. The context of our empirical application is a stated choice experiment concerning traffic calming schemes. We find that the random parameter RU-RR mixture model not only outperforms its fixed coefficient counterpart in terms of fit as expected but also in terms of plausibility of membership determinants of behavioural class. In line with psychological theories of regret, we find that, compared to respondents who are familiar with the choice context (i.e. the traffic calming scheme), unfamiliar respondents are more likely to be regret minimizers than utility maximizers.

According to 36 different harvest records, rice productivity continuously declined from the early eighteenth to the late nineteenth centuries due to deforestation and increase in natural disasters. Contraction of rural markets after the interruption of trade with Japan also contributed to the decrease in rice production. The third reason for the nineteenth-century crisis was the dissolution of the government-led grain storage and redistribution system.

Firstly, a traditional Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, the approach of Bessembinder & Seguin (1992) and the Gray's (1996) Markov-switching-GARCH model are used to examine the impact of futures trading on the European real estate securities market. The results show that futures trading did not destabilize the underlying listed market. Importantly, the results also reveal that the introduction of a futures market has improved the speed and quality of information flowing to the spot market. Secondly, we assess the hedging effectiveness of the contracts using two alternative strategies (na < ve and Ordinary Least Squares models).

We find that the only feasible mechanism satisfying a mild zero transfer axiom, in this class, is the Pivotal mechanism.","Indian Stat Inst, ERU, Kolkata 700108, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata,"Mukherjee, C (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, ERU, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India.",conanmukherjee@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,11,12,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2014,42.0,2,,,,,289.0,311,,10.1007/s00355-013-0733-3,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA3KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330992000003,0

The two major bargaining solutions, that of Nash (Econometrica 18:155-162, 1950) and that of Kalai and Smorodinsky (Econometrica, 43:513-518, 1975), Pareto-dominate this process (in the ex ante sense). However, whereas the existing literature offers axiomatizations of the Nash solution in which this ex ante domination plays a central role (Moulin, Le choix social utilitariste, Ecole Polytechnique Discussion Paper, 1983 ; de Clippel, Social Choice and Welfare, 29:201-210, 2007), it does not provide an analogous result for Kalai-Smorodinsky. This paper fills in this gap: a characterization of the latter is obtained by combining the aforementioned domination with three additional axioms: Pareto optimality, individual monotonicity, and a weakened version of the Perles-Maschler (International Journal of Game Theory, 10:163-193, 1981) super additivity axiom.","Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Rachmilevitch, S (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",shiranrach@econ.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2014,76.0,2,,,,,173.0,177,,10.1007/s11238-013-9367-2,0.0,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA1AW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330829500002,0

By weaving together a detailed quantitative examination of changes in corporate profit shares with a qualitative appraisal of the restructuring in business control over the organisation of society and nature, the paper points to the rapid ascendance of a new power configuration in the global political economy of food: the Agro-Trader nexus. The agribusiness and grain trader firms that belong to the Agro-Trader nexus have not been mere 'price takers', instead they have actively contributed to the inflationary restructuring of the world food system by championing and facilitating the rapid expansion of the first-generation biofuels sector. As a key driver of agricultural commodity price rises, the biofuels boom has raised the Agro-Trader nexus's differential profits and it has at the same time deepened global hunger. These findings suggest that food price inflation is a mechanism of redistribution.","York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",York University - Canada,"Baines, J (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",jbaines@yorku.ca,,"Baines, Joseph/0000-0002-0554-2998",,,,,62,15,16,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We focus on two GVC governance theories to which we previously contributed: a theory of linking and a theory of conventions. The modular framework we propose is built on three scalar dimensions: (1) a micro level - determinants and dynamics of exchange at individual value chain nodes; (2) a meso level- how and to what extent these linkage characteristics 'travel' upstream and downstream in the value chain; and (3) a macro level - looking at 'overall' GVC governance. Given space limitations, we focus only on the issue of 'polarity' in governance at the macro level, distinguishing between unipolar, bipolar and multipolar governance forms. While we leave a more ambitious analysis of how overall GVC governance is mutually constituted by micro/meso factors and broader institutional, regulatory and societal processes to future work, we provide an initial framework to which this work could be linked. Our ultimate purpose is to spur future efforts that seek to use and refine additional theories, to connect theories together better or in different modular configurations, and to incorporate elements at the macro level that reflect the changing constellation of key actors in GVC governance- the increasing influence of, for example, NGOs, taste and standard makers, and social movements in GVC governance.","[Ponte, Stefano] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Sturgeon, Timothy] MIT, Ind Performance Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Copenhagen Business School; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Ponte, S (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",,,,,,,,67,308,335,18,256,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This research will analyse the connection between the fiscal deficit and inflation in the Republic of Macedonia. The main objective of this research is to review the factors responsible for the growth of fiscal deficit in Macedonia, taking into consideration all the factors which may influence in the status of fiscal deficit. The research states that inflation is not caused only by fiscal deficit. However, government expenditures and the money supply are stated as important determiners of the growth of the fiscal deficit. A question is posed in relation to what fiscal deficit is? The fiscal deficit is the difference between total government expenditures (excluding loans). The element sof the fiscal deficit are: a) income deficit and b) capital expenditures. The fiscal deficit in Macedonia in 2011 was 2.6% of GDP, whereas the expenditures were reduced in accordance with the lack of the income fullfilling the objective of the government deficit. The incomes were grown to 3.5% in comparison with 2010, under 12.6% taken in the budget. The lack was mainly because of over-optimistic estimations of non-tax income. Inflation is generally connected with the fast monetary spreading. Although the immediate cause of inflation is connected with money supply, developments in the monetary position are indicators of other sectors of economy. In order to verify our posed hypothesis above, we will use the log log model. Through the chosen model we will try to verify the way of interaction of our variables. We will see whether inflation influences the fiscal deficit and how does their connection stands, we will analyse whether monetary supply has positive or negative connection with the fiscal deficit, that is whether does it cause its growth or reduction, and lastly we will analyse the same for the government expenditures, i. e. whether they increase or decrease the fiscal deficit.","South East Europian Univ, Tetovo, Macedonia",,"Aziri, E (通讯作者)，South East Europian Univ, Tetovo, Macedonia.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,397.0,404,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900051,0

A stochastic macroeconomic model of an open economy along the lines proposed by Clarida and Gali (1994) constitutes a theoretical framework for the analysis. An empirical strategy is founded on Bayesian structural VAR models with the long-run identifying restrictions (zero and/or sign). We show that the traditional division into nominal and real shocks is not sufficient as it omits financial shocks. This distorts the results considerably. Using quarterly data spanning from 1995 until 2013q2 for real GDP, real exchange rate, and price level in Poland we examine three empirical specifications of the macroeconomic model that differ in the number of shocks included and the type of identifying restrictions imposed. Our main finding is that, contrary to the extant studies that either do not allow for financial shocks or find their impact to be rather weak in comparison with real shocks, financial shocks are important source of real exchange rate fluctuations in Poland. Using historical simulation we also show that the results are empirically consistent since the deviations of real exchange rate from its long-run equilibrium level have been dominated by financial shocks during the global financial crisis.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Krakow, Poland; [Wroblewska, Justyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl; eowroble@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Wróblewska, Justyna/AAA-8421-2020; Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018","Wróblewska, Justyna/0000-0002-9789-2601; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811",,,,,11,3,3,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-43-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,37.0,46,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367244900004,0

The TPE can also deal with the common situation in which such a correlation is the result of decisions on (intended) program participation not being taken centrally. In this context RCTs are less suitable even for the simplest interventions. The TPE can be estimated by applying regression techniques to observational data from a representative sample from the targeted population. The approach is illustrated with an evaluation of a health insurance program in Vietnam.","[Elbers, Chris; Gunning, Jan Willem] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Elbers, Chris; Gunning, Jan Willem] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Gunning, JW (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.t.m.elbers@vu.nl; j.w.gunning@vu.nl,"Gunning, Jan Willem/C-6879-2008","Gunning, Jan Willem/0000-0002-8402-8793",,,,,23,2,4,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

The results indicate that the permanent departure of the father decreases children's school enrollment by approximately 5 percentage points and increases child labor by 3 percentage points. This paper explores the rollout of a conditional-cash-transfer program during the period of study and shows that this program counteracts these adverse effects. When coupled with other evidence, this finding strongly suggests that the channel through which the father's departure most affects children is by reducing the income of very poor households, which tightens their liquidity constraints. This finding also highlights the important safety-net role played by welfare programs with respect to disadvantaged households, particularly because these households are unlikely to have formal or informal mechanisms with which to insure themselves against such vagaries.","[Fitzsimons, Emla] Inst Fiscal Studies, Ctr Evaluat Dev Policy EDePo, London, England; [Mesnard, Alice] City Univ London, London, England; [Mesnard, Alice] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Mesnard, Alice] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; City University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Fitzsimons, E (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, Ctr Evaluat Dev Policy EDePo, London, England.",emla_f@ifs.org.uk; Alice.Mesnard.1@city.ac.uk,,"mesnard, alice/0000-0001-6899-9138","ESRC [RES-000-22-1742]; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1, ES/G040923/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are grateful to participants at the IFS, CMPO, World Bank, and 3ie-LIDC Seminar Series and to participants in the NEUDC conference for comments.

In this paper, the authors choose data of 11 industries from the year 2001 to the year 2010 as research objects and try to combine the static PE method with the dynamic PE (PEG) method together to analyze the relationship between PEG value and its corresponding earnings ratio. Through conducting Granger causality test, correlation analysis, significance test based on independent sample, regression and other methods to analyze the correlation between PEG and earnings ratio, three main conclusions are drawn: 1. PEG has a negative impact on earnings ratio; 2. The effects of PEG on earnings ratio are different in the same industry but among different years. In fact, PEG's effect on earnings ratio is more apparent in bull market than in bear market. 3. The PEG's effects on earnings ratio are also different in the same year but among different industries.

We revisit these from the point of view of their original rationale - an investigation of the characteristics and extent of poverty in the countryside. We argue that Davies' standard of 'tolerable comfort' can lay claim to being the first poverty line based upon the application of a minimum consumption standard to household income. We find that the majority of households fall below this standard, although those in the south of England were worst off, that family size was the largest coefficient and poverty reduced as the age of the first child increased. The incidence of poverty was not highly correlated with the absence of a woman wage earner. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Our previous research suggested that the service quality can be improved when the station location is proposed by solving the p-median problem, however in this solution there are significant differences in the load of individual ambulances. Therefore, it seems reasonable to limit the population allocated to one station in the problem formulation. This way, the problem of station location becomes a capacitated p-median problem. It can be efficiently solved using a matheuristic combining local optimisation approach with an IP solver. In the paper, our solution of the capacitated p-median problem is compared with the previously proposed deployment using computer simulation.","[Janosikova, L'udmila; Zarnay, Michal] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Transportat Networks, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Jánosiková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Transportat Networks, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",Ludmila.Janosikova@fri.uniza.sk,"Jánošíková, Ľudmila/C-9712-2010","Jánošíková, Ľudmila/0000-0003-3983-6713",,,,,8,20,21,0,4,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3868-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,116.0,122,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1MX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350272000019,0

Cost management models statistical analysis in Croatian companies was made. The main aim was to research cost management models used in Croatia as a support for sustaining and enhancing competitiveness. The survey was conducted in November 2012. Using simple random selection procedure 70 Croatian companies were selected from Register of business subjects in Croatian commercial Chamber. The selected companies were surveyed mostly by e-mail (50 companies) but also by phone (10 companies) and by personal contact (10 companies). The final response rate was 41%. The main hypothesis was that Croatian companies fail to apply adequate models of cost management and thereby significantly reduce their efficiency and competitiveness. Modern cost management model usage provides options for managers in their actions to be more precise, efficient and effective. But the research has shown that Croatian companies are mostly using traditional methods of cost management. The further cost management model usage analysis in the Croatian companies showed that most companies consider that they could achieve significant cost savings thanks to better use of different models of cost management. The empirical research results have shown that Croatian companies do not use adequate models of cost management, thus confirming the hypothesis. Further research aims should be to investigate reasons of not using modern cost management models as integral parts of the companies' strategic orientation.","[Lutilsky, Ivana Drazic; Zmuk, Berislav; Dragija, Martina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Ivanko, Smiljana] Financijska Agencija FINA, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Lutilsky, ID (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",idrazic@efzg.hr; bzmuk@efzg.hr; mdragija@efzg.hr; smljnvnk5@gmail.com,"Dragija Kostic, Martina/H-9443-2018; Drazic Lutilsky, Ivana/I-2428-2018","Dragija Kostic, Martina/0000-0003-0131-0345; Drazic Lutilsky, Ivana/0000-0003-3562-9864",,,,,10,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,245.0,254,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600023,0

Data on wages are available for the last 15 years. During this time the characteristics of the wage empirical distribution were changed. Variability of data grew, skewness and kurtosis were changed over time, too. Changing the parameters of probability density over time has led to a degradation of the model and it was necessary to choose a different probability distribution.

The socio-economic performance of a country depends on the performance of its regions. In this paper we examined the differences between the performance of the regions of Visegrad group (Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland). Performance of countries and regions can be evaluated on the basis of various socio-economic indicators. We measured the performance of the regions using these indicators: gross domestic product per capita, employment rate and unemployment rate. In the paper a region is defined as a territorial unit corresponding with NUTS II. Methods. We used the method of analysis, synthesis, comparison and scoring method in this paper. The method of analysis was used to examine the development of selected indicators in the regions of Visegrad group. The method of comparison was used for comparing the gross domestic product per capita, employment and unemployment and the performance of the regions. The scoring method was used for the evaluation of the performance of Visegrad group regions. The method of synthesis was used to draw conclusions. Results. Prague region achieved the best results. In 2001, the Prague was followed by regions Kozep-Magyarorszag, Nyugat-Dunantul and Bratislava region. In 2006, Bratislava region was on the second place, followed by Kozep-Magyarorszag region. The best Polish Mazowiecicie region was placed on the 11th place. In 2011, the Prague region scored the highest points, but Bratislava region was the best region in regard to the level of GDP per capita. Mazowieckie region was placed on the 5th place and Kozep-Magyarorszag region was on the 6th place. Conclusions. There are significant differences among the states of Visegrad Group but also among the regions within the same state in regard to GDP per capita, employment and unemployment. The biggest economic performance is achieved by regions with capital within. The most productive region is Prague. The highest increase in performance was observed in regions of Poland and Slovakia. The performance of regions in Hungary was worsened significantly. Some regions of the Czech Republic have increased their performance, some of them have decreased.","Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Trencin, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Masárová, J (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Trencin, Slovakia.",,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,195.0,202,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900025,0

Transition countries started to develop entrepreneurial culture quite late, thus facing a series of barriers to a full implementation of entrepreneurial values in their respective areas. Changing the concept of approach to entrepreneurship at the same time includes overall changes in socio-economic environment. Researches have shown that development of entrepreneurship is a result of general preconditions, such as finance programs, economic policy, openness of markets, etc., but also of important factors, such as education as well as cultural and social norms. In some transition countries, an aggravating circumstance in this process is a relatively high level of conservativeness in terms of development of entrepreneurship among members of marginal social groups, especially women and the young. There are fewer entrepreneurs among women and the young in comparison to other social groups. Education is certainly one of the main preconditions for these two groups' inclusion in entrepreneurial activities. Society requires a creation of an entrepreneurial climate which will prevent a creation of social barriers to inclusion of any group in entrepreneurial activities and which should start developing from childhood. The aim of this paper is to explore the elements of entrepreneurial culture influencing the development of entrepreneurship among women and the young in Croatia as a transition country. The paper will present the results of two researches conducted among student population with regard to students' attitude towards entrepreneurship. Moreover, the paper will analyze the differences in level of acceptance of women's predispositions to entrepreneurship between students from Bosnia and Herzegovina and students from Croatia. The researches were conducted through structured questionnaires on an accidental sample of students. Different methods of descriptive statistics were employed in processing the collected data. The conclusion will offer the possibilities which entrepreneurial education opens up among student population in transition countries aiming to raise the level of the overall entrepreneurial activity.","[Miocic, Bozena Krce; Vidic, Gabrijela; Kovacevic, Andrea] Univ Zadar, Dept Tourism & Commun Studies, Zadar, Croatia",University of Zadar,"Miocic, BK (通讯作者)，Univ Zadar, Dept Tourism & Commun Studies, Zadar, Croatia.",,"Krce Miocic, Bozena/ISU-6504-2023","Krce Miocic, Bozena/0000-0001-5845-8901",,,,,9,0,0,0,9,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,143.0,150,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900018,0

A survey has been carried out and Romanian tourists have been questioned regarding their intentions and motivations of travelling in Moldavia. The results indicate that the variables of the TPB represent valid predictors for the intention of travelling in Moldavia, as well as for the self-reported behavior. Also the analysis of tourists' place of origin has permitted us identifying their specific Moldavian destinations.

Urban and peri-urban agriculture are potential regular users of large quantities of household wastes and compost; but these organic fertilizers are indeed scarcely used. This study proposes using a binomial Logit model on the one hand, to identify factors to encourage using compost in the urban and peri-urban lowlands in Cameroon, and on the other hand, to highlight the effects of these factors on different levels of fertilization using an ordered Logit model. Using a representative sample of 288 farmers, it was found that 41% of farmers use mixed compost and mineral fertilizer, 22% of them use mineral fertilizers exclusively, and 15% use compost exclusively. However, 23% of the farmers in Cameroon do not use any fertilizers. The binomial Logit model estimations show that variables like membership in farmers' cooperatives, land property rights, food cultivation, low levels of farm income and the distance between farmers' dwellings and their farms have an effect on whether compost is used in urban and peri-urban areas in Cameroon. In addition, the ordered Logit model estimation shows that the variables like land-property rights, food cultivation, the available chemical input budget and the distance between dwellings and farms explains fertilization at all levels. In light of these results, a participative solid waste management plan that encourages local composting in the lowlands would help to reduce pollution resulting from solid wastes while promoting the development of the urban and peri-urban urban agriculture.","[Sotamenou, J.] Univ Yaounde II Soa, Fac Econ & Management, POB 1365, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Parrot, L.] Ctr Coop Int Rech, Agron Dev CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France",CIRAD,"Sotamenou, J (通讯作者)，Univ Yaounde II Soa, Fac Econ & Management, POB 1365, Yaounde, Cameroon.",sotamenou@yahoo.fr; laurent.parrot@cirad.fr,"Sotamenou, Joel/ABE-8105-2021",,African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),The authors are indebted to the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) for its financial support.,,57,2,3,0,15,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-08-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1021.0,,,,,,325.0,338,,,,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB5GQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343861400030,0

Increasing demand for freight services and growing number of vehicles led to critical shortage of drivers. Due to economic recession, road freight traffic experienced dramatic decline, and the shortfall of drivers was resolved only on a temporary basis. However, compliance with social legislation necessitated to increase the number of drivers of road freight traffic compared to number of vehicles by about 30%. Since there is no systematic approach to train professional drivers in the Slovak Republic, encompassing for instance the cost of driver's license, initial qualification courses, driver qualification cards, psychological examinations, etc., driver shortage can again be expected in the near future. Therefore, companies dealing in the transport of goods are invariably to focus on the processes of planning, motivating and rewarding if they want to attract and retain competent, qualified and experienced drivers. The purpose of the paper is to verify theory and identify methods of remuneration and motivation as viewed by both freight road drivers and transport undertakings. The main methods of survey were an interview and a questionnaire. The questionnaire could be completed on-line using the professional freight driver website, but a print version of the questionnaire was also available. A total of 156 respondents participated in the survey. Several responses obtained from the questionnaire by professional freight drivers and transport undertakings were compared and evaluated to highlight and analyse different motivating factors for both the employers and employees. In addition, applied maluses by employers upon the discovery of deficient performance were looked at. The value of the paper lies in clarifying the current applicable wage system in road transport undertakings. Any road transport undertaking striving to retain competent and qualified drivers must focus on factors to prevent high employee turnover rates. The factors include mainly setting competitive wages, defining employer's accountability, defining employer's duty of care for employees outside the workplace, allocating optimal workload, offering employee benefits, investing in employee education and training. Decision-making process for remuneration must take into consideration company expenditures, pay comparable to same or similar positions and minimum pay level. Qualified, competent and well-trained workforce is essential for any company to thrive. Professional drivers, however, must not only be able follow and carry out instructions and tasks. Additionally, they must be able to select the best solution to potential transport problems.","[Spankova, Jana; Grencikova, Adriana] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Trencin, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Spanková, J (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Trencin, Slovakia.",,"Grenčíková, Adriana/JLL-2678-2023; Španková, Jana/HLW-9647-2023","Grenčíková, Adriana/0000-0003-1077-1127; Španková, Jana/0000-0002-9951-4890",,,,,3,5,5,0,9,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,495.0,502,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800062,0

The robust design has been applied successfully in improving the quality design of products or processes for different industries by minimizing the effect of the causes of variation and quality loss. The system of quality improvement is classified as a static system if the response of system has a fixed target and as a dynamic system if the response of system is an ideal function of signal factors. The robust design of dynamic system is used to find the optimal control factor settings so that the measured response is closest to the ideal function. Taguchi's dynamic system is ineffective when the response has a nonlinear relationship with the signal factors. Most of the dynamic system research in the literature only focused on the linear ideal function. Nevertheless, there are cases where the inherent nature of a dynamic system has a nonlinear function. It may be necessary to transform the data into a linearized ideal function, but even then there are many cases that cannot be linearized in some practical situations. In this paper, a mathematical formula based on the quality loss function is derived for optimizing the robust design of a nonlinear dynamic system. The example of high-precision positioning device is provided to demonstrate the implementation and effectiveness of the proposed method.","[Wu, Ful-Chiang] Vanung Univ, Dept Hotel Management, Chungli 32061, Taiwan; [Lai, Ruei-Lung] Vanung Univ, Dept Tourism & Leisure Management, Chungli 32061, Taiwan",,"Wu, FC (通讯作者)，Vanung Univ, Dept Hotel Management, Chungli 32061, Taiwan.",shogo@vnu.edu.tw; tony@vnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,1,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-200-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,374.0,380,,,,,,7,Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BC2LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351060400068,0

The daily numbers of births between 1920 and 1989 have been calculated from the full sample of individuals who have been registered at least once in the German social security system. While the lunar cycle does not affect the number of births, the number of sunspots is positively correlated to the number of births. The empirical results may be explained by medical technological progress making natural influences on births less important over time.

(2005)) by using data from publicly traded manufacturing firms in the United States. I control for the possible endogeneity of competition by using a trade-weighted average of industry exchange rates as an instrument. I find a mildly negative relationship between competition (as measured by the inverse of markups) and innovation (as measured by citation-weighted patents). The negative relationship is robust to many alternative assumptions and specifications. To reconcile the mildly negative relationship in the U.S. data with the inverted-U relationship that Aghion et al. (2005) find in the U.K. data, I modify their theoretical model and show that the modified model can explain both negative and inverted-U relationships. The key theoretical assumption is that the U.K. manufacturing industries are technologically more neck-and-neck than their counterparts in the United States. I find support for this assumption in the data. The different empirical results between the two countries may also arise because of differences in data and samples.","Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Hashmi, AR (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",,,,,,,,28,146,163,12,90,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We incorporate these exogenous commodity market dynamics into Porter's (1983) structural modeling of the Joint Executive Committee Railroad Cartel. As in Porter, we model marginal cost as a parametric function of (instrumented) output, among other factors. Unlike Porter, we model pricing over marginal cost as a nonparametric function of a set of variables, which include expectations of deterministic demand cycles and cartel stability. We estimate the pricing and demand equation simultaneously and semiparametrically. Our estimated weekly markups during periods of cartel stability are shown to reflect optimal collusive pricing over deterministic business cycles, as modeled in Haltiwanger and Harrington (1991). Periods of cartel instability are proven to be triggered by realized mistakes in expectations of New York grain prices.","[Mariuzzo, Franco] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Walsh, Patrick Paul] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University of East Anglia; University College Dublin,"Mariuzzo, F (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,"Walsh, Patrick Paul/AAG-5085-2019","Walsh, Patrick Paul/0000-0003-0739-8835; , Franco/0000-0003-4604-1054",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,4,4,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Based on the data of 102 countries over the period 1970-2007, we find the following. First, there exists substantial heterogeneity in the inward FDI-inequality relationship. Inward FDI is inequality-ameliorating in low-income countries where human capital is scarce but is inequality-raising in middle- and high-income countries where human capital is abundant. Second, contrary to the conventional mindset, outward FDI has no significant impact on inequality in low-and high-income countries. Nevertheless, outward FDI is inequality-raising in middle-income countries with low levels of human capital. Our results demonstrate that accounting for parameter heterogeneity is critical to identify the key mechanisms through which FDI affects inequality. Omitting parameter heterogeneity could lead to misspecification and incorrect policy prescriptions.","[Deng, Wen-Shuenn] Tamkang Univ, Dept Stat, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan; [Lin, Yi-Chen] Tamkang Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Tamkang University,"Deng, WS (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Stat, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan.",121350@mail.tku.edu.tw; ylin@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,40,6,6,1,26,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

For while I very much welcome Benjamin Cohen's seminal historiographical intervention, nevertheless it obscures two foundational properties of IPE. First, identifying 1970 as the birth-year of IPE produces a distorted image of the discipline's purpose and historiography that can begin to be remedied by rehabilitating the originary era of classical political economy. Second, focussing on issues revolving around methodology and epistemology obscures the deeper Eurocentric metanarratival foundations upon which the vast majority of IPE scholarship between 1760-2012 stands. Specifically, I reveal the various Eurocentric metanarratives that underpin the orthodox traditions of classical political economy (Smith and List) and modern IPE (Gilpin and Keohane). My conclusion is that rather than producing positivist/objective (or even critical) explanations of the world economy, most of IPE has, often unwittingly, defended, promoted or celebrated Western civilization as the highest or ideal referent in the world. I follow this up in Part 2 by deconstructing open economy politics to bring my historiography upto the present while advancing an alternative non-Eurocentric empirical and theoretical research agenda for what I call inter-civilizational political economy.","Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Hobson, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,72,43,48,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Here, we compare the performance of six alternative models. Currently, the most popular are mixed logit (MIXL), particularly the version with normal mixing (N-MIXL), and latent class (LC), which assumes discrete consumer types. Recently, several alternative models have been developed. The 'generalized multinomial logit' (G-MNL) extends N-MIXL by allowing for heterogeneity in the logit scale coefficient. Scale heterogeneity logit (S-MNL) is a special case of G-MNL with scale heterogeneity only. The 'mixed-mixed' logit (MM-MNL) assumes a discrete mixture-of-normals heterogeneity distribution. Finally, one can modify N-MIXL by imposing theoretical sign constraints on vertical attributes. We call this 'T-MIXL'. We find that none of these models dominates the others, but G-MNL, MM-MNL and T-MIXL typically outperform the popular N-MIXL and LC models.

We present evidence that house prices in Hawaii were subject to such regime shifts. Prices responded to demands associated with U.S. incomes and wealth for most years from 1975 through 2008. For about a decade starting in the middle of the 1980s, after the Japanese yen appreciated dramatically and Japanese housing and stock market wealth soared, however, house prices in Hawaii responded to Japanese incomes and wealth. Estimated models with these regime shifts outperformed conventional, constant-coefficient models. The regime-shifting model helps explain why, when and by how much the volatility and the elasticities of house prices in Hawaii with respect to the incomes and wealth of the United States and Japan varied over time.","[Krainer, John] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Wilcox, James A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Financial Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Krainer, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",john.krainer@sf.frb.org; jwilcox@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SEP,2013,41.0,3,,,,,449.0,480,,10.1111/reec.12009,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,217AZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324330200001,0

Using dwelling data and a hedonic price model (using both OLS and quantile regressions), in the first stage, we estimate the shadow price of the location of dwellings. In the second stage, we analyse the impact of crime perception, after controlling for other district characteristics such as local public spending and immigration, on this locational valuation. After accounting for the possible endogeneity of crime and housing prices, our findings suggest that crime exerts relevant costs beyond its direct costs. Indeed, a one standard deviation increase in perceived security is associated with a 0.57 % increase in the valuation of districts. Moreover, in districts perceived as being less safe than the average for the City of Barcelona, houses are highly discounted. Less safe districts have on average a valuation that is 1.27 % lower.","[Buonanno, Paolo] Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy; [Montolio, Daniel] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Montolio, Daniel] Barcelona Inst Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Maria Raya-Vilchez, Josep] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Escola Univ Maresme, Dept Econ & Empresa, Barcelona 08005, Spain",University of Bergamo; University of Barcelona; Pompeu Fabra University,"Montolio, D (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Av Diagonal 690 Torre 4 Planta 2, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",montolio@ub.edu,"Raya, Josep Maria/AAR-7073-2020; Buonanno, Paolo/O-1949-2019; Montolio, Daniel/F-1204-2016","Raya, Josep Maria/0000-0002-2885-234X; Buonanno, Paolo/0000-0001-8838-3904;",,,,,43,39,52,2,45,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In-sample analysis establishes that in all countries the covariance matrix is time-varying and reacts stronger to bad than to good news. Using a realistic out-of-sample exercise, we find that portfolios selected with a forecasted dynamic covariance matrix are less risky than portfolios constructed with the static matrix. However, benefits of using the dynamic covariance matrix for active portfolio management are mostly offset by rebalancing cost. Passive buy-and-hold investors benefit, because the forecasted dynamic covariance matrix provides better risk assessment.","[Peng, Liang] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Schulz, Rainer] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Aberdeen,"Schulz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Edward Wright Bldg,Dunbar St, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.",liang.peng@colorado.edu; r.schulz@abdn.ac.uk,,"Schulz, Rainer/0009-0000-5741-9070",,,,,46,5,6,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Because of this, governments have decided to accompany the deregulation process with the adoption of subsidy schemes aimed at mitigating the anticipated consequences to low-demand regions. The subsidy scheme adopted in the European Union is known as the Public Service Obligations (PSO) system. In this paper, we propose a decision approach to assist governments (aviation authorities) in the setting of PSO standards consistent with the budget available to finance their implementation. The approach is based on an integrated flight scheduling and fleet assignment model to determine the air transportation network that minimizes the total social costs of satisfying a given origin/destination target demand. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated with an application to the network of the Azores, one of the main European networks fully operated according to the PSO system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects on workplace injuries of different configurations of OHS voice (negotiation, consultation, information or none'), as mapped by the perceptions of both management and unions in the same workplace, are explored using the British Workplace Employment Relations Survey 2004. The findings indicate that some participation is better than none, that more inclusive voice configurations are better than those that are less inclusive and that the alignment of voice between management and unions is fundamental to success. The impact of less inclusive participation is also found to be conditioned by the extent of trade union membership in the workplace.","[Robinson, Andrew M.] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Smallman, Clive] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",University of Leeds; Western Sydney University,"Robinson, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",amr@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,19,20,0,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

By focusing on runways at commercial airports, we estimate the impact of reducing congestion that sets in and takeoffs and landings as air activity nears the technical limit for safe operations. Both the number of runways and the maximum length of runway available at a given airport correlate positively with real gross metropolitan product with a negative cross product between the two, suggesting a trade-off between the number of flights possible and the size of the aircraft that can use the airport. Additional analysis examines the impact of additional runways on other measures of economic activity.","[Tittle, Derek; McCarthy, Patrick; Xiao, Yuxi] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, Ivan Allen Coll Liberal Arts, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Tittle, D (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, 221 Bobby Dodd Way, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",derek.tittle@econ.gatech.edu,,,,,,,15,14,18,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We prove that in the absence of externalities, the grand cartel forms in equilibrium, allowing ring members to gain the auctioned object for a minimal price. However, identity-dependent externalities may lead to the formation of small rings, as often observed in practice. Potential ring members may condition their participation on high transfer payments as a compensation for their expected (negative) externalities if the ring forms. The cartel may therefore profitably exclude these bidders, although risking tougher competition in the auction. We also analyze ring (in)efficiency in the presence of externalities, showing that a ring may prefer sending an inefficient member to the auction, if the efficient member exerts threatening externalities on bidders outside the ring, which in turn leads to a higher winning price.","Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, F-75775 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Biran, O (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris, France.",omer.biran@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,0,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2013,75.0,1,,,,,117.0,136,,10.1007/s11238-012-9330-7,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,179KV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321520100008,0

This paper demonstrates how training premiums (fees) complemented the formal legal framework surrounding apprenticeship to secure training contracts. Premiums varied in response to scarcity rents, the expected productivity of masters and apprentices, and served as compensation for the anticipated risk of default. In most trades premiums were small enough to allow access to apprenticeship training for youths from modest families. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

First, considering symmetric regions and simultaneous move tax competition, we demonstrate that the competing regions can restrict 'race-to-the-bottom' in tax rates by deviating away from social welfare to net tax revenue. Moreover, it is optimal for a region to be fully revenue oriented even if that region's ultimate goal is to maximize social welfare, irrespective of whether the rival region is concerned about social welfare or net tax revenue. Next, we show that these results go through under production asymmetry and under sequential/simultaneous choice of public investment and tax rate in the case of two-dimensional competition. However, in the case of Stackelberg type competition, it is optimal for the leader region not to deviate from its ultimate goal, while the follower region always gains from being fully revenue oriented.

Is the effectiveness of reforms constrained by a country's distance from the technology frontier or by its institutional environment? This paper takes a new and comprehensive look at these questions by employing a novel data set that includes several kinds of real (trade, agriculture, and networks) and financial (domestic finance, banking, securities, and capital account) reforms for an extensive list of developed and developing countries, going back to the early 1970s. First-pass evidence based on growth breaks analysis and on panel growth regressions suggests that on average, both real and financial sector reforms are positively associated with higher growth. However, on several occasions, botched reforms resulted in growth disasters. More important, the positive reform-growth relationship is shown to be highly heterogeneous and to be influenced by a country's constraints on the authority of the executive power and by its distance from the technology frontier. Finally, there is some evidence that crises, defined as severe growth downturns, are associated with subsequent reform upticks.","[Prati, Alessandro; Papageorgiou, Chris] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Papageorgiou, C (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,46,43,47,1,31,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Here, we tested hypotheses about positive relationship between wealth, height and several measures of RS in an indigenous, traditional society from West Papua. The study was conducted among the Yali tribe in a few small, isolated mountain villages. In this tribe, a man's wealth is measured by the number of pigs he possesses. We found that wealth was related to fertility and number of living children, but not to child mortality in both men and women. Additionally, child mortality increased with the number of children in a family. Finally, we did not observe any relationship between height and reproductive success measures or wealth. We provide several possible explanations of our results and also put forward hypothetical background for further studies of indigenous populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
