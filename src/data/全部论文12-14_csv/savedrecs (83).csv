We show that the expected price in the first round is strictly lower than that in the second round due to the extraction effect. We then compare the revenues for the sequential auctions and the simultaneous auctions. We show that the discriminatory auction, the Vickrey auction, and the sequential second-price auctions generate the same revenue for the seller, followed in order by the sequential first-price auctions, and by the uniform-price auction.

In this article, we present a list of 10 specific issues that we argue pose specific methodological challenges that require careful consideration when designing and conducting robust model-based economic evaluations in the context of personalized medicine. Key issues are related to the correct framing of the research question, interpretation of test results, data collection of medical management options after obtaining test results, and expressing the value of tests. the need to formulate the research question clearly and be explicit and specific about the technology being evaluated is essential because various test kits can have the same purpose and yet differ in predictive value, costs, and relevance to practice and patient populations. The correct reporting of sensitivity/specificity, and especially the false negatives and false positives (which are population dependent), of the investigated tests is also considered as a key element. This requires additional structural complexity to establish the relationship between the test result and the consecutive treatment changes and outcomes. This process involves translating the test characteristics into clinical utility, and therefore outlining the clinical and economic consequences of true and false positives and true and false negatives. Information on treatment patterns and on their costs and outcomes, however, is often lacking, especially for false-positive and false-negative test results. The analysis can even become very complex if different tests are combined or sequentially used This potential complexity can be handled by explicitly showing how these tests are going to be used in practice and then working with the combined sensitivities and specificities of the tests. Each of these issues leads to a higher degree of uncertainty in economic models designed to assess the added value of personalized medicine compared with their simple pharmaceutical counterparts. To some extent, these problems can be overcome by performing early population-level simulations, which can lead to the identification and collection of data on critical input parameters. Finally, it is important to understand that a test strategy does not necessarily lead to more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). it is possible that the test will lead to not only fewer QALYs but also fewer costs, which can be defined as decremental cost per QALYs. Different decision criteria are needed to interpret such results.","[Annemans, Lieven] Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Redekop, Ken] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England",Ghent University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Manchester,"Annemans, L (通讯作者)，Univ Brussels, Univ Ghent, Pintelaan 185 Blok A,2nd Floor, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",lieven.annemans@ugent.be,"Redekop, Ken/AAA-2423-2020; Nasarian, Elham/ISB-6863-2023; Payne, Katherine/AAJ-3728-2020","Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350; Redekop, Ken/0000-0001-9538-4083",,,,,27,60,62,0,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,S,,,S20,S26,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.008,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CS,24034308.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325467800005,0

Informality did increase by 1.7% for less educated workers, but the wage gains for workers who switch between the formal and the informal sector were not significantly affected.

Even rarer is self-reported survey information that helps explain this variation in large samples. In this paper, we link a cross-sectional survey of 267188 Australians age 45 and over to a panel dataset of annual healthcare costs calculated from several years of hospital, medical and pharmaceutical records. We use this data to distinguish between cost variations due to health shocks and those that are intrinsic (fixed) to an individual over three years. We find that high fixed expenditures are positively associated with age, especially older males, poor health, obesity, smoking, cancer, stroke and heart conditions. Being foreign born, speaking a foreign language at home and low income are more strongly associated with higher time-varying expenditures, suggesting greater exposure to adverse health shocks.

Methods: The Psoriasis Symptom Diary was administered in a phase 2 clinical trial of AIN457 to US adult outpatients (N = 172) with physician-diagnosed moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. Participant compliance with daily diary administration and item score variability, reliability, construct and discriminant validity, sensitivity to change, and interpretation were all evaluated. Results: Participants completed 94% of scheduled diary assessments across 12 study weeks. Diary items were generally normally distributed, and no floor or ceiling effects were observed. Item reliability (reproducibility) was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.80), with an exception for one item (skin color). At week 12, items significantly related to criterion measures as predicted (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index r = 0.27-0.57; Investigator's Global Assessment r = 0.25-0.59), with the exception of items that measured skin color and difficulty using hands. Most items generated change scores that were synchronous to changes as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, Investigator's Global Assessment, Dermatology Life Quality Index (r > 0.37), as well as the Patient Global Impression of Change. Responders experienced a 2- to 3-point and 3- to 5-point change in item scores for minimal and large improvements, respectively. Four items that did not perform well were dropped from the diary. Conclusions: The 16-item Psoriasis Symptom Diary demonstrated favorable psychometric properties and is a brief, useful tool for measuring patient based symptoms and the impact of chronic plaque psoriasis.","[Strober, Bruce E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Dermatol, Farmington, CT USA; [Nyirady, Judit; Mallya, Usha G.; Guettner, Achim; Papavassilis, Charis] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Gottlieb, Alice B.] Tufts Med Ctr, Dept Dermatol, Boston, MA USA; [Elewski, Boni E.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL USA; [Turner-Bowker, Diane M.; Gwaltney, Chad J.] ERT, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Shields, Alan L.] Adelphi Values, Boston, MA USA; [Lebwohl, Mark] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Dermatol, New York, NY USA",University of Connecticut; Novartis; Tufts Medical Center; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Turner-Bowker, DM (通讯作者)，18 Lori Ellen Dr, Smithfield, RI 02917 USA.",Diane.Turner-Bowker@ert.com,"Strober, Bruce/AAQ-6953-2020","Strober, Bruce/0000-0002-8394-2057; Turner-Bowker, Diane/0000-0002-8491-5704","Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ","Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ","Source of financial support: These findings are the result of the work supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ.",,38,21,22,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,1014,1022,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.07.002,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041351.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700012,0

Preferences favoring an improvement of the sampling distribution in univariate or bivariate first-order stochastic dominance are those exhibiting additive or cross risk apportionment. The univariate additive and multiplicative risk apportionment concepts are then related to the notion of bivariate cross risk apportionment by viewing the single-attribute utility function of an aggregate position (sum or product of attributes) as a 2-attribute utility function. The results derived in the present paper allow one to further explore the connections between the different concepts of risk apportionment proposed so far in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by the classical cases of Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and Geometric Mean Reversion (GMR), we consider processes of similar functional form, but with Heston stochastic volatility replacing the constant volatility in the classical models. We refer to these processes as Heston-GBM and Heston-GMR. For these cases we derive asymptotic solutions for the investment timing problem using the methodology introduced by Fouque et al. (2000). In particular we show that compared to the classical cases with constant volatility, the question of whether additional stochastic volatility increases or decreases the investment threshold depends on the instantaneous correlation between the project value and the stochastic volatility. For the case of Heston-GBM we provide a closed form expression that measures this effect quantitatively; for the case of Heston-GMR we derive the sign of the effect analytically, using a type of maximum principle for ODEs.

Methods: TWo meta-analysis models were fitted to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of Wells score and Ddimer in combination. The first model assumes that the two tests perform independently of one another; thus, two separate meta-analyses were fitted to the Ddimer and Wells score data and then combined. The second model allows for any performance dependency of the two tests by incorporating published data on the accuracy of Ddimer stratified by Wells score, as well as studies of Ddimer alone and Wells score alone. The results from the two meta-analysis models were input into a decision model to assess the impact that assumptions regarding performance dependency have on the overall cost-effectiveness of the tests. Results: The results highlight the importance of accounting for potential performance dependency when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tests used in combination. In our example, assuming the diagnostic performance of the two tests to be independent resulted in the strategy Wells score moderate/high risk treated for DVT and Wells score low risk tested further with Ddimer being identified as the most cost-effective at the (sic)20,000 willingness-to-pay threshold (probability cost-effective 0.8). However, when performance dependency is modeled, the most cost-effective strategies were Ddimer alone and Wells score low/moderate risk discharged and Wells score high risk further tested with Ddimer (probability cost-effective 0.4). Conclusions: When evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tests used in combination, failure to account for diagnostic performance dependency may lead to erroneous results and non-optimal decision making.","[Novielli, Nicola; Cooper, Nicola J.; Sutton, Alexander J.] Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Cooper, NJ (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",njc21@le.ac.uk,,"Novielli, Nicola/0000-0001-9314-7092; Sutton, Alexander/0000-0002-8934-9940",Department of Health Sciences at the University of Leicester,Department of Health Sciences at the University of Leicester,The project was funded by a studentship from the Department of Health Sciences at the University of Leicester.,,17,14,16,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,536,541,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.02.015,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796287.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900012,0

Diarrhea is considered to be the second leading cause of under-five mortality in developing countries. About one out of five deaths is caused by diarrhea. In this paper, we use the newly available data set District Level Household Survey 3 to quantify the impact of access to improved sanitation on diarrheal morbidity for children less than 5years of age in India. Using propensity score matching, we find that access to improved sanitation reduces the risk of contracting diarrhea by 2.2 percentage points. There is considerable heterogeneity in the impacts of improved sanitation. We find statistically insignificant treatment effects for children in low or middle socioeconomic status households and for girls; however, boys and children in high socioeconomic status households experienced economically significant treatment effects. The magnitude of the treatment effect differs largely by hygiene behavior.

I compare social distancing incentives and outcomes under decentralized, full control social planner, and constrained social planner, without health class specific control, decision making scenarios. Constrained social planner decision making, based on non-health class specific controls, can in some instances make society worse off than decentralized decision making (i.e. no intervention).

Methods: An an area under the curve cost-effectiveness model was developed. The clinical effectiveness evidence for both cetuximab and panitumumab was taken from a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) in each case and for cetuximab plus irinotecan from several sources. Results: Patients are predicted to survive for approximately 6 months on BSC, 8.5 months on panitumumab, 10 months on cetuximab, and 16.5 months on cetuximab plus irinotecan. Panitumumab is dominated, and cetuximab is extended dominated. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of (sic)95,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was estimated for cetuximab versus BSC and is likely to be relatively accurate, because the relevant clinical evidence is taken from a high-quality RCT. The estimated ICER for panitumumab versus BSC, at (sic)187,000 per QALY, is less certain due to assumptions in the adjustment for the substantial crossing-over of patients in the RCT. The ICER for cetuximab plus irinotecan versus BSC, at (sic)88,000 per QALY, is least certain due to substantial uncertainty about progression-free survival, treatment duration, and overall survival. Nonetheless, when key parameters are varied within plausible ranges, all three treatments always remain poor value for money. Conclusions: All three treatments are highly unlikely to be considered cost-effective in this patient population in the United Kingdom. We explain how the reader can adapt the model for other countries.","[Hoyle, Martin; Peters, Jaime; Crathorne, Louise; Jones-Hughes, Tracey; Cooper, Chris; Hyde, Chris] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Napier, Mark] Royal Devon & Exeter Hosp, Exeter EX2 5DW, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Hoyle, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Peninsula Technol Assessment Grp PenTAG, Sch Med, Veysey Bldg,Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England.",martin.hoyle@pms.ac.uk,"Hyde, Christopher/HTQ-3128-2023; Cooper, Chris/C-9318-2012","Hoyle, Martin/0000-0001-5593-9777; Crathorne, Louise/0000-0001-8018-517X; Christopher, Hyde/0000-0002-7349-0616; Cooper, Chris/0000-0003-0864-5607",NICE [10/11],NICE,"The research was carried out under contract to the UK NHS Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme.

Methods: A cost-utility analysis was undertaken for duloxetine and seven oral post-first-line comparators, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), weak and strong opioids, and an anticonvulsant. We created a Markov model on the basis of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence model documented in its 2008 osteoarthritis clinical guidelines. Health states included treatment, death, and 12 states associated with serious adverse events (AEs). We estimated treatment-specific utilities by carrying out a meta-analysis of pain scores from CLBP clinical trials and developing a transfer-to-utility equation using duloxetine CLBP patient-level data. Probabilities of AEs were taken from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence model or estimated from osteoarthritis clinical trials by using a novel maximum-likelihood simulation technique. Costs were gathered from Red Book, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database, the literature, and, for a limited number of inputs, expert opinion. The model performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost acceptability curves. Results: The model estimated an ICER of $59,473 for duloxetine over naproxen. ICERs under $30,000 were estimated for duloxetine over non-NSAIDs, with duloxetine dominating all strong opioids. In subpopulations at a higher risk of NSAID-related AEs, the ICER over naproxen was $33,105 or lower.

These unprecedented changes are moving faster than economic growth and threaten universal health coverage. What is at stake nowadays is governments' and healthcare systems' ability to renovate themselves and develop new paradigms aimed at finding innovative solutions to manage the new global forces so to maintain universal access to care in a changing environment. We have to be imaginative because if we keep relying on current paradigms to answer already too far-ahead complex problems, we will fail. And here education has a role to play. Although the recent years have seen a steep increase in the offerings of post-graduate management education programs in health and healthcare, the majority of these programs are still traditionally conceived and designed, aiming to train students to deal with specific, domestic, current problems. With the promise of making students the best specialists on Earth, to get the highest return on his or her investment in education, the performance of these programs is often measured in terms of earnings maximization. Although an indicator of success, this often incentivizes individuals to be context-based, individualistic, short-sighted and self-focused. Education has the greatest potential to foster imagination, to leverage diversity, to exploit team-working and free creative thinking. Education can substantially contribute to anticipate the impact of global forces by but an endeavor is needed to design programs and measures performances differently.

This quantity has been proposed as a measure of economic polarization between two groups, Anderson (2004) and Anderson et al. (2010). In ecology it has been used to measure the overlap of species. We give the asymptotic distribution theory of our estimator, which in some cases of practical relevance is nonstandard due to a boundary value problem. We also propose a method for conducting inference based on estimation of unknown quantities in the limiting distribution and show that our method yields consistent inference in all cases we consider. We investigate the finite sample properties of our methods by simulation methods. We give an application to the study of polarization within China in recent years using household survey data from two provinces taken in 1987 and 2001. We Find a big increase in polarization between 1987 and 2001 according to monetary outcomes but less change in terms of living space. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that minimization of a Generalized Method of Moments criterion yields inconsistent estimators of the break fractions, but minimization of the Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) criterion yields consistent estimators of these parameters. We develop a methodology for estimation and inference of the parameters of the model based on 2SLS. The analysis covers the cases where the reduced form is either stable or unstable. The methodology is illustrated via an application to the New Keynesian Phillips Curve for the US. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the existence of equilibrium networks called Nash networks in the non-cooperative two-way flow model by Bala and Goyal (2000a,b) in the presence of partner heterogeneity. First, we show through an example that Nash networks in pure strategies do not always exist in such model. We then impose restrictions on the payoff function to find conditions under which Nash networks always exist. We provide two properties-increasing differences and convexity in the first argument of the payoff function that ensure the existence of Nash networks. Note that the commonly used linear payoff function satisfies these two properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier By.

A voting rule is self-selective if it chooses itself when it is also used in choosing the voting rule. A set of voting rules is said to be stable if it contains at least one self-selective voting rule at each profile of preferences on voting rules. We consider in this paper a society which makes a choice from a set of three alternatives (a, b, c) and a set of the three well-known scoring voting rules{Borda, Plurality, Antiplurality}. We will derive an a priori probability for the stability of this triplet of voting rules, under the Impartial Anonymous Culture assumption (IAC). In order to solve this problem, we need to specify Ehrhart polynomials, which count the number of integer points inside a (convex) polytope. We discuss briefly a recent algorithmic solution to this method before applying it. We also discuss the impact of different behavioral assumptions for the voters (consequentialist or nonconsequentialist) on the probability of stability for the triplet {Borda, Plurality, Antiplurality}.

Access to questionnaires and diaries, however, is often limited. This study examined the feasibility of establishing an open-access Database of Instruments for Resource-Use Measurement, identified relevant fields for data extraction, and outlined its design. Methods: An electronic survey was sent to authors of full UK economic evaluations listed in the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (2008-2010), authors of monographs of Health Technology Assessments (1998-2010), and subscribers to the JISCMail health economics e-mailing list. The survey included questions on piloting, validation, recall period, and data capture method. Responses were analyzed and data extracted to generate relevant fields for the database. Results: A total of 143 responses to the survey provided data on 54 resource-use instruments for inclusion in the database. All were reliant on patient or carer recall, and a majority (47) were questionnaires. Thirty-seven were designed for self-completion by the patient, carer, or guardian, and the remainder were designed for completion by researchers or health care professionals while interviewing patients. Methods of development were diverse, particularly in areas such as the planning of resource itemization (evident in 25 instruments), piloting (25), and validation (29). Conclusion: On the basis of the present analysis, we developed a Web-enabled Database of Instruments for Resource-Use Measurement, accessible via www.DIRUM.org. This database may serve as a practical resource for health economists, as well as a means to facilitate further research in the area of resource-use data collection.","[Ridyard, Colin H.; Hughes, Dyfrig A.; DIRUM Team] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Inst Med & Social Care Res, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Inst Med & Social Care Res, Dean St, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459; Coast, Joanna/0000-0002-3537-5166; Knapp, Martin/0000-0003-1427-0215; Whitehurst, David/0000-0002-7890-6756; Noble, Sian/0000-0002-8011-0722; Hollingworth, William/0000-0002-0840-6254","Network of Hubs for Trial Methodology Research (MRC); Medical Research Council, as part of the North West Hub for Trial Methodology Research; MRC [G0800800, G0800792] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [UD99999939, G0800800, G0800792] Funding Source: researchfish","Network of Hubs for Trial Methodology Research (MRC); Medical Research Council, as part of the North West Hub for Trial Methodology Research; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","DIRUM team: Professor Dyfrig Hughes and Dr. Colin Ridyard (Bangor University), Dr. William Hollingworth, Dr. Sian Noble, and Dr. Joanna Thorn (University of Bristol), Professor Joanna Coast (University of Birmingham), Dr. David Whitehurst (University of British Columbia), and Professor Martin Knapp (London School of Economics and Political Science).

The objective of this study was to develop values sets for the EQ-5D-5L by means of a mapping (cross-walk) approach to the currently available three-level version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) values sets. Methods: The EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L descriptive systems were coadministered to respondents with conditions of varying severity to ensure a broad range of levels of health across EQ-5D questionnaire dimensions. We explored four models to generate value sets for the EQ-5D-5L: linear regression, nonparametric statistics, ordered logistic regression, and item-response theory. Criteria for the preferred model included theoretical background, statistical fit, predictive power, and parsimony. Results: A total of 3691 respondents were included. All models had similar fit statistics. Predictive power was slightly better for the nonparametric and ordered logistic regression models. In considering all criteria, the nonparametric model was selected as most suitable for generating values for the EQ-5D-5L. Conclusions: The nonparametric model was preferred for its simplicity while performing similarly to the other models. Being independent of the value set that is used, it can be applied to transform any EQ-5D-3L value set into EQ-5D-5L index values. Strengths of this approach include compatibility with three-level value sets. A limitation of any crosswalk is that the range of index values is restricted to the range of the EQ-5D-3L value sets.","[Pickard, A.

This paper explores issues associated with developing attributes for DCEs and contrasts different qualitative approaches. The paper draws on eight studies, four developed attributes for measures, and four developed attributes for more ad hoc policy questions. Issues that have become apparent through these studies include the following: the theoretical framework for random utility theory and the need for attributes that are neither too close to the latent construct nor too intrinsic to people's personality; the need to think about attribute development as a two-stage process involving conceptual development followed by refinement of language to convey the intended meaning; and the difficulty in resolving tensions inherent in the reductiveness of condensing complex and nuanced qualitative findings into precise terms. The comparison of alternative qualitative approaches suggests that the nature of data collection will depend both on the characteristics of the question (its sensitivity, for example) and the availability of existing qualitative information. An iterative, constant comparative approach to analysis is recommended. Finally, the paper provides a series of recommendations for improving the reporting of this element of DCE studies.

No direct comparisons, however, are available for indacaterol 150 mu g with formoterol or indacaterol 300 mu g with salmeterol. Indacaterol trial evidence was synthesized to provide coherent estimates of indacaterol 150 mu g and indacaterol 300 mu g relative to formoterol, salmeterol, and tiotropium. Methods: Four randomized controlled trials were combined with Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons by using individual patient-level data. End points of interest were trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and response (>= 4 points), and Transition Dyspnea Index total score and response (>= 1 point). Results: Indacaterol 150 mu g demonstrated a higher FEV1 than did formoterol at 12 weeks and 6 months (0.10 L difference; 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.06-0.14), as did indacaterol 300 mu g versus salmeterol (0.06 L difference at 12 weeks; CrI = 0.02-0.10; 0.06 L at 6 months; CrI = 0.02-0.11). Regarding SGRQ, indacaterol 150 mu g demonstrated a comparable proportion of responders versus formoterol, as did indacaterol 300 mu g versus salme-terol. In comparison to tiotropium, indacaterol 150 mu g demonstrated a greater proportion of responders (odds ratio = 1.52 at 12 weeks; CrI 1.15-2.00). For Transition Dyspnea Index, indacaterol 150 mu g and formoterol showed a similar response. Indacaterol 300 mu g was more efficacious than salmeterol (odds ratio = 1.65 at 12 weeks; CrI 1.16-2.34). Overall, indacaterol 150 mu g showed the greatest efficacy for SGRQ and indacaterol 300 mu g for FEV1 and Transition Dyspnea Index. Conclusion: Indacaterol is expected to be comparable to formoterol, salmeterol, and tiotropium, providing higher FEV1 than formoterol and salmeterol and greater improvement in the SGRQ total score than tiotropium. Indacaterol 150 mu g provided comparable improvement in dyspnea, while indacaterol 300 mu g demonstrated the greatest response overall.","[Cope, Shannon; Jansen, Jeroen P.] MAPI Consultancy, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Capkun-Niggli, Gorana] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Gale, Rupert; Lassen, Cheryl; Owen, Roger] Novartis Horsham Res Ctr, Horsham, W Sussex, England; [Ouwens, Mario J.

Increasing competitive pressure is therefore likely to force management to work harder to reach optimal profits. Another hypothesis, which also relates market power to efficiency is the efficient structure hypothesis (ESH) by Demsetz (1973). ESH argues that firms with superior efficiencies or technologies have lower costs and therefore higher profits. These firms are assumed to gain larger market shares which lead to higher concentration. Ignoring the efficiency levels of the firms in a market power model might cause both estimation and interpretation problems. Unfortunately, the literature on market power measurement largely ignores this relationship. In the context of a dynamic setting, we estimate the market power of US airlines in two city-pairs by both allowing inefficiencies of the firms and not allowing inefficiencies of the firms. Using industry level cost data, we estimate the cost function parameters and time-varying efficiencies. An instrumental variables version of the square root Kalman filter is used to estimate time-varying conduct parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We consider games with demand rationing schemes ranging from efficient to proportional rationing. In all cases, there is a subgame perfect equilibrium outcome coinciding with the outcome of the Cournot game with demand uncertainty if and only if (i) the fluctuation in absolute market size is small relative to the cost of capacity, or (ii) uncertainty is such that with high probability the market demand is very large and with the remaining probability the market demand is extremely small. Otherwise, equilibria involve mixed strategies. Further, we show under efficient rationing that condition (i) is sufficient for the unique equilibrium outcome to be an equilibrium outcome of the Cournot game with demand uncertainty.

By examining data obtained from Taiwan and focusing on diabetic patients, we use a new class of drugs, namely, thiazolidinediones, as an example to investigate the effect on health expenditure of prescribing new drugs to patients by focusing on the impact of treatment substitution and treatment expansion. Overall, our results indicate that the introduction of new drugs mainly impacts the outpatient drug expenditure and does not give rise to any offsetting effect on other outpatient and inpatient health expenditures. This suggests that the adoption of pharmaceutical innovation in treating diabetic patients is expenditure-increasing. In addition, we find evidence that the treatment substitution channel has a more significant impact on the level of health expenditure than the treatment expansion channel. An important policy implication for our finding is that the justification for increasing health expenditure on the treatment of diabetes is not conditional upon a lowering in the demand for other types of health-care services. By contrast, it is conditional upon the increased health benefits per se.

The objective of this study was to provide specific guidance to analysts on the methods for the conduct of high-quality economic evaluations in oncology by building on the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health Guidelines for the Economic Evaluation of Health Technologies (third edition). Methods: Fifteen oncologists, health economists, health services researchers, and decision makers from across Canada identified sections in Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health guidelines that would benefit from oncology-specific guidance. Fifteen sections of the guidelines were reviewed to determine whether 1) Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health guidelines were sufficient for the conduct of oncology economic evaluations without further guidance specific for oncology products or 2) additional guidance was necessary. A scoping review was conducted by using a comprehensive and replicable search to identify relevant literature to inform recommendations. Recommendations were reviewed by representatives of academia, government, and the pharmaceutical industry in an iterative and formal review of the recommendations. Results: Major adaptations for guidance related to time horizon, effectiveness, modeling, costs, and resources were required. Recommendations around the use of final outcomes over intermediate outcomes to calculate quality-adjusted life-years and life-years gained, the type of evidence, the source of evidence, and the use of time horizon and modeling were made. Conclusions: This article summarizes key recommendations for the conduct of economic evaluations in oncology and describes methods required to ensure that economic assessments in oncology are conducted in a standardized manner.","[Mittmann, Nicole; Isogai, Pierre K.] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Hlth Outcomes & PharmacoEcon HOPE Res Ctr, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada; [Mittmann, Nicole; Evans, William K.; Au, Heather-Jane; Leighl, Natasha B.; Peacock, Stuart] Comm Econ Anal, NCIC Clin Trials Grp, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Mittmann, Nicole] Univ Toronto, Dept Pharmacol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Longo, Christopher J.] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Rocchi, Angela] Axia Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Au, Heather-Jane] Cross Canc Inst, Edmonton, AB T6G 1Z2, Canada; [Husereau, Don] CADTH, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Husereau, Don; Coyle, Doug] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Leighl, Natasha B.] Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Hosp, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Krahn, Murray D.] Univ Toronto, Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment Collaborat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Peacock, Stuart; Taylor, Suzanne C.

Our estimation procedure is based on the decomposition of the nonparametric part of the regression function into homogeneous and integrable components. It consists of two steps: In the first step we parameterize and fit the homogeneous component of the nonparametric part by the nonlinear least squares with other parametric terms in the model, and use in the second step the standard kernel method to nonparametrically estimate the integrable component of the nonparametric part from the residuals in the first step. We establish consistency and obtain the asymptotic distribution of our estimator. A simulation shows that our estimator performs well in finite samples. For the empirical illustration, we estimate the money demand functions for the US and Japan using our model and methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We wanted to explore potential learning effects when using the TTO method, that is, whether the valuations were affected by the number of previously rated health states (the sequence number). Methods: We included 3773 respondents from the US EQ-5D valuation study, each of whom valued 12 health states (plus unconscious) in random order. With linear regression, we used sequence number to predict mean and standard deviations across all health states. We repeated the analysis separately for TTO responses indicating a state better than death and a state worse than death. Each TTO value requires a specific number of choice iterations. To test whether respondents used fewer iterations with experience, we used linear regression with sequence number as the independent variable and number of iterations as the dependent variable. Results: Mean TTO values were fairly stable across the sequence number, but analyzing state better than death and state worse than death values separately revealed a tendency toward more extreme values: state better than death values increased by 0.02, while state worse than death values decreased by 0.21 (P < 0.0001) over the full sequence. The standard deviations increased slightly, while the number of choice iterations was the same over the sequence number. The findings were stable across the levels of health state severity, age, and sex. Conclusions: TTO values become more extreme with increasing experience. Because of the randomized valuation order, these effects do not bias specific health states; however, they reduce the overall validity and reliability of TTO values.","[Augestad, Liv Ariane; Rand-Hendriksen, Kim; Stavem, Knut] Akershus Univ Hosp, Hlth Serv Res Ctr, N-1478 Lorenskog, Norway; [Kristiansen, Ivar Sonbo] Univ Oslo, Inst Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Stavem, Knut] Akershus Univ Hosp, Dept Pulm Med, N-1478 Lorenskog, Norway; [Stavem, Knut] Univ Oslo, Akershus Univ Hosp, Fac Div, Fac Med, Lorenskog, Norway",University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Oslo,"Augestad, LA (通讯作者)，Akershus Univ Hosp, Hlth Serv Res Ctr, N-1478 Lorenskog, Norway.",liv.ariane.augestad@ahus.no,"Kristiansen, Ivar Sonbo/JXN-7976-2024","Rand, Kim/0000-0001-7692-4099; Augestad, Liv Ariane/0000-0003-3330-5081",Norwegian Research Council; South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority,This study was indirectly financed through two PhD grants from the Norwegian Research Council and from the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority.

Methods: A three state Markov model derived from the medical literature was developed to estimate the comparative cost-effectiveness of three CTPs in relation to VLU standard care. CTPs evaluated in the study included extracellular matrix (ECM), human skin equivalent (HSE), and living skin equivalent (LSE). The three Markov states included unhealed, healed, and death. A 1-year time horizon was used to determine the number of ulcer-free weeks and the expected costs of therapies. The payer perspective was taken in the analysis and only the direct costs of care were considered. Sensitivity analyses were performed to gauge model parameter uncertainty. Results: The expected costs for standard care, ECM, HSE, and LSE VLU therapy were $6,132, $6,732, $10,638, and $11,237, while the expected outcomes were 24, 31, 29, and 27 ulcer free weeks, respectively. ECM was economically dominant among the three CTPs. In the base case of ECM versus standard care, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ECM therapy was $86 per ulcer-free week. Sensitivity analysis did not alter ECM dominance. Clinic visits and home health utilization exhibited the greatest influence on cost Conclusions: ECM is the most cost-effective CTP when used in the management of VLUs as an adjunct to standard care. These findings suggest that VLU standard care therapy with ECM can yield potential cost savings and produce better outcomes than do other CTPs.","[Carter, Marissa J.] Strateg Solut Inc, Cody, WY USA; [Waycaster, Curtis; Schaum, Kathleen; Gilligan, Adrienne M.] Smith & Nephew, Ft Worth, TX 76107 USA",Smith & Nephew,"Waycaster, C (通讯作者)，Smith & Nephew, 3909 Hulen St, Ft Worth, TX 76107 USA.",Curtis.Waycaster@smith-nephew.com,,,"Health-point Biotherapeutics, Fort Worth, TX, USA","Health-point Biotherapeutics, Fort Worth, TX, USA","This study was funded by Health-point Biotherapeutics, Fort Worth, TX, USA.",,52,29,31,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2014,17,8.0,,,,,801,813,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.08.001,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AX4RC,25498775.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346918100006,0

We link financial institution assessment to the actual impact on clients, rather than ratios and non-performing loans. We derive both consumption and investment equations from a common core theory with both risk and productive activities. The empirical specification follows closely from this theory and allows both OLS and IV estimation. We thus quantify the consumption and investment smoothing impact of financial institutions on households including those running farms and small businesses. A government development bank (BAAC) is shown to be particularly helpful in smoothing consumption and investment, in no small part through credit, consistent with its own operating system, which embeds an implicit insurance operation. Commercial banks are smoothing investment, largely through formal savings accounts. Other institutions seem ineffective by these metrics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show the existence of an equilibrium under fairly general conditions. We further demonstrate that the characterization of Pareto optimal allocation is significantly different from the classical situation, where all beliefs are Mutually equivalent for each agent. Absent aggregate uncertainty, we prove that with common beliefs among agents, any Pareto optimal allocation is a full insurance under the upper capacities for all agents. But the full insurance feature of all Pareto optimal allocations, if true, does not necessarily ensure common beliefs. Moreover, despite agents have sharing beliefs, a full insurance Pareto optimal allocation could be associated with intricate allocation form. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The backward-induction technique of Shaked and Sutton (1984, Econometrica) applies to the cyclical structure of SPE payoffs and provides recursive dynamics on the bounds of SPE payoffs. Acceptable and unacceptable offers have to be incorporated for these dynamics to be necessary and sufficient for extreme SPEs. In this paper, we demonstrate how these recursive dynamics are directly applicable to establish the existence of SPE in a model with no SSPE. Also from these dynamics, the extreme SPE strategy profiles can easily be recovered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The new weighting differs from those proposed in the literature in two important ways. First, this paper shows that estimators based on KS statistics with the proposed weighting function converge to the identified set at a faster rate than existing procedures based on bounded weight functions in a broad class of models. This provides a theoretical justification for inverse variance weighting in this context, and contrasts with analogous results for conditional moment equalities in which optimal weighting only affects the asymptotic variance. The results on rates of convergence of set estimators are the first such results even for the existing procedures, and involve developing the first general framework for determining consistency and rates of convergence for set estimators and confidence regions in this context.

We use administrative data that cover the full population of Ontario and nearly all the services provided by primary care physicians. We employ a difference-in-differences approach that controls for selection on observables and selection on unobservables that may cause estimation bias. We implement a set of robustness checks to control for confounding from other contemporaneous interventions of the primary care reform in Ontario. The results indicate that responses were modest and that physicians responded to the financial incentives for some services but not others. The results provide a cautionary message regarding the effectiveness of employing P4P to increase the quality of health care.

It has been prominently argued that economic development provides a natural interpretation of the growth in obesity. This paper tests the main aggregated predictions of the theoretical framework to analyze obesity. Average body weight and health inequality should be associated with economic development. Both hypotheses are confirmed: we find higher average female body weight in economically more advanced countries. In relatively nondeveloped countries, obesity is a phenomenon of the socioeconomic elite. With economic development, obesity shifts toward individuals with lower socioeconomic status.

In ascending auctions, bid distributions do not provide information about risk preference. We infer risk attitudes using distributions of transaction prices and participation decisions in ascending auctions with entry costs. Nonparametric tests are proposed for two distinct scenarios: first, the expected entry cost can be consistently estimated from the data; second, the data does not report entry costs but contains exogenous variation in potential competition and auction characteristics. We also show the identification of risk attitudes in ascending auctions with selective entry, where bidders receive entry-stage signals correlated with their values. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine whether statin treatment for primary prevention in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes is cost-effective, taking nonadherence, baseline risk, and age into account. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by using a Markov model with a time horizon of 10 years. The baseline 10-year cardiovascular risk was estimated in a Dutch population of primary prevention patients with newly diagnosed diabetes from the Groningen Initiative to Analyse Type 2 Diabetes Treatment (GIANTT) database, using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study risk engine. Statin adherence was measured as pill days covered in the IADB.nl pharmacy research database. Cost-effectiveness was measured in costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from the health care payers' perspective. Results: For an average patient aged 60 years, the base case, statin treatment was highly cost-effective at (sic)2245 per QALY. Favorable cost-effectiveness was robust in sensitivity analysis. Differences in age and 10-year cardiovascular risk showed large differences in cost-effectiveness from almost (sic)100,000 per QALY to almost being cost saving. Treating all patients younger than 45 years at diabetes diagnosis was not cost-effective (weighted cost-effectiveness of almost (sic)60,000 per QALY). Conclusions: Despite the nonadherence levels observed in actual practice, statin treatment is cost-effective for primary prevention in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Because of large differences in cost-effectiveness according to different risk and age groups, the efficiency of the treatment could be increased by targeting patients with relatively higher cardiovascular risk and higher ages.","[de Vries, Folgerdiena M.; Visser, Sipke T.; Hak, Eelko; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon PE2, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Denig, Petra] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Clin Pharm & Pharmacol, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"de Vries, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon PE2, A Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",F.M.de.Vries@rug.nl,"Denig, Petra/L-9865-2014","Denig, Petra/0000-0002-7929-4739; Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653",,,,,55,12,13,1,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2014,17,2.0,,,,,223,230,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.12.010,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AD6EB,24636380.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333346600009,0

There is a two way interaction between the economy and the disease: the incidence of the disease affects labor supply, and investment in health capital can affect the incidence and recuperation from the disease. Thus, both the disease incidence and the income levels are endogenous. The disease dynamics make the control problem non-convex thus usual optimal control results do not apply. We establish existence of an optimal solution, continuity of state variables, show directly that the Hamiltonian inequality holds thus establishing optimality of interior paths that satisfy necessary conditions, and of the steady states. There are multiple steady states and the local dynamics of the model are fully characterized. A disease-free steady state always exists, but it could be unstable. A disease-endemic steady state may exist, in which the optimal health expenditure can be positive or zero depending on the parameters of the model. The interaction of the disease and economic variables is non-linear and can be non-monotonic. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by this real-life phenomenon, we study the application fee overreporting incentives of hospitals in centralized matching markets by assuming that interns have finite budgets to spend on such fees. Our main theorem shows that no stable mechanism is immune to application fee manipulations. Interestingly, under any stable rule, hospitals might not only obtain better matchings but also increase their application fee revenues through overreporting their application fees. In the restricted domains in which either side has homogeneous preferences or each hospital has only one available position, every stable mechanism turns out to be immune to application fee overreportings.

First, national time series data have been used within a multivariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition framework to construct the permanent and cyclical components. The correlation analysis results for the cyclical components suggest that current public health expenditure is pro-cyclical while there is no clear evidence of a correlation between cycles in private health expenditure and in GDP growth. Next, using an instrumental variable method and the generalised method of moments estimator, provincial-level panel data analyses confirm pro-cyclical impacts of government spending on health. The provincial analysis also suggests that private health expenditure in urban China has a pro-cyclical association with GDP growth, but a lack of good instruments makes it difficult to identify a clear causal link between cycles in income growth and private health expenditure.

Yet any attempt to achieve universal coverage must focus on the uninsured, the vast majority of whom are not offered employer-sponsored insurance. In the summer of 2008, we conducted a survey experiment to assess the willingness to pay for a health plan among a large sample of uninsured Americans. The experiment yields price elasticities of around one, substantially greater than those found in most previous studies. We use these results to estimate coverage expansion under the Affordable Care Act, with and without an individual mandate. We estimate that 35 million uninsured individuals would gain coverage and find limited evidence of adverse selection.

Licensing of these alternative treatments was based on randomized controlled trials assessing complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months as primary end points. We use this case study to illustrate the validation of CCyR and MMR as surrogate outcomes for overall survival in CML and how this evidence was used to inform National Institute for Health and Care Excellences recommendation on the public funding of these first-line treatments for CML. Methods: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the association between CCyR and MMR at 12 months and overall survival in patients with chronic phase CML. We estimated life expectancy by extrapolating long-term survival from the weighted overall survival stratified according to the achievement of CCyR and MMR. Results: Five studies provided data on the observational association between CCyR or MMR and overall survival. Based on the pooled association between CCyR and MMR and overall survival, our modeling showed comparable predicted mean duration of survival (21-23 years) following first-line treatment with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib. Conclusions: This case study illustrates the consideration of surrogate outcome evidence in health technology assessment. Although it is often recommended that the acceptance of surrogate outcomes be based on randomized controlled trial data demonstrating an association between the treatment effect on both the surrogate outcome and the final outcome, this case study shows that policymakers may be willing to accept a lower level of evidence (i.e., observational association).","[Oriana, Ciani; Martin, Hoyle; Chris, Cooper; Rod, Taylor] Univ Exeter, PenTAG, Inst Hlth Serv Res, Sch Med, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Toby, Pavey] Univ Queensland, Sch Human Movement Studies, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ruth, Garside] Univ Exeter, European Ctr Environm & Human Hlth, Sch Med, Truro, England; [Claudius, Rudin] Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Fdn Trust, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Queensland; University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Oriana, C (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, PenTAG, Inst Hlth Serv Res, Sch Med, Veysey Bldg,Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England.",oriana.ciani@pcmd.ac.uk,"Pavey, Toby/HZK-6905-2023; CIANI, ORIANA/D-1455-2015; Cooper, Chris/C-9318-2012; Pavey, Toby/G-1299-2012","Hoyle, Martin/0000-0001-5593-9777; CIANI, ORIANA/0000-0002-3607-0508; Cooper, Chris/0000-0003-0864-5607; Pavey, Toby/0000-0002-4946-6683",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) health technology assessment program [08/226/01]; NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC); European Regional Development Fund; European Social Fund Convergence Programme,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) health technology assessment program(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC); European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); European Social Fund Convergence Programme,"Source of financial support: Ciani Oriana is currently receiving a Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry PhD studentship.

Utility scores of autism caregivers were compared with norms for the general adult US population. Predictors of health utility were identified. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey design was used. Caregivers registered with the Interactive Autism Network were approached for participation in the online survey. Three hundred and sixteen usable responses were received. Health utility among caregivers was calculated and compared with the US population norms by using Student's t test. Problems in EQ-5D questionnaire domains and utility scores were analyzed by study characteristics by using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance. Factors predicting health utility were identified by using ordinary least square regression. Results: Roughly 94% of the caregivers who participated in the study were females. As compared to their counterparts in the general US population, caregivers who were aged 18 to 44 years and were females had lower utility scores (P < 0.001). Significant differences in utility scores were observed among caregivers. When compared to males, females had lower health utility. Caregivers of lower socioeconomic status had lower utility scores and reported more problems in EQ-5D questionnaire domains than did those from higher socioeconomic status. Caregiver burden was inversely correlated with health utility. Caregiver physical and mental health status, objective strain, education, and relationship with the care recipient were found to significantly predict health utility (adjusted R-2 similar to 57%). Conclusions: Autism caregivers had lower health utility than did the general adult US population. There is an immediate need to address health concerns among this growing population.","[Khanna, Rahul; Bentley, John P.] Univ Mississippi, Sch Pharm, Res Inst Pharmaceut Sci, University, MS 38677 USA; [Khanna, Rahul; Jariwala, Krutika; Bentley, John P.] Univ Mississippi, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharm Adm, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi,"Khanna, R (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharm Adm, Faser Hall Room 236,POB 1848, University, MS 38677 USA.",rkhanna@olemiss.edu,"Khanna, Rahul/F-6071-2013",,American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy,American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy,The study was funded by a grant from the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.,,41,21,22,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2013,16,5.0,,,,,778,788,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.04.007,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CL,23947971.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325466600011,0

This can lead to an overestimation if compensation mechanisms occur. Until now only Dutch data are available on the influence of compensation mechanisms on lost productivity, but between-country differences in frequency and type of compensation mechanisms can be expected. The objective of this study was to understand whether compensation mechanisms for days absent from paid work differ in type and frequency across countries and to explore whether this would result in between-country differences in relevant lost productivity. Methods: Data from a cross-sectional survey among respondents with rheumatic disorders from four countries were the basis for this study. Analyses focused on respondents with paid employment who reported absence in the last 3 months. The different compensation mechanisms are described and the resulting lost productivity in terms of days absent was calculated with and without taking compensation mechanisms into account. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine which variables influence compensation mechanisms leading to relevant lost productivity. Results: The results indicate that compensation mechanisms occur and are relevant in all four countries. Between-country differences in the type and frequency of compensation mechanisms and relevant lost productivity were observed. The logistic regression analyses indicate that, correcting for other variables, this is also the case for the use of compensation mechanisms leading to relevant lost productivity. Conclusions: Between-country differences in compensation mechanisms in case of absenteeism exist and could vary to such an extent that foreign relevant lost productivity data should be used with caution.","[Knies, S.; Evers, S.

It explores data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. I found that 37% of all surveyed workers who had experienced one on-the-job accident reported at least one additional injury, but only 56% of all occupational injuries and illnesses resulted in workers' compensation claims. I estimated different count models to assess the effect of different individual worker and job characteristics on individual injury counts and workers' compensation claims counts. Lower educational levels, less tenure, work in dangerous industries and unskilled occupations, and job demands are found to be important determinants of multiple on-the-job injuries. The most interesting results, however, refer to the role played by individuals' pre-injury characteristics: early exposure to dangerous jobs is among the main determinants of higher counts of occupational injuries later in life. Early health limitations are also significant predictors of recurrent workers' compensation claims. These results provide new evidence about the important role played by both the health and the socioeconomic status of young people as determinants of their future occupational injuries.

Health data from the Longitudinal Aging Survey Amsterdam is combined with data on hospital and long term care use. We estimate a latent variable based jointly on observed health indicators and expenditures. Annual transition probabilities between states of the latent variable are estimated using a Markov model. States associated with good current health and low annual health care expenditures are not associated with lower cumulative health care expenditures over remaining lifetime. We conclude that, although the direct health care cost saving effect is limited, the considerable gain in healthy lifeyears can make investing in the improvement of health of the older population worthwhile.

The RRM is a regret-based model that explores a driver of choice different from the traditional utility-based Random Utility Maximisation (RUM). The RRM approach is based on the idea that, when choosing, individuals aim to minimise their regret-regret being defined as what one experiences when a non-chosen alternative in a choice set performs better than a chosen one in relation to one or more attributes. Analysing data from a discrete choice experiment on diet, physical activity and risk of a fatal heart attack in the next ten years administered to a sample of the Northern Ireland population, we find that the combined use of RUM and RRM models offer additional information, providing useful behavioural insights for better informed policy appraisal.

Evidence from longitudinal studies is mixed but generally find that initiation does not vary with price or tax. We show that the lack of statistical significance partly results because of limited policy variation in the time periods studied, truncated behavioral windows, or mis-assignment of price and tax rates in retrospective data (which occurs when one has no information about respondents' prior state or region of residence).

Clarity, however, is lacking about when and how to conduct modeling studies in tandem with systematic reviews, as well as about how to evaluate and present model results. The objective of this study was to collect and analyze information from various sources to inform the development of a framework for deciding when and how a decision model should be added to a systematic review. Methods: We collected data through 1) review and analysis of evidence reports that used decision models; 2) review and synthesis of current best practices for the development of decision models; 3) interviews of Evidence-Based Practice Center directors and selected staff, United States Preventive Services Task Force members, and decision modelers who developed models used by the United States Preventive Services Task Force; and 4) a focus group of expert modelers. Results: Models are well suited to address gaps in the literature, better suited for certain types of research questions, and essential for determining the value of information relating to future research. Opinions differ regarding whether model outputs constitute evidence, but interviewees expressed concern over the lack of standards and directions in grading and reporting such evidence. Interviews of stakeholders and modelers revealed the importance of communication and presentation of model results as well as the importance of model literacy and involvement of stakeholders. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the need for a framework for deciding when and how to use models alongside systematic reviews and provides information to develop such a framework.","[Sainfort, Francois; Kuntz, Karen M.; Gregory, Sean; Butler, Mary; Kane, Robert L.] Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Taylor, Brent C.] Vet Affairs Hlth Care Syst, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Taylor, Brent C.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Med, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Taylor, Brent C.; Kulasingam, Shalini] Univ Minnesota, Div Epidemiol & Community Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Sainfort, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Sch Publ Hlth, MMC 729,420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",sainfort@umn.edu,"Taylor, Brent C/A-8069-2009; Gregory, Sean/AAM-3924-2020","Taylor, Brent C/0000-0002-2140-8377; Gregory, Sean/0000-0003-3157-0316; Kulasingam, Shalini/0000-0002-0932-9166","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [290-2007-10064-I, 8]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality)","This project was funded under Contract No. 290-2007-10064-I, Task Order No.8, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Methods: Data were obtained from a group of patients receiving epidural steroid injections. We assessed responsiveness by using correlation, by estimating standardized response means, by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and by comparing the minimum clinically important differences peculiar to each of the instruments. Results: ODI, BPI, and EQ-5D index scores, and changes in scores, were found to be correlated. Estimated standardized response means and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested lower responsiveness for the EQ-5D index score. Clinically significant categories of mild, moderate, and severe BPI pain intensity translated into progressively and significantly lower mean EQ-5D index scores. An increase or a decrease in severity level reported on any of the five EQ-5D dimensions was associated with significant changes (with appropriate signs) in the condition-specific scores. No change in severity in any EQ-5D dimension was associated with no change in the specific scores. Significant changes in the EQ-5D index scores were associated with clinically important changes in the ODI and BPI scores. Correlation between index scores and responses on EQ-5D's visual analogue scale was only moderate. Conclusions: The EQ-5D index is less responsive than instruments specific to pain measurement, although it is capable of indicating clinically important changes. The lower responsiveness arises from EQ-5D's more limited gradation of severity and its multidimensionality.","[Whynes, D. K.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [McCahon, R.

We evaluate the effects of orphan drug policies on the basis of this concern for real accessibility to drugs. We highlight two unforeseen effects of orphan drug policies: 1) they provide unique business opportunities for manufacturers and 2) drugs approved through these policies are often inaccessible because of their high price. We identify six causes of this emergence of effects. The first four are the direct result of incentives included in orphan drug policies. The fifth cause is the off-label use of orphan drugs. These emergent effects have several implications: 1) they raise doubts about the equity of access to drugs, 2) they highlight the limitations of the cohort paradigm in medicine, and c) they force third-party payers to make drugs accessible even when the prices of drugs are believed to be disproportionate to the clinical effects obtained.","[Cote, Andre] Univ Laval, Fac Sci Adm, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Keating, Bernard] Univ Laval, Fac Theol & Sci Religieuses, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Côté, A (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Fac Sci Adm, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",Andre.cote@mng.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,27,58,63,4,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1185,1191,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.09.004,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244823.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300025,0

These protocols, built on the multi-bidding procedure of Perez-Castrillo and Wettstein (2001), allow more freedom in multilateral bargaining where rejected players can further negotiate and form coalitions. The self-duality of the Shapley value plays a key role in the second and third results. Moreover, these renegotiation protocols allow an actual play along the equilibrium path to restore the Shapley value in case of a 'mistake' made before. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Lusk, JL; Schroeter, C",,,,"Lusk, Jayson L.; Schroeter, Christiane",,,WHEN DO FAT TAXES INCREASE CONSUMER WELFARE?,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,obesity; fat tax; sugary beverage; willingness to pay,IMPACT,"Previous analyses of fat taxes have generally worked within an empirical framework in which it is difficult to determine whether consumers benefit from the policy. This note outlines on simple means to determine whether consumers benefit from a fat tax by comparing the ratio of expenditures on the taxed good to the weight effect of the tax against the individual's willingness to pay for a one-pound weight reduction. Our empirical calculations suggest that an individual would have to be willing to pay about $1500 to reduce weight by one pound for a tax on sugary beverages to be welfare enhancing. The results suggest either that a soda tax is very unlikely to increase individual consumer welfare or that the policy must be justified on some other grounds that abandon standard rationality assumptions.

The aim of this study was twofold: first, to calculate the direct treatment costs associated with ADEs leading to hospitalization and, second, to derive the excess costs and extra hospital days attributable to ADEs of inpatient treatments in selected German hospitals. Methods: This was a retrospective and medical record-based study performed from the hospitals' perspective based on administrative accounting data from three hospitals (49,462 patients) in Germany. Total treatment costs (analysis 1) and excess costs (i.e., incremental resource utilization) between patients suffering from an ADE and those without ADEs were calculated by means of a propensity score-based matching algorithm (analysis 2). Results: Mean treatment costs (analysis 1) of ADEs leading to hospitalization (n = 564) were (sic)1,978 +/- 2,036 (range (sic)191-18,147; median (sic)1,446; (sic)843-2,480 [Q1-Q3]). In analysis 2, the mean costs of inpatients suffering from an ADE (n = 1,891) as a concomitant disease or complication ((sic)5,113 +/- 10,059; range (sic)179-246,288; median (sic)2,701; (sic)1,636-5,111 [Q1-Q3]) were significantly higher ((sic)970; P < 0.0001) than those of non-ADE inpatients ((sic)4,143 +/- 6,968; range (sic)154-148,479; median (sic)2,387; (sic)1,432-4,701 [Q1-Q3]). Mean inpatient length of stay of ADE patients (12.7 +/- 17.2 days) and non-ADE patients (9.8 +/- 11.6 days) differed by 2.9 days (P < 0.0001). A nationwide extrapolation resulted in annual total treatment costs of (sic)1.058 billion. Conclusions: This is one of the first administrative data-based analyses calculating the economic consequences of ADEs in Germany. Further efforts are necessary to improve pharmacotherapy and relieve health care payers of preventable treatment costs.","[Rottenkolber, Dominik] Univ Munich, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Rottenkolber, Dominik] LMU, Munich Ctr Hlth Sci, Munich, Germany; [Rottenkolber, Dominik] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth GmbH, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Neuherberg, Germany; [Hasford, Joerg; Stausberg, Juergen] LMU, Inst Med Informat Verarbeitung Biometrie & Epidem, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Munich,"Rottenkolber, D (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Ludwigstr 28 RG V, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",rottenkolber@bwl.lmu.de,,,,,,,67,51,53,0,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15,6.0,,,,,868,875,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.05.007,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999137.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800013,0

We analysed the factors that explain variations in resource use for child delivery in ten European countries. We compared the performance of three models for explaining the variations in resource use (log cost or length of inpatient stay) at patient and hospital level. The first model used only the DRGs to which child deliveries were coded (MD), the second used a set of patient-level and delivery specific explanatory variables (MP), and the third model combined both sets of variables (MF). Countries vary both in the number of DRGs and the criteria used to classify cases of child delivery (range: 38) and in the percentage of deliveries classified as delivery without complication (range: 5390%). The capacity of DRGs and patient level variables to explain cost variation for child birth ranges from 48% in Sweden to over 70% in Spain. There is room for improving current DRG classification in most countries, but this does not necessary imply multiplying the groups and/or complicating criteria. Countries with a higher number of DRGs do not always perform better.

The universal coverage plan of Taiwan is the newest among developed countries, and it is known for readily providing access to care at low costs. However, Taiwan experiences problems on the supply side, such as inadequate compensation for providers, especially in the area of preventive care. We compare the use of preventive, hospital, and emergency care between the USA and Taiwan. The rate of preventive care use is much higher in the USA than in Taiwan, whereas the use of hospital and emergency care is about the same. Results of our decomposition analysis suggest that higher levels of education and income, along with inferior health status in the USA, are significant factors, each explaining between 7% and 15% of the gap in preventive care use. Our analysis suggests that, in addition to universal coverage, proper remuneration schemes, education levels, and cultural attitudes towards health care are important factors that influence the use of preventive care.

Each candidate has a certain cost or weight. The choice of the k-committee has to satisfy some budget or weight constraint: the sum of the weights of all committee members must not exceed a given value W. While the former part of the problem is a typical question in Social Choice Theory, the latter stems from Operations Research. The purpose of this paper is to link these two research fields: we first characterize reasonable ways of ranking sets of objects, i.e., candidates, and then develop efficient algorithms for the actual computation of optimal committees.

Approximately 50% of state prisoners meet the criteria for a diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence, but only 10% receive medically based drug treatment. Because of the link between substance abuse and crime, treating substance abusing and dependent state prisoners while incarcerated has the potential to yield substantial economic benefits. In this paper, we simulate the lifetime costs and benefits of improving prison-based substance abuse treatment and post-release aftercare for a cohort of state prisoners. Our model captures the dynamics of substance abuse as a chronic disease; estimates the benefits of substance abuse treatment over individuals' lifetimes; and tracks the costs of crime and criminal justice costs related to policing, adjudication, and incarceration. We estimate net societal benefits and cost savings to the criminal justice system of the current treatment system and five policy scenarios. We find that four of the five policy scenarios provide positive net societal benefits and cost savings to the criminal justice system relative to the current treatment system. Our study demonstrates the societal gains to improving the drug treatment system for state prisoners.

Methods: A total of 101 adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) completed a daily diary of items measuring symptoms and impacts of COPD for 7 days, and on the seventh day they completed a questionnaire of the same items with a 7-day recall period. The analysis examined concordance of 7-day recall with summary descriptors of the daily responses, examined the magnitude and covariates (patient characteristics and response patterns) of the difference between 7-day recall and mean of daily responses, and compared the discriminant ability and ability to detect change of 7-day recall and mean of daily responses. Results: A 7-day recall was moderately concordant with the mean and maximum of daily responses and was 0.34 to 0.50 SDs higher than the mean of daily responses. Only the weekly report itself was a covariate of the difference. The discriminant ability and ability to detect change were equivalent. Conclusions: In measuring the weeklong experience of COPD symptoms and impacts on groups of patients, the 7-day recall scores were higher than the daily diary scores, but equivalent in detecting change over time.","[Bennett, Antonia V.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Amtmann, Dagmar] Univ Washington, Dept Rehabil Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Diehr, Paula; Patrick, Donald L.] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Diehr, Paula] Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Bennett, AV (通讯作者)，Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, 307 E 63rd St,2nd Floor, New York, NY 10065 USA.",bennetta@mskcc.org,"Patrick, Donald/Y-2460-2019","Patrick, Donald/0000-0003-0756-0492","Pfizer, Inc.; Health Research Associates, Inc.","Pfizer, Inc.(Pfizer); Health Research Associates, Inc.","No funding was received for this secondary analysis or manuscript preparation.

Further, health behaviors, such as exercise, smoking, drinking, as well as weight status, are instrumental to diabetes management and the reduction of its medical consequences. Nine waves of the Health and Retirement Study are used to model the role of a recent diabetes diagnosis and medication on present and subsequent weight status, exercise, drinking and smoking activity. Several non-linear dynamic population average probit models are estimated. Results suggest that compared to non-diagnosed individuals at risk for high blood sugar, diagnosed diabetics respond initially in terms of increasing exercise, losing weight, and curbing smoking and drinking behavior, but the effect diminishes after diagnosis.

This paper uses community and individual-level longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey to estimate the net health impact of China's unprecedented urbanization. We construct an index of urbanicity from a broad set of community characteristics and define urbanization in terms of movements across the distribution of this index. We use difference-in-differences estimators to identify the treatment effect of urbanization on the self-assessed health of individuals. We find that urbanization raises the probability of reporting of poor health and that a greater degree of urbanization has a larger effect. The effect may, in part, be attributable to changed health expectations, but it also appears to operate through health behaviour. Populations experiencing urbanization tend to consume more fat and smoke more.

This study investigates how hospital ownership type affects treatment choices to show whether ownership type and teaching status are correlated with choosing a procedure as the treatment and how these choices relate to patient insurance type. Not-for-profit hospitals significantly differ from for-profits in terms of treatment choices of less profitable patients and all hospitals are more likely to accord the procedure when the patient is privately insured than uninsured though teaching government hospitals are the most likely to accord the procedures for all insurance types. Considering treatment choices, not-for-profit hospitals have different objectives than for-profit and government hospitals and in terms of profit-seeking behavior, not-for-profit hospitals seem to lie between for-profit and government hospitals.

It is shown that the LSE is strongly consistent. When the autoregressive function is discontinuous over each threshold, the estimated thresholds are n-consistent and asymptotically independent, each of which converges weakly to the smallest minimizer of a one-dimensional two-sided compound Poisson process. The remaining parameters are root n-consistent and asymptotically normal. The theory of Chan (1993) is revisited and a numerical approach is proposed to simulate the limiting distribution of the estimated threshold via simulating a related compound Poisson process. Based on the numerical result, one can construct a confidence interval for the unknown threshold. This issue is not straightforward and has remained as an open problem since the publication of Chan (1993). This paper provides not only a solution to this long-standing open problem, but also provides methodological contributions to threshold models. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the LSE in finite samples. The results are illustrated with an application to the quarterly U.S. real GNP data over the period 1947-2009.

Methods: Florida Medicaid claims data are used to compare methods based on prior cost, and concurrent and prospective diagnosis-based models. Individuals with prior year expenditures in the top decile or with predicted expenditures in the top decile from the diagnosis-based models were expected to be high-cost individuals. Results: Individuals in the top decile of prior year costs averaged $13,684 (US dollars) in costs in the following year with 50% remaining in the top decile of spending. Individuals classified as high cost by diagnosis-based models averaged $10,935 to $10,974, with 34% meeting the criteria for a high-cost case in the following year. Conclusion: In contrast to research on high-costs cases for physical health care, prior cost was superior to diagnosis-based models at identifying future high cases for mental health care.","[Robst, John] Univ S Florida, Florida Mental Hlth Inst, Dept Mental Hlth Law & Policy, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Robst, John] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Robst, John] Inst Study Labor IZA Bonn, Tampa, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Robst, J (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Florida Mental Hlth Inst, Dept Mental Hlth Law & Policy, 13301 Bruce B Downs Blvd, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",jrobst@fmhi.usf.edu,,"Robst, John/0000-0003-1965-0233",Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration [MED 078],Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration,This work was supported by the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration through contract MED 078.,,17,6,8,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,,,,198,203,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.08.007,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GU,22264989.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299318500024,0

Methods: Forty-seven PEs that were submitted by pharmaceutical companies for coverage decisions between June 2005 and December 2009 were included in this study. To assess their appropriateness with regard to the PE guidelines, we used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment services (HIRA) checklist consisting of 20 items based on the PE guidelines. We also evaluated the results for coverage decisions, as recommended, recommended with restricted use, or  not recommended, based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the range of uncertainty. Results: On average, 14 of the 20 items on the HIRA checklist were fulfilled (70.9%, range 35.0%-100%). The compliance rate for the following items was above 70%: presentation of perspectives and evaluation methods, a sufficient time horizon, and appropriateness of comparators and health outcomes. The compliance rate for the following items was below 70%: omission of objectives for the study, inappropriate target population, unclear selection process for effectiveness and cost, inappropriate cost estimation, insufficient justification of generalizability, and description of study limitations. The range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life-years of PEs from a societal perspective varied from dominant to 59K USD (n = 13): it consisted of dominant to 28K USD for recommended submissions (n = 6), 8K to 20K USD for recommended with restricted use submissions (n = 4), and 13K to 59K for not recommended ones (n = 3). Conclusions: Our study showed that most PEs in this study have reached an adequate level for coverage decisions. Overall barriers associated with a lack of relevant evidence could account for the low compliance rate with specific items in the PE guidelines. PEs with good quality submitted for coverage decisions have played an important role for selecting cost-effective drugs.","[Yim, Eun-Young; Lim, Sang Hee; Oh, Mi-Jeong; Park, Hye Kyung; Gong, Ji-Ryoun; Park, Sung Eun; Yi, So Young] Hlth Insurance Review & Assessment Serv, Drug Listing Div, Seoul 137706, South Korea",,"Yi, SY (通讯作者)，Hlth Insurance Review & Assessment Serv, Drug Listing Div, 1451-34 Seocho3 Dong, Seoul 137706, South Korea.",zlnolja@hiramail.net,,,,,,,32,11,12,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S104,S110,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.026,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265055.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000019,0

We develop unique time-series datasets on governance in each country. We address construct validity by building country-specific indices which reflect local norms and institutions. These similar-but-not-identical indices predict firm market value in each country, and when pooled across countries, in firm fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) regressions. In contrast, a common index, which uses the same elements in each country, has no predictive power in FE regressions. For the country-specific and pooled indices, FE and RE coefficients on governance are generally lower than in pooled OLS regressions, and coefficients with extensive covariates are generally lower than with limited covariates.

We investigate whether incentives produce the desired plan elections and whether these changes, along with cost shifting, produce the expected reductions in cost growth. Using individual-level administrative data, along with aggregated data on expenditures for retirees, we estimate the effects of the introduction and subsequent repeal of a Comprehensive Wellness Initiative for non-Medicare eligible retirees, as well as increases in coinsurance and copayments and the introduction of a premium for all retirees. Over a third of non-Medicare retirees shifted into the least generous plan between June 2009 and December 2012.

Innovators have private information about their abilities, and choose unobservable effort in order to produce innovations of random quality. Innovation quality is not contractible. We compare two procurement mechanisms a fixed prize and a first-price auction. Before the contest, a fixed number of innovators is selected in an entry auction, in order to address the adverse selection problem.

Unfortunately, these shocks may not have a meaningful structural economic interpretation. It is discussed how statistical and conventional identifying information can be combined. The discussion is based on a VAR model for the US containing oil prices, output, consumer prices and a short-term interest rate. The system has been used for studying the causes of the early millennium economic slowdown based on traditional identification with zero and long-run restrictions and using sign restrictions. We find that previously drawn conclusions are questionable in our framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The first result shows that every social welfare order satisfying Hammond Equity and the Strong Pareto axioms is non-constructive in nature for all non-trivial domains, Y. The second result shows that, when the domain set is Y = [0, 1], every social welfare order satisfying the Pigou Dalton transfer principle is non-constructive in nature. Specifically, in both results, we show that the existence of the appropriate social welfare order entails the existence of a non-Ramsey set, a non-constructive object.

Most prior studies rely on cross-sectional evidence, which renders causal inference problematic and policy recommendations inappropriate. We exploit legislation changes regarding minimum staffing requirements in eight states between 2000 and 2001 as exogenous shocks to nurse staffing levels. We find that registered nurse staffing has a large and significant impact on quality of care, and that there is no evidence of a significant association between nurse aide staffing and quality of care. A comparison of the IV estimation to the OLS estimation of the first-difference model suggests that ignoring endogeneity would lead to an underestimation of how nurse staffing affects quality of care in nursing homes.

Specifically, we model the joint distribution of each outcome error and the selection error via a newly constructed class of multivariate distributions which we call generalized normal mean-variance mixture distributions. We extend Heckman's two-step estimation procedure for the Gaussian switching regime model to the new class of models. When the distributions of the outcome errors are asymmetric, we show that an additional correction term accounting for skewness in the outcome error distribution (besides the analogue of the well known inverse mill's ratio) needs to be included in the second step regression. We use the two-step estimators of parameters in the model to construct simple estimators of average treatment effects and establish their asymptotic properties. Simulation results confirm the importance of accounting for skewness in the outcome errors in estimating both model parameters and the average treatment effect and the treatment effect for the treated.

Methods: Studies are presented that require different types of risk adjustment. First, we demonstrate using rates that external risk adjustment through standardization can be achieved using modified meta analytic methods, but only with a model that allows input of user-defined weights. Next, we extend these observations to internal risk adjustment of comparative effect sizes. Results: We show that this procedure produces identical results to conventional age standardization if a rate is being standardized for age. We also demonstrate that risk adjustment of effect sizes can be achieved with this modified method but cannot be done using standard meta-analysis. Conclusions: We conclude that this method allows risk adjustment to be performed in situations in which currently the fixed- or random effects methods of meta analysis are inappropriately used The latter should be avoided when the underlying aim is risk adjustment rather than meta-analysis.","[Doi, Suhail A.

Methods: Respondents made multiple choices between hospital treatment as usual (7 days) and two combinations of hospital admission (3 days) followed by treatment at home. The latter was described by a set of attributes. Hospital treatment was constant across choice sets. Respondents were patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a randomized controlled trial investigating the cost-effectiveness of early assisted discharge and their informal caregivers. The data were analyzed using mixed logit, generalized multinomial logit, and latent-class conditional logit regression. These methods allow for heterogeneous preferences across groups, but in different ways. Results: Twenty-five percent of the respondents opted for hospital treatment regardless of the description of the early assisted discharge program, and 46% never opted for the hospital. The best model contained four latent classes of respondents, defined by different preferences for the hospital and caregiver burden. Preferences for other attributes were constant across classes. Attributes with the strongest effect on choices were the burden on informal caregivers and co-payments. Except for the number of visits, all attributes had a significant effect on choices in the expected direction. Conclusions: Considerable segments of respondents had fixed preferences for either treatment option. Applying latent class analysis was essential in quantifying preferences for attributes of early assisted discharge.","[Goossens, Lucas M. A.; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P. M.

How do these normative labels influence consumer choice and how much they ultimately either consume or waste? Although one might believe that firms use normative labels to impact choice behavior through loss aversion, a field experiment shows consumer's willingness to pay is inconsistent with a loss aversion explanation. Although portions were clearly visible, individuals appeared to use the labels as objective information about their size. Importantly, a second study showed these labels also led people to eat less when food was given a larger sounding name than a smaller name (double vs. regular; regular vs. half-size). If labels are used as size information, policies governing normative names could help reduce food consumption or reduce waste.

Design: A retrospective database analysis of critically ill patients (intensive care unit stay >= 3 days) receiving PN and discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2011, using the Premier Hospital Database. Patients were identified as receiving MCB or COM on the basis of product description codes. Primary outcomes were length of stay (LOS) and total costs. Comorbidities and clinical outcomes were identified using International Classificaion of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes. All costs reported were for inpatient services only Patients receiving MCB and COM were matched on key patient and hospital characteristics using a propensity score methodology. Multivariate regression models for cost and LOS used generalized linear models with a log link and gamma distribution. Results: A total of 42,631 patients met the inclusion criteria (MOB = 5,679; COM = 36,952), and the final matched population included 3,559 patients from each cohort. Baseline patient and hospital characteristics were well matched between groups. Adjusted multivariate models demonstrated a small difference between groups for LOS (MOB = 9.40 days vs. COM = 9.65 days; P = 0.014). In addition, patients receiving MOB incurred approximately 9.1% less in total costs (MCB = $37,790 vs. COM = $41,569; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Overall, patients receiving MCB and COM experienced similar LOS, though patients receiving MCB had significantly lower overall costs. Interpretation of the study findings is subject to several limitations, and additional studies that include explicit identification of the method for compounding are needed.","[Magee, Glenn] Premier Inc, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Zaloga, Gary P.] Baxter Healthcare Corp, Global Med Affairs, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA; [Turpin, Robin S.; Sanon, Myrlene] Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Deerfield, IL USA; [Turpin, Robin S.] Takeda Pharmaceut, Hlth Delivery Syst & Pharmacoecon, Deerfield, IL USA; [Turpin, Robin S.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Jefferson Sch Populat Hlth, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA",Baxter International Inc; Jefferson University,"Sanon, M (通讯作者)，Baxter Healthcare Corp, DF5-3W,One Baxter Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA.",myrlene.sanon@gmail.com,,,Baxter Healthcare (Nutrition),Baxter Healthcare (Nutrition),This research was supported by Baxter Healthcare (Nutrition).,,20,12,13,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,328,333,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.02.009,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24968991.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900004,0

We first show how to write the causality measures in terms of copula densities. Thereafter, we suggest consistent estimators for these measures based on a consistent nonparametric estimator of copula densities. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic normality of these nonparametric estimators and discuss the validity of a local smoothed bootstrap that we use in finite sample settings to compute a bootstrap bias-corrected estimator and to perform statistical tests. A Monte Carlo simulation study reveals that the bootstrap bias-corrected estimator behaves well and the corresponding test has quite good finite sample size and power properties for a variety of typical data generating processes and different sample sizes. Finally, two empirical applications are considered to illustrate the practical relevance of nonparametric causality measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We assume that firms offer one low quality plan and one high quality plan. Under the assumption of wage rigidities we found that the employee's contribution to each plan is an increasing function of that plan's premium. The effect of the other plan's premium is ambiguous. We test our hypothesis using data from the Employer Health Benefit Survey. Restricting the analysis to firms that offer both HMO and PPO plans, we measure the amount of the premium passed on to employees in response to a change in both premiums. We find evidence of large and positive effects of the increase in the plan's premium on the amount of the premium passed on to employees. The effect of the alternative plan's premium is negative but statistically significant only for the PPO plans. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, a majority of the literature has limitations to capture a changing preference for flexibility across time in the sense that such an attitude is independent of past actions. This study incorporates the histories of past actions into an infinite-horizon extension of Dekel et al. (2001) and models a decision maker whose attitude toward flexibility evolves over time from the uncertainty of future time preference or discount factors. Moreover, we provide behavioral comparisons of the degree of patience across different histories and characterize the shift of subjective beliefs about discount factors in the sense of an increasing convex and concave stochastic order.

It can be applied to sets of trials reporting different combinations of patient- or clinician-reported outcomes, including both disease-specific measures and generic health-related quality-of-life measures. It is underpinned by a structural equation model that includes measurement error and latent common treatment effect factor. Treatment effects can be expressed on any of the test instruments that have been used Methods: This is illustrated in a synthesis of eight placebo-controlled trials of TNF-alpha inhibitors in ankylosing spondylitis, each reporting treatment effects on between two and five of a total six test instruments. Results: The method has advantages over other methods for synthesis of multiple outcome data, including standardization and multivariate normal synthesis. Unlike standardization, it allows synthesis of treatment effect information from test instruments sensitive to different underlying constructs. It represents a special case of previously proposed multivariate normal models for evidence synthesis, but unlike the former, it also estimates mappings. Combining synthesis and mapping as a single operation makes more efficient use of available data than do current mapping methods and generates treatment effects that are consistent with the mappings. A limitation, however, is that it can only generate mappings to and from those instruments on which some trial data exist. Conclusions: The method should be assessed in a wide range of data sets on different clinical conditions, before it can be used routinely in health technology assessment.","[Lu, Guobing; Kounali, Daphne; Ades, A.

Based on an extensive Monte Carlo study, we show that the use of Chamberlain's (1987) optimal instruments overcomes many problems that have recently been documented with standard, non-optimal instruments. Optimal instruments reduce small sample bias, but they prove even more powerful in increasing the estimator's efficiency and stability. We consider a wide variety of data-generating processes and an empirical application to the automobile market. We also consider the gains of other recent methodological advances when combined with optimal instruments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Unbalanced cointegration refers to the situation where the integration orders of the observables are different, but their corresponding balanced versions (with equal integration orders after filtering) are cointegrated in the usual sense. Within this setting, the long run linkage between the observables is driven by both the cointegrating parameter and the difference between the integration orders of the observables, which we consider to be unknown. Our results reveal three noticeable features. First, superconsistent (faster than root n-consistent) estimators of the difference between memory parameters are achievable. Next, the joint limiting distribution of the estimators of both parameters is singular, and, finally, a modified version of the Type II fractional Brownian motion arises in the limiting theory. A Monte Carlo experiment and the discussion of an economic example are included. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is based on a jackknife version of the overidentifying test statistic. Correct asymptotic critical values are derived for this statistic when the number of instruments grows large, at a rate up to the sample size. It is also shown that the test is valid when the number of instruments is fixed and there is homoskedasticity. This test improves on recently proposed tests by allowing for heteroskedasticity and by avoiding assumptions on the instrument projection matrix. This paper finds in Monte Carlo studies that the test is more accurate and less sensitive to the number of instruments than the Hausman Sargan or GMM tests of overidentifying restrictions.

Specifically, given an arbitrary binary relation defined on a finite set, we ask if and when there exists a data set which can generate the given relation through revealed preference. We show that the dimension of the consumption space affects the set of revealed preference relations. If the consumption space has more goods than observations, any revealed preference relation can arise. Conversely, if the consumption space has low dimension relative to the number of observations, then there exist both rational and irrational preference relations that can never be revealed by choices.

Methods: A propensity score matched cohort of 6856 elderly (>= 65 years) ovarian cancer patients diagnosed from 1991 to 2005 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data cohort were included. Treatment regimens (i.e., no chemotherapy, platinum-based only, platinum plus taxane, and other nonplatinum) were identified in the 6 months postdiagnosis. Patients were followed until death or end of study (December 2006). Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total health care costs were measured by using a payer's perspective (2009 US dollars). Methodological and statistical uncertainties were accounted by including alternative scenarios (for utility values) and net monetary benefit approach. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERS) were calculated, and stratified analyses were performed by tumor stages and age groups. Results: On comparing the platinum based group versus no chemotherapy, we found that the ICER was $30,073/QALY and $58,151/QALY for early- and late-stage disease, respectively, while other nonplatinum and platinum plus taxane groups were dominated (less effective and more costly). Similar results were found across alternative scenarios and age groups. For patients 85 years or older, platinum plus taxane, however, was not dominated by the platinum based group, with an ICER of $133,892/QALY. Conclusions: Following elderly ovarian cancer patients over a lifetime using real-world longitudinal data and adjusting for quality of life, we found that treatment with platinum based regimen was the most cost-effective treatment alternative.","[Lairson, David R.; Parikh, Rohan C.; Du, Xianglin L.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Management Policy & Community Hlth, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Cormier, Janice N.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Div Surg Oncol & Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Du, Xianglin L.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol Human Genet & Environm Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health,"Lairson, DR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, 1200 Herman Pressler Dr,RAS E-307, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",David.R.Lairson@uth.tmc.edu,,"Parikh, Rohan/0000-0003-4516-9996",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [R01-HS018956],Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),This study was supported by a grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (grant no.

We propose an algorithm that calculates the coefficients of the rearranged expansion that Ait-Sahalia (2002) suggested. That is, a general expression of the coefficients is provided explicitly, which as far as we know has not been given in the existing literature. We also introduce a reduced form of the rearranged expansion and call it as the delta expansion in the paper. Moreover, we are able to obtain an explicit expansion of the moments in the order of the power of the observational time interval. We examine the delta expansion and the Hermite expansion without rearrangement numerically to find that the delta expansion has such advantageous features as the order of the error bound can be more effectively attained. It is also found that our expansion gives a comparable numerical accuracy of the approximation to the expansion Ait-Sahalia (1999) suggested, while making any symbolic computation unnecessary.

Objectives: The objective of this report was to present updated guidance on methods for those undertaking such analyses or for those reviewing the results of such analyses. This update was needed, in part, because of developments in BIA methods as well as a growing interest, particularly in emerging markets, in matters related to affordability and population health impacts of health care interventions. Methods: The Task Force was approved by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Health Sciences Policy Council and appointed by its Board of Directors. Members were experienced developers or users of BIAs; worked in academia and industry and as advisors to governments; and came from several countries in North America and South America, Oceania, Asia, and Europe. The Task Force solicited comments on the drafts from a core group of external reviewers and, more broadly, from the membership of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research. Results: The Task Force recommends that the design of a BIA for a new health care intervention should take into account relevant features of the health care system, possible access restrictions, the anticipated uptake of the new intervention, and the use and effects of the current and new interventions. The key elements of a BIA include estimating the size of the eligible population, the current mix of treatments and the expected mix after the introduction of the new intervention, the cost of the treatment mixes, and any changes expected in condition-related costs. Where possible, the BIA calculations should be performed by using a simple cost calculator approach because of its ease of use for budget holders. In instances, however, in which the changes in eligible population size, disease severity mix, or treatment patterns cannot be credibly captured by using the cost calculator approach, a cohort or patient level condition-specific model may be used to estimate the budget impact of the new intervention, accounting appropriately for those entering and leaving the eligible population over time. In either case, the BIA should use data that reflect values specific to a particular decision maker's population. Sensitivity analysis should be of alternative scenarios chosen from the perspective of the decision maker. The validation of the model should include at least face validity with decision makers and verification of the calculations. Data sources for the BIA should include published clinical trial estimates and comparator studies for the efficacy and safety of the current and new interventions as well as the decision maker's own population for the other parameter estimates, where possible. Other data sources include the use of published data, well-recognized local or national statistical information, and, in special circumstances, expert opinion. Reporting of the BIA should provide detailed information about the input parameter values and calculations at a level of detail that would allow another modeler to replicate the analysis. The outcomes of the BIA should be presented in the format of interest to health care decision makers. In a computer program, options should be provided for different categories of costs to be included or excluded from the analysis. Conclusions: We recommend a framework for the BIA, provide guidance on the acquisition and use of data, and offer a common reporting format that will promote standardization and transparency. Adherence to these good research practice principles would not necessarily supersede jurisdiction-specific BIA guidelines but may support and enhance local recommendations or serve as a starting point for payers wishing to promulgate methodology guidelines.","[Sullivan, Sean D.] Univ Washington, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Mauskopf, Josephine A.] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Augustovski, Federico] Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Caro, J.

When insurance expansions make markets more profitable, firms respond by boosting advertising. Theory suggests this effect will be magnified in the least competitive drug classes, where firms internalize a larger share of the benefits from advertising. Empirically, we find that the implementation of Part D coincides with a 14-19% increase in total advertising expenditures. This effect is indeed concentrated in the least competitive drug classes. The additional advertising raised utilization among non-elderly patients outside the Part D program by about 3.6%. This is roughly half of the direct utilization effect of Part Don elderly beneficiaries. The results suggest the presence of considerable spillover effects from publicly subsidized prescription drug insurance on the utilization and welfare of consumers outside the program.

We demonstrate, in particular, that the Samuelson-LeChatelier principle extends naturally to the comparative statics of changes in risk: in the presence of positive feedbacks between the decision variables, the unrestricted response to an increase in risk is in the same direction and stronger in magnitude than the restricted response (i.e. the choice when other decision variables are fixed). We define the concepts of Nth-degree risk complements and Nth-degree risk substitutes and we show that it is in any one of these two cases (and only in these cases) that we will observe positive feedbacks between the decision variables.

Starting with individual preferences over alternatives, we analyse when it can be determined efficiently if a given committee C satisfies a weak (resp. strong) Condorcet criterion - i.e., if C is at least as good as (resp. better than) every other committee in a pairwise majority comparison. Scoring functions used in classic voting rules are adapted for these comparisons. In particular, we draw the sharp separation line between computationally tractable and intractable instances with respect to different voting rules. Finally, we show that deciding if there exists a committee which satisfies the weak (resp. strong) Condorcet criterion is computationally hard. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We systematically incorporate the implicit substitution between added sugars and solid fats into a comprehensive food demand system and evaluate the effect of taxes on sugars and fats. The approach conditions how food and obesity taxes affect total calorie intake. The proposed methodology accounts for the ability of consumers to substitute leaner low-fat and low-sugar items for rich food items within the same food group. We calibrate this demand system approach using recent food intake data and existing estimates of price and income elasticities of demand. The demand system accounts for both the within-food group substitution and the substitution across these groups. Simulations of taxes on added sugars and solid fat show that the tax impact on consumption patterns is understated and the induced welfare loss is overstated when not allowing for the substitution possibilities within food groups.

While it has been known since the eighteenth century that the Borda and Condorcet winners need not agree, it had not been known, for instance, in which settings the Condorcet and plurality winners can disagree, or must agree. Results of this type are developed here for all three-alternative positional rules. These relationships are based on an easily used method that connects pairwise tallies with admissible positional outcomes; e.g., a special case provides the first necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring that the Condorcet winner is the plurality winner; another case identifies when there must be a profile whereby each candidate is the winner with some positional rule.

Robust empirical evidence to this effect is lacking. To explore societal preferences for these and other criteria, including those proposed for rewarding new medicines under the future value-based pricing (VBP) system, we conducted a choice-based experiment in 4118 UK adults via web-based surveys. Preferences were determined by asking respondents to allocate fixed funds between different patient and disease types reflecting nine specific prioritisation criteria. Respondents supported the criteria proposed under the VBP system (for severe diseases, address unmet needs, are innovativeprovided they offered substantial health benefits, and have wider societal benefits) but did not support the end-of-life premium or the prioritisation of children or disadvantaged populations as specified by NICE, nor the special funding status for treatments of rare diseases, nor the CDF. Policies introduced on the basis of perceivedand not actualsocietal values may lead to inappropriate resource allocation decisions with the potential for significant population health and economic consequences.

In the particular case where there are two attributes and where the distribution of one of these two attributes is fixed, one can appeal to sequential rank order dominance for comparing distributions. We show that sequential rank order domination of one distribution over another implies that the dominating distribution can be obtained from the dominated one by means of a finite sequence of favourable permutations, and conversely. We provide two examples where favourable permutations prove to have interesting implications from a normative point of view. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the effect of PE on child weight. This paper measures that effect by instrumenting for child PE time with the state's mandated minimum number of minutes of PE, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) for 1998-2004. Results from IV models indicate that PE lowers BMI z-score and reduces the probability of obesity among 5th graders. This effect is concentrated among boys; we find evidence that this gender difference is partly attributable to PE being a complement with other physical activity for boys, whereas they are substitutes for girls. This represents some of the first evidence of a causal effect of PE on youth obesity, and thus offers at least some support for the assumptions behind the CDC recommendations. We find no evidence that increased PE time crowds out time in academic courses or has spillovers to achievement test scores. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to illustrate potential efficiency gains from reallocating Medicare expenditures by using cost-effectiveness information, and the consequences for health gains among Medicare beneficiaries. Methods: We included national coverage determinations from 1999 through 2007. Estimates of cost-effectiveness were identified through a literature review. For coverage decisions with an associated cost-effectiveness estimate, we estimated utilization and size of the unserved eligible population by using a Medicare claims database (2007) and diagnostic and reimbursement codes. Technology costs originated from the cost-effectiveness literature or were estimated by using reimbursement codes. We illustrated potential aggregate health gains from increasing utilization of dominant interventions (i.e., cost saving and health increasing) and from reallocating expenditures by decreasing investment in cost-ineffective interventions and increasing investment in relatively cost-effective interventions. Results: Complete information was available for 36 interventions. Increasing investment in dominant interventions alone led to an increase of 270,000 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and savings of $12.9 billion. Reallocation of a broader array of interventions yielded an additional 1.8 million QALYs, approximately 0.17 QALYs per affected Medicare beneficiary. Compared with the distribution of resources prior to reallocation, following reallocation a greater proportion was directed to oncology, diagnostic imaging/tests, and the most prevalent diseases. A smaller proportion of resources went to cardiology, treatments (including drugs, surgeries, and medical devices, as opposed to nontreatments such as preventive services), and the least prevalent diseases. Conclusions: Using cost-effectiveness information has the potential to increase the aggregate health of Medicare beneficiaries while maintaining existing spending levels.","[Chambers, James D.; Lord, Joanne; Buxton, Martin J.] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Chambers, James D.; Cohen, Joshua T.; Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Brunel University; Tufts Medical Center,"Chambers, JD (通讯作者)，Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 800 Washington St 63, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",jchambers@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,"Embrett, Mark G./H-4466-2014; Lord, Joanne/H-1417-2011","Embrett, Mark G./0000-0002-3969-0219; Lord, Joanne/0000-0003-1086-1624; Cohen, Joshua/0000-0003-1737-0991",Commonwealth Fund [20090203],Commonwealth Fund,This research was funded in part by a grant from the Commonwealth Fund (Grant No. 20090203).,,38,17,17,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,629,638,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.02.011,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796298.0,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900023,0

We exploit formal economic theories and a rich national data of providers to tease out implications for operational cost efficiencies. The 2008-2009 dataset comprising over 19 000 bi-weekly, site-specific physical therapy center observations across 28 US states and Occupational Employment Statistics data (Bureau of Labor Statistics) includes measures of output, three labor types (clinical, support, and administrative), and facilities (capital). We discuss findings from the iterative seemingly unrelated regression estimation system model. The generalized translog cost estimates indicate a well-behaved underlying technology structure. We also find the following: (i) factor demands are downwardly sloped; (ii) pair-wise factor relationships largely reflect substitutions; (iii) factor demand for physical therapists is more inelastic compared with that for administrative staff; and (iv) diminishing scale economies exist at the 25%, 50%, and 75% output (patient visits) levels. Our findings advance the timely economic understanding of operations in an increasingly important segment of the medical care sector that has, up-to-now (because of data paucity), been missing from healthcare efficiency analysis. Our work further provides baseline estimates for comparing operational efficiencies in physical therapy care after implementations of the 2010 US healthcare reforms.

Examples of simulated and trial data are presented: firstly to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of CMA in the context of non-inferiority trials and those finding no significant difference in efficacy and secondly to assess whether CMA gives biased results.We show that CMA is still used and will bias measures of uncertainty, causing overestimation or underestimation of the value of information and the probability that treatment is cost-effective. Although bias will be negligible for non-inferiority studies comparing treatments that differ enormously in cost, it is generally necessary to collect and analyse data on costs and efficacy (including utilities) to assess this bias. Cost-effectiveness analysis (including evaluation of the joint distribution of costs and benefits) is almost always required to avoid biased estimation of uncertainty. The remit of CMA in trial-based economic evaluation is therefore even narrower than previously thought, suggesting that CMA is not only dead but should also be buried.

Our objective was to determine whether giving patients a resource use log (RUL) at baseline would improve the odds of completing questions in a follow-up resource use questionnaire (RUQ) and to identify patients' views on RUL's usefulness and acceptability. Methods: The RUL study was a randomized controlled trial and qualitative study nested within a larger randomized controlled trial (the Arthroplasty Pain Experience Study trial). Eighty-five patients were randomized at baseline to receive or not receive an RUL. At 3-month follow-up, all participants received a postal RUQ. We created dummy variables for 13 resource use categories indicating whether complete information had been given for each category. We compared the completion rates between arms by using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. We explored patients' experience of using the RUL by interviewing a different subsample of Arthroplasty Pain Experience Study patients (n = 24) at 2- to 4-week follow-up. Results: At 3 months, 74 of the 85 (87% in each arm) patients returned the RUQ. Patients in the RUL arm were 3.5 times more likely to complete the National Health Service community-based services category (P = 0.08). The RUL was positively received by patients and was generally seen as a useful memory aid. Conclusions: The RUL is a useful and acceptable tool in reducing the amount of missing data for some types of resource use.","[Marques, Elsa; Noble, Sian] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Johnson, Emma C.; Gooberman-Hill, Rachael; Blom, Ashley W.] Univ Bristol, Musculoskeletal Res Unit, Sch Clin Sci, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England",University of Bristol; University of Bristol,"Marques, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",e.marques@bristol.ac.uk,,"Blom, Ashley/0000-0002-9940-1095; Marques, Elsa/0000-0003-1360-5677; Noble, Sian/0000-0002-8011-0722; Gooberman-Hill, Rachael/0000-0003-3353-2882","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in England under its Programme Grants for Applied Research funding scheme [RP-PG-0407-10070]; MRC Hubs for Trial Methodology Research [G0800800]; NIHR, through the Comprehensive Clinical Research Network (NIHR CRN) [7664]; North Bristol NHS Trust; Medical Research Council [G0800800] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-0407-10070] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0800800] Funding Source: UKRI","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in England under its Programme Grants for Applied Research funding scheme; MRC Hubs for Trial Methodology Research(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); NIHR, through the Comprehensive Clinical Research Network (NIHR CRN); North Bristol NHS Trust; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This article outlines independent research commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in England under its Programme Grants for Applied Research funding scheme (grant number RP-PG-0407-10070).

The causal mechanism is unclear: do children who work less become informal caregivers, or are children who become caregivers working less? Using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, we identify the relationship between informal care and work in the United States, both on the intensive and extensive margins, and examine wage effects. We control for time-invariant individual heterogeneity; rule out or control for endogeneity; examine effects for men and women separately; and analyze heterogeneous effects by task and intensity. We find modest decreases-2.4 percentage points in the likelihood of working for male caregivers providing personal care. Female chore caregivers, meanwhile, are more likely to be retired. For female care providers who remain working, we find evidence that they decrease work by 3-10 hours per week and face a 3 percent lower wage than non-caregivers. We find little effect of caregiving on working men's hours or wages. These estimates suggest that the opportunity costs to informal care providers are important to consider when making policy recommendations about the design and funding of public long-term care programs.

Methods: Three hundred seventy-seven subjects with a clinically isolated syndrome or relapsing remitting MS participated in the study. Subjects underwent neurological examinations and completed patient-reported outcome and cognitive measures. Subjects also completed the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health to quantify absenteeism (missing work because of health problems), presenteeism (impairment while working), overall work impairment, and daily activity impairment attributable to health problems. Univariate correlations and multivariate models were used to determine the associations between each work productivity variable and clinical, patient-reported outcome, and cognitive measures. Results: Seventy-six percent of subjects were employed. Fourteen percent of working subjects reported absenteeism, and 47% reported presenteeism. The mean work time lost because of absenteeism was 4%, and the mean work time lost because of presenteeism was 12%. Absenteeism was not significantly associated with disease or patient-reported outcome measures. Statistically significant correlations (0.32-0.53) were found between presenteeism and increasing disability, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life. No associations were observed between presenteeism and disease duration or cognitive function. Conclusions: Subjects with clinically isolated syndrome/relapsing remitting MS reported substantial work productivity losses due to presenteesim. Presenteeism was associated with increasing fatigue, depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life. It is possible that the early identification and treatment of fatigue and mental health symptoms may improve productivity while working and extend employment for individuals with MS.","[Glanz, Bonnie I.; Degano, Irene R.; Rintell, David J.; Chitnis, Tanuja; Weiner, Howard L.; Healy, Brian C.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Partners Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Brookline, MA 02445 USA; [Glanz, Bonnie I.; Degano, Irene R.; Rintell, David J.; Chitnis, Tanuja; Weiner, Howard L.; Healy, Brian C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Healy, Brian C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Biostat Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital,"Glanz, BI (通讯作者)，Brigham & Womens Hosp, Partners Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, 1 Brookline Pl,Suite 227, Brookline, MA 02445 USA.",bglanz@partners.org,"Degano, Irene/ABG-5341-2020; Degano, Irene Roman/C-1826-2012","Rintell, David/0000-0003-2951-5086; Degano, Irene R./0000-0003-1914-6934",Nancy Davis Foundation; Merck Serono S.A.,Nancy Davis Foundation; Merck Serono S.A.,Source of financial support: This research was funded in part by the Nancy Davis Foundation and Merck Serono S.A.,,50,110,122,1,52,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1029,1035,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.07.010,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244804.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300006,0

Our most important finding is that the commonly used ACCRA price data are unlikely to reliably indicate alcohol demand elasticities-estimates obtained from this source vary drastically and unpredictably. As an alternative, researchers often use beer taxes to proxy for alcohol prices. While the estimated beer taxes elasticities are more stable, there are several problems with using taxes, including difficulties in accounting for cross-price effects. We believe that the most useful estimates reported in this paper are obtained using annual Uniform Product Code (UPC) barcode scanner data on grocery store alcohol prices. These estimates suggest relatively low demand elasticity, probably around -0.3, with evidence that the elasticities are considerably overstated in models that control for beer but not wine or spirits prices.

The tests are compared by the exponential rates of growth to one of the power functions evaluated at a fixed alternative while keeping the asymptotic sizes bounded by some constant. We present two sets of sufficient conditions for a test to be Hodges-Lehmann optimal. These new conditions extend the scope of the Hodges-Lehmann optimality analysis to setups that cannot be covered by other conditions in the literature. The general result is illustrated by our applications of interest: testing for moment conditions and overidentifying restrictions. In particular, we show that (i) the empirical likelihood test does not necessarily satisfy existing conditions for optimality but does satisfy our new conditions; and (ii) the generalized method of moments (GMM) test and the generalized empirical likelihood (GEL) tests are Hodges-Lehmann optimal under mild primitive conditions. These results support the belief that the Hodges-Lehmann optimality is a weak asymptotic requirement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, this paper estimates the percentage of the US military-age population that exceeds the US Army's current active duty enlistment standards for weight-for-height and percent body fat, using data from the series of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys that spans 1959-2008. We calculate that the percentage of military-age adults ineligible for enlistment because they are overweight and overfat more than doubled for men and tripled for women during that time. As of 2007-2008, 5.7 million men and 16.5 million women exceeded the Army's enlistment standards for weight and body fat. We document disparities across race and education in exceeding the standards and estimate that a further rise of just 1% in weight and body fat would further reduce eligibility for military service by over 850?000 men and 1.3 million women. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for military recruitment and defense policy.

We find that the ability of the wild bootstrap to provide a higher order refinement is contingent upon whether the errors are mean independent of the regressors or merely uncorrelated with them. In the latter case, the wild bootstrap may fail to match some of the terms in an Edgeworth expansion of the full sample test statistic. Nonetheless, we show that the wild bootstrap still has a lower maximal asymptotic risk as an estimator of the true distribution than a normal approximation, in shrinking neighborhoods of properly specified models. To assess the practical implications of this result we conduct a Monte Carlo study contrasting the performance of the wild bootstrap with a normal approximation and the traditional nonparametric bootstrap.

This property relies on the existence of dominance regions: all players have a highest and lowest action that, for some fundamentals, is strictly dominant. But if the fundamental follows a random walk, it eventually spends nearly all of its time in these regions: crises gradually disappear. We obtain recurring crises by adding a single large player who lacks dominance regions. We also show that in order to obtain recurring crises, one must either relax dominance regions or restrict to fundamentals that continually return to or cross over a fixed region.

Our approach focuses on the negative effect that finite-sample estimation error has on forecast accuracy despite the presence of significant population-level predictive content. We derive in-sample tests that assess whether a variable has predictive content and whether this content is estimated precisely enough to improve forecast accuracy. Our tests are asymptotically non-central chi-square or non-central normal. We provide a convenient bootstrap for computing critical values. In Monte Carlo and empirical analysis, we examine the effectiveness of our testing procedure. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The test is consistent against the chaotic alternatives. A simulation study shows that the test performs reasonably well in finite samples.

Methods: We developed a disease simulation model integrating epidemiological and clinical data from the literature to simulate the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and a combination of both on a US pediatric population with major depressive disorder. Results: In a cohort of 1,000,000 simulated individuals (ages 10-24 years), the use of SSRIs was associated with the highest number of suicide-related events, while CBT was associated with the lowest number. Over a 5-year period, the strategy with the highest number of symptom-free weeks depended on assumptions made regarding treatment efficacy beyond the available clinical data. Conclusions: Considering the risk-benefit profile over a 5-year period, CBT offers a safer profile than combination treatment or SSRIs alone with respect to suicide deaths and attempts. Any additional benefits of SSRIs, either alone or in combination with CBT, must be weighed against the expected increase in suicides.","[Soeteman, Djora I.; Kim, Jane J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Decis Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Miller, Matthew; Kim, Jane J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.
