The network theory is not able to capture in detail the nature and source of interaction, and therefore the focal point is the concept of destination governance that applied the corporate governance theory (Beritelli, Bieger and Laesser, 2007; Nordin and Svensson, 2007; Baggio, Scott and Cooper, 2010; Pechlaner, Volgger and Herntrei, 2012).

The focus will be on a very popular one-sample t-test, as well as on a Behrens-Fisher problem, i.e. on hypothesis testing concerning the difference between expected values of two random variables with unknown and possibly different variances. Based on a simulation study the consequences of different forms of non-normality will be examined for various sample sizes. Type I and type II errors of the classical tests will be then compared with those of appropriate nonparametric tests, specifically with the errors of the Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests, as well as the tests based on bootstrap methodology. Based on the results of the conducted simulation study it can be inferred that the classical t-tests tend to be conservative or liberal depending on a form of non-normality. It will be also demonstrated that in case of a contaminated distribution with possible outliers the Wilcoxon tests should be always considered, and that for skewed data and a large sample size the bootstrap BCa method may also be preferable.","Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Marcinko, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",xmart14@vse.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",,,978-83-7695-421-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,180,189,,,,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9JN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356491900020,0

One of the most important starting points is the matrix of regional consumption expenditures. These data are not officially published, but were estimated in the preceding research. It is essential to estimate not only regional final consumption expenditures of households, but also of general government and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs). These data are estimated for 14 Czech NUTS 3 regions taking into account all possible data sources accessible. The results are computed for the year 2011 using the most up-to-date national accounts information available. Moreover, regional price levels are taken into consideration. Regional households' consumption expenditures are subsequently compared with net disposable income of households and selected social statistics indicators and a brief regional analysis of well-being of households is carried out. Data on regional consumption expenditures need to be transformed to become suitable for regional input-output modeling. Therefore, commodity structure of consumption expenditures is estimated and all figures are transferred from purchasers' prices to basic prices. Further, the applicability of regional consumption expenditures for multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model is discussed in the paper.","[Musil, Petr; Zeman, Jan] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Kramulova, Jana] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Studies, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Musil, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",petr.musil@vse.cz; jana.kramulova@vse.cz; jan.zeman@vse.cz,"Musil, Petr/HSB-9652-2023","Musil, Petr/0000-0002-8457-4559",,,,,15,1,1,0,6,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",,,978-83-7695-421-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,200,207,,,,,,8,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9JN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356491900022,0

The aim of the paper is to evaluate and compare the development of regional disparities in Visegrad Four (V4) countries over the period 2001-2011 by utilizing the selected multicriteria decision-making methods. Applying TOPSIS and AHP methods we get the final ranking of V4 NUTS 2 regions based on the shortest distances to the ideal solution and the farthest from the negative ideal solution. Also, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to study the impact of different weights on the scores of relative closeness to ideal solution (c(i)) and regions' ranking. Although some positive changes in disparities trend are observed during the examined period (especially in Poland), disparities have still persisted between NUTS 2 regions with capital cities (Praha, Bratislavsky kraj, Mazowieckie, Kozep-Magyarorszag) and more distant regions on the one hand and between Czech regions and Hungarian, Polish and Slovak regions on the other hand. The sensitivity analysis also shows that the importance of criteria influences the final ranking of regions. In the absence of the mainstream to regional disparities evaluation, this paper can be understood as a contribution to the discussion about the quantitative measurement of disparities between regions.","VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Poledníková, E (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",eva.polednikova@vsb.cz,"Polednikova, Eva/J-5333-2018","Polednikova, Eva/0000-0001-8645-5716",,,,,21,16,16,0,11,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6840-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,54,61,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6840-2014-5,0.0,,,8,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536900006,0

It aims description and quantification of the financial management of municipalities in the Slovak Republic in the period 2000 to 2010 followed by the identification of trends in selected components of financial management, as well as the overall management of municipalities and specification of conditions and changes in the planning of revenues and expenses during the period. When processing the present paper, we mainly used the method of analysis, synthesis and comparison of available statistical data on financial management of municipalities in the Slovak Republic, descriptive methods, by specifying legal conditions and changes in the budgetary management, mathematical and statistical methods in quantifying the financial management and identifying trends of certain components of revenues and expenses, as well as abstraction, induction and deduction methods. The time period from 2000 to 2010 was chosen for two reasons. First reason, it is the realization of several phases of public administration reform in Slovakia, as well as because of the negative impact of the economic crisis on the budget (mainly tax) incomes of villages and towns. For above 11 years, the conditions for financial planning and management fundamentally changed. Their volume and structure are mainly related to the transition of many competencies from government to local and regional authorities. The problem was late fiscal decentralization, but also to the persistent underfunding transferred state administration to municipalities is forced to bring in their own resources. Despite a number of negative effects is evident from the analysis that the total revenues and costs of local governments in the Slovak Republic are growing in absolute terms, slightly increasing the relative share of investment spending. At the same time, we found that current incomes stagnate, slightly decreasing and increases the share of income of a capital nature, it can mean both increasing loan burden, respectively, sale of property, from which income is disposable and never to be repeated in the future. These facts are a challenge for further investigation.

These goals, together with the analysis of local specifics in the process of creation of local and regional strategic development documents, should create functional and flexible tool for support of activities related to the development of RES technologies with an accent on utilization of the local and regional potential.","[Koziak, Radoslav; Suchy, Michal] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Koziak, R (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",radoslav.koziak@umb.sk; michal.suchy@umb.sk,"Kožiak, Radoslav/AAA-9190-2021","Kožiak, Radoslav/0000-0003-0888-7980",,,,,7,5,5,0,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6840-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,120,126,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6840-2014-13,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536900014,0

The study procedure encompass the analysis of the horizontal redistribution scale in the all 16 regions in Poland, the analysis of the financial situation of the voivodeships in the years 2008-2012, using the databases of the Ministry of Finances, and also the comparative analysis of initial indicators and the corrected indicators obtained as a result of excluding income streams resulting from the equalisation mechanism. Therefore, for the better understanding the importance of the subsidy redistribution mechanism, it was necessary to reduce the calculation elements of the indicators by their value. In the majority of cases omitting the subsidy in the calculation resulted in the deterioration of the budgetary indicators in the half of voivodeships. It should be noticed that in the most extreme cases, the volume of subventions received was as much as twice the size of own revenue. This may attest to the striking maladjustment between the structure of regional income and the regional financing demands. It must be also noted that the outflow of proceeds under the pending 'Robin Hood tax' regulations - in the case of the Mazovian Voivodship(mazowieckie) - reached as much as a third of regional revenue, overall. This has the effect of greatly reducing the level of financing available for self-governing regions. In the Mazovian Voivodeship, the adopted fiscal solution resulted in liquidity loss.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Finance, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Olejniczak, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Finance, Komandorska St 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",jaroslaw.olejniczak@ue.wroc.pl,"Olejniczak, Jarosław/F-7780-2014","Olejniczak, Jarosław/0000-0003-2028-8446",,,,,1,1,1,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6840-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,393,401,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6840-2014-49,0.0,,,9,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536900050,0

The idea of this approach is to replicate a suitably chosen financial index as a convex linear combination (i.e. portfolio) of pre-selected assets that are components of the given synthetic financial index. In this approach, a tracking portfolio that performs as best as the financial index serving the function of benchmark and follows its path of returns is constructed and sought. However, a question arises whether the replication portfolio found under the tracking error variance minimization strategy should be left without alterations (non-rebalanced) or adjusted in respect to market movements (or rebalanced). This is of practical implications as rebalancing induces undesirable transaction costs, and the investor must choose whether he will rebalance his portfolio on a regular periodic basis. In the paper, under the tracking error variance minimization approach, practical aspects of both the buy-and-hold strategy and the rebalancing strategy are investigated with respect to net returns (returns including transaction costs) and to portfolio volatility.","[Bod'a, Martin; Kanderova, Maria] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Bod'a, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",martin.boda@umb.sk; maria.kanderova@umb.sk,"Boďa, Martin/J-3602-2016","Boďa, Martin/0000-0002-7503-6898",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",,,978-83-7695-421-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,26,35,,,,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9JN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356491900003,0

These inequalities are formulated in a very general way that does not require the empirical risk to be a usual sample average over independent observations.

The joint distribution of the random vector is formulated by means of an absolutely continuous copula, allowing for a variety of different dependence structures between the summands. The obtained expression for the distribution of the sum features a separation property into marginal and dependence structure contributions typical for copula approaches. Along the same lines we obtain the formulation of a conditional expectation closely related to the expected shortfall common in actuarial and financial literature. We further exploit the separation to introduce new numerical algorithms to compute the distribution and quantile function, as well as this conditional expectation. A comparison with the most common competitors shows that the discussed Path Integration algorithm is the most suitable method for computing these quantities. In our example, we apply the theory to compute Value-at-Risk forecasts for a trivariate portfolio of index returns. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Bayesian random-effects PMAs were performed for each pharmacotherapy vs. placebo, and a Bayesian random-effects NMA was performed combining both placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials. Both provided comparative rate ratio (RR) estimates between each pharmacotherapy vs. placebo. A Markov model was developed to project costs and quality-adjusted life-years of five commonly used treatments for chronic obsructive pulmonary disorder. RRs for the treatment effect compared with placebo derived using PMA and NMA were used alongside values from the literature to populate the model. In addition to standard cost-effectiveness outputs, we calculated and compared the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) for treatment effects, for comparisons that included all or a subset of treatments. The network of evidence included five different treatments, compared in 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which in total included 28,172 individuals. The cost-effectiveness outcomes were similar between the two evidence-synthesis paradigms. The individual EVPI for all treatments was Can$1,262 for PMA-based analyses and Can$572 for NMA-based analyses. For all comparisons involving two, three, or four treatments, the comparison with the highest EVPI was different between the two methods. Similarly, the choice of PMA or NMA had resulted in substantially different EVPPI rankings. Our case study shows that the choice of PMA or NMA can have significant effects on the EVI results. Under comparable conditions, the incorporation of more evidence in the NMA most likely increases the precision of estimates and therefore is likely to result in lower EVI outcomes. As our study demonstrates, the difference in EVI outcomes can be substantial, potentially affecting the decision to conduct research and the design of future research.","[Zafari, Zafar; Marra, Carlo A.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Collaborat Outcome Res & Evaluat, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Zafari, Zafar; Sadatsafavi, Mohsen] Vancouver Coastal Hlth Inst, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Evaluat, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Thorlund, Kristian] Stanford Univ, Stanford Prevent Res Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Thorlund, Kristian] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [FitzGerald, J.

The probabilistic framework is based on a multiple state continuous and time inhomogeneous Markov model. We provide an estimate of transition intensities from the healthy state to the sickness state when only prevalence rates of sickness are available, according to an extension and modification of the methodology proposed in Olivieri (1996) for Long Term Care insurance.

Usually, the ratemaking process is done in two steps. In the first step, a priori ratemaking, an a priori premium is computed based on the characteristics of the insureds. In the second step, called the a posteriori ratemaking, the past claims experience of each insured is considered to the a priori premium and set the final net premium. In practice, for automobile insurance, this correction is usually done with bonus-malus systems, or variations on them, which offer many advantages. In recent years, insurers have accumulated longitudinal information on their policyholders, and actuaries can now use many years of informations for a single insured. For this kind of data, called panel or longitudinal data, we propose an alternative to the two-step ratemaking approach and argue this old approach should no longer be used. As opposed to a posteriori models of cross-section data, the models proposed in this paper generate premiums based on empirical results rather than inductive probability. We propose a new way to deal with bonus-malus systems when panel data are available. Using car insurance data, a numerical illustration using at-fault and non-at-fault claims of a Canadian insurance company is included to support this discussion. Even if we apply the model for car insurance, as long as another line of business uses past claim experience to set the premiums, we maintain that a similar approach to the model proposed should be used.","[Boucher, Jean-Philippe; Inoussa, Rofick] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Math, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Boucher, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Math, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",boucher.jean-philippe@uqam.ca; inoussa.rofick_ayinde@uqam.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),The authors would like to thank an anonymous referee for his/her careful reading of the manuscript and the resulting comments that greatly helped to improve the paper.

We randomly assign an $8.50 incentive to households in rural Bangladesh to temporarily out-migrate during the lean season. The incentive induces 22% of households to send a seasonal migrant, their consumption at the origin increases significantly, and treated households are 8-10 percentage points more likely to re-migrate 1 and 3 years after the incentive is removed. These facts can be explained qualitatively by a model in which migration is risky, mitigating risk requires individual-specific learning, and some migrants are sufficiently close to subsistence that failed migration is very costly. We document evidence consistent with this model using heterogeneity analysis and additional experimental variation, but calibrations with forward-looking households that can save up to migrate suggest that it is difficult for the model to quantitatively match the data.

Using this decomposition, we arrive at a novel strategy for estimating a plausibly causal effect of land use regulation on land value and welfare. This strategy exploits cross-border changes in development, prices, and regulation in regions near municipal borders.

To this end, we introduce a weighting scheme that accounts for the similarity of previous market conditions to the present situation. The resulting estimators are less biased and show lower variance than either unweighted or exponentially weighted estimators. The weighting scheme is based on a similarity measure that compares the current correlation structure of the market to the structures at past times. Similarity is then measured by the matrix 2-norm of the difference of probe correlation matrices estimated for two different points in time. The method is validated in a simulation study and tested empirically in the context of mean-variance portfolio optimization. In the latter case we find an enhanced realized portfolio return as well as a reduced portfolio risk compared with alternative approaches based on different strategies and estimators.","[Muennix, M.

The model structure was based on a decision tree developed by the Swedish TLV (TandvAyenrds- och lakemedelsformAyennsverket) and adapted to the Belgium healthcare setting, using primary local data on the patterns of treatment and following KCE [Federal Knowledge Center (Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de Gezondheidszorg)] recommendations. Comparators were escitalopram, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. In the model, patients not achieving remission or relapsing after remission on the assessed treatment moved to a second therapeutic step (titration, switch, add-on, or transfer to a specialist). In case of failure in the second step or following a suicide attempt, patients were assumed to be referred to secondary care. The time horizon was 1 year and the analysis was conducted from the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI; national health insurance) and societal perspectives. Remission rates were obtained from the TLV network meta-analysis and risk of relapse, efficacy following therapeutic change, risk of suicide attempts and related death, utilities, costs (2012), and resources were derived from the published literature and expert opinion. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters was estimated through scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). In the base-case analysis, escitalopram was identified as the optimal strategy: it dominated all other treatments except venlafaxine from the NIHDI perspective, against which it was cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a,not sign6,352 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Escitalopram also dominated all other treatments from the societal perspective. At a threshold of a,not sign30,000 per QALY and from the NIHDI perspective, the PSA showed that the probability of escitalopram being identified as the optimal strategy ranged from 61 % (vs. venlafaxine) to 100 % (vs. fluoxetine). Escitalopram was associated with the highest probability of being the optimal treatment from the NIHDI and societal perspectives. This analysis, based on new Belgian clinical practice data and following KCE requirements, provides additional information that may be used to guide the choice of treatments in the management of MDD in Belgium.","[Annemans, Lieven] Ghent Univ Hosp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Brignone, Melanie] Lundbeck SAS, Issy Les Moulineaux, France; [Druais, Sylvain; Gauthier, Aline] Amaris, London, England; [De Pauw, Ann] Lundbeck Belgium, Brussels, Belgium; [Demyttenaere, Koen] Univ Hosp Gasthuisberg, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University Hospital; Lundbeck Corporation; Lundbeck Corporation - France; KU Leuven; University Hospital Leuven,"Annemans, L (通讯作者)，Ghent Univ Hosp, Block A,2nd Fl,De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Lieven.annemans@ugent.be,"demyttenaere, koen/AAG-4716-2021",,Lundbeck SAS; Lundbeck,Lundbeck SAS(Lundbeck Corporation); Lundbeck(Lundbeck Corporation),The study was funded by Lundbeck SAS.

The main goal of our study is to analyse the role of the Mood Maintenance Hypothesis (MMH) in financial markets. MMH refers to people's tendency to maintain positive mood states, and implies that positive mood is associated with less critical thinking and reduced information processing, yielding three behavioral effects: (i) out of the blue, resulting in stronger negative reactions to bad news during good mood periods, (ii) sunray on a cloudy day, leading to stronger positive reactions to good news during bad mood periods, and (iii) shallow thinking, producing stronger reactions to all kinds of news during good mood periods. Employing daylight duration changes and a measure of onset and recovery from symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) as proxies for contemporaneous investors' mood, we test the role of mood in investors' reactions to analyst recommendation revisions. We find corroborative results, most notably that negative stock price reactions to recommendation downgrades are significantly stronger during daylight increasing periods, and, alternatively, during the periods characterized by low rates of onset and high rates of recovery from SAD. The magnitude of the effect increases in longer event windows.","[Kliger, Doron; Kudryavtsev, Andrey] Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Kudryavtsev, A (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",kud.andrey@gmail.com,,"Kliger, Doron/0000-0001-7649-8464",,,,,54,7,10,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The challenge of limited healthcare resources means that the dissemination of these technologies will be dependent on their value in relation to their cost, i.e., their cost effectiveness. Phelps and Mushlin have described how to optimize tests to meet a cost-effectiveness target. However, when tests are applied repeatedly the case mix of the patients tested changes with each administration, and this impacts upon the value of each subsequent test administration. In this article, we present a modification of Phelps and Mushlin's framework for diagnostic tests; to identify the cost-effective cut-off for monitoring tests. Using the Ca125 test monitoring for relapse in ovarian cancer, we show how the repeated use of the initial cut-off can lead to a substantially increased false-negative rate compared with the monitoring cut-off-over 4 % higher than in this example-with the associated harms for individual and population health.","[Longo, Roberta; Hall, Peter; Hewison, Jenny] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Baxter, Paul] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Genet Hlth & Therapeut, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Afshar, Mehran; Hall, Geoff] Leeds Teaching Hosp NHS Trust, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [McCabe, Christopher] Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, Capital Hlth Endowed Res Chair, Edmonton, AB T6G 0B7, Canada",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Alberta,"McCabe, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, Capital Hlth Endowed Res Chair, Suite 736 Univ Terrace,8303 112 St, Edmonton, AB T6G 0B7, Canada.",mccabe1@ualberta.ca,"Hall, Geoff D/A-1717-2010; McCabe, Christopher J/E-2051-2016; Hall, Peter S/O-3131-2019; Longo, Roberta/ABB-5448-2020","Hall, Geoff D/0000-0002-8864-5932; Hall, Peter S/0000-0001-6015-7841; Baxter, Paul/0000-0003-2699-3103","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme [RP-PG-0707-10101]; Medical Technologies Innovation and Knowledge Centre - UK Research Councils; EPSRC; BBSRC; Technology Strategy Board; Genome Canada Large Scale Applied Research Program on Personalized Medicine; MRC [MR/L01629X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/L01629X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0509-10020, CL-2012-02-501, RP-PG-0707-10101] Funding Source: researchfish",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Medical Technologies Innovation and Knowledge Centre - UK Research Councils; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Technology Strategy Board; Genome Canada Large Scale Applied Research Program on Personalized Medicine; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This article presents independent research partially funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme (RP-PG-0707-10101: Evaluating the benefits for patients and the NHS of new and existing biological fluid biomarkers in liver and renal disease).

Measurement errors will influence the dynamic properties of the observed process and may conceal the persistence of the underlying time series. In this paper we develop instrumental variable (IV) methods for extracting information about the latent process. Our framework can be used to estimate the autocorrelation function of the latent volatility process and a key persistence parameter. Our analysis is motivated by the recent literature on realized volatility measures that are imperfect estimates of actual volatility. In an empirical analysis using realized measures for the Dow Jones industrial average stocks, we find the underlying volatility to be near unit root in all cases. Although standard unit root tests are asymptotically justified, we find them to be misleading in our application despite the large sample. Unit root tests that are based on the IV estimator have better finite sample properties in this context.","[Hansen, Peter R.] European Univ Inst, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [Hansen, Peter R.; Lunde, Asger] CREATES, Warwick, England; [Lunde, Asger] Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",European University Institute; CREATES; Aarhus University,"Hansen, PR (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Via Piazzuola 43, I-50133 Florence, Italy.",peter.hansen@eiu.eu,"Lunde, Asger/AAH-2136-2020","Hansen, Peter Reinhard/0000-0001-9728-4860; Lunde, Asger/0000-0002-0805-0892",Danish National Research Foundation,Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"The authors thank participants at the 2006 Zeuthen Lectures at University of Copenhagen, the 2008 SOFIE inaugural conference, and the 2008 workshop at Stanford Institute for Theoretical Economics.

However the trend of energy inputs (TWh) decreases since 1985. The research project ARCHIVES aims to lift this contradiction. The knowledge of the past should inform the debate and allow a bet winner on the future. To this end, retrospective forecast of the level flows involves dendrochronology, i.e. tree-ring analysis with a view to dating timber.

This toolkit proposes a discovering path step with an active measuring step for estimating delays. As for our anomaly detection step, we exploit HIDDeN: this tool aims at interpreting delay characteristics (on pair packet or packet train techniques): It has then been enriched by the use of entropy and Hausdorff distances on probabilities of time series, which significantly decreases the number of false positives for the classification. The advantage of active measurement is its user oriented nature which allows anybody to cope with anomaly detection (whereas it is usually devoted to network administrators). Our approach then relies on analyzing time series of measured RTT delays. The originality of this toolkit is to propose a whole method to discover existing paths, measure and evaluate RTT time series. It relies also on how time series are computed in order to exhibit anomalous events and classify them. Real experiments for evaluating the effectiveness of the approach have been run on RE-NATER the French operational network.

A method is proposed in this study that is non-parametric and can be used assuming underlying white or red noise. The price to pay is that the method is computer intensive. Particularly, the proposed method is a Monte Carlo method based on random permutations of the original sample. The method may be applied to any spectral estimator and does not require any distributional assumptions.

The RC procedure deals with some of the limitations of previous studies, such as unknown functional forms, omitted variables, measurement errors, additive error terms, and the correlations between explanatory variables and their coefficients. Our main findings are as follows. First, the empirical results indicate that the values of the elasticities in the RC estimation are significantly different from those in other studies, because of the use of coefficient drivers. Second, by observing the time-varying behavior of the coefficients, we find some specific points in our time profile of coefficients; that is, we can make an association with real events occurring in Taiwan, such as the financial liberalization after 1989 and the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998.

The aim of this study was to explore the potential costs and benefits of childhood influenza vaccination to gain a better understanding of the key drivers of cost-effectiveness. As our case study we examined the cost-effectiveness of vaccination in Australian schoolchildren using an age-stratified Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered model. The results of this study highlight the critical role that methodological choices play in determining the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination. These choices include decisions about the structure of the model (including/excluding herd immunity) and what costs and benefits to include in the analysis. In scenarios where herd protection was included we estimated that the program was likely to be cost-effective. The study also illustrates the importance of the inherent seasonal variability of influenza, which can produce counter-intuitive results, with low transmission seasons being easier to control by vaccination but resulting in fewer benefits. Universal childhood influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective if a substantial herd protection effect can be achieved by the program. However, it is important that decision makers understand the role of seasonal variability and the impact of alternative methodological choices in economic evaluations of influenza vaccination.","[Newall, Anthony T.; Dehollain, Juan Pablo; Creighton, Prudence; Beutels, Philippe; Wood, James G.] Univ New S Wales, Fac Med, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Beutels, Philippe] Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, CHERMID, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Antwerp,"Newall, AT (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Fac Med, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",a.newall@unsw.edu.au; jpd@unsw.edu.au; p.creighton@unsw.edu.au; philippe.beutels@ua.ac.be; james.wood@unsw.edu.au,"Dehollain, Juan Pablo/G-9915-2012; Beutels, Philippe/A-1919-2010","Dehollain, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-0425-4345; Beutels, Philippe/0000-0001-5034-3595; Newall, Anthony/0000-0003-0836-1065","National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [630779, APP1031963]",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"This research was supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) grant (630779).

Our study is a significant addition to the literature that investigates herding behaviour in an industry context with asymmetric herding effects with respect to different market states, different stock exchanges, and the role of the information technology sector. Using recent daily data from 17 May 2001 through 16 May 2011, we demonstrate strong evidence of industry herding in the A-share markets. Evidence further supports that stock return dispersions from the information technology sector play a significant role in explaining the other sectors' herding activity. After examining bull and bear markets, herding is more profound in some sectors during a bull market. Finally, industry herding is more prevalent in the Shenzhen stock exchange, while for some sectors in the Shanghai stock exchange herding is more prevalent during a bull market state.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang; Hsieh, Kuan-Mien] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chen, Mei-Ping] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Accounting Informat, Taichung 40401, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Chen, MP (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Accounting Informat, 129,Sanmin Rd,Sec 3, Taichung 40401, Taiwan.",meiping@nutc.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020; Yan, Jing/JFA-6705-2023","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347;",,,,,46,53,54,6,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The objective of this study is to investigate the dynamics of the bivariate relationship between gold and silver prices. First, we investigate the spread, measured as the price difference between gold and silver trading as a futures contract. Then the presence of a fractal structure is measured using statistical techniques based on rescaled range analysis after accommodating short-term autocorrelated innovations in the return process. To highlight the economic consequences of fractality, we apply trading rules based upon the Hurst coefficient to the time series data. Importantly, we find that these rules out-perform simple buy-hold and moving-average strategies over varying holding periods.","[Batten, Jonathan A.] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ciner, Cetin] Univ N Carolina, Cameron Sch Business, Wilmington, NC 28401 USA; [Lucey, Brian M.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin Sch Business, Sutherland Ctr, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Lucey, Brian M.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Inst Int Integrat Studies, Sutherland Ctr, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Szilagyi, Peter G.] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington; Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; University of Cambridge,"Batten, JA (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jabatten@ust.hk,"lucey, brian/AAY-3885-2021; Szilagyi, Peter Gabor/AAC-8854-2019; Batten, Jonathan/J-3838-2013","lucey, brian/0000-0002-4052-8235; Szilagyi, Peter Gabor/0000-0003-1197-7928; Szilagyi, Peter/0000-0002-5539-9157; Batten, Jonathan/0000-0002-3871-7360",,,,,43,38,38,1,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The empirical study is carried out by estimating an extended Markov-switching Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle (GJR)-in-mean model with a Bayesian-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo methodology. The results indicate that stock markets in the Euro area display two significant regimes with distinct characteristics. Within a bear-market regime, stock returns have a negative relationship with volatility, and the volatility process responds asymmetrically to negative shocks to equity returns. The other regime appears to be a bull-market regime, within which the returns have a positive relationship with volatility, and volatility is lower and more persistent. We find also that there is a significant impact from fluctuations in short-term interest rates on the conditional variance and conditional returns in the Economic and Monetary Union countries. This impact is asymmetrical and appears to be stronger in bear markets and when interest rates change upward.","[Hou, Ai Jun] Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Hou, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",aijun@sam.sdu.dk,,,Bankforskningsinstitutet (the Swedish Institute of Banking Research),Bankforskningsinstitutet (the Swedish Institute of Banking Research),The author thanks the Bankforskningsinstitutet (the Swedish Institute of Banking Research) for providing the funding for this project.,,66,2,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The examination of the long-run equilibrium of the mortality rate relies on co-integration analysis, and a vector error correction model (VECM) is proposed for mortality forecasts. Mortality correlations among different countries under a VECM model are then derived. We take into account the mortality correlations across countries and utilize the multivariate Wang transform to derive the valuation formula for pricing the longevity bonds, with payoffs based on a combined weighted mortality index. This study illustrates the pattern of mortality correlations for men and women in the US and the UK, according to the Human Mortality Database.

Dividend strategies for this model that can be found in the literature include the barrier strategy (e.g., Avanzi et al., 2007) and the threshold strategy (e.g., Cheung, 2008), where dividend decisions are made continuously. While in practice the financial position of a company is typically monitored frequently, dividend decisions are only made periodically along with the publication of its books. In this paper, we introduce a dividend barrier strategy whereby dividend decisions are made only periodically, but still allow ruin to occur at any time (as soon as the surplus is exhausted). This is in contrast to Albrecher et al. (2011a), who introduced periodic dividend payments in the Cramer-Lundberg surplus model, albeit with periodic ruin opportunities as well. Under the assumption that the time intervals between dividend decisions are Erlang(n) distributed, we derive integro-differential equations for the Laplace transform of the time to ruin and the expected present value of dividends until ruin. These are then solved with the help of probabilistic arguments. We also provide a recursive algorithm to compute these quantities. Finally, some numerical studies are presented, which aim at illustrating how our assumptions about dividend payments and ruin occurrence compare with those of the classical barrier strategy.

The purpose of this study is to share the process used to complete these guideline revisions and to provide the contents of the revised guidelines. In developing the current revision, meetings with the advisory committee and working-level meetings with pharmaceutical companies were held several times to reach as much of a consensus as possible, and the results of a survey of pharmaceutical companies and decision makers regarding the existing guidelines were considered. The second version of the guidelines clarified the level of data requirement ('must', 'recommended', 'preferred') based on the data availability, the information needs of the decision makers and the strength of the evidence. The recommended perspective economic studies should take has been modified and additional guidance has been provided on QALY measurement. Manuals for systematic reviews and indirect comparisons have been published, and a standardized reporting format for expert opinions has been added.

The conflicts of interest between bondholders and shareholders affect the security prices significantly. In this paper, we investigate how to use a nonzero-sum game framework to model the interaction between bondholders and shareholders and to evaluate the bond accordingly. Mathematically, this problem can be reduced to a system of variational inequalities and we explicitly derive the Nash equilibrium to the game. Our model shows that credit risk and tax benefit have considerable impacts on the optimal strategies of both parties. The shareholder may issue a call when the debt is in-the-money or out-of-the-money. This is consistent with the empirical findings of late and early calls. In addition, the optimal call policy under our model offers an explanation for certain stylized patterns related to the returns of company assets and stocks on call.","[Chen, Nan; Wan, Xiangwei] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Dai, Min] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, Singapore, Singapore; [Wan, Xiangwei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; National University of Singapore; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Chen, N (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk,"Dai, Min/H-5328-2012; Wan, Xiangwei/AFE-0229-2022","Dai, Min/0000-0002-8270-9413;","Hong Kong Research Council [CUHK411108]; NUS RMI [R-146-000-124-720/646]; Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University","Hong Kong Research Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); NUS RMI; Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University","The authors are grateful for valuable comments from the anonymous referee, the associate editor, and Prof. Ernst Eberlein, the editor.

To find an analytic solution to the loss distribution may be misleading although this approach is frequently adopted in the actuarial literature. Moreover, it is well recognized that the loss distribution is strongly skewed with heavy tails and presents small, medium and large size claims which hardly can be fitted by a single analytic and parametric distribution. Here we propose a finite mixture of Skew Normal distributions that provides a better characterization of insurance data. We adopt a Bayesian approach to estimate the model, providing the likelihood and the priors for the all unknown parameters; we implement an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution.

It is problematic to capture accurately future survival patterns, in particular at retirement ages when the effects of the rectangularization phenomenon and random fluctuations are combined. Another important aspect affecting the projections is related to the so-called cohort-period effect. In particular, the mortality experience of countries in the industrialized world over the course of the twentieth century would suggest a substantial age-time interaction, with the two dominant trends affecting different age groups at different times. From a statistical point of view, this indicates a dependence structure. Also the dependence between ages is an important component in the modeling of mortality (Barrieu et al., 2011). It is observed that the mortality improvements are similar for individuals of contiguous ages (Wills and Sherris, 2008). Moreover, considering the data subdivided by set by single years of age, the correlations between the residuals for adjacent age groups tend to be high (as noted in Denton et al., 2005). This suggests that there is value in exploring the dependence structure, also across time, in other words the inter-period correlation. The aim of this paper is to improve the methodology for forecasting mortality in order to enhance model performance and increase forecasting power by capturing the dependence structure of neighboring observations in the population. To do this, we adapt the methodology for measuring uncertainty in projections in the Lee-Carter context and introduce a tailor-made bootstrap instead of an ordinary bootstrap. The approach is illustrated with an empirical example. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

After the crisis of several European countries, however, credit risk has recently been paid greater attention. Nevertheless, the latest version of the Solvency II standard model (QIS 5), provided by regulators for deriving solvency capital requirements, still does not require capital for credit risk inherent in, e.g., EEA issued government bonds from Greece or Spain. This paper aims to provide an alternative approach and compares the standard model with a partial internal risk model using a rating-based credit risk model that accounts for credit, equity, and interest rate risk inherent in a portfolio of stocks and bonds. The findings demonstrate that solvency capital requirements strongly depend on the quality and composition of an insurer's asset portfolio and that model risk in regard to model choice and calibration plays an important role in the quantification.

The estimators are obtained by minimizing a rank-based residual dispersion function similar to the one given in Jaeckel (1972, Annals of Mathematical Statistics 43, 1449-1458). They are useful for GARCH order selection and preliminary estimation. We give a limiting distribution for the rank estimators that holds when the true parameter vector is in the interior of its parameter space and when some GARCH parameters are zero. The limiting theory is used to show that the rank estimators are robust, can have the same asymptotic efficiency as maximum likelihood estimators, and are relatively efficient compared to traditional Gaussian and Laplace quasi-maximum likelihood estimators. The behavior of the estimators for finite samples is studied via simulation, and we use rank estimation to fit a GARCH model to exchange rate log-returns.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Stat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Andrews, B (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Stat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",bandrews@northwestem.edu,"Fan, Jianqing/B-2115-2008",,NSF [DMS0806104],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author is very grateful to editor Peter Co.

Strengths and limitations of these techniques are well-known. In practice, both methods often lead to quite different prices. In this paper we show that limitations of traditional experience rating can be overcome by taking into account historical profile information by means of exposure curves. For pricing unused or rarely used capacity, we propose to use exposure rating, calibrated on the experience rate of a working layer.

Once this is accomplished we use this function in analyzing a certain family of three player subtraction games along with a complete analysis of three player, three row Chomp. Furthermore we make use of our new function in producing alternative proofs to various well known two player Chomp games. Finally the paper presents a possible method of analyzing a two player game where one of the players plays a completely random game.

They include unit root and cointegration models. A possible nonlinear extension is to relax the linearity and at the same time keep general properties such as nonstationarity and the Markov property. A null recurrent Markov chain is nonstationary, and beta-null recurrence is of vital importance for statistical inference in nonstationary Markov models, such as, e.g., in nonparametric estimation in nonlinear cointegration within the Markov models. The standard random walk is an example of a null recurrent Markov chain. In this paper we suggest that the concept of null recurrence is an appropriate nonlinear generalization of the linear unit root concept and as such it may be a starting point for a nonlinear cointegration concept within the Markov framework. In fact, we establish the link between null recurrent processes and autoregressive unit root models. It turns out that null recurrence is closely related to the location of the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the state space matrix and the associated eigen-vectors. Roughly speaking the process is beta-null recurrent if one root is on the unit circle, null recurrent if two distinct roots are on the unit circle, whereas the others are inside the unit circle. It is transient if there are more than two roots on the unit circle. These results are closely connected to the random walk being null recurrent in one and two dimensions but transient in three dimensions. We also give an example of a process that by appropriate adjustments can be made beta-null recurrent for any beta is an element of (0, 1) and can also be made null recurrent without being beta-null recurrent.","[Myklebust, Terje] Sogn & Fjordane Univ Coll, NO-6851 Sogndal, Norway; [Karlsen, Hans Arnfinn; Tjostheim, Dag] Univ Bergen, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",Western Norway University of Applied Sciences; University of Bergen,"Myklebust, T (通讯作者)，Sogn & Fjordane Univ Coll, Pb 133, NO-6851 Sogndal, Norway.",terjemy@hisf.no,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,40,14,14,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Extensions of these methods are provided for sequences of functions that are commonly encountered in applications and where the usual methods sometimes fail. Important examples of failure arise in the use of simulation-based estimation methods such as indirect inference. The paper explores the application of these methods to the indirect inference estimator (IIE) in first order autoregressive estimation. The IIE uses a binding function that is sample size dependent. Its limit theory relies on a sequence-based delta method in the stationary case and a sequence-based implicit continuous mapping theorem in unit root and local to unity cases. The new limit theory shows that the IIE achieves much more than (partial) bias correction. It changes the limit theory of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) when the autoregressive coefficient is in the locality of unity, reducing the bias and the variance of the MLE without affecting the limit theory of the MLE in the stationary case. Thus, in spite of the fact that the IIE is a continuously differentiable function of the MLE, the limit distribution of the IIE is not simply a scale multiple of the MLE, but depends implicitly on the full binding function mapping. The unit root case therefore represents an important example of the failure of the delta method and shows the need for an implicit mapping extension of the continuous mapping theorem.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Our major finding is the existence of a noisy rational expectation competitive equilibrium, in which there are more informed traders of the large firm than those of the small firm. As a result, share prices of the large firm are more informative than those of the small firm. Our empirical study supports the analytical results. By using a bivariate vector autoregressive regression, we are able to conduct a variance decomposition of share prices for different size portfolios. We find that prices of large-size portfolios are more informative because non-value-related price shocks are less important in driving price changes of large-size portfolios than in the case of small-size portfolios.","Invesco Capital Management, Houston, TX 77081 USA",,"Zhao, T (通讯作者)，Invesco Capital Management, 4707 Pin Oak Pk,Apt 1039, Houston, TX 77081 USA.",zhaotianliuai@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,4,5,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In general, the amount of required computations for these methods is very substantial. In this paper, we address some of these issues and propose a viable alternative to the standard ADI methods based on Galerkin-Ritz ideas. We also discuss various approaches to solving the corresponding pricing problems in a semi-analytical fashion. We use the fact that in the zero correlation case some of the pricing problems can be solved analytically, and develop a closed-form series expansion in powers of correlation.

Players choose strategies by imitating the strategy of the most successful individual they observe. So, while individuals interact globally, their observation and hence imitation, as determined by their social network, may be local. When all individuals observe each other, the most successful individual in the entire population is imitated; here, in the stochastically stable state, the population coordinates on the Pareto-efficient outcome. While this outcome is always stochastically stable, even when observability is incomplete, the state where everyone plays the action of the risk-dominant equilibrium may be stochastically stable as well. Reasonably tight sufficient conditions for unique stochastic stability of the state where all coordinate on the Pareto-efficient equilibrium strategy include each individual observing at least four other individuals or when each individual observes the same number of other individuals.

These models are relevant for applications to large portfolios of credits, corporate bonds, or life insurance contracts. For instance, the Asymptotic Risk Factor (ARF) model is recommended in the current regulation in Finance (Basel II and Basel III) and Insurance (Solvency II) for risk prediction and computation of the required capital. The specification accounts for both micro-and macrodynamics, induced by the lagged individual observations and the common stochastic factors, respectively. For large cross-sectional and time dimensions n and T, we derive the efficiency bound and introduce computationally simple efficient estimators for both the micro-and macroparameters. The results are based on an asymptotic expansion of the log-likelihood function in powers of 1/n, and are linked to granularity theory. The results are illustrated with the stochastic migration model for credit risk analysis.","[Gagliardini, Patrick] Univ Svizzera Italiana, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland; [Gourieroux, Christian] CREST, Paris, France; [Gourieroux, Christian] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Toronto,"Gagliardini, P (通讯作者)，Univ Svizzera Italiana, Fac Econ, Via Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.",patrick.gagliardini@usi.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation through the NCCR FINRISK network; NSERC Canada; chair AXA/Risk Foundation: Large Risks in Insurance,Swiss National Science Foundation through the NCCR FINRISK network(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); NSERC Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); chair AXA/Risk Foundation: Large Risks in Insurance(AXA Research Fund),"The first author gratefully acknowledges financial support of the Swiss National Science Foundation through the NCCR FINRISK network.

We present the theory and tests traditionally used to explore external validity that focus on a comparison of final outcomes and review how this traditional definition has been empirically tested in health economics and other sectors (such as transport, environment and marketing) in which DCE methods are applied. While an important component, we argue that the investigation of external validity should be much broader than a comparison of final outcomes. In doing so, we introduce a new and more comprehensive conceptualisation of external validity, closely linked to process validity, that moves us from the simple characterisation of a model as being or not being externally valid on the basis of predictive performance, to the concept that external validity should be an objective pursued from the initial conceptualisation and design of any DCE. We discuss how such a broader definition of external validity can be fruitfully used and suggest innovative ways in which it can be explored in practice.","[Lancsar, Emily] Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Swait, Joffre] Univ S Australia, I4C, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Monash University; University of South Australia,"Lancsar, E (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",emily.lancsar@monash.edu; joffre.swait@unisa.edu.au,"Swait, Joffre D/F-7236-2014","Swait, Joffre D/0000-0002-0435-117X; Lancsar, Emily/0000-0003-2404-6735",,,,,57,88,117,1,33,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2014,32.0,10,,,,,951,965,,10.1007/s40273-014-0181-7,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0LF,24920196.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344626900003,0

In particular, we try to compute the distributions of (ratios of) its quadratic functionals, not by simulations, but by numerically inverting the associated characteristic functions (c.f.s). Among them is the fractional unit root distribution. It turns out that the derivation of the c.f.s based on the standard approaches used for the ordinary Bm is inapplicable. Here the martingale approximation to the fBm suggested in the literature is used to compute an approximation to the distributions of such functionals. The associated c.f. is obtained via the Fredholm determinant. Comparison of the first two moments of the approximate with true distributions is made, and simulations are conducted to examine the performance of the approximation. We also find an interesting moment property of the approximate fractional unit root distribution, and a conjecture is given that the same property will hold for the true fractional unit root distribution.","[Tanaka, Katsuto] Gakushuin Univ, Tokyo 1718588, Japan",Gakushuin University,"Tanaka, K (通讯作者)，Gakushuin Univ, Dept Econ, Toshima Ku, 1-5-1 Mejiro, Tokyo 1718588, Japan.",katsuto.tanaka@gakushuin.ac.jp,,,,,,,24,4,4,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Until now, only the Edgeworth expansion technique of Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein is able to characterize the order of the approximation error. Under a multifactor HJM Gaussian framework, this paper proposes a new approximation for European-style swaptions, which is able to set bounds on the magnitude of the approximation error and is based on the conditioning approach initiated by Curran and Rogers and Shi. All the proposed pricing bounds will arise as a simple by-product of the Nielsen and Sandmann setup, and will be shown to provide a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than all the approximations already proposed in the literature.","[Vidal Nunes, Joao Pedro] BRU UNIDE, Lisbon, Portugal; [Vidal Nunes, Joao Pedro] ISCTE IUL Business Sch, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal; [Silva Prazeres, Pedro Miguel] Banco Portugal, Soc Gestora Fundos Pensoes, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Banco de Portugal,"Nunes, JPV (通讯作者)，ISCTE IUL Business Sch, Dept Finance, Complexo INDEG ISCTE,Av Prof Anibal Bettencourt, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal.",joao.nunes@iscte.pt,"Vidal Nunes, Joao Pedro/B-1984-2014","Vidal Nunes, Joao Pedro/0000-0001-5523-1584",FCT's grant [PTDC/EGE-ECO/099255/2008],FCT's grant,"Financial support by FCT's grant number PTDC/EGE-ECO/099255/2008 is gratefully acknowledged.

We consider a fiscal policy model where the government has time-inconsistent preferences with a present bias toward public spending. The government chooses a fiscal rule to trade off its desire to commit to not overspend against its desire to have flexibility to react to privately observed shocks to the value of spending. We analyze the optimal fiscal rule when the shocks are persistent. Unlike under independent and identically distributed shocks, we show that the ex ante optimal rule is not sequentially optimal, as it provides dynamic incentives. The ex ante optimal rule exhibits history dependence, with high shocks leading to an erosion of future fiscal discipline compared to low shocks, which lead to the reinstatement of discipline. The implied policy distortions oscillate over time given a sequence of high shocks, and can force the government to accumulate maximal debt and become immiserated in the long run.","[Halac, Marina; Yared, Pierre] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Halac, Marina] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Yared, Pierre] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; University of Warwick; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Halac, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, 3022 Broadway,Uris Hall 616, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mhalac@columbia.edu; pyared@columbia.edu,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017",,,,,,61,63,85,2,50,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2014,82.0,5,,,,,1557,1614,,10.3982/ECTA11207,0.0,,,58,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AQ6FP,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342905900003,0

This paper reviews economic models of CML treatment to learn lessons from this experience and support ongoing efforts to model CML. A search of databases and submissions to key health technology assessment agencies identified 12 studies that reported 22 models. Common practice included the use of cohort Markov models-most models used health states organised around the key stages in CML: chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast phase-and the use of utility estimates in the literature that correspond with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reference case. Two key areas of uncertainty were the extrapolation of survival outcomes beyond the period observed by the trial; and the effectiveness of second-line therapies. Further work is required to overcome these uncertainties in existing models, such as longer-term trial data collection, including trials of second-line therapies; validation of health-related quality-of-life instruments; and the testing of alternative modelling approaches. In the meantime, it is important that the impact of uncertainties is tested through the use of sensitivity and scenario analysis.","[Marsh, Kevin; Xu, Peng; Orfanos, Panagiotis; Desai, Kamal] Evidera, London W6 8DL, England; [Benedict, Agnes] Evidera, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Griebsch, Ingolf] Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co KG, Ingelheim, Germany",Evidera; Evidera; Boehringer Ingelheim,"Marsh, K (通讯作者)，Evidera, Metro Bldg,6th Floor,1 Butterwick, London W6 8DL, England.",kevin.marsh@evidera.com,"Griebsch, Ingolf/JRW-6501-2023","Desai, Kamal/0009-0003-8502-5783",Boehringer Ingelheim in Germany,Boehringer Ingelheim in Germany,This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim in Germany.,,44,3,3,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2014,32.0,9,,,,,853,864,,10.1007/s40273-014-0177-3,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0LB,24906478.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344626500005,0

The PSR is likely to have pro competitive effects (lower premium), but by the same move, to lead to excessive segmentation. The main theoretical prediction of the PSR is that, in equilibrium, everyone will pay every year a premium reflecting his current risk, meaning that the risk of future risk evolution is not covered. This destruction of insurance is appreciated negatively by consumers. The trade-off is between, on the one hand, a lower price for insurance, and on the other hand, a lower quality of insurance. I simulate the cost of the PSR and find about 5-15% of the total insurance cost. This order of magnitude is slightly smaller than the benefit one can expect from increased competition. All in all, a switching right limited in time would bring the benefits of competition and avoid most of the cost of segmentation.","[Villeneuve, Bertrand] Univ Paris 09, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Villeneuve, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Paris, France.",bertrand.villeneuve@dauphine.fr,,"Villeneuve, Bertrand/0000-0002-2227-0250",,,,,20,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

We study the smooth monotone covariance by analysing its performance in reducing various statistical distances and improving optimal portfolio selection. We also extend its use in non-Gaussian cases by incorporating various robust covariance estimates for elliptical distributions.

This is known as rent control. Because some price equilibria may be disqualified given such restrictions, this paper proposes an alternative equilibrium concept, called rationing price equilibrium, tailored to capture the specific features of housing markets with rent control. An allocation rule that always selects a rationing price equilibrium is defined, and it is demonstrated to be constrained efficient and (group) non-manipulable for almost all preference profiles. In its bounding cases, the rule reduces to a number of well-known mechanisms from the matching literature. In this sense, the housing market with rent control investigated in this paper integrates several of the predominant matching models into a more general framework.","[Andersson, Tommy; Svensson, Lars-Gunnar] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Andersson, T (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden.",Tommy.Andersson@nek.lu.se; Lars-Gunnar.Svensson@nek.lu.se,,,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"We are very grateful to Matthew Jackson and three anonymous referees for their extensive comments.

To mitigate the local minima problems inherent in model calibration, we provide a global calibration method with enhanced discrete local search strategy. We compare this global calibration method with local calibration methods by using both model generated and real-market cross-sectional option data. Global calibration is highly essential for obtaining a reliable parameter set for affine jump-diffusion models and yields robust calibration results. By using the 2007 S&P 500 index options, we apply the global calibration method to 12 widely used affine jump-diffusion models. Results show that the calibrated parameters common across the models share similar values. This result verifies the robustness of global calibration. Conversely, local calibration generates different values. We also examine the predictive performance of the models and find that global calibration outperforms local calibration for the considered affine jump-diffusion models with respect to in-sample and out-of-sample errors.","[Yang, Seungho] POSTECH, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Pohang, South Korea; [Lee, Jaewook] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",jaewook@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Jaewook/A-7355-2013","Lee, Jaewook/0000-0001-5720-8337",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean government (MEST) [2011-0017657],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korean government (MEST)(Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST), Republic of KoreaKorean Government)",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MEST) (No. 2011-0017657).,,26,3,3,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

One interesting feature of ordinal symbolic representations is that their symbols are amenable to algebraic operations themselves, like taking the inverse of a permutation or multiplying two of them. The concept of transcript exploits precisely the algebraic structure of the group of permutations of L elements. Given the ordinal symbolic representations of two coupled time series, one can calculate a number of information directionality (coupling, temporal causality, ... ) indicators, like the symbolic transfer entropy and the momentary sorting information transfer. From an information-theoretical point of view, these indicators are conditional mutual informations with one and two conditioning variables, respectively. It can be shown that, under some restrictions often met in practice, conditional mutual informations can be calculated via transcripts with a conditioning variable less. This dimensional reduction can avoid or ameliorate undersampling in real time series analysis. We will talk about theoretical and practical issues related to transcript-based directionality indicators, as well as work in progress.","[Amigo, Jose M.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Ctr Invest Operat, Elche 03202, Spain; [Monetti, Roberto] CNEA UNC, Fdn Escuela Med Nucl FUESMEN, Mendoza, Argentina",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Comision Nacional de Energia Atomica (CNEA),"Amigó, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Miguel Hernandez, Ctr Invest Operat, Avda Univ S-N, Elche 03202, Spain.",jm.amigo@umh.es; r.monetti@gmail.com,"Amigo, Jose/B-2217-2008","Amigo, Jose/0000-0002-1642-1171",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,304,308,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600038,0

The current available guidelines suggest that a dental and skeletal age estimate should be provided, but the expert usually has to rely on two estimates obtained from different methods that cannot be combined, and the final judgment is based on a more subjective assessment of which age is more reliable or how the two estimates can be combined. The purpose of this study is to discuss the use of panel data models to develop age estimation methods that rely on a combination of dental and skeletal maturation in a longitudinal sample of French-Canadian children between the ages of 7 and 15 years old, for legal purposes. The study wishes to assess which of the possible panel data models is more appropriate and which variables perform best in these models. The use of the random-effects models is discussed as it was proven to be the correct choice for the problem under study. While determining the combination of variables that best provides an estimate of age in young males around 16 years, only two were selected. The quality of the model with the best results is evaluated by how much variability explained is lost when the number of variables is reduced. The critical variables in the model used to estimate the age of juveniles, were fusion of the ulna and formation of the third molar. In contrast, fusion of the radius and formation of the second molar were much less important in the model. When dental and skeletal maturation is used in the combined the score version, the results show that the models are not improved.","Univ Inst Lisbon ISCTE IUL, Dept Matemat, BRU IUL, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Archaeol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Simon Fraser University,,marina.andrade@iscte.pt; hcardoso@sfu.ca,"Cardoso, Hugo/U-7178-2019; Andrade, Marina/AAP-5353-2021","Cardoso, Hugo/0000-0003-1338-101X; Pedro Andrade, Marina Alexandra/0000-0001-5412-7144",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,446,452,,,,,,7,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600055,0

Its application covers many fields of research, from economics to biology and beyond. DFA was originally designed to investigate correlation properties in non stationary series, through the estimate of a scaling exponent, whose value can discriminate between (short or long-range) correlated and uncorrelated time series. Complex systems often exhibit long-range correlations and it is of crucial importance to quantify such behavior in order to understand the underlying dynamics.

The long-range dependence of the stochastic part of topocentric coordinates changes (North, East, Up) results in relatively high autocorrelation values. One of the reason of such self-similarity of the GPS time series are the noises that are commonly recognized to prevail in the form of the flicker noise model. To prove the self-similarity of the stochastic part of GPS time series, the authors used more than 130 ASG-EUPOS stations from the area of Poland with 5-years span of the daily topocentric coordinate changes. The deterministic part of time series was removed from the time series by means of the least-squares method, median absolute deviation criterion and the sequential t-test algorithm, respectively. Then the self-similarity of the residua was proved by the results of the Ljung-Box test, which values close to zero showed the dependence of the stochastic part of the GPS time series. The residua were analyzed by means of the Rescaled Range (R/S) method with the H parameter and the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) with the scaling exponent a. Both H and a values ranged within assumed long-range dependence limits. These analyses were followed by noise investigation with the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The combination of white plus power-law noise models were assumed a-priori, what gave us spectral indices K between -0.4 and -1.2 for all of the time series. It proved that the fractional white noise overweighs other types of noises in GPS time series. We found here, that the long-range dependence methods by missing the information of noise amplitudes lead to underestimation of H values and their misinterpretation. The larger the non-included amplitude is, the greater are the differences between the noise character estimated with R/S values in comparison to the reference values of K. Some of these differences exceed even the value of 0.6 what may result in wrongly estimated noise character in GPS data falsifying in this way the conclusions.","[Klos, Anna; Bogusz, Janusz; Figurski, Mariusz; Kujawa, Marcin] Mil Univ Technol, Ctr Appl Geomat, PL-00908 Warsaw, Poland",Military University of Technology in Warsaw,"Klos, A (通讯作者)，Mil Univ Technol, Ctr Appl Geomat, Kaliskiego St 2, PL-00908 Warsaw, Poland.",aklos@wat.edu.pl,"Figurski, Mariusz/U-8665-2017; Klos, Anna/JKP-8326-2023; Klos, Anna/G-4345-2013; Bogusz, Janusz/F-8636-2011","Figurski, Mariusz/0000-0001-9602-5007; Bogusz, Janusz/0000-0002-0424-7022",,,,,0,0,0,0,2,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,434,434,,,,,,1,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600053,0

To verify this hypothesis about the influence of the service sector in resilience of the Spanish economy, we will use quarterly temporal series of Value Added (VA) and employment since 1995 to 2013 of Spanish economy as well as a mixing of traditional regression models, comparing aggregated data using traditional univariate analysis (Box & Jenkins), and the so-called intervention function.

In this report we consider this problem, relating to empirical modeling of climate dynamics, which implies an analysis of spatial-distributed time-series. The main goal is to establish the number of principal modes which have key contribution to data and actually governs the observed variability. Currently, the number of widely used methods based on PCA and factor analysis exists, which yeld different data decompositions taking into consideration linear spatio/spatio-temporal correlations in observed dynamics: spatial emirical orthogonal functions, multichannel SSA, varimax rotation, emirical orthogonal telecoonections, and so on. However, the question about possibility of improving the decomposition by acounting for nonlinear couplings between variables often remains untouched. In the report the method for construction of principal dynamic modes on the basis of low-dimensional nonlinear parametric representation of observed multivariate time-series is suggested. It is aimed to extract the set of latent modes that both explains an essential part of variability, and obeys the simplest evolution law. Thus, this approach can be used for optimal reconstruction of the phase space for empirical prognostic modeling of observed dynamics. Artificial neural networks are used for both parametric representation of the time-series, and parameterization of evolution operator. Criterion of evidence of the nonlinearity, which allows to estimate optimal parameters of data representation (such as the number of neurons and the number of principal modes) is proposed. The effectiveness of suggested method is firstly demonstrated on toy model example: two-dimensional strongly nonlinear problem of unknown dynamic signal recognition from noisy data is considered. Next the approach is applied to construction of prognostic model of El-Nin'o Southern Oscillation dynamics from sea surface temperature (SST) field time-series covering low-mid-latitudes over the Globe. The evidence of nonlinear couplings in SST data is investigated by the proposed approach.","[Mukhin, Dmitry; Gavrilov, Andrey; Loskutov, Evgeny; Feigin, Alexander] Inst Appl Phys, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Mukhin, D (通讯作者)，Inst Appl Phys, Ulyanova Str 46, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia.",mukhin@appl.sci-nnov.ru; gavrilov@appl.sci-nnov.ru; loskutov@appl.sci-nnov.ru; feigin@appl.sci-nnov.ru,"Mukhin, Dmitry/U-1058-2017; Loskutov, Evgeny/R-8263-2016; Feigin, Alexander M./K-3857-2018","Mukhin, Dmitry/0000-0002-5669-0771; Feigin, Alexander M./0000-0002-9106-7766",,,,,0,0,0,0,2,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,309,309,,,,,,1,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600039,0

Our default risk model allows the possibility for the reinsurer to fail paying in full the promised indemnity, whenever it exceeds the level of regulatory capital. We also investigate the change in the optimal solution if the reinsurance premium recognises or not the default in payment. Closed form solutions are elaborated when the insurer's objective function is set via some well-known risk measures. It is also discussed the effect of reinsurance over the policyholder welfare. If the insurer is Value-at-Risk regulated, then the reinsurance does not increase the policyholder's exposure for any possible reinsurance transfer, even if the reinsurer may default in paying the promised indemnity. Numerical examples are also provided in order to illustrate and conclude our findings. It is found that the optimal reinsurance contract does not usually change if the counterparty default risk is taken into account, but one should consider this effect in order to properly measure the policyholders exposure.

As most portfolio managers use dynamic rules for rebalancing their portfolios, we use a dynamic framework to study the optimization of the tracking error-return trade-off. Following these observations, we assume that the manager minimizes the tracking error under an expected return goal (or, equivalently, maximizes the information ratio). Moreover, we assume that he/she complies with a stochastic hedging constraint whereby the terminal value of the portfolio is (almost surely) higher than a given stochastic payoff. This general setting includes the case of a minimum wealth level at the horizon date and the case of a performance constraint on terminal wealth as measured by the benchmark (i.e. terminal portfolio wealth should be at least equal to a given proportion of the index). When the manager cares about absolute returns and relative returns as well, the risk-return trade-off acquires an extra dimension since risk comprises two components. This extra risk dimension substantially modifies the characteristics of portfolio strategies. The optimal solutions involve pricing and duplication of spread options. Optimal terminal wealth profiles are derived in a general setting, and optimal strategies are determined when security prices follow geometric Brownian motions and interest rates remain constant. A numerical example illustrates the type of strategies generated by the model.","CNAM, F-75002 Paris, France; ESSEC, F-75002 Paris, France; CNAM, Chaire Finances, F-75002 Paris, France; George Washington Univ, Dept Finance, Washington, DC 20052 USA",heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM); ESSEC Business School; heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM); George Washington University,"Bajeux-Besnainou, I (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Finance, 2201 G St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,,,Institute for Quantitative Investment Research,Institute for Quantitative Investment Research,The Institute for Quantitative Investment Research provided financial support to the first two authors for this research.,,42,2,3,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

However, violation of this assumption may arise in several econometric contexts such as treatment effects evaluation. This paper presents a thorough characterisation of the asymptotic distributions in the least-squares estimation of such abnormal cases. First, the asymptotic results on the threshold point are different from the conventional case. For example, any convergence rate between zero and infinity is possible; the asymptotic distribution can be discrete, continuous or a mixture of discrete and continuous; the weak limits of the localised objective functions can be non-homogeneous instead of homogeneous compound Poisson processes. Second, this paper distinguishes threshold regression from structural change models by studying a problem unique in threshold regression. Third, the asymptotic distributions of regular parameters are not affected by estimation of the threshold point irrespective of the density of the threshold variable. Numerical calculations and simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis, and the density of the threshold variable in an application is checked to illustrate the relevance of the study in this paper.","[Yu, Ping] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Zhao, Yongqiang] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Auckland; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Yu, P (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",p.yu@auckland.ac.nz; yqzhao@math.wisc.edu,"Zhao, Yongqiang/O-7342-2015",,,,,,37,5,6,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

A central problem in the literature is that firm performance is affected by two countervailing spillovers : a positive effect from technology (knowledge) spillovers and a negative business stealing effects from product market rivals. We develop a general framework incorporating these two types of spillovers and implement this model using measures of a firm's position in technology space and product market space. Using panel data on U. S. firms, we show that technology spillovers quantitatively dominate, so that the gross social returns to R&D are at least twice as high as the private returns. We identify the causal effect of R&D spillovers by using changes in federal and state tax incentives for R&D. We also find that smaller firms generate lower social returns to R&D because they operate more in technological niches. Finally, we detail the desirable properties of an ideal spillover measure and how existing approaches, including our new Mahalanobis measure, compare to these criteria.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bloom, Nicholas; Van Reenen, John] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Schankerman, Mark] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Van Reenen, John] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nbloom@stanford.edu; m.schankerman@lse.ac.uk; J.Vanreenen@lse.ac.uk,"Van Reenen, John/AAG-9587-2019; Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019",,"ESRC at the Centre for Economic Performance; NSF; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0846194] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish","ESRC at the Centre for Economic Performance(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This is a heavily revised version of Bloom, Schankerman, and Van Reenen (2007).

We call this property the lexicographical improvement property (LIP) and show that, in finite games, it is equivalent to the existence of a generalized strong potential function. We use this characterization to derive existence, efficiency and fairness properties of strong equilibria (SE). As our main result, we show that an important class of games that we call bottleneck congestion games has the LIP and thus the above mentioned properties. For infinite games, the LIP does neither imply the existence of a generalized strong potential nor the existence of SE. We therefore introduce the slightly more general concept of the pairwise LIP and prove that whenever the pairwise LIP is satisfied for a continuous function, then there exists a SE. As a consequence, we show that splittable bottleneck congestion games with continuous facility cost functions possess a SE.","[Harks, Tobias] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, NL-6211 LM Maastricht, Netherlands; [Klimm, Max; Moehring, Rolf H.] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Math, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Maastricht University; Technical University of Berlin,"Klimm, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Math, Str 17 Juni 136, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",t.harks@maastrichtuniversity.nl; klimm@math.tu-berlin.de; moehring@math.tu-berlin.de,,,Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [03MOPAI1]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the research training group 'Methods for Discrete Structures' [GRK 1408],Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the research training group 'Methods for Discrete Structures',An extended abstract of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Internet and Networks Economics.

These contracts provide a guaranteed value at the maturity of the option. The contract valuation is dependent on the stochastic interest rate and mortality processes. We assume single-factor stochastic square-root processes for both the interest rate and mortality intensity, with mortality being a time-inhomogeneous process. We then derive the pricing partial differential equation (PDE) and the corresponding transition density PDE for options written on the pure endowment and deferred annuity contracts. The general solution of the pricing PDE is derived as a function of the transition density function. We solve the transition density PDE by first transforming it to a system of characteristic PDEs using Laplace transform techniques and then applying the method of characteristics. Once an explicit expression for the density function is found, we then use sparse grid quadrature techniques to generate European call option prices on the pure endowment and deferred annuity contracts. This approach can easily be generalised to other contracts which are driven by similar stochastic processes presented in this paper. We test the sensitivity of the option prices by varying independent parameters in our model. As option maturity increases, the corresponding option prices significantly increase. The effect of mispricing the guaranteed annuity value is analysed, as is the benefit of replacing the whole-life annuity with a term annuity to remove volatility of the old age population.

In particular, we study some implications of row-standardizing the weights matrix, the dependence of the correlations on graph distance, and the behavior of the correlations at the extremes of the parameter space. Throughout the analysis differences between directed and undirected networks are emphasized. The graph theoretic representation also clarifies why it is difficult to relate properties of W to correlation properties of SAR(1) models defined on irregular lattices.","Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Martellosio, F (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",f.martellosio@reading.ac.uk,,"Martellosio, Federico/0000-0002-8537-9720",,,,,25,5,5,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

This procedure admits a clear financial interpretation that can be formulated in the language of embedded options. Our approach results in a fast and accurate pricing method that can be used in a rather wide class of Levy-driven models including Variance Gamma processes, Normal Inverse Gaussian processes, KoBoL processes, CGMY model, and Kuznetsov's beta-class.

In contrast to Battalio et al. (Econometrica 69:749-764, 2001), our design keeps the riskiness ratio of the two strategies at a constant level as the optimization premium is increased. We define the riskiness ratio as the relative payoff range of the two strategies. We find that decreasing the riskiness ratio while keeping the optimization premium constant decreases sharply the frequency of the payoff-dominant equilibrium strategy. On the other hand an increase of the optimization premium with a constant riskiness ratio has no effect on the choice frequencies.

Assuming a normal distribution for the idiosyncratic error e(t) conditional on the factors {F-t}, conditional maximum likelihood estimators of the factor and factor-loading spaces are derived. These estimators are called generalized principal component estimators (GPCEs) without the normality assumption. This paper derives asymptotic distributions of the GPCEs of the factor and factor-loading spaces. It is shown that variance of the GPCE of the common component is smaller than that of the principal component estimator studied in Bai (2003, Econometrica 71, 135-172). The approximate variance of the forecasting error using the GPCE-based factor estimates is derived and shown to be smaller than that based on the principal component estimator. The feasible GPCE (FGPCE) of the factor space is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the GPCE. The GPCE and FGPCE are shown to be more efficient than the principal component estimator in finite samples.","Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University,"Choi, I (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Shinsu Dong, Seoul, South Korea.",inchoi@google.com,,,Research Grant Council of Hong Kong [641207],Research Grant Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"This paper was presented at the Third Symposium on Econometric Theory and Applications, held in Hong Kong in April 2007.

The estimator is unrestricted in the sense that the value of the intercept, which cannot be consistently estimated in the explosive case, is not fixed. A specific behavior of the estimator of the GARCH coefficients is obtained at the boundary of the stationarity region, but, except for the intercept, this estimator remains consistent and asymptotically normal in every situation. The asymptotic variance is different in the stationary and nonstationary situations, but is consistently estimated with the same estimator in both cases. Tests of strict stationarity and nonstationarity are proposed. The tests developed for the classical GARCH(1, 1) model are able to detect nonstationarity in more general GARCH models.

This investigation was motivated by the results of Vassalou [J. Int.

Our results show that both exchange rate and inflation risks are significantly priced in the pre- and post-euro periods. Moreover, the sizes of exchange rate and inflation risk premiums are economically significant in the pre-and post-euro periods. Futhermore, the UK and excluding-UK inflation risk premiums explain, in part, our evidence concerning a large EUR/GBP exchange rate risk premium and the existence of an economically significant domestic non-diversifiable risk after euro adoption. Hence overlooking inflation risk factors can produce an under/overestimation of the currency premiums and a miscalculation of the degree of integration of stock markets.","[Font, Begona] Univ Valencia, Dept Math Econ & Business, Valencia, Spain; [Juan Grau, Alfredo] Univ Valencia, Dept Corporat Finance, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Font, B (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Math Econ & Business, Valencia, Spain.",maria.b.font@uv.es,"FONT-BELAIRE, M.

Our results reveal that the 18 financial variables (sales growth rate, total assets, total sales, return on assets, return on equity, gross margin, operating cost minus depreciation divided by sales plus other trading income, acid test ratio, debt-equity ratio, time interest earned, average receivables per average daily sales, inventory, average payables per average daily sales, working capital, working capital as a fraction of total assets, long-term liabilities as a fraction of total assets, and sales as a fraction of net worth of the firm) that we employ bunch together into five different financial ratios for the years 1997 and 2003 that are stable between these years. These financial factors are short-term liquidity, return on investment, long-term liquidity, firm size and capital turnover. Regressing these ratio groups (extracted principal components) on firm growth, we find return on investment in the year 1997 was positively and significantly related to firm growth, while long-term solvency was negatively related to firm growth. In addition, smaller firms tended to grow faster. By 2003, larger firms grew faster than smaller ones and short-term liquidity was positively and significantly related to firm growth, while return on investment was no longer a significant determining factor. Our findings suggest that firms that finance internally or do not rely too heavily on indebtedness may end up growing slower during boom periods but they are the ones that survive and outperform after the bust.","[Kiani, Khurshid M.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ellen Huiru] So Calif Edison Co, Dept Regulatory Finance, Rosemead, CA 91770 USA; [Madjd-Sadjadi, Zagros] Winston Salem State Univ, Dept Econ, Winston Salem, NC 27110 USA",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Winston-Salem State University,"Kiani, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, 199 Taikang E Rd, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",mkkiani@yahoo.com,"Chen, Ellen/HGU-3154-2022",,,,,,71,9,9,3,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Recognition that these new treatments could significantly improve the prognosis for COPD patients has radically changed clinical management guidelines from a palliative philosophy to an aggressive approach intended to reduce chronic symptoms, improve quality of life and prolong survival. These new treatments have also sparked interest in COPD cost-effectiveness research. Most COPD cost-effectiveness studies have been based on clinical trial populations, limited to direct medical costs, and used standard analysis methods such as Markov modelling, and they have usually found that newer therapies have favourable cost effectiveness. However, new insights into the clinical progression of COPD bring into question some of the assumptions underlying older analyses. In this review, we examine clinical factors unique to COPD and recent changes in clinical perspectives that have important implications for pharmacoeconomic analyses. The main parameters explored include (i) the high indirect medical costs for COPD and their relevance in assessing the societal benefits of new therapy; (ii) the importance of acute deteriorations in COPD, known as exacerbations, and approaches to modelling the cost benefit of exacerbation reduction; (iii) quality/utility instruments for COPD; (iv) the prevalence of co-morbid conditions and confounding between COPD and co-morbid disease utilization; (v) the limitations of Markov modelling; and (vi) the problem of outliers.","[Mapel, Douglas W.; Roberts, Melissa H.] Lovelace Clin Fdn, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA",,"Mapel, DW (通讯作者)，Lovelace Clin Fdn, 2309 Renard Pl SE 103, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA.",DMapel@comcast.net,,"Roberts, Melissa/0000-0002-1314-4906",,,,,135,14,14,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,10,,,,,869,885,,,,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,012QO,22852587.0,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309251800002,0

Agents have preferences over coalitions, and these preferences vary with an underlying, and commonly known, state of nature. Assuming that there is substantial variability of preferences across states of nature, we show that there exists a core stable coalition structure in every state if and only if agents' preferences are pairwise-aligned in every state. This implies that there is a stable coalition structure if agents' preferences are generated by Nash bargaining over coalitional outputs. We further show that all stability-inducing rules for sharing outputs can be represented by a profile of agents' bargaining functions and that agents match assortatively with respect to these bargaining functions.

Bessembinder et al. [J.

This indicates that the spot prices revert to a stochastic long-run mean. Recognizing this, I propose a reduced-form model with the stochastic long-run mean as a separate factor.

Direct dominance implies indirect dominance, but not the reverse. Hence, the predicted outcomes when assuming myopic (direct) or farsighted (indirect) agents could be very different. In this paper, we characterize dominance invariant one-to-one matching problems when preferences are strict. That is, we obtain the conditions on preference profiles such that indirect dominance implies direct dominance in these problems and give them an intuitive interpretation. Whenever some of the conditions are not satisfied, it is important to understand whether the agents are myopic or farsighted in order to use the appropriate stability concept. Furthermore, we characterize dominance invariant one-to-one matching problems having a non-empty core. Finally, we show that, if the core of a dominance invariant one-to-one matching problem is not empty, it contains a unique matching, the dominance invariant stable matching, in which all agents who mutually top rank each other are matched to one another and all other agents remain unmatched.","[Mauleon, Ana; Vannetelbosch, Vincent J.; Vergote, Wouter] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Mauleon, Ana; Vannetelbosch, Vincent J.; Vergote, Wouter] St Louis Univ, CEREC, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Molis, Elena] Univ Granada, GLOBE, Granada 18011, Spain",Universite Catholique Louvain; University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles; University of Granada,"Mauleon, A (通讯作者)，St Louis Univ, CEREC, Blvd Jardin Bot 43, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",ana.mauleon@usaintlouis.be,"Vergote, Wouter/GWU-5413-2022; Molis, Elena/H-5261-2015; Mauleon, Ana/H-1970-2015","Vergote, Wouter/0000-0002-3201-7515; Molis Banales, Elena/0000-0002-5552-6590","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competition [ECO2012-35820]; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [ECO2010-17049, ECO2012-31346]; Basque Government [IT568-13]; Andalusian Government [P07.SEJ.02547]; FNRS",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competition(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); Andalusian Government; FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"We would like to thank Lars Ehlers and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

We first study how existing models can be adapted to satisfy the new-data-invariant property, a property that is required to ensure the resulting mortality indexes are tractable by market participants. Among the collection of adapted models, we find that the adapted Model M7 (the Cairns-Blake-Dowd model with cohort and quadratic age effects) is the most suitable model for constructing mortality indexes. One basis of this conclusion is that the adapted model M7 gives the best fitting and forecasting performance when applied to data over the age range of 40-90 for various populations. Another basis is that the three time-varying parameters in it are highly interpretable and rich in information content. Based on the three indexes created from this model, one can write a standardized mortality derivative called K-forward, which can be used to hedge longevity risk exposures. Another contribution of this paper is a method called key K-duration that permits one to calibrate a longevity hedge formed by K-forward contracts. Our numerical illustrations indicate that a K-forward hedge has a potential to outperform a q-forward hedge in terms of the number of hedging instruments required. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such a setup generalizes the traditional fixed-effect paradigm in which between-group heterogeneity is limited to univariate factors that act like constants within groups. Notable members of the class of models considered are non-linear regression models with additive heterogeneity and multiplicative-error models suitable for non-negative limited dependent variables. The heterogeneity is modelled as a non-parametric nuisance function of covariates whose functional form is fixed within groups but is allowed to vary freely across groups. A simple approach to perform inference in such situations is based on local first-differencing of observations within a given group. This leads to moment conditions that, asymptotically, are free of nuisance functions. Conventional generalized method of moments procedures can then be readily applied. In particular, under suitable regularity conditions, such estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and asymptotically valid inference can be performed using a plug-in estimator of the asymptotic variance.","Sci Po, Dept Econ, F-75007 Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Jochmans, K (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.",koen.jochmans@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,34,0,0,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

J,"Tappenden, P; Chilcott, JB",,,,"Tappenden, Paul; Chilcott, James B.",,,Avoiding and Identifying Errors and Other Threats to the Credibility of Health Economic Models,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GUIDELINES; SUBMISSIONS,"Health economic models have become the primary vehicle for undertaking economic evaluation and are used in various healthcare jurisdictions across the world to inform decisions about the use of new and existing health technologies. Models are required because a single source of evidence, such as a randomised controlled trial, is rarely sufficient to provide all relevant information about the expected costs and health consequences of all competing decision alternatives. Whilst models are used to synthesise all relevant evidence, they also contain assumptions, abstractions and simplifications. By their very nature, all models are therefore 'wrong'. As such, the interpretation of estimates of the cost effectiveness of health technologies requires careful judgements about the degree of confidence that can be placed in the models from which they are drawn. The presence of a single error or inappropriate judgement within a model may lead to inappropriate decisions, an inefficient allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately suboptimal outcomes for patients. This paper sets out a taxonomy of threats to the credibility of health economic models. The taxonomy segregates threats to model credibility into three broad categories: (i) unequivocal errors, (ii) violations, and (iii) matters of judgement; and maps these across the main elements of the model development process. These three categories are defined according to the existence of criteria for judging correctness, the degree of force with which such criteria can be applied, and the means by which these credibility threats can be handled. A range of suggested processes and techniques for avoiding and identifying these threats is put forward with the intention of prospectively improving the credibility of models.","[Tappenden, Paul; Chilcott, James B.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Tappenden, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",p.tappenden@sheffield.ac.uk; j.b.chilcott@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Chilcott, James/0000-0003-1231-7817",,,,,42,14,15,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2014,32.0,10,,,,,967,979,,10.1007/s40273-014-0186-2,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0LF,25027943.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344626900004,0

This study aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of the darunavir/r regimen compared with the lopinavir/r regimen in treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection in Canada. A Markov model with a 3-month cycle time and six CD4 cell-count-based health states (> 500, 351-500, 201-500, 101-200, 51-100, and 0-50 cells/mm(3)) followed a cohort of treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection through initial darunavir/r or lopinavir/r combination therapy and a common set of subsequent regimens over the course of their remaining lifetimes. Population characteristics and transition probabilities were estimated from the ARTEMIS clinical trial and other trials. Costs (in 2014 Canadian dollars), utilities, and mortality were estimated from Canadian sources and published literature. Costs and health outcomes were discounted at 5 % per year. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, including a simple indirect comparison of the darunavir/r initial regimen with an atazanavir/r-based regimen. In the base-case lifetime analysis, individuals receiving initial therapy with the darunavir/r regimen experienced 0.25 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with lower antiretroviral drug costs (-$14,246) and total costs (-$18,402) than individuals receiving the lopinavir/r regimen, indicating that darunavir/r dominated lopinavir/r. In an indirect comparison with an atazanavir/r-based regimen, the darunavir/r regimen remained the dominant choice, but with lower cost savings (-$2,303) and QALY gains (0.02). Results were robust to a wide range of other changes in input parameter values, population characteristics, and modeling assumptions. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the darunavir/r regimen was cost effective compared with the lopinavir/r regimen in over 86 % of simulations for willingness-to-pay thresholds between $0 and $100,000 per QALY gained. Darunavir/r 800/100 mg QD may be a cost-effective PI/r component of initial antiretroviral therapy for treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection in Canada.","[Brogan, Anita J.; Mauskopf, Josephine A.] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Smets, Erik; Adriaenssen, Ines] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, Beerse, Belgium; [Manuel, Sarah A.

On the basis of the best estimate, Solvency 2 requires the use of a one-year volatility of the reserves. When internal models are used, such one-year volatility has to be provided by the reserving actuaries. Due to the lack of closed-form formulas for the one-year volatility of Bornhuetter-Ferguson, Cape-Cod and Benktander-Hovinen, reserving actuaries have limited possibilities to estimate such volatility apart from scaling from tractable models, which are based on other reserving methods. However, such scaling is technically difficult to justify cleanly and awkward to interact with. The challenge described in this editorial is therefore to come up with similar models like those of Mack or Merz-Wuthrich for the chain ladder, but applicable to Bornhuetter-Ferguson, mix Chain-Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson, potentially Cape-Cod and Benktander-Hovinen - and their mixtures.","[Dal Moro, Eric] Chief Reserving Actuary SCOR Switzerland, Geneva, Switzerland; [Lo, Joseph] Aspen, Actuarial Res & Dev, London, England",,"Dal Moro, E (通讯作者)，Chief Reserving Actuary SCOR Switzerland, Geneva, Switzerland.",eric_dal_moro@yahoo.com; Jo.Lo@aspen.co,,,,,,,13,4,4,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2014,44.0,3,,,,,495,499,,10.1017/asb.2014.16,0.0,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AP3VF,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342005400001,0

Current methods of modeling time dependence in this setting are either unduly restrictive or computationally infeasible. Some impose restrictive assumptions on the nature of dependence such as the scaling property. Others involve T-dimensional integration, where T is the number of cross-sections, which may be large. Moreover, no known multivariate distribution has the property of having commonly used, convenient marginals such as normal/half-normal. We show how to use copulas to resolve these issues. The range of dependence we allow for is unrestricted and the computational task involved is easy compared to the alternatives. Also, the resulting estimators are more efficient than those that assume independence over time. We propose two alternative specifications. One applies a copula function to the distribution of the composed error term. This permits the use of maximum likelyhood estimate (MLE) and generalized method moments (GMM). The other applies a copula to the distribution of the one-sided error term. This allows for a simulated MLE and improved estimation of inefficiencies. An application demonstrates the usefulness of our approach.","[Amsler, Christine; Schmidt, Peter] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Prokhorov, Artem] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Michigan State University; Concordia University - Canada,"Schmidt, P (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 486 W Circle Dr Room 110, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",schmidtp@msu.edu,"Prokhorov, Artem/M-1401-2015","Prokhorov, Artem/0000-0003-4046-7994",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Helpful comments from participants of the Canadian Econometrics Study Group Meetings, the International Conference on Panel Data, and the European Workshop on Efficiency and Productivity Analysis as well as seminar participants at University of New South Wales and Ewha Womans University are gratefully acknowledged.

The Better than Dead (BTD) method is a health-state valuation method where states with a certain duration are compared with being dead. It has the potential to overcome these problems. To test the feasibility of the BTD method to estimate values for the EQ-5D system. A representative sample of 291 Dutch respondents (aged 18-45 years) was recruited. In a web-based questionnaire, preferences were elicited for a selection of 50 different health states with six durations between 1 and 40 years. Random-effects models were used to estimate the effects of socio-demographic and experimental variables, and to estimate values for the EQ-5D. Test-retest reliability was assessed in 41 respondents. Important determinants for BTD were a religious life stance [odds ratio 4.09 (2.00-8.36)] and the educational level. The fastest respondents more often preferred health-state scenarios to being dead and had lower test-retest reliability (0.45 versus 0.77 and 0.84 for fast, medium and slow response times, respectively). The results showed a small number of so-called maximal endurable time states. Valuating health states using the BTD method is feasible and reliable. Further research should explore how the experimental setting modifies how values depend on time.","[van Hoorn, R. A.; Donders, A. R. T.; Stalmeier, P. F.

In the first part it is shown that, depending on the relations between excess profit and the investor's excess wealth, a well-specified theory of residual income is generated: one is the standard theory, which historically traces back to Hamilton and Marshall and is a deep-rooted notion in economic theory, finance, and accounting. Another is the systemic value added or lost-capital paradigm: first introduced by Magni, the theory is enfolded in Keynes's notion of user cost and is naturally generated by an arbitrage-theory perspective. In the second part, the paper inverts the usual analysis: instead of computing residual incomes from a pattern of cash flows, residual incomes are fixed first to derive vectors of cash flows. It is shown that variable- or fixed-income assets may be constructed on the basis of either theory starting from pre-determined growth rates for residual income. In particular, zero-coupon bonds and coupon bonds traded in a capital market are shown to be deduced as equilibrium vectors of residual-income-based assets.","[Ricci, Roberto Ghiselli] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ, Ist Terr, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Magni, Carlo Alberto] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, I-41100 Modena, Italy",University of Ferrara; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Magni, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, Viale Berengario 51, I-41100 Modena, Italy.",magni@unimo.it,"Magni, Carlo Alberto/G-3356-2016","Magni, Carlo Alberto/0000-0003-3066-8426",,,,,95,1,1,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We use the bounds as control variates to develop a simple Monte Carlo method for pricing contracts with Asian-style features. The conditioning idea that is inherent in our approach also inspires us to propose a new semi-analytic pricing approach. We compare both approaches and conclude that these both have their merits and are useful in practice. In particular, we point out that our newly proposed Monte Carlo method allows to deal with Asian-style products that appear in insurance (e. g., unit-linked contracts) in a very efficient way, and outperforms other known Monte Carlo methods that are based on control variates.","[Deelstra, Griselda; Rayee, Gregory] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Math, Brussels, Belgium; [Vanduffel, Steven; Yao, Jing] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Econ, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Vanduffel, S (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Econ, Brussels, Belgium.",griselda.deelstra@ulb.ac.be; Gregory.Rayee@ulb.ac.be; steven.vanduffel@vub.ac.be; jingyao@vub.ac.be,"Vanduffel, Steven/K-6709-2012","Vanduffel, Steven/0000-0003-0511-1044; Yao, Jing/0000-0002-8936-2600","ARC; BNP Paribas Fortis Chair in Banking; Mandat de Charge de Recherche from the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, Communaute francaise de Belgique","ARC(Australian Research Council); BNP Paribas Fortis Chair in Banking; Mandat de Charge de Recherche from the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, Communaute francaise de Belgique","The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their constructive suggestions and comments.

Thus far, time preference investigations in health have mostly involved life-years gained and lives saved. However, the quality-adjusted life-year, which is recommended by several bodies, is a multiplicative measure of life duration and quality of life. To our knowledge, our study is the first to follow this approach specifically for quality of life. Methods A questionnaire was developed to elicit time preferences for quality of life and for money, and it was distributed to a representative sample of the Dutch population. We also investigated the impact of population characteristics, such as current health state, optimistic/pessimistic future views or gender, on time preferences. Results We found that discount rates for both money and quality of life decrease with increasing time of delay, with rates of the former being consistently at least two times higher than those of the latter. Similar trends in time preferences were observed across the subgroups, with the exception of the relatively high education subgroup. Conclusion In agreement with the results of other studies, our empirically derived discount rates are higher than the rates featured in national guidelines for health care economic assessment. Our empirical study adds to the evidence for differential discounting, both with regards to money and health, as well as in time.","[Parouty, M. B. Y.; Le, H. H.; Krooshof, D.; Postma, M.

This study aimed to assess the impact of URBMI on health services access (especially inpatient utilisation) in urban China. Data was drawn from the recent four-wave URBMI Survey (2008-2011). Probit and recursive bivariate probit models have been adopted to handle the possible endogeneity of medical insurance in the utilisation equations. Based on the preferred results from the unbalanced four-wave panel data, we found that the URBMI had significantly increased the likelihood of receiving inpatient treatment in the past year. However, the insurance effect on reducing the refused hospitalisation was insignificant. Finally, the URBMI had also increased the probability of using outpatient services in the past 2 weeks, although the insurance reimburses mainly against critical outpatient care. Given that it is still early days for the URBMI scheme, the positive effect on health services utilisation is appreciable.","[Chen, Gang] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Med, Repatriat Gen Hosp, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, Daw Pk, SA 5041, Australia; [Liu, Gordon G.] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Xu, Fei] China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Int Pharmaceut Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Flinders University South Australia; Peking University; China Pharmaceutical University,"Chen, G (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Med, Repatriat Gen Hosp, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, A Block,Level 1,Daws Rd, Daw Pk, SA 5041, Australia.",Gang.Chen@flinders.edu.au; gordonliu@nsd.pku.edu.cn; xufei0505@gmail.com,"Chen, Gang/G-4214-2011","Chen, Gang/0000-0002-8385-5965",,,,,37,35,36,2,71,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2014,32.0,3,,,,,277,292,,10.1007/s40273-013-0097-7,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AC4KO,24178373.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332490100006,0

Importantly, we show that additional conditions are often needed in nonlinear, nonparametric models to avoid nonlinearities overwhelming linear effects. We give restrictions on a neighborhood of the true value that are sufficient for local identification. We apply these results to obtain new, primitive identification conditions in several important models, including nonseparable quantile instrumental variable (IV) models and semiparametric consumption-based asset pricing models.","[Chen, Xiaohong] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Chernozhukov, Victor; Newey, Whitney K.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Lee, Sokbae] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151742, South Korea",Yale University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Seoul National University (SNU),"Chen, XH (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, Box 208281, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",xiaohong.chen@yale.edu; vchern@mit.edu; sokbae@snu.ac.kr; wnewey@mit.edu,"Lee, Sokbae/F-7514-2011","Lee, Sokbae/0000-0003-4080-7733","National Science Foundation [SES-0838161, SES-1132399]; European Research Council [ERC-2009-StG-240910-ROMETA]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2011-327-B00073]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: researchfish",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The National Science Foundation (Grants SES-0838161 and SES-1132399), European Research Council (ERC-2009-StG-240910-ROMETA), and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2011-327-B00073) provided financial support for this paper.

Moreover, optimization decisions, such as portfolio selection, amplify the effect of model error. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying the impact of model error and for measuring and minimizing risk in a way that is robust to model error. This robust approach starts from a baseline model and finds the worst-case error in risk measurement that would be incurred through a deviation from the baseline model, given a precise constraint on the plausibility of the deviation. Using relative entropy to constrain model distance leads to an explicit characterization of worst-case model errors; this characterization lends itself to Monte Carlo simulation, allowing straightforward calculation of bounds on model error with very little computational effort beyond that required to evaluate performance under the baseline nominal model. This approach goes well beyond the effect of errors in parameter estimates to consider errors in the underlying stochastic assumptions of the model and to characterize the greatest vulnerabilities to error in a model. We apply this approach to problems of portfolio risk measurement, credit risk, delta hedging and counterparty risk measured through credit valuation adjustment.","[Glasserman, Paul] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Xu, Xingbo] Columbia Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, IEOR Dept, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Xu, XB (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, IEOR Dept, 500 West 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",xx2126@columbia.edu,,,NSF [DMS09-14539]; Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge,We thank Xuedong He for helpful discussion.

Past studies commonly derived willingness to pay (WTP) for certain future QALY gains. However, obtaining valid WTP per QALY estimates proved to be difficult. We conducted a contingent valuation study and estimated the individual WTP per QALY under risk. We demonstrate the impact of probability weighting on WTP per QALY estimates in the Netherlands. Our estimates of the value of a QALY are in the range of a,not sign80,000-110,000 when the weighting correction was applied, and a,not sign250,500 without correction. The validity of these estimates, applying probability weighting, appears to be good. Given the reasonable support for their validity and practical meaningfulness, the estimates derived while correcting for probability weighting may provide valuable input for the debate on the consumption value of health. While decision makers should not apply these estimates without further consideration, since strictly individual valuations may not carry all relevant information and values for societal decision-making, the current estimates may provide a good and informed basis for further discussion and study of this important topic.","[Bobinac, Ana; van Exel, Job; Rutten, Frans F.

More specifically, we characterize the relevant quantities using semimartingale characteristics similarly as in C. erny and Kallsen (Ann. Probab., 35:1479-1531, 2007) for mean-variance hedging. These results are illustrated by applying them to exponential Levy processes and stochastic volatility models of Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard type (J. R. Stat. Soc. B, 63:167-241, 2001). We find that asymptotic utility-based hedges are virtually independent of the investor's risk aversion. Moreover, the price adjustments compared to the Black-Scholes model turn out to be almost linear in the investor's risk aversion, and surprisingly small unless very high levels of risk aversion are considered.","[Kallsen, Jan; Vierthauer, Richard] Univ Kiel, Math Seminar, Westring 383, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Muhle-Karbe, Johannes] ETH, Dept Matemat, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Muhle-Karbe, Johannes] Swiss Finance Inst, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Kiel; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Geneva,"Muhle-Karbe, J (通讯作者)，ETH, Dept Matemat, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",kallsen@math.uni-kiel.de; johannes.muhle-karbe@math.ethz.ch; vierthauer@math.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

This is particularly relevant in offshore applications which are typically affected by complex dynamical loads such as wind and waves. The main aim of this study is to identify the dynamical response of structural models in offshore wind turbines from experimental data in order to improve the turbine design process. The experimental data consists of a set of 1174 load and stress time-series obtained from an offshore wind turbine prototype under power production conditions. Since our first interest is to characterise the effects of wind fluxes, a first prototype has been installed onshore in order to avoid the effects of marine currents in the study. Each time-series has a total duration of 10 minutes and has been acquired at a sampling frequency of 50Hz. Data has been classified in 13 groups corresponding to different wind conditions ranging from 3 to 15 m/s. For each time-series, we use different model-selection criteria (BIC, AIC, FPE) in order to select an optimal Autoregressive moving average model with exogenous inputs (ARMAX). The stationarity of the structural response of the system is then analysed by using a dynamical linear model in which latent variables correspond to the parameters of the selected ARMAX model. The proposed methodology accounts for non-stationary dynamical response of the system and provides a powerful tool during the structural design of wind turbines.","[Olle, Jordi; Benitez, Raul] Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Dept Automat Control, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Jove, Jordi; Martin, Manel] Alstom Wind, SLU, Dept Struct Design, Barcelona 08008, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Alstom,"Ollé, J (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Dept Automat Control, Comte Urgell 187, Barcelona 08036, Spain.",,"Benítez, Raúl/AGO-5018-2022","Benítez, Raúl/0000-0002-8782-9406",,,,,0,0,0,0,1,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1292,1292,,,,,,1,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600140,0

The models compared include: a) model using only past temperatures, b) model using past and future temperatures, c) model using all available past and future weather data, d) model based on past weather data and future temperature forecasts. Results confirm that the temperature is the most influential parameter for heat load forecasting, and that accurate temperature forecasts are highly important for an online forecasting implementation.

The observed AGST variations are shown here to possess high statistical predictability within the classical Kolmogorov-Wiener theory. An example of successful extrapolation for 3 years on the basis of an autoregressive model of observed AGST is given together with an AGST extrapolation through 2020. It is suggested that the use of such predictions along with numerical projections of climate might improve the quality of model-based projections transforming them into predictions of the net climate variations: natural plus externally-caused climate change.

Moreover, when prediction intervals are constructed using unobserved component models (UCM) the problem increases, this is due to the possible existence of several components which may or may not be conditional heteroscedastic and, consequently, the true coverage depends on the correct identification of the source of the heteroscedasticity. There are proposals for testing homoscedasticity applied to the auxiliary residuals of the UCM; however, in most cases, these procedures are not able, on average, to correctly identify the heteroscedastic component. The problem is associated with transmission of heteroscedasticity between the auxiliary residuals, this transmission may generate a wrongly identification of heteroscedasticity in the component with constant conditional variance. The idea of this paper is to focus on eliminating the transmission and then, using the auxiliary residuals, to correctly identify the conditional heteroscedastic components. In addition, we propose to use an nonparametric test for testing the presence of heteroscedasticity. Simulation results show an improvement in the power and the size of several homoscedasticity tests.","[Rodriguez, Alejandra F.] Univ Talca, Dept Modelac & Gest Ind, Talca, Chile; [Ferreira, Guillermo] Univ Concepcion, Dept Estadist, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Talca; Universidad de Concepcion,"Rodriguez, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Dept Modelac & Gest Ind, Talca, Chile.",alrodriguez@utalca.cl; gferreir@udec.cl,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,329,337,,,,,,9,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600042,0

This is due to the inherent challenge and theoretical interest provided by the non-normal stable laws as well as the possibility that the processes constructed from these laws may be appropriate models for many diverse phenomena. In practice, any time series which exhibits sharp spikes or occasional bursts of outlying observations suggests the possible use of a model with stable errors having infinite variance. For time series models with infinite variance stable errors and for circular time series time series with wrapped stable errors, closed form expressions for the density are not available and hence the maximum likelihood estimate cannot be obtained, Merkouris (2007) and Thavaneswaran et al.

Although the bargaining phase is cheap talk (following a generalized alternating-offer protocol), sharp predictions arise from three axioms. Two axioms allow the players to meaningfully discuss whether to deviate from their plan; the third embodies a theory of disagreementthat play under disagreement should not vary with the manner in which bargaining broke down. Equilibria that satisfy these axioms exist for all discount factors and are simple to construct; all equilibria generate the same welfare. Optimal play under agreement generally requires suboptimal play under disagreement. Whether patient players attain efficiency depends on both the stage game and the bargaining protocol. The theory extends naturally to games with imperfect public monitoring and heterogeneous discount factors, and yields new insights into classic relational contracting questions.","[Miller, David A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Watson, Joel] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92093 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Miller, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",econdm@umich.edu; jwatson@ucsd.edu,,,"NSF [SES-1127643, SES-0095207, SES-1227527]; Microsoft Research, Yale; Cowles Foundation; NOAA Fisheries Service, Yale; Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1227527] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Microsoft Research, Yale; Cowles Foundation; NOAA Fisheries Service, Yale; Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Nageeb Ali, Jim Andreoni, Sylvain Chassang, Vince Crawford, Marina Halac, Matt Jackson, Sebastian Kranz, Ola Kvaloy, Jin Li, Garey Ramey, Larry Samuelson, Joel Sobel, and several anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions, along with seminar participants at Arizona, Collegio Carlo Alberto, Columbia, Duke-Fuqua, ETH Zurich, Florida International, IFPR, Johns Hopkins, Microsoft Research, Penn, Santa Fe Institute, Toronto, UCLA, UCSD, UC Davis, USC, USC-Marshall, Washington University, Western Ontario, and Yale, and conference participants at the GTS Third World Congress, SWET 2008, the 2008 Stony Brook Workshops, the 2009 NBER Organizational Economics Working Group, and NAWMES 2011.

Productivity differences across countries arise endogenously through free entry to the local service sector in each country. In any stable equilibrium, the countries sort themselves into specializing in different sets of tradeable goods, and a strict ranking of countries in per capita income, TFP, and the capital-labor ratio emerges endogenously. Furthermore, the distribution of country shares, the Lorenz curve, is unique and analytically solvable in the limit, as the number of countries grows unbounded. Using this limit as an approximation allows us to study what determines the shape of distribution, to perform various comparative statics, and to evaluate the welfare effects of trade.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Matsuyama, K (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",k-matsuyama@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,21,11,11,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2013,81.0,5,,,,,2009,2031,,10.3982/ECTA10107,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,227BY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325084100008,0

The bulk of the existing literature has focused on the application of unit root tests allowing for structural breaks in the trend function under the trend stationary alternative but not under the unit root null. These tests, however, provide little information regarding the existence and number of trend breaks. Moreover, these tests suffer from serious power and size distortions due to the asymmetric treatment of breaks under the null and alternative hypotheses. This article estimates the number of breaks in trend employing procedures that are robust to the unit root/stationarity properties of the data. Our analysis of the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries thereby permits a robust classification of countries according to the growth shift, level shift, and linear trend hypotheses. In contrast to the extant literature, unit root tests conditional on the presence or absence of breaks do not provide evidence against the unit root hypothesis.","[Kejriwal, Mohitosh] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Lopez, Claude] Banque France, Int Macroecon Div, Paris, France",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Kejriwal, M (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",mkejriwa@purdue.edu,"Lopez, Claude/C-3053-2013","Lopez, Claude/0000-0002-6969-9193",,,,,57,22,24,0,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We show that by properly choosing instrument functions, one can transform conditional moment inequalities/equalities into unconditional ones without losing identification power. Based on the unconditional moment inequalities/equalities, we construct CS's by inverting Cramervon Mises-type or KolmogorovSmirnov-type tests. Critical values are obtained using generalized moment selection (GMS) procedures. We show that the proposed CS's have correct uniform asymptotic coverage probabilities. New methods are required to establish these results because an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter affects the asymptotic distributions. We show that the tests considered are consistent against all fixed alternatives and typically have power against n1/2-local alternatives to some, but not all, sequences of distributions in the null hypothesis.

In particular, they are strict in the sense that more of the key resource (which may, for example, be the size or structure of the tie-breaking region where the weights of the different coalitions are considered so close that we are allowed to specify either winningness or nonwinningness of the coalition) yields the flexibility to capture strictly more games.","[Gvozdeva, Tatiana; Slinko, Arkadii] Univ Auckland, Dept Math, Auckland, New Zealand; [Hemaspaandra, Lane A.] Univ Rochester, Dept Comp Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Auckland; University of Rochester,"Gvozdeva, T (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Math, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand.",t.gvozdeva@math.auckland.ac.nz; a.slinko@auckland.ac.nz,"; Hemaspaandra, Lane/W-7512-2018","Slinko, Arkadii/0000-0002-0397-6290; Hemaspaandra, Lane/0000-0003-0659-5204","University of Auckland's Faculty of Science [3624495/9844]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; [NSF-CCF-0426761]; [NSF-CCF-0915792]; [NSF-CCF-1101479]; [ARC-DP110101792]; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1101479, 0915792] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",University of Auckland's Faculty of Science; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); ; ; ; ; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"During a talk on roughly weighted games at the March 2010 Dagstuhl Seminar on Computational Foundations of Social Choice, Bill Zwicker asked whether those games were merely the start of some hierarchy.

The population was those with active disease who had not responded to conventional therapy. The specified comparators were conventional care and two other tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors (adalimumab and etanercept). Outcomes to be considered were disease activity, functional capacity, disease progression, adverse effects of treatment and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). There were no head-to-head trials comparing TNF-alpha. inhibitors. The submission included one trial of golimumab versus placebo (the GO-RAISE trial) and additionally seven placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of other TNF-alpha inhibitor agents (five with etanercept, and two with adalimumab). The results of these trials were generally a statistically significant improvement from each of the TNF-alpha inhibitors. A Bayesian mixed treatment comparison (MTC) showed there was generally overlap in the 95 % credible intervals (CrIs) between the TNF-alpha inhibitors. Exceptions included a greater risk of discontinuation of treatment for golimumab than for etanercept (relative risk [RR] 4.30; 95 % CrI 1.01-18.50). The cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) compared all of these TNF-alpha inhibitors. Relative effectiveness was informed only by RR of response (proportion achieving at least a 50 % improvement in Bath AS Disease Activity Index [BASDAI] score; BASDAI50) from the MTC. In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of golimumab versus conventional care was 26,597 pound and adalimumab and etanercept were extendedly dominated by golimumab. The manufacturer concluded that golimumab is a cost-effective treatment option. Generally, the ERG agreed with the MTC analyses. The main problem was that the MS used data from one trial, which included a period of cross-over. The ERG found some problems with the CEA model, mainly that it did not allow for comparison of TNF-alpha inhibitor sequences and did not use MTC estimates for treatment discontinuation or adverse events (AEs). The ERG could not correct the sequencing problem, but re-ran the CEA with discontinuations and AEs estimated from the MTC and using the correct trial data. The results of the ERG analysis were that golimumab was extendedly dominated by etanercept, and the preferred treatment was either conventional treatment or etanercept, depending on the ICER threshold. Uncertainty was also substantial. NICE issued guidance (technology appraisal [TA] 233), which recommended golimumab according to the indications described in TA143 for etanercept and adalimumab, i.e. as first-line. therapy among the TNF-alpha inhibitors unless patients are intolerant to one or both alternatives. Given the factors cited by NICE for their decision, the ERG recommends that there should be greater clarity in the NICE methods guidance on handling uncertainty in CEAs as well as the incorporation of benefit from process of care.","[Armstrong, Nigel; Misso, Kate; Manning, Nathan; Kleijnen, Jos; Riemsma, Rob] Kleijnen Systemat Reviews Ltd, Unit 6, York YO19 6FD, N Yorkshire, England; [Joore, Manuela; van Asselt, Thea; Tomini, Florian] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Kleijnen, Jos] Maastricht Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Maastricht, Netherlands",Kleijnen Systematic Reviews; Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Armstrong, N (通讯作者)，Kleijnen Systemat Reviews Ltd, Unit 6, Escrick Business Pk, York YO19 6FD, N Yorkshire, England.",nigel@systematic-reviews.com,"Riemsma, Rob/E-2319-2016; Misso, Kate/D-2060-2016; Misso, Kate/IYJ-4543-2023","Riemsma, Rob/0000-0001-8892-0861; Misso, Kate/0000-0002-4924-4327; Joore, Manuela/0000-0002-5649-6768; Tomini, Florian/0000-0003-2220-5210",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [08/205/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project number 08/205/01).

We adopt the factor analytical approach by estimating the sample variance of individual effects rather than the effects themselves. In the presence of cross-sectional heteroskedasticity, the factor method estimates the average of the cross-sectional variances instead of the individual variances. The method thereby eliminates the incidental-parameter problem in the means and in the variances over the cross-sectional dimension. We further show that estimating the time effects and heteroskedasticities in the time dimension does not lead to the incidental-parameter bias even when T and N are comparable. Moreover, efficient and robust estimation is obtained by jointly estimating heteroskedasticities.","[Bai, Jushan] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Bai, Jushan] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China",Columbia University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Bai, JS (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA.",jushan.bai@columbia.edu,,,"NSF [SES-0962410]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0962410] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The author thanks a co-editor and three anonymous referees for constructive comments, and Marcelo Moreira for useful discussions.

This occurs because the bootstrap distribution of a normalised sum of infinite variance random variables tends to a random distribution. Consistent bootstrap algorithms based on subsampling methods have been proposed but have the drawback that they deliver much wider confidence sets than those generated by the iid bootstrap owing to the fact that they eliminate the dependence of the bootstrap distribution on the sample extremes. In this paper we propose sufficient conditions that allow a simple modification of the bootstrap (Wu, 1986) to be consistent (in a conditional sense) yet to also reproduce the narrower confidence sets of the iid bootstrap. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed bootstrap method works very well in practice delivering coverage rates very close to the nominal level and significantly narrower confidence sets than other consistent methods.","[Taylor, A.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group (ScHARR-TAG) at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the manufacturer's submission to NICE. Clinical evidence was derived from a multinational randomized open-label phase III trial of cabazitaxel plus prednisone or prednisolone in men with mHRPC that had progressed during or following treatment with docetaxel. The comparator was mitoxantrone plus prednisone or prednisolone. Use of cabazitaxel was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, median progression-free survival and time to tumour progression. However, it was also associated with an increased incidence of adverse events such as neutropenia. Utility data were based on interim results from the early access programme for cabazitaxel. Data were only available for a small number of patients with stable disease, resulting in great uncertainty as to the effect of cabazitaxel on quality of life. For their economic evaluation, the manufacturer estimated that the use of cabazitaxel was associated with an incremental cost of 74,908 pound per QALY gained. However, the ERG disagreed with the manufacturer over two key methodological points. The first concerned modelling and extrapolating survival; the second point was concerned with the choice of patient population. The ERG altered the manufacturer's evaluation to take into account these two points of disagreement. The resulting cost per QALY gained was 82,950 pound. The NICE Appraisal Committee believed the analysis presented by the ERG to be more plausible, and likely to be an underestimate of the cost per QALY. They concluded that whilst the clinical effectiveness of cabazitaxel had been proven, it was not likely to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources and so its use could not be recommended.","[Kearns, Ben; Jones, Myfanwy Lloyd; Stevenson, Matt; Littlewood, Chris] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Kearns, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",b.keams@sheffield.ac.uk,"Kearns, Benjamin/H-3686-2019","Kearns, Benjamin/0000-0001-7730-668X; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Littlewood, Chris/0000-0002-7703-727X",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [10/49/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project number 10/49/01).

The specifics of how VBP will work are unclear. We provide an account of the possible means by which VBP of medicines might be operationalized, and a taxonomy to describe and categorize the various approaches. We begin with a brief discussion of the UK Government's proposal for VBP and proceed to define a taxonomy of approaches to VBP. The taxonomy has five main dimensions: (1) what is identified as being of value, (2) how each element is measured, (3) how it is valued, (4) how the different elements of value are aggregated, and (5) how the result is then used to determine the price of a medicine. We take as our starting point that VBP will include a measure of health gain and that, as proposed by the UK Government, this, will be built on the QALY. Our principal interest is in the way criteria other than QALYs are taken into account, including severity of illness, the extent of unmet need, and wider societal considerations such as impacts on carers. We set out to: (1) identify and describe the full range of alternative means by which 'value' might be measured and valued, (2) identify and describe the options available for aggregating the different components of value to establish a maximum price, and (3) note the challenges and relative advantages associated with these approaches. We review the means by which aspects of VBP are currently operationalized in a selection of countries and place these, and proposals for the UK, in the context of our taxonomy. Finally, we give an initial assessment of the challenges, pros and cons of each approach. We conclude that identifying where VBP should lie on each of the five dimensions entails value judgements: there are no simple 'right or wrong' solutions. If a wider definition of value than incremental QALYs gained is adopted, as is desirable, then a pragmatic way to aggregate the different elements of value, including both QALYs and benefits unrelated to QALYs, is to use a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach. All approaches to VBP ultimately require the conversion of value, however assessed, into a monetary price. This requires assessment of the marginal values of all types of benefit, not just of QALYs. All stages of the VBP process are subject to uncertainty and margins of error. Consequently, the assessment of overall value can provide bounds to a price negotiation but cannot be expected to identify a precise value-based price.","[Sussex, Jon; Towse, Adrian; Devlin, Nancy] Off Hlth Econ, London SW1E 6QT, England",,"Sussex, J (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, 7th Floor,Southside 105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England.",jsussex@ohe.org,"Devlin, Nancy/M-3816-2014; Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014; Sussex, Jon/J-5049-2014","Sussex, Jon/0000-0001-8970-4546",Celgene UK; DH organization; NHS organization,Celgene UK(Bristol-Myers SquibbCelgene Corporation); DH organization; NHS organization,"The authors' work on this paper was supported by an unrestricted research grant from Celgene UK.

Vast differences in the approaches and discrepancies in the results give rise to heated discussions and limit the use of these models. Our main objective is to discuss the methodological challenges in modelling the cost effectiveness of treatments for MS. We conducted a review of published models to describe the approaches taken to date, to identify the key parameters that influence the cost effectiveness of DMTs, and to point out major areas of weakness and uncertainty. Thirty-six published models and analyses were identified. The greatest source of uncertainty is the absence of head-to-head randomized clinical trials. Modellers have used various techniques to compensate, including utilizing extension trials. The use of large observational cohorts in recent studies aids in identifying population-based, 'real-world' treatment effects. Major drivers of results include the time horizon modelled and DMT acquisition costs. Model endpoints must target either policy makers (using cost-utility analysis) or clinicians (conducting cost-effectiveness analyses). Lastly, the cost effectiveness of DMTs outside North America and Europe is currently unknown, with the lack of country-specific data as the major limiting factor. We suggest that limited data should not preclude analyses, as models may be built and updated in the future as data become available. Disclosure of modelling methods and assumptions could improve the transferability and applicability of models designed to reflect different healthcare systems.","[Abdolahi, Amir; Noyes, Katia] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Rochester, NY 14642 USA",University of Rochester,"Thompson, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Med, 601 Elmwood Ave,Box 648, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.",joel_thompson@urmc.rochester.edu,,"Abdolahi, Amir/0000-0002-9400-5368","Biogen Idec; National Multiple Sclerosis Society [HC 0103]; Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [UL1 RR024160]; NIH Roadmap for Medical Research","Biogen Idec(Biogen); National Multiple Sclerosis Society(National Multiple Sclerosis Society); Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); NIH Roadmap for Medical Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","The authors would like to express sincere gratitude and appreciation to Dr. Matthew Bellizzi for his clinical consultations and thoughtful suggestions.

Our objective was to determine whether economic evaluations are subject to publication bias by considering whether economic data are as likely to be reported, and reported as promptly, as effectiveness data. Methods Trials that intended to conduct an economic analysis and ended before 2008 were identified in the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) register; a random sample of 100 trials was retrieved. Fifty comparator trials were randomly drawn from those not identified as intending to conduct an economic study. The trial start and end dates, estimated sample size and funder type were extracted. For trials planning economic evaluations, effectiveness and economic publications were sought; publication dates and journal impact factors were extracted. Effectiveness abstracts were assessed for whether they reached a firm conclusion that one intervention was most effective. Primary investigators were contacted about reasons for non-publication of results, or reasons for differential publication strategies for effectiveness and economic results. Results Trials planning an economic study were more likely to be funded by government (p = 0.01) and larger (p = 0.003) than other trials. The trials planning an economic evaluation had a mean of 6.5 (range 2.7-13.2) years since the trial end in which to publish their results. Effectiveness results were reported by 70 %, while only 43 % published economic evaluations (p <0.001). Reasons for non-publication of economic results included the intervention being ineffective, and staffing issues. Funding source, time since trial end and length of study were not associated with a higher probability of publishing the economic evaluation. However, studies that were small or of unknown size were significantly less likely to publish economic evaluations than large studies (p <0.001). The authors' confidence in labelling one intervention clearly most effective did not affect the probability of publication. The mean time to publication was 0.7 years longer for cost-effectiveness data than for effectiveness data where both were published (p = 0.001). The median journal impact factor was 1.6 points higher for effectiveness publications than for the corresponding economic publications (p = 0.01). Reasons for publishing in different journals included editorial decision making and the additional time that economic evaluation takes to conduct. Conclusions Trials that intend to conduct an economic analysis are less likely to report economic data than effectiveness data. Where economic results do appear, they are published later, and in journals with lower impact factors. These results suggest that economic output may be more susceptible than effectiveness data to publication bias. Funders, grant reviewers and trialists themselves should ensure economic evaluations are prioritized and adequately staffed to avoid potential problems with bias.","[Thorn, Joanna C.; Noble, Sian M.; Hollingworth, William] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, MRC ConDuCT Hub, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Thorn, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, MRC ConDuCT Hub, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",joanna.thorn@bristol.ac.uk,,"Noble, Sian/0000-0002-8011-0722; Hollingworth, William/0000-0002-0840-6254",Medical Research Council [G0800800]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G007543/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0800800] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G007543/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [G0800800] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),The authors thank Dr Lisa Hampson for her assistance with the statistical analyses.

The basic idea is to first estimate the derivative of the conditional mean of Y given X at x with respect to x on the uncensored sample without correcting for the effect of x on the censored population. We then correct the derivative for the effects of the selection bias. We discuss nonparametric and semiparametric estimators for the derivative.

Moreover, in the spirit of Collin Dufresne, Hugonnier, and Goldstein, we propose a simple pricing formula under an equivalent change of measure. Two processes will play a central role: the hazard process and the martingale hazard process attached to a default time. The crucial step is to understand the difference between them, which has been an open question in the literature so far. We show that pseudo-stopping times appear as the most general class of random times for which these two processes are equal. We also show that these two processes always differ when t is an honest time, providing an explicit expression for the difference. Eventually we provide a solution to another open problem: we show that if t is an arbitrary random (default) time such that its Azema's supermartingale is continuous, then t avoids stopping times.","[Coculescu, Delia; Nikeghbali, Ashkan] Univ Zurich, Swiss Banking Inst, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Nikeghbali, Ashkan] Univ Zurich, Inst Math, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Zurich,"Coculescu, D (通讯作者)，Plattenstr 32, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",coculescu@isb.uzh.ch; ashkan.nikeghbali@math.uzh.ch,"Coculescu, Delia/GXF-2147-2022",,National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK); Credit Suisse,National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Credit Suisse,We would like to thank Monique Jeanblanc for helpful discussions and comments.

The ruin is defined through the status of the aggregate risk process, which in turn is determined by premium accumulation as well as claim settlement outgo for the insurance company. The main purpose of this work is to design an effective alarm system, i.e. to define alarm times and to recommend augmentation of capital of suitable magnitude at those points to reduce the chance of ruin. To draw a fair measure of effectiveness of alarm system, comparison is drawn between an alarm system, with capital being added at the sound of every alarm, and the corresponding system without any alarm, but an equivalently higher initial capital. Analytical results are obtained in general setup and this is backed up by simulated performances with various types of loss severity distributions. This provides a strategy for suitably spreading out the capital and yet addressing survivability concerns at factory level. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

I propose dynamic valuation decompositions (DVD's) designed to distinguish components of an underlying economic model that influence values over long investment horizons from components that impact only the short run. A DVD represents the values of stochastically growing claims to consumption payoffs or cash flows using a stochastic discount process that both discounts the future and adjusts for risk. It is enabled by constructing operators indexed by the elapsed time between the trading date and the date of the future realization of the payoff. Thus formulated, methods from applied mathematics permit me to characterize valuation behavior and the term structure of risk prices in a revealing manner.

The bargaining protocol is natural and has as its main feature that the players' shares in the surplus are determined sequentially rather than simultaneously. The protocol also assumes orderly voting, a restriction on the order in which players respond to a proposal. The bargaining protocol requires unanimous agreement for proposals to be implemented. Unlike all existing bargaining protocols with unanimous agreement, the resulting game has unique subgame perfect equilibrium utilities for any value of the discount factor.

The innovation is in considering nonseparable preferences, where issues may be complements or substitutes. Voters face a political exposure problem: the optimal vote for a particular issue will depend on the resolution of the other issues. Moreover, the probabilities that the other issues will pass should be conditioned on being pivotal. We prove that equilibrium exists when distributions over values have full support or when issues are complements. We then study large elections with two issues. There exists a nonempty open set of distributions where the probability of either issue passing fails to converge to either 1 or 0 for all limit equilibria. Thus, the outcomes of large elections are not generically predictable with independent private values, despite the fact that there is no aggregate uncertainty regarding fundamentals. While the Condorcet winner is not necessarily the outcome of a multi-issue election, we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the implementation of the Condorcet winner.","[Ahn, David S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Oliveros, Santiago] UC Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Ahn, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, 508-1 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dahn@econ.berkeley.edu; soliveros@haas.berkeley.edu,"Ahn, David/AAD-3086-2022","Oliveros, Santiago/0000-0002-4859-9767",National Science Foundation [SES-0851704],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank a co-editor and four anonymous referees for constructive guidance; in particular, Section 5 is a direct result of their suggestions.

These health gains are achieved at considerable cost, but economic evidence is lacking on superiority of one agent in terms of cost effectiveness. The objective of this systematic review was to assess fully published cost-effectiveness studies comparing the new agents docetaxel, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, gemcitabine and pemetrexed, and the targeted therapies erlotinib and gefitinib with one another. We performed systematic searches in the bibliographic databases PubMed, EMBASE and Health Economic Evaluations (HEED) [via the Cochrane Library] for fully published studies from the past 10 years. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers according to a priori inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated by two independent reviewers using standardized assessment tools. A total of 222 potential studies were identified; 11 studies and six reviews were included. The methodological quality of the full economic evaluations was fairly good. Transparency in costs and resource use, details on statistical tests and sensitivity analysis were points for improvement. In first-line treatment, gemcitabine+cisplatin was cost effective compared with other platinum-based regimens (paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinorelbine). In one study, pemetrexed+cisplatin was cost effective compared with gemcitabine+cisplatin in patients with non-squamous-cell carcinoma. In second-line treatment, docetaxel was cost effective compared with best supportive care; erlotinib was cost effective compared with placebo; and docetaxel and pemetrexed were dominated by erlotinib. We found indications of superiority in terms of cost effectiveness for gemcitabine+cisplatin in a first-line setting, and for erlotinib in a second-line setting.","[Bongers, Mathilda L.; Coupe, Veerle M.

A significant anti-correlation between dispersion and cross-sectional kurtosis is found such that dispersion is high but kurtosis is low in panic times, and the opposite in normal times. The co-movement of stock returns also increases in panic times. We define a simple statistic s, the normalized sum of signs of returns on a given day, to capture the degree of correlation in the system. s can be seen as the order parameter of the system because if s = 0 there is no correlation (a disordered state), whereas for s not equal 0 there is correlation among stocks (an ordered state). We make an analogy to non-equilibrium phase transitions and hypothesize that financial markets undergo self-organization when the external volatility perception rises above some critical value. Indeed, the distribution of s is unimodal in normal times, shifting to bimodal in times of panic. This is consistent with a second-order phase transition. Simulations of a joint stochastic process for stocks use a multi-timescale process in the temporal direction and an equation for the order parameter s for the dynamics of the cross-sectional correlation. Numerical results show good qualitative agreement with the stylized facts of real data, in both normal and panic times.","[Borland, Lisa] Evnine & Associates Inc, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA",,"Borland, L (通讯作者)，Cogence Capital, 3733 22nd St, San Francisco, CA 94114 USA.",lisa@cogencecapital.com,,,,,,,30,11,12,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Ours is a leading variable for the business cycle and exhibits low persistence which avoids the fictitious long-horizon predictability associated with other predictors used in the literature. We compare our variable with the most popular predictors in a sample period that includes the recent financial crisis. Our results suggest that oil price changes are the only variable with forecasting power for stock returns. This significant predictive ability is robust against the inclusion of other variables and out-of-sample tests. We also study the cross-section of expected stock returns in a conditional CAPM framework based on oil price shocks. Our model displays high statistical significance and a better fit than all the conditional and unconditional models considered, including the FamaFrench three-factor model. From a practical perspective, ours is a high-frequency, observable variable that has the advantage of being readily available to market-timing investors.","[Casassus, Jaime] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Higuera, Freddy] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Ingn Ind, Antofagasta, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad Catolica del Norte,"Casassus, J (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",jcasassus@uc.cl,"Casassus, Jaime/F-8714-2012","Casassus, Jaime/0000-0002-5049-522X",FONDECYT [1110841]; Grupo Security through FinanceUC; CONICYT,FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Grupo Security through FinanceUC; CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),"We would like to thank Augusto Castillo, Gonzalo Cortazar, Rodrigo Fuentes, Borja Larrain, Chris Telmer, Jose Tessada, Eduardo Walker and seminar participants at UC.

We show that, when the number of stocks in the index is large, this model may be approximated by a local volatility model for the index and a stochastic volatility model for each stock with volatility driven by the index.

More importantly, since those local risk-minimizing strategies are in general convoluted and difficult to evaluate, we introduce Girsanov-like risk-neutral measures for the log-prices that yield more tractable and useful results. Regarding this subject, we focus on GARCH time series models with Gaussian innovations and we provide specific sufficient conditions concerning the finiteness of the kurtosis, under which those martingale measures are appropriate in the context of quadratic hedging. When this equivalent martingale measure is adapted to the price representation we are able to recover the classical pricing formulas of Duan and Heston and Nandi, as well as hedging schemes that improve the performance of those proposed in the literature.","Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, Dept Math Besancon, UFR Sci & Tech, F-25030 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Ortega, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, Dept Math Besancon, UFR Sci & Tech, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France.",juan-pablo.ortega@univ-fcomte.fr,,"Ortega, Juan-Pablo/0000-0002-5412-9622",,,,,31,8,8,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Several studies have described the direct and indirect costs of EGW, while others have reported on the burden of EGW in terms of the impact on the quality of life (QOL) of patients. The arrival of a quadrivalent HPV vaccine that protects against both cervical cancer and EGW requires a proper understanding of the impact of vaccines on costs and QOL. Using pre-defined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria, we performed a systematic review of the economic and humanistic burden of EGW. The focus of our review was on literature describing the direct and indirect costs of EGW per episode of care (EoC) or per year, as well as the impact of EGW on disease-specific, generic, or preference-based QOL measures. We also reviewed the literature on the national economic burden of EGW from the perspectives of different countries. Other aspects of EGW management that can inform economic modelling studies, such as length of EoC, number of physician visits and indirect costs, were also explored. Our review sheds light on the high economic and humanistic burden of EGW and important differences in the costs between men and women, as well as the differences in health resource utilization and costs across countries. Our study also highlights the dearth of information on the impact of EGW on the QOL and productivity of patients.","[Raymakers, Adam J.

The UK DB pension system differs from the Dutch one in terms of the steering tools and adjustment mechanisms. In addition to the sponsor guarantee, the UK system has the protection from the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) that guarantees DB pension schemes' funding shortfalls if the sponsors of the schemes are insolvent. The paper first introduces a multi-period model called value-based ALM to value the embedded options implied by both UK and Dutch pension policies and build the HBS. The HBS framework allows us to have a holistic view on the real and contingent assets and liabilities of a pension scheme and evaluate the impact of introducing a new policy for the stakeholders of the pension scheme. Then, we compare the results of a typical UK policy with a typical Dutch one. The comparison suggests the UK policy is better for participants but worse for the sponsor compared to the Dutch policy. The UK policy is more generous in indexation and participants do not have the burden to contribute to the funding recovery of the pension scheme. The PPF provides protection of the benefits up to a certain level if the sponsor is insolvent, thus, participants in a scheme with a UK pension policy are exposed to limited downside risk. On the other hand, the sponsor of the pension scheme with the UK policy shoulders a heavier burden to contribute to the recovery of the pension funding shortfalls than that of the pension scheme with the Dutch policy.

This paper proposes and analyzes simple procedures for constructing perturbations of such belief structures in which beliefs have a degree of ambiguity. Specifically, we construct ambiguous type spaces whose induced (ambiguous) belief hierarchies approximate the standard, precise, belief hierarchies corresponding to the initial type space. Based on a metric that captures the resulting approximation, two alternative procedures to construct such perturbations are introduced, and are shown to yield a simple and intuitive characterization of convergence to the initial unperturbed environment. As a special case, one of these procedures is shown to characterize the set of all finite perturbations. The introduced perturbations and their convergence properties provide conceptual foundations for the analysis of robustness to ambiguity of various solutions concepts, and for various decision rules under ambiguity.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Stauber, R (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",ronald.stauber@anu.edu.au,,"Stauber, Ronald/0000-0001-6373-4034",,,,,35,2,3,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Our model is a point process mainly characterized by four kernels associated with, respectively, the trade arrival self-excitation, the price changes mean reversion, the impact of trade arrivals on price variations and the feedback of price changes on trading activity. It allows one to account for both stylized facts of market price microstructure (including random time arrival of price moves, discrete price grid, high-frequency mean reversion, correlation functions behaviour at various time scales) and the stylized facts of market impact (mainly the concave-square-root-like/relaxation characteristic shape of the market impact of a meta-order).

Moreover, the empirical merger and acquisitions literature documents a time-varying level and duration of the stock price runup of target firms. Using a market microstructure approach, we model stock price runup as a stochastic process that shifts between a random walk without drift and a predictable process dependent on a parsimonious set of state variables. Consistent with the market microstructure literature, predictability in prices can be exploited only by the informed trader. The model is capable of explaining the complex stylized facts observed in stock price runup. It is also consistent with the merger wave literature, as we find that capital liquidity, economic growth, and market valuations drive the complex dynamics of stock price runup.","[Brigida, Matthew] Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Clarion, PA 16214 USA; [Madura, Jeff; Viale, Ariel] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Clarion University of Pennsylvania; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Viale, A (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",aviale@fau.edu,,"Viale, Ariel/0000-0003-0125-8321; Brigida, Matt/0000-0003-1937-2712",,,,,22,1,1,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The present study departs from the tendency in earlier analyses to attribute the problem of information asymmetry to the entrepreneur only. In view of the obvious social benefits that the development of the venture capital industry brings, the government should take upon itself to consider tax incentives and changes to regulatory policies in order to attract venture capital investments. Three scenarios are portrayed here to examine the issue of asymmetric information in the venture capital market: (1) when both the venture capitalist's and entrepreneur's efforts are observable and the government incentive policy is available; (2) when the entrepreneur's effort is unobservable but the venture capitalist's is observable and government tax incentive is available; and (3) when the entrepreneur's effort is observable but the venture capitalist's effort is unobservable, and regulatory monitoring and government tax incentives are uncertain. This investigation reveals that the tax incentive policy and regulatory measures put in place by the government can significantly and positively affect the outcome of the entrepreneurial project by reducing information asymmetry.","Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Wong, AS (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",afanson@inet.polyu.edu.hk,,,,,,,32,3,6,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The values of 80 EQ-5D-3L health states were elicited from a general Singaporean population sample using a TTO method. In face-to-face interviews, participants were asked to value a block of ten health states. Various linear regression models were examined to assess for goodness of fit to the data, at both aggregate and individual levels. Prediction precision was assessed in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), and numbers of prediction errors larger than 0.10 and 0.20. Prediction consistency and bias were also assessed. A total of 456 participants provided data for this study. The N3 model without a constant estimated using the aggregate data exhibited the best fit of the data, predicted values with the least bias, and generated logically consistent values for all 243 EQ-5D-3L health states. The MAE was 0.1137, and 35 of 80 predicted values had errors less than 0.10 in absolute magnitude. Based on this model, the utility values ranged from 0.854 for state 11121 to -0.769 for state 33333. The EQ-5D-3L value set can be estimated using the TTO method in the multi-cultural, multi-ethnic Singapore. Although the estimation precision is not optimal, the health-state preference values generated in this study are useful to health service researchers in the country before estimates with smaller errors are available.","[Luo, Nan; Wang, Pei; Lim, Yee-Wei; Vrijhoef, Hubertus J.

Under these equivalent conditions any set of posteriors for the players is consistent (i.e., there is a common prior).

This approach generates rates of return which measure a fund's or portfolio's performance and a fund manager's performance. It also enables to show that the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is a weighted mean of holding period rates associated with interim values which differ from market values, so that value additivity is violated. The manager's Arithmetic Internal Rate of Return (AIRR) is shown to be the true period equivalent of the cumulative Time Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR), whereas the period TWRR (a geometric return) provides a different ranking. The method is easily generalized for coping with varying benchmark rates. We also cope with the practical problem of estimating interim values whenever they are not available. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the long investment horizons involved, stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rates are important factors to include in their valuation. Moreover, investors are typically allowed to participate in a mixed fund composed of both equity and fixed-income securities. Here, we develop an efficient method for valuing these path-dependent products through re-writing the problem in the form of an Asian styled claim and a dimensionally reduced partial differential equation (PDE). The PDE is then solved using an Alternating Direction Implicit method. Furthermore, we derive an analytical closed form approximation and compare this approximation with the PDE results and find excellent agreement. We illustrate the various effects of the parameters on the valuation through numerical experiments and discuss their financial implications.","[Donnelly, Ryan] Univ Toronto, Dept Math, Toronto, ON M5S 2E4, Canada; [Jaimungal, Sebastian] Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Jaimungal, Sebastian] Univ Toronto, Math Finance Program, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Rubisov, Dmitri H.] BMO Capital Markets, Toronto, ON M5X 2A1, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Jaimungal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",sebastian.jaimungal@utoronto.ca,,"Jaimungal, Sebastian/0000-0002-0193-0993",NSERC; Mprime,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Mprime,Ryan Donnelly and Sebastian Jaimungal thank NSERC and Mprime for partially funding this work.,,20,16,19,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Time series analysis is a methodology highly valuable in the assessment of health trends and control program performance. The present study applies Dynamic Regression models in order to potentially contribute to a better characterization of the PTB monthly incidence rates in Portugal mainland and the impact of lagged predictor variables. Materials and Methods: Monthly PTB incidence rates (per 100,000 population) for Portugal mainland were analyzed, from 2000 to 2009. Dynamic regression models were employed to study PTB time series behavior and its association with up to six months lagged predictor variables. The predictor variables in the dynamic model were calculated as monthly proportions of TB cases that were alcohol consumers, smokers, drug users, inmates, homeless, HIV positive, community home, a new PTB case, immigrants from a high risk country and belonging to a certain age group. Results: A dynamic regression model with SARIMA(2,1,0)(1,0,0) 12 structure for the errors revealed to be the best-fit model to monthly PTB incidence rates. Forecasts were performed for the year 2010. The predicted values were very close to the observed PTB monthly incidence rates for the year 2010. Overall, estimated future projections indicate a persistence of the decreasing trend in year 2010, with a peak in April and trough in December. We have seen that the model with predictor variables is better (in terms of fitting and forecasting) than the SARIMA model without predictors. Discussion and Conclusion: Understanding what characterizes patients who suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis is of great importance when establishing screening strategies to better control tuberculosis disease. Dynamic regression models with ARIMA errors prove to be useful in identifying high-risk groups associated with PTB incidence rates that should be targeted by control programs and in performing accurate predictions. Forecast analysis shown that the past pattern modeled herein will continue into the future. However, such assumption may not be valid in the near future, given that Portugal entered an economic crisis in 2008 which can affect the PTB incidence rates.","[Gomes, Dulce; Filipe, Patricia A.] Univ Evora, CIMA UE, Sch Sci & Technol, Evora, Portugal; [Bras, Ana L.] Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, PAH, Calgary, AB, Canada; [de Sousa, Bruno] Univ Coimbra, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, CINEICC, Coimbra, Portugal; [Nunes, Carla] Nova Univ Lisbon, Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Evora; University of Calgary; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Gomes, D (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, CIMA UE, Sch Sci & Technol, Evora, Portugal.",,"Filipe, Patrícia A/X-5967-2018; de Sousa, Bruno/A-1654-2012; de Sousa, Bruno/S-2600-2019; Nunes, Carla/H-1732-2011","de Sousa, Bruno/0000-0001-9918-8100; Nunes, Carla/0000-0003-4562-1057",,,,,24,0,0,0,10,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1331,1340,,,,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600148,0

We show that DCRHM is a reliable and efficient model for forward default prediction through maximum likelihood analysis. We use actual panel data-sets to illustrate the proposed methodology. Using an expanding rolling window approach, our empirical results statistically confirm that DCRHM has better and more robust out-of-sample performance than DHM, in the sense of yielding more accurate predicted number of forward defaults.

In the aftermath of the 2008-2009 crisis governments have become increasingly aware of the importance to generate trustworthy, time-consistent budget forecasts. Recently, several papers (Onorante et. al., 2008; Pedragal & Perez, 2010; Hallet et. al., 2012. Ghysels & Ozkan, 2012) showed that using intra-annual data can increase forecasting performance. In addition, these models can provide governments with early warning signals. A second strand of literature (Lutkepo, 2010; Asimakopoulos et. al., 2013) recognizes that aggregating the forecasts for different expenditure and revenue components reduces the forecast error of the resulting budget deficit. Unfortunately, little evidence is available concerning the best models for specific revenue categories like stamp duties or inheritance taxes. In this paper we contribute to the literature by modeling the regional revenues of stamp duties using quarterly and monthly data covering the time period 1994-2013. More than 60 models were tested, including a-theoretical AR and (E(G)) ARCH models, and more theory driven DL, ADL, VAR, VEC models. In addition, combination forecasts were produced. Forecast horizons vary from one month ahead to 2 years ahead; model selection is based on the Aikake Information Criteria and on theoretical arguments, stemming from housing models. Performance evaluation is based on MPE, MAPE and RMSPE of both insample as well as out-of-sample forecasts.. In general, multivariate models show lower in-sample forecasting errors than univariate models. Based on the out-of-sample performance, theory driven models outperform the least complex models for shorter forecasting horizons.

It also has the significant responsibility to identify the production capabilities, in order to see if they meet the market requirements. As the demands can vary as the times passes, the production plan must be able to face those variations. In this paper we focus on the mining of the time series formed by all the past results using an artificial neural network based simulation system that is able to identify an appropriate production forecast. For the simulation of the production planning system is presented an approach based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique adapted to job shop scheduling problem. The results of the production simulations are used as historical data in order to forecast the future demands and the amount of time needed to satisfy them. The time series forecast results show that data mining can be used in this domain in order to extract patterns that can be used to optimize the production process.","Petr Gas Univ Ploiesti, Ploiesti, Romania",Oil & Gas University of Ploiesti,"Toader, FA (通讯作者)，Petr Gas Univ Ploiesti, Ploiesti, Romania.",toader_florentina_alina@yahoo.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,2,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,916,925,,,,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600105,0

We are interested in which components (including parametric and non-parametric components) are nonzero. The additive nonparametric functions are approximated by polynomial splines. We propose a doubly penalized procedure to obtain an initial estimate and then use the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator to identify nonzero components and to obtain the final selection and estimation results. We establish selection and estimation consistency of the estimator in addition to asymptotic normality for the estimator of the parametric components by employing a penalized quasi-likelihood. Thus our estimator is shown to have an asymptotic oracle property.

First, access to agents' private information is costly and unobservable. Second, the mechanism may communicate sequentially with the agents. Third, the mechanism designer and all the agents share a common interest. As an example one can think of N geologists that study the potential oil reserves in some tract. The geologists agree on the right course of action, given their N studies. However, carrying out the study may be costly for a geologist and so he may opt to fabricate a study. The oil company that employs these geologists need not contract them simultaneously and may, furthermore, choose to provide some of the results of early studies to geologists employed later on. Finally, the geologists and the oil company would like the joint study to forecast the quantity of oil reserves as accurate as possible. It turns out that, in such settings, what may not be implementable without communication becomes implementable with communication. Clearly, the possibility for sequential communication introduces a lot of complexity to the design problem. However, we provide a result in the spirit of the revelation principle and argue that whenever implementation is possible with communication it is also possible with a simple communication mechanism. Formally, we extend the model and results in Smorodinsky and Tennenholtz (Games Econ Behav 55(2):385-406, 2006) who consider the similar problem but restrict attention to symmetric social choice functions and IID distributions over the private information.","[Aricha, Inbar] Columbia Univ, Dept Math Educ, New York, NY USA; [Smorodinsky, Rann] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",Columbia University; Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Smorodinsky, R (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",ia2213@tc.columbia.edu; rann@ie.technion.ac.il,,,Technion fund for the promotion of research; Bernard M.

Preferences are usually assumed to be fixed and exogenously given.

In our model, an agent's preferences are based on certain 'motivationally salient' properties of the alternatives over which the preferences are held. Preferences may change as new properties of the alternatives become salient or previously salient properties cease to be salient.

Details of various policies including welfare time limits, work requirements, and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) are incorporated formally in the budget constraint. Policy simulations reveal that the economy accounts for half of the increase in the labor supply of female heads of family between 1992 and 1999. A time limit results in a larger efficiency gain than a work requirement or a direct reduction in welfare benefits. A reform package can lead to both a reduction in the government expenditure and an improvement in utility. The EITC expansion results in a substantial efficiency gain among individuals with the lowest expected wage. These individuals are almost unaffected by the economic expansion, but their income and utility increase significantly under the reform package.","Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Econ Discipline Grp, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Chan, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Econ Discipline Grp, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",marc.chan@uts.edu.au,,"Chan, Marc/0000-0002-1010-7587",,,,,53,24,35,4,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2013,81.0,3,,,,,941,1001,,10.3982/ECTA9075,0.0,,,61,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,146AZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319062500003,0

However, properties such as negative asymmetry, positive correlation with stocks indexes and higher volatility levels during the trading session, typical of financial assets, and the existence of inflation hedge and positive correlation with bonds, typical of commodity futures, are also detected.

In this paper, we first study the relationship between the time consistency of dynamic risk measure and the time consistency of optimal investment policy and obtain the following conclusions: if the dynamic risk mapping is time consistent and monotone, then the corresponding optimal investment policy satisfies the time consistency requirements; however, if the dynamic risk mapping is time consistent but not monotone, then the time consistency requirements of an optimal investment policy will no longer be satisfied. Since the variance operator does not satisfy the smoothing property, the optimal investment policy derived from the existing multi-period mean-variance model is not time consistent. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose the notation of a separable expected conditional mapping and then construct a time consistent dynamic mean-variance model. We prove that the optimal investment policy derived from our model is time consistent. Moreover, for two cases with or without a riskless asset, we obtain the time consistent analytical optimal investment policy and the mean-variance efficient frontier of the new model with the self-financing constraint. Finally, numerical results illustrate the flexibility and superiority of our multi-period mean-variance model and the optimal investment policy over those in the literature. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that the reference point can serve as the critical parameter in defining greed. An asymptotic analysis on optimal trading behaviors when the pricing kernel is lognormal and the S-shaped utility function is a two-piece CRRA shows that both the level of leverage and the magnitude of potential losses will grow unbounded if the greed grows uncontrolled. However, the probability of ending with gains does not diminish to zero even as the greed approaches infinity. This explains why a sufficiently greedy behavioral agent, despite the risk of catastrophic losses, is still willing to gamble on potential gains because they have a positive probability of occurrence whereas the corresponding rewards are huge. As a result, an effective way to contain human greed, from a regulatory point of view, is to impose a priori bounds on leverage and/or potential losses.","[Zhou, Xun Yu] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford OX1 3LB, England; [Zhou, Xun Yu] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Oxford; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Zhou, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Math Inst, 24-29 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LB, England.",zhouxy@maths.ox.ac.uk,,,University of Oxford,University of Oxford,"We are grateful for comments from seminar and conference participants at Columbia, Nomura London, UBS London, Paris Dauphine, University of Hong Kong, Heriot-Watt, Glasgow, the 5th Oxford-Princeton Workshop on Financial Mathematics, and Stochastic Analysis, the 4th General Conference on Advanced Mathematical Methods for Finance in Alesund, Norway, the 2009 Strategies and Risk Analysis International Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, the 2009 IIM International Finance Conference in Calcutta, India, the 2009 Quantitative Methods in Finance Conference in Sydney, Australia, the 2010 International Conference on Actuarial and Financial Risks in Shanghai, China, and the 6th World Congress of the Bachelier Finance Society in Toronto, Canada.

Methods A comprehensive discrete event simulation was created to represent, as realistically as possible, ART management and HIV outcomes. The model was focused on patients for whom clinicians believed that LPV/r or DRV + RTV were good options as a first regimen. Prognosis was determined by the impact of initial treatment on baseline CD4+ T-cell count and viral load, adherence, virological suppression/failure/rebound, acquired resistance mutations, and ensuing treatment changes. Inputs were taken from trial data (ARTEMIS), literature and, where necessary, stated assumptions. Clinical measures included AIDS events, side effects, time on sequential therapies, cardiovascular events, and expected life-years lost as a result of HIV infection. The model underwent face, technical and partial predictive validation. Treatment-naive individuals similar to those in the ARTEMIS trial were modelled over a lifetime, and outcomes with first-line DRV + RTV were compared with those with LPV/r, both paired with tenofovir and emtricitabine. Up to three regimen changes were permitted. Drug prices were based on wholesale acquisition cost. Outcomes were lifetime healthcare costs (in 2011 US dollars) from the US healthcare system perspective and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (discounted at 3 % per annum). Results Choice of LPV/r over DRV + RTV as initial ART resulted in nearly identical clinical outcomes, but distinctly different economic consequences. Starting with an LPV/r regimen potentially results in approximately US$25,000 discounted lifetime savings. Accumulated QALYs for LPV/r and DRV + RTV were 12.130 and 12.083, respectively (a 19-day difference). In sensitivity analyses, net monetary benefit ranged from US$12,000 to US$31,000, favouring LPV/r (base case US$27,762). Conclusions A comprehensive simulation of lifetime course of HIV in the USA indicated that using LPV/r as first-line therapy compared with DRV + RTV may result in cost savings, with similar clinical outcomes.","[Simpson, Kit N.] Med Univ S Carolina, Coll Hlth Profess, Dept Hlth Leadership & Management, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Pei, Pamela P.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Med Practice Evaluat Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Pei, Pamela P.; Migliaccio-Walle, Kristen; Caro, J.

Two main explanations have been offered: firm selection (larger cities toughen competition, allowing only the most productive to survive) and agglomeration economies (larger cities promote interactions that increase productivity), possibly reinforced by localized natural advantage. To distinguish between them, we nest a generalized version of a tractable firm selection model and a standard model of agglomeration. Stronger selection in larger cities left-truncates the productivity distribution, whereas stronger agglomeration right-shifts and dilates the distribution. Using this prediction, French establishment-level data, and a new quantile approach, we show that firm selection cannot explain spatial productivity differences. This result holds across sectors, city size thresholds, establishment samples, and area definitions.","[Combes, Pierre-Philippe] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, F-13236 Marseille 02, France; [Combes, Pierre-Philippe] EHESS, F-13236 Marseille 02, France; [Duranton, Gilles] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gobillon, Laurent] CEPR, PSE, CREST, London, England; [Gobillon, Laurent] Inst Natl Etud Demog, F-75980 Paris 20, France; [Gobillon, Laurent] IZA, D-53072 Bonn, Germany; [Puga, Diego] Ctr Estudios Monetarios & Financieros CEMFI, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Roux, Sebastien] CREST INSEE, F-92245 Malakoff, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Pennsylvania; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Combes, PP (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille 02, France.",ppcombes@univmed.fr; duranton@wharton.upenn.edu; laurent.gobillon@ined.fr; diego.puga@cemfi.es; roux@ensae.fr,"Combes, Pierre-Philippe/Q-7020-2017; Puga, Diego/A-9184-2008","Combes, Pierre-Philippe/0000-0001-7935-7149; Puga, Diego/0000-0003-2640-1534","Agence Nationale de la Recherche through grant COMPNASTA (Combes); Banco de Espana Excellence Programme (Puga); Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council (Duranton); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (Combes); Comunidad de Madrid [S2007/HUM/0448 PROCIUDAD-CM]; European Commission [269868, 225551]; Fundacion Ramon Areces; IMDEA Ciencias Sociales and Madrimasd Foundations (Puga); ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Agence Nationale de la Recherche through grant COMPNASTA (Combes)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Banco de Espana Excellence Programme (Puga); Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council (Duranton); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (Combes); Comunidad de Madrid(Comunidad de Madrid); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Fundacion Ramon Areces; IMDEA Ciencias Sociales and Madrimasd Foundations (Puga); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Replication files for this paper are available from http://diegopuga.org/data/selectagg/.

We focus on the notion of constrained efficiency used in the general equilibrium literature. Our characterization of constrained efficiency uses the first-order condition of a constrained planner's problem. This condition highlights the margins of relevance for whether capital is too high or too low: the factor composition of income of the (consumption-)poor. Using three calibrations commonly considered in the literature, we illustrate that there can be either over- or underaccumulation of capital in steady state and that the constrained optimum may or may not be consistent with a nondegenerate long-run distribution of wealth. For the calibration that roughly matches the income and wealth distribution, the constrained inefficiency of the market outcome is rather striking: it has much too low a steady-state capital stock.","[Davila, Julio] Univ C Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, Louvain, Belgium; [Davila, Julio] CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Hong, Jay H.] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Krusell, Per] Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Krusell, Per] Univ Gothenburg, CAERP, CEPR, NBER, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Rios-Rull, Jose-Victor] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Rios-Rull, Jose-Victor] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, CAERP, CEPR, NBER, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Rochester; Stockholm University; University of Gothenburg; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Federal Reserve System - USA,"Dávila, J (通讯作者)，Univ C Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, Louvain, Belgium.",julio.davila@univ-paris1.fr; jay.hong@rochester.edu; per.krusell@iies.su.se; vr0j@umn.edu,"DAVILA, Julio/ABE-2802-2020","DAVILA, Julio/0000-0002-5827-9118",National Science Foundation; University of Pennsylvania Research Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Pennsylvania Research Foundation,"We thank Tim Kehoe, Michael Magill, Ivan Werning, and Martine Quinzii, as well as the editor and three anonymous referees, for very helpful comments.

We propose a very simple method which consists in grouping the trajectories of the initial process of the asset according to a quantile. The measurement of the distance between the initial process and the discretized process is realized by the L2-norm. L2 distance decreases according to the number of trajectories of the discretized process. The discretized process is then used in the valuation of the life insurance contracts. We note that a wise choice of the discretized process enables us to correctly estimate the price of a European option. Finally, the error due to the valuation of a contract in Euro using the discretized process can be reduced to less than 5%. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In our proposed models, the cost data are assumed to be dependent on the whole clinical evolution via Markov transition probabilities, and the accumulative rate of cost in a time period (sojourn) has a semiparametric structure. The medical costs are recurrent at different time points with different states under informative censoring, and the cost incurred in a sojourn at a state is correlated with that sojourn. A copula is used to model the relationship between a sojourn and its associated cost. The multivariate local likelihood method is employed to estimate model parameters and the asymptotic properties of the estimators are established as well. Our methods can be easily extended to model the total cost and to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the model. Simulations are performed to assess the proposed models and methodology, and comparisons with certain existing models are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The insurance market consists of individuals with common state-dependent utility function who are identical except for their known accident probability q. Insurers incur production costs (commonly called expenses or transaction costs by actuaries) that are proportional to the amount of insurance purchased and to the premium charged. By introducing the concept of insurance desirability, we prove that the existence of insurer expenses generates a pair of constants q(min) and q(max) that naturally partitions the applicant pool into three mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups of individuals: those individuals with accident probability q is an element of vertical bar 0, q(min)) are insurable but do not desire insurance, those individuals with accident probability q is an element of [q(min), q(max) ] are insurable and desire insurance, and those individuals with accident probability q is an element of (q(max), 1 vertical bar desire insurance but are uninsurable. We also prove that, depending on the level of q and the marginal rate of substitution between states, it may be optimal for individuals to buy complete (full) insurance, partial insurance, or no insurance at all.

To account for heterogeneity in correlation of trader values, a Gaussian model of double auction is introduced that departs from the standard information structure based on a common (fundamental) shock. The paper shows that markets are informationally efficient only if correlations of values coincide across all bidder pairs. As a result, with heterogeneously interdependent values, price informativeness may not increase monotonically with market size. As a necessary and sufficient condition for the monotonicity, price informativeness increases with the number of traders if the implied reduction in (the absolute value of) an average correlation statistic of an information structure is sufficiently small.","[Rostek, Marzena; Weretka, Marek] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Rostek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",rostek@wisc.edu; weretka@wisc.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0851876]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0851876] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank a co-editor and anonymous referees for very helpful comments.

Such drugs are gathered on a positive list, established by the Ministry of Health, with a reimbursement price cap. Hospitals still negotiate with pharmaceutical firms, who set their prices freely, and then charge the national health insurance according to their consumption, without budgetary constraints, but on the condition of good use of care. They are not allowed to charge a price higher than this ceiling price, which is called the 'responsibility tariff' (RT). This measure is included in another, larger reform, which concerns hospital financing through allotted amounts at a specific diagnosis-based level. The purpose of this add-on payment on top of the health funds is firstly to avoid heterogeneity in costs per diagnostic-related group and secondly to avoid an uncontrolled increase of prices due to a lack of interest in negotiation from hospitals, as supplementary funding could reduce hospital price sensitivity. Objectives: The aim of this work was to assess the bargaining power of hospitals with the pharmaceutical firms in the monopoly market of innovative cancer drugs since the implementation of this reimbursement price cap. Methods: This study used data from the French Technical Agency of Information on Hospitals (ATIH; Agence Technique de l'Information sur l'Hospitalisation) and included 487 hospitals, which were public and non-profit private. The analysis was conducted on the cancer drugs of the regulated list. An index representing the ratio of the purchase prices to the RT was built from 2004 to 2007 in order to make a 'before-and-after' comparison. Results: Results showed a transient price decrease in 2005 before an alignment of patented drugs with regulated prices in the context of a dynamic market with a 22.5% yearly growth rate in value between 2004 and 2007. Conclusion: Hospitals are able to impose the RT for single-brand drugs. However, they are no longer able to negotiate below the RT except for generic drugs. Negotiations take place upstream for setting the RT between the public authorities and the firms.","[Degrassat-Theas, A.] Univ Paris 09, Lab Econ & Gest Org Sante, F-75016 Paris, France; [Bensadon, M.] Tech Agcy Informat Hosp ATIH, Lyon, France; [Rieu, C.; Paubel, P.] Hop St Anne, F-75674 Paris, France; [Angalakuditi, M.] Eisai Inc, Woodcliff Lake, NJ USA",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite Paris Cite; GHU PARIS Psychiatrie Neurosciences; Eisai Co Ltd,"Degrassat-Théas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Lab Econ & Gest Org Sante, Pl Marechal Lattre de Tassigny, F-75016 Paris, France.",albanedegrassat@gmail.com,"Degrassat-Théas, Albane/HTQ-3094-2023",,,,,,12,9,9,0,22,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,7,,,,,565,573,,,,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,966DG,22686661.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305817200003,0

We provide here an empirical study of the cross-correlation between all these different events, and their respective impact on future price changes. We define and extract from the data the 'bare' impact these events would have if they were to happen in isolation. For large tick stocks, we show that a model where the bare impact of all events is permanent and non-fluctuating is in good agreement with the data. For small tick stocks, however, bare impacts must contain a history-dependent part, reflecting the internal fluctuations of the order book. We show that this effect can be accurately described by an autoregressive model of the past order flow. This framework allows us to decompose the impact of an event into three parts: an instantaneous jump component, the modification of the future rates of the different events, and the modification of the jump sizes of future events. We compare in detail the present formalism with the temporary impact model that was proposed earlier to describe the impact of market orders when other types of events are not observed. Finally, we extend the model to describe the dynamics of the bid-ask spread.","[Eisler, Zoltan; Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe; Kockelkoren, Julien] Capital Fund Management, Paris, France",,"Eisler, Z (通讯作者)，Capital Fund Management, Paris, France.",zoltan.eisler@cfm.fr,,,,,,,20,80,94,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We propose necessary and sufficient conditions for the identification of the parameters in the presence of instrumental variables. We also focus on the estimation of beta. It is known that the presence of phi may lead to a slow rate of convergence for the estimator of beta. An additional complication in the fully endogenous model is that the solution of the equation necessitates the inversion of a compact operator that has to be estimated non-parametrically. In general this inversion is not stable, thus the estimation of beta is ill-posed. In this paper, a root n-consistent estimator for beta is derived in this setting under mild assumptions. One of these assumptions is given by the so-called source condition that is explicitly interpreted in the paper. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the reasonable performance of the estimation procedure on finite samples.","[Florens, Jean-Pierre] Univ Toulouse 1, TSE, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Johannes, Jan] Catholic Univ Louvain, ISBA, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Van Bellegem, Sebastien] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Florens, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse 1, TSE, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",florens@cict.fr; jan.johannes@uclouvain.be; sebastien.vanbellegem@uclouvain.be,,"Van Bellegem, Sebastien/0000-0002-5648-5460",Agence National de la Recherche [ANR-09-JCJC-0124-01]; SCOR Chair on 'Market Risk and Value Creation'; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-09-JCJC-0124] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Agence National de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); SCOR Chair on 'Market Risk and Value Creation'; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors are grateful to R.

Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) are conducted in accordance with the existing agreed Irish HTA guidelines. These guidelines do not specify a formal analysis of value of information (VOI). Objective: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the benefits of using VOI analysis in decreasing decision uncertainty and to examine the viability of applying these techniques as part of the formal HTA process for reimbursement purposes within the Irish healthcare system. Method: The evaluation was conducted from the Irish health payer perspective. A lifetime model evaluated the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin sodium for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism after total hip replacement. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was determined directly from the probabilistic analysis (PSA). Population-level EVPI (PEVPI) was determined by scaling up the EVPI according to the decision incidence. The expected value of perfect parameter information (EVPPI) was calculated for the three model parameter subsets: probabilities, preference weights and direct medical costs. Results: In the base-case analysis, rivaroxaban dominated both dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin sodium. PSA indicated that rivaroxaban had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy over a threshold range of sic0-sic100 000 per QALY. At a threshold of sic45 000 per QALY, the probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy was 67%. At a threshold of sic45 000 per QALY, assuming a 10-year decision time horizon, the PEVPI was sic11.96 million and the direct medical costs subset had the highest EVPP1 value (sic9.00 million at a population level). In order to decrease uncertainty, a more detailed costing study was undertaken. In the subsequent analysis, rivaroxaban continued to dominate both comparators. In the PSA, rivaroxaban continued to have the highest probability of being optimal over the threshold range sic0-sic100 000 per QALY. At sic45 000 per QALY, the probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy increased to 80%. At sic45 000 per QALY, the 10-year PEVPI decreased to sic3.58 million and the population value associated with the direct medical costs fell to sic1.72 million. Conclusion: This increase in probability of cost effectiveness, coupled with a substantially reduced potential opportunity loss could influence a decision maker's confidence in making a reimbursement decision.

Whilst this modeling enables insurers to project mortality rates and hence price mortality products it does not provide good fit for younger aged mortality. Mortality rates below the early 20's are important to model as they give an insight into estimates of the cohort effect for more recent years of birth. It is also important given the cumulative nature of life expectancy to be able to forecast mortality improvements at all ages. When we attempt to fit existing models to a wider age range, 5-89, rather than 20-89 or 50-89, their weaknesses are revealed as the results are not satisfactory. The linear innovations in existing models are not flexible enough to capture the non-linear profile of mortality rates that we see at the lower ages. In this paper, we modify an existing 4 factor model of mortality to enable better fitting to a wider age range, and using data from seven developed countries our empirical results show that the proposed model has a better fit to the actual data, is robust, and has good forecasting ability.

One important aspect of portfolio risk management is risk attribution, the process of decomposing a risk measure into components that are attributed to individual assets or activities. The theory of portfolio risk attribution has limited applicability to systemic risk because systems can have richer structure than portfolios. This article contributes to the theory of systemic risk attribution and illuminates the design process for systemic risk attribution by developing some schemes for attributing systemic risk in an application to deposit insurance.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, McCormick Sch Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Staum, J (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, McCormick Sch Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",j-staum@northwestern.edu,"Staum, Jeremy/B-7494-2009",,FDIC Center for Financial Research; IBM,FDIC Center for Financial Research; IBM(International Business Machines (IBM)),"This material appears in a FDIC Center for Financial Research working paper (Liu and Staum 2011b).

In this paper we establish second-order approximation of risk concentration associated with a random vector X := (X-1, X-2, ..., X-d) in terms of Value at Risk (VaR) within the methodological framework of second-order regular variation and the theory of Archimedean copula. Moreover, we find that the rate of convergence of the first-order approximation of risk concentration depends on the the interplay between the tail behavior of the marginal loss random variables and their dependence structure. Specifically, we find that the rate of convergence is determined by either the second-order parameter (rho(1)) of Archimedean copula generator or the second-order parameter (rho) of the tail margins, leading to either the so-called dependence dominated case or margin dominated case.

First, in contrast to the US experience, positive alphas remain after Fama and French's three factors are applied to excess stock returns in Japan. Second, positive alphas remain in Japan, even if the Fama-French three factors combined with momentum and reversal factors are applied to excess stock returns. Third, the positive return premia unexplained by these five factors bear little relation to the dynamics of the Japanese macroeconomy. Fourth, the time series evolution of the positive return premia indicates autonomous dynamics with at least three regimes. Fifth, we can predict or time the acquisition of the positive return premia for small-size portfolios in Japan by observing the direction and effect of the return premia of large-size portfolios and high-book equity to market equity (BE/ME) portfolios. Finally, application of the self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) model shows that the size effects are stronger than the BE/ME effects in Japan, given that the return premia from small-size portfolios in the SETAR model are bounded by positive thresholds, while the return premia from high-BE/ME portfolios are bounded by negative thresholds.","Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Tsuji, C (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",mail_sec_low@minos.ocn.ne.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Nihon Housei Gakkai,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Nihon Housei Gakkai","The authors acknowledge the generous financial assistance of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance, and the Nihon Housei Gakkai.

Parent-proxy reports are known to differ from children's reports. Simultaneous assessment using a parent-child dyad is an alternative approach. Objective: Our objective was to assess the validity, reliability and responsiveness of a parent-child dyad approach to utility and HR-QOL assessment of paediatric asthma health states. Methods: The setting was specialist care in a hospital-based asthma clinic. Participants were 91 girls and boys with asthma aged 8 to 17 years and 91 parents. The intervention employed was parent-child dyad administration of the Health Utilities Index (HUI) 2 and 3, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (TM) (Ped5QL (TM)) Core and Asthma modules, and the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ). Questionnaires were administered by interview to children and parents separately and then together as a dyad to assess the child's health state. The dyad interview was repeated at the next clinic visit. Dyad-child agreement was measured by intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficient; Spearman correlations were used to assess convergent validity. Test-retest reliability was assessed in 28 children who remained clinically stable between visits with a two-way ICC coefficient. Responsiveness to change from baseline was assessed with Spearman coefficients in 30 children who demonstrated clinical change between visits. Results: There was no significant agreement between parent and child for the HUI2 or HUI3 whereas agreement between dyad and child was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36, 0.69) for the HUI2 and 0.74(95% CI 0.61, 0.82) for the HUI3 overall. With respect to dyad performance characteristics, both HUI2 and HUI3 overall scores demonstrated moderate convergent validity with the generic PedsQL (TM) Core domains (range r=0.30-0.52; p<0.01). Dyad HUI2 attributes demonstrated moderate convergent validity with the generic Ped5QL (TM) Core domains of similar constructs (range r=0.35-0.43; p<0.001) and weaker convergent validity with disease-specific domains (range r = 0.13-0.32). Dyad HUI3 attributes demonstrated weaker convergent validity compared with the HUI2. For the assessment of test-retest reliability, significant agreement between baseline and follow-up was observed for dyad HUI2 total (r=0.53), dyad PedsQL (TM) Core summary (r = 0.70) and select dyad disease-specific domains. Significant responsiveness (r>0.4; p<0.05) was observed for dyad HUI2 total score change over time as correlated with dyad HUI3, dyad Ped5QL (TM) Core summary and select disease-specific domains. Conclusions: The parent-child dyad approach demonstrated moderate to strong performance characteristics in generic and disease-specific questionnaires suggesting it may be a valuable alternative to relying on parent proxies for assessing children's utility and HR-QOL. Future research in additional paediatric populations, younger children and a population-based sample would be useful.","[Ungar, Wendy J.] Hosp Sick Children, Program Child Hlth Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Marshall, Deborah] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Calgary,"Ungar, WJ (通讯作者)，Hosp Sick Children, Program Child Hlth Evaluat Sci, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",wendy.ungar@sickkids.ca,"Boydell, Katherine/AAR-2918-2021; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Boydell, Katherine/0000-0002-1464-8532; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008; Ungar, Wendy/0000-0002-0762-0101; Dell, Sharon/0000-0003-2169-9407",Canadian Institutes of Health Research [66654]; Canada Research Chair in Health Services and Systems Research; R.B.

Econophysical analyses of transaction data for the US and Australian stock markets have uncovered market-specific scaling laws, where a master curve of price impact can be obtained in each market when stock capitalization C is included as an argument in the scaling relation. However, the rationale of introducing stock capitalization in the scaling is unclear and the anomalous negative correlation between price change r and trade size omega for small trades is unexplained. Here we show that these issues can be addressed by taking into account the aggressiveness of orders that result in trades together with a proper normalization technique. Using order book data from the Chinese market, we show that trades from filled and partially filled limit orders have very different price impacts. The price impact of trades from partially filled orders is constant when the volume is not too large, while that of filled orders shows power-law behavior r similar to omega(alpha) with alpha approximate to 2/3. When returns and volumes are normalized by stock-dependent averages, capitalization-independent scaling laws emerge for both types of trades. However, no scaling relation in terms of stock capitalization can be constructed. In addition, the relation alpha = alpha(omega)/alpha(r) is verified for some individual stocks and for the whole data set containing all stocks using partially filled trades, where alpha(omega) and alpha(r) are the tail exponents of trade sizes and returns. These observations also enable us to explain the anomalous negative correlation between r and omega for small-size trades.","[Zhou, Wei-Xing] E China Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Econophys, Sch Sci, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei-Xing] E China Univ Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Proc Syst Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei-Xing] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Fictitious Econ & Data Sci, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China",East China University of Science & Technology; East China University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Zhou, WX (通讯作者)，E China Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Econophys, Sch Sci, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",wxzhou@ecust.edu.cn,"Zhou, Wei-Xing/B-1250-2008","Zhou, Wei-Xing/0000-0002-8952-8228",'Shu Guang' project; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; Shanghai Education Development Foundation [2008SG29]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [NCET-07-0288],"'Shu Guang' project; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (SHMEC)); Shanghai Education Development Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Education, China)","I am grateful to Didier Sornette and Liang Guo for valuable discussions, Wei Chen for kindly providing the data, and Gao-Feng Gu for preprocessing the data.

The insurer who faces the risk of paying stochastic insurance claims needs to manage her asset and liability by taking into account of the correlation risk. This paper investigates the impact of correlation risk to the optimal asset liability management (ALM) of an insurer. We employ the Wishart process to model the stochastic covariance matrix of risky asset returns. The insurer aims to minimize the variance of the terminal wealth given an expected terminal wealth subject to the risk of paying out random liabilities of compound Poisson process. This ALM problem then becomes a linear quadratic stochastic optimal control problem with stochastic volatilities, stochastic correlations and jumps. The recognition of an affine form in the solution process enables us to derive the explicit closed-form solution to the optimal ALM portfolio policy, obtain the efficient frontier, and identify the condition that the solution is well behaved.

Individuals play a higher order best response to samples from the empirical data on the history of play, where the order of best response is determined by their exogenously given level of cognition. As in Young's model of adaptive play, (unperturbed) play still converges to a minimal curb set. Random perturbations of the best response dynamic identifies the stochastically stable states. In Young's model of adaptive play with simple best-responses, the set of stochastically stable states are sensitive to the sample size that individuals from a population can draw.

Aggressive withdrawal policies expose subjects to risk of bankruptcy, but the policy that maximizes expected earnings need not maximize the odds of survival. When profit maximization is consistent with high rates of survival (HS parameters), subjects adjust decisively towards the optimum. When survival and profit maximization are sharply at odds (LS parameters), subjects persistently (and sub-optimally) hoard excess cash in an evident effort to improve survival rates. The design ensures that this hoarding is not due to standard risk aversion. Analysis of period-to-period adjustments in strategies suggests instead that hoarding is due to a widespread bias towards survival in the subject population. Robustness treatments varying feedback, parameters, and framing fail to eliminate the bias.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Oprea, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, 3014 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",roprea@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation [SES-0925039],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I am grateful to the National Science Foundation for support under Grant SES-0925039, to seminar audiences at UC Berkeley, Florida State University, the University of Michigan, New York University, Purdue University, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, Stanford University, and attendants at the 2011 North American ESA Meetings.

In this review, which is not meant to be comprehensive, we cover those that in our experience are most vexing. The biggest challenge is getting decision makers to trust the model. This is a major problem because most models undergo only cursory validation; our field has lacked the motivation, time, and data to properly validate models intended to inform health care decisions. Without documented, adequate validation, there is little basis for decision makers to have confidence that the model's results are credible and should be used in a health technology appraisal. A fundamental problem for validation is that the models are very artificial and lack sufficient depth to adequately represent the reality they are simulating. Typically, modelers assume that all resources have infinite capacity so any patient needing care receives it immediately; there are no waiting times or queues, contrary to the common experience in actual practice. Moreover, all the patients enter the model simultaneously at time zero rather than over time as happens in actuality; differences between patients are ignored or minimized and structural modeling choices that make little sense (e.g., using states to represent events) are forced by commitment to a technique (and even to specific spreadsheet software!). The resulting structural uncertainty is rarely addressed, because methods are lacking and even probabilistic analysis of parameter uncertainty suffers from weak consideration of correlation and arbitrary distribution choices. Stakeholders must see to it that models are fit for the stated purpose and provide the best possible estimates given available data-the decisions at stake deserve nothing less.","[Caro, J.

To interpret this fact, we develop a structural economic model where households can hold two assets: a low-return liquid asset (e.g., cash, checking account) and a high-return illiquid asset that carries a transaction cost (e.g., housing, retirement account). The optimal life-cycle pattern of portfolio choice implies that many households in the model are wealthy hand-to-mouth: they hold little or no liquid wealth despite owning sizable quantities of illiquid assets. Therefore, they display large propensities to consume out of additional transitory income, and small propensities to consume out of news about future income. We document the existence of such households in data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. A version of the model parameterized to the 2001 tax rebate episode yields consumption responses to fiscal stimulus payments that are in line with the evidence, and an order of magnitude larger than in the standard one-asset framework. The model's nonlinearities with respect to the rebate size and the prevailing aggregate economic conditions have implications for policy design.","[Kaplan, Greg] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kaplan, Greg; Violante, Giovanni L.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Violante, Giovanni L.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Violante, Giovanni L.] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Kaplan, G (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",gkaplan@princeton.edu; glv2@nyu.edu,"Violante, Giovanni L./F-1872-2017",,"National Science Foundation [1127632]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1251480, 1127632] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Kurt Mitman for outstanding research assistance.

Using Credit Default Swaps (CDS) premia as a measure of both credit and counterparty risks, our analysis focuses on the extreme co-movements of financial institutions' default swap contracts during the high level of stress undergone by the CDS markets in the aftermath of the 2007 sub-prime crisis. Our approach is twofold. First, under different tail dependence scenarios, we calibrate several multivariate linear models of constant correlation. Our Monte Carlo simulation study finds evidence of contagion for financial institutions, notably in the U.S., and captures a non-normal dependence structure in the tails for the traded contracts. Second, we estimate a multivariate Dynamic Conditional Correlation-GARCH (DCC-GARCH) model, and demonstrate significant ARCH and GARCH effects, as well as time-varying correlations in CDS spread variations. Our overall analysis rejects the assumption of constant correlation. More importantly, it advocates changing structures in the tail dependence for CDS returns series during times of financial turmoil as an important feature of banks' increased fragility.","Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, F-92001 Nanterre, Paris, France",Universite Paris Nanterre,"Rahman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, Paris, France.",dima.rahman@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The payoff of the derivative-assets may be path-dependent. In addition, the process underlying the derivatives may exhibit killing (i.e., jump to default) as well as combined local/nonlocal stochastic volatility. The nonlocal component of volatility may be multiscale, in the sense that it may be driven by one fast-varying and one slow-varying factor. The flexibility of our modeling framework is contrasted by the simplicity of our method. We reduce the derivative pricing problem to that of solving a single eigenvalue equation. Once the eigenvalue equation is solved, the approximate price of a derivative can be calculated formulaically.

Our testing procedure covers the class of Hamilton's models, where the parameters vary according to an unobservable Markov chain, but also applies to nonlinear models where the random coefficients need not be Markov. We show that the contiguous alternatives converge to the null hypothesis at a rate that is slower than the standard rate. Therefore, standard approaches do not apply. We use Bartlett-type identities for the construction of the test statistics. This has several desirable properties. First, it only requires estimating the model under the null hypothesis where the parameters are constant. Second, the proposed test is asymptotically optimal in the sense that it maximizes a weighted power function. We derive the asymptotic distribution of our test under the null and local alternatives. Asymptotically valid bootstrap critical values are also proposed.","[Carrasco, Marine] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econom, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Hu, Liang] Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Ploberger, Werner] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Universite de Montreal; Wayne State University; Washington University (WUSTL),"Carrasco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econom, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",marine.carrasco@umontreal.ca; lianghu@wayne.edu; werner@ploberger.com,"Carrasco, Marine/ACU-3814-2022",,National Science Foundation [SES-0211418],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),An earlier version of this paper has circulated under the title Optimal Test for Markov Switching.

It derives treatment parameters in the framework of a potential outcomes model with a treatment choice equation, where the correlation between the unobservable components of the model is driven by a low-dimensional vector of latent factors. The analyst is assumed to have access to a set of measurements generated by the latent factors. This approach has attractive features from both theoretical and practical points of view. Not only does it address the fundamental identification problem arising from the inability to observe the same person in both the treated and untreated states, but it also turns out to be straightforward to implement. Formulae are provided to compute mean treatment effects as well as their distributional versions.

The proposed estimator uses a novel form of systematic differencing, called X-differencing, that eliminates fixed effects and retains information and signal strength in cases where there is a root at or near unity. The resulting panel fully aggregated estimator (PFAE) is obtained by pooled least squares on the system of X-differenced equations. The method is simple to implement, consistent for all parameter values, including unit root cases, and has strong asymptotic and finite sample performance characteristics that dominate other procedures, such as bias corrected least squares, generalized method of moments (GMM), and system GMM methods. The asymptotic theory holds as long as the cross section (n) or time series (T) sample size is large, regardless of the n/T ratio, which makes the approach appealing for practical work. In the time series AR(1) case (n = 1), the FAE estimator has a limit distribution with smaller bias and variance than the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) when the autoregressive coefficient is at or near unity and the same limit distribution as the MLE in the stationary case, so the advantages of the approach continue to hold for fixed and even small n. Some simulation results are reported, giving comparisons with other dynamic panel estimation methods.","[Han, Chirok] Korea Univ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Phillips, Peter C.

The main idea is to choose a finite number of suitable excessive functions (randomly) and to find the smallest majorant of the gain function in the span of these functions. The resulting problem is a linear semi-infinite programming problem, that can be solved using standard algorithms. This leads to good upper bounds for the original problem. For our algorithms no discretization of space and time and no simulation is necessary. Furthermore it is applicable even for high-dimensional problems. The algorithm provides an approximation of the value not only for one starting point, but for the complete value function on the continuation set, so that the optimal exercise region and, for example, the Greeks can be calculated. We apply the algorithm to (one- and) multidimensional diffusions and show it to be fast and accurate.","[Christensen, Soeren] Univ Kiel, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Christensen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Math Seminar, Ludewig Meyn Str 4, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",christensen@math.uni-kiel.de,"Christensen, Soren/E-6402-2013","Christensen, Soren/0000-0002-8598-7507",,,,,28,7,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

It has been demonstrated that water availability is an important variable in flowering intensity. However, other parameters, mainly temperature and relative humidity, influence on plant reproductive development. The present study has been performed in the city of Cordoba (South Spain). It has been analyzed airborne pollen data during the period 1996-2010. Mediterranean climate is characterized by a high inter-annual variability in its meteorological patterns, showing climatic micro-cycles, alternating wet and dry periods. The selected statistical technique for extracting the trend component of pollen time series has been the seasonal decomposition procedure by Loess method (STL). STL decomposes long time series taking into account short term patterns. It has been also analyzed changes on land uses around the city (5000 m radius, 10000 m radius, 25000 m radius, 50000 m radius) during the period 1999 and 2007. Results show different trends depending on species. Some agronomical species, as Olea, show significant increasing trend, attributable to the increment on olive crop areas during last years. On the other hand, some taxa related with strong anthropic influence, i.e. Rumex, Plantago, Amaranthaceae or Parietaria, show significant decreasing trends that could be related with recent changes in urban planning, as the increase of urban land and decreasing on urban wastelands. In the same way, the crescent trend on species with ornamental use, as Platanus, Cupressus, Mirtus or Morus is well related with changes on urbanized land around pollen trap. The increase on rainfall during the first three months of the year has been better correlated with positive trend on Poaceae and Quercus airborne pollen. Urtica membranaceae is a nitrophilous specie whose positive trend may be related with the increase of heterogeneous agricultural areas and olive grove around the city. STL method has shown high effectiveness for extracting trend component of ecological time series, because the features of nature present a wide range of possibilities and it can change quickly at short term.","[Oteros, Jose; Garcia-Mozo, Herminia; Dominguez-Vilches, Eugenio; Galan, Carmen] Univ Cordoba, Dept Bot Ecol & Plant Physiol, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence CeiA3, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba,"Oteros, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cordoba, Dept Bot Ecol & Plant Physiol, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence CeiA3, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.",,"Oteros, Jose/A-8671-2018; Domínguez-Vilches, Eugenio EDV/G-3732-2017; Oteros, Jose/AAN-5515-2020; MOZO, HERMINIA GARCIA/G-3461-2017; Galan, Carmen Mrs/M-1377-2015","Oteros, Jose/0000-0002-9369-8633; Galan, Carmen Mrs/0000-0002-6849-1219",,,,,0,0,0,0,2,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1093,1093,,,,,,1,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600121,0

Our results validate the hidden order arbitrage theory proposed by Farmer et al. [How efficiency shapes market impact, 2013] of the market impact of large institutional orders. We find that large trades are drawn from a distribution with tail exponent of roughly 3/2 and that market impact approximately increases as the square root of trade duration. We examine price reversion after the completion of a trade, finding that permanent impact is also a square root function of trade duration and that its ratio to the total impact observed at the last fill is roughly 2/3. Additionally, we confirm empirically that the post-trade price reverts to a level consistent with a fair pricing condition of Farmer et al. (2013). We study the relaxation dynamics of market impact and find that impact decay is a multi-regime process, approximated by a power law in the first few minutes after order completion and subsequently by exponential decay.","[Bershova, Nataliya; Rakhlin, Dmitry] AllianceBernstein LP, Quantitat Trading, New York, NY USA",,"Rakhlin, D (通讯作者)，AllianceBernstein LP, Quantitat Trading, New York, NY USA.",dmitry.rakhlin@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,34,41,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

If the semigroup is amenable in the sense of Day and von Neumann, one can extend the set of classical strategies, namely countably additive probability measures on S, to include some finitely additive measures in a natural way. This extended game has a value and the players have optimal strategies. This theorem extends previous results for the multiplication game on a compact group or on the positive integers with a specific payoff. We also prove that the procedure of extending the set of allowed strategies preserves classical solutions: if a semigroup game has a classical solution, this solution solves also the extended game.","[Capraro, Valerio] Univ Neuchatel, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Morrison, Kent E.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Morrison, Kent E.] Amer Inst Math, Palo Alto, CA USA",University of Neuchatel; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Capraro, V (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",valerio.capraro@virgilio.it; kmorriso@calpoly.edu,,,Swiss SNF Sinergia Project [CRSI22-130435],Swiss SNF Sinergia Project,This research has been partially supported by Swiss SNF Sinergia Project CRSI22-130435.,,19,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

This process includes both externally excited joint jumps, which are distributed according to a shot noise Cox process, and two separate self-excited jumps, which are distributed according to the branching structure of a Hawkes process with an exponential fertility rate, respectively. A constant rate of exponential decay is included in this process as it can play a role as the time value of money in economics, finance and insurance applications. We analyse this process systematically for its theoretical distributional properties, based on the piecewise deterministic Markov process theory developed by Davis (1984), and the martingale methodology used by Dassios and Jang (2003). The analytic expressions of the Laplace transforms of this process and the moments are presented, which have the potential to be applicable to a variety of problems in economics, finance and insurance. In this paper, as an application of this process, we provide insurance premium calculations based on its moments. Numerical examples show that this point process can be used for the modelling of discounted aggregate losses from catastrophic events. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The results of a simple prototype Ben-Porath model with age-specific survival rates show that an increase in lifetime labor supply is not a necessary, or a sufficient, condition for greater life expectancy to increase optimal schooling. The observed increase in survival rates during working ages that follows from the rectangularization of the survival function is crucial for schooling and labor supply. The empirical results suggest that the relative benefits of schooling have been increasing across cohorts of U.S. men born between 1840 and 1930. A simple quantitative analysis shows that a realistic shift in the survival function can lead to an increase in schooling and a reduction in lifetime labor hours.","[Cervellati, Matteo] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Sunde, Uwe] Univ Munich, Seminar Populat Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Bologna; University of Munich,"Cervellati, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",m.cervellati@unibo.it; uwe.sunde@econ.lmu.de,,"CERVELLATI, MATTEO/0000-0002-0018-9005",,,,,43,70,78,3,37,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2013,81.0,5,,,,,2055,2086,,10.3982/ECTA11169,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,227BY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325084100010,0

In this case, in order to choose the optimal portfolio, it is necessary to estimate the risk and reward of several alternative portfolios over a long-run given a sample of observations over a short-run. Two interrelated obstacles in these estimations are lack of sufficient data and the uncertainty in the nature of the return generating process. To overcome these obstacles researchers rely heavily on block bootstrap methods. In this paper we demonstrate that the estimates provided by a block bootstrap method are generally biased and we propose two methods of bias reduction. We show that an improper use of a block bootstrap method usually causes underestimation of the risk of a portfolio whose returns are independent over time and overestimation of the risk of a portfolio whose returns are mean-reverting.","[Cogneau, Philippe] Univ Liege, HEC Management Sch, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Zakamouline, Valeri] Univ Agder, Fac Econ & Social Sci, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway",University of Liege; University of Agder,"Zakamouline, V (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Serv Box 422, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway.",Valeri.Zakamouline@uia.no,,"Zakamulin, Valeriy/0000-0002-8619-7283",,,,,51,14,16,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In this paper, we will follow the event-based approach to epistemic game theory and supplement strategic games with type space models, where each type is associated with a preference relation on the state space. In such a framework, IDIP can be characterized by the conditions that at least one player has correct beliefs about the state of the world and that there is common belief that every player is rational, has correct beliefs about the state of the world and has strictly monotone preferences. Moreover, we shall compare the epistemic motivations for IDIP and its mixed strategy variant known as strong rationalizability (SR). Presuppose the above conditions. Whenever there is also common belief that players' preferences are representable by some expected utility function IDIP still applies. But if there is common belief that players' preferences are representable by some expected payoff function, then SR results.","Univ Freiburg, Inst Res Econ Evolut, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Trost, M (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Inst Res Econ Evolut, Pl Alten Synagoge,KG 2, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",michael.trost@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,22,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

We show that this model is appropriate for fitting historical mortality rates. Without traded mortality instruments the choice of risk-neutral measure is not unique and we fit it to observed historical mortality rates in our framework. We show that the risk-neutral parameters can be calibrated and are relatively insensitive of the historical period chosen. Importantly, the framework provides consistent future survival curves with the same parametric form as the initial curve in the risk-neutral measure. The multiple risk factors allow for applications in pricing and more general risk management problems. A state-space representation is used to estimate parameters for the model with the Kalman filter. A measurement error variance is included for each age to capture the effect of sample population size. Swedish mortality data is used to assess 2- and 3-factor implementations of the model. A 3-factor model specification is shown to provide a good fit to the observed survival curves, especially for older ages. Bootstrapping is used to derive parameter estimate distributions and residual analysis is used to confirm model fit. We use the Heath-Jarrow-Morton forward rate framework to verify consistency and to simulate cohort survivor curves under the risk-neutral measure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper discusses the optimal reinsurance problem with the insurer's risk measured by distortion risk measure and the reinsurance premium calculated by a general principle including expected premium principle and Wang's premium principle as its special cases. Explicit solutions of the optimal reinsurance strategy are obtained under the assumption that both the ceded loss and the retained loss are increasing with the initial loss. We present a new method for discussing the optimal problem.

However, one major drawback of Gaussian copula is that it intrinsically lacks the flexibility of modeling the tail dependence, which real life data often exhibit. In this paper, we present the modified Gaussian copula, a pseudo-copula model that allows for both tail dependence and elliptical dependence structure. To improve model flexibility, the Gaussian copula is modified such that each correlation coefficient is not only an unknown parameter (to be modeled), but also a function of random variables. We present the characteristics of the modified Gaussian pseudo-copula and show that our modification enables the copula to capture the tail dependence adequately. The proposed modified Gaussian pseudo-copula is assessed by estimating the association on a real life insurance data and a finance data set. Furthermore, a comprehensive simulation study comparing goodness-of-fit test statistics is carried out. Both experiment results demonstrate that our Modified Gaussian pseudo-copula fits data (with or without tail dependence) generally better than other common copulas. (c) 2013 The Authors.

In contrast to the univariate specification, we show that the expectation of the log-likelihood function is unbounded, away from the true parameter value, if (and only if) the observable has unbounded second moment. Despite this nonstandard feature, consistency of the Gaussian QMLE is still warranted. The same moment condition proves to be necessary and sufficient for the stationarity of the score when evaluated at the true parameter value. This explains why high moment conditions, typically bounded sixth moment and above, have been used hitherto in the literature to establish the asymptotic normality of the QMLE in the multivariate framework.","[Avarucci, Marco; Beutner, Eric] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Zaffaroni, Paolo] Imperial Coll London, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Zaffaroni, Paolo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",Maastricht University; Imperial College London; Sapienza University Rome,"Zaffaroni, P (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Business Sch, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",p.zaffaroni@imperial.ac.uk,,"Avarucci, Marco/0009-0000-3746-5950",ESRC [RES-000-22-3219]; ESRC [ES/G024243/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The usual disclaimers apply.

In particular, the log-normal continuous cascade is a parsimonious model that has proven to reproduce most observed stylized facts. In this paper, several statistical issues related to this model are studied. We first present a quick, but extensive, review of its main properties and show that most of these properties can be studied analytically. We then develop an approximation theory in the limit of small intermittency (2)<<1, i.e. when the degree of multifractality is small. This allows us to prove that the probability distributions associated with these processes possess some very simple aggregation properties across time scales. Such a control of the process properties at different time scales allows us to address the problem of parameter estimation. We show that one has to distinguish two different asymptotic regimes: the first, referred to as the low-frequency asymptotics', corresponds to taking a sample whose overall size increases, whereas the second, referred to as the high-frequency asymptotics', corresponds to sampling the process at an increasing sampling rate. The first case leads to convergent estimators, whereas in the high-frequency asymptotics, the situation is much more intricate: only the intermittency coefficient (2) can be estimated using a consistent estimator. However, we show that, in practical situations, one can detect the nature of the asymptotic regime (low frequency versus high frequency) and consequently decide whether the estimations of the other parameters are reliable or not. We apply our results to equity market (individual stocks and indices) daily return series and illustrate a possible application to the prediction of volatility and conditional value at risk.","[Bacry, E.] Ecole Polytech, Ctr Math Appl, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Kozhemyak, A.] Calyon RPC DRM MCRA, F-92400 Courbevoie, France; [Muzy, J.

We call such values membership values, as a player's payoff depends on the worths of the coalitions to which he belongs and not necessarily on his marginal contributions. This could mean that the player would get some share of regardless of whether or not he makes a marginal contribution to the welfare of society. In this paper it is demonstrated that the set of (non-marginal) membership values include those that embody numerous widely held notions of fairness, such as partial benefit equalization, individual rationality and greater rewards follow from greater contributions, where one's contributions are not measured marginally. We also present a very simple and revealing way of interpreting all values, including those having a marginal interpretation. Finally, we obtain a mapping which effectively embeds the space of marginal values in the space of all membership values.","[Kleinberg, Norman L.; Weiss, Jeffrey H.] CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Kleinberg, Norman L.; Weiss, Jeffrey H.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10010 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Kleinberg, NL (通讯作者)，CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, 17 Lexington Ave,Box B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA.",norman.kleinberg@baruch.cuny.edu,,,,,,,22,3,4,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

We reconsider the endogenous tariff model introduced by Goyal and Joshi (2006) who study pairwise stability of free trade networks. We depart from their analysis by adopting the concept of pairwise farsightedly stable networks (Herings et al. 2009, GEB). We show that the complete network (i.e., global free trade) constitutes a pairwise farsightedly stable set. In particular, there is a farsightedly improving path from the empty network (i.e., no free trade agreement in place) to the complete network, which involves link additions only, while farsightedly improving paths from preexisting free trade networks may involve link deletion (i.e., dissolution of some bilateral FTAs). Moreover, we show that pairwise farsightedly stable set of networks is not unique. One implication of our results is that bilateral trade negotiations, if properly channeled, can lead to global free trade, although some bilateral agreements may have to be dissolved first to pave the way towards global free trade.","[Zhang, Jin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xue, Licun] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Zu, Lei] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; McGill University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Dept Econ, 10 East Huixin St, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jin.zhang2@mail.mcgill.ca; licun.xue@mcgill.ca,,,SSHRC; CIREQ Fellowship; NSFC [71073019],SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); CIREQ Fellowship; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are indebted to the editor and two anonymous referees for detailed comments on earlier version of the paper.

We develop a multistep method for estimating the parameters in a triangular, linear index, threshold-crossing model with two equations. Such an econometric model might be used in testing for moral hazard while allowing for asymmetric information in insurance markets. In outlining this new estimation method two contributions are made. The first one is proposing a novel matching estimator for the coefficient on the binary endogenous variable in the outcome equation. Second, in order to establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators for the coefficients of the exogenous regressors in the outcome equation, the results of Powell, Stock, and Stoker (1989, Econometrica 75, 1403-1430) are extended to cover the case where the average derivative estimation requires a first-step semiparametric procedure.","[Yildiz, Nese] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Yildiz, N (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Harkness Hall, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",nyildiz@mail.rochester.edu,,,,,,,22,2,2,1,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Over the years, many theoretical models have been developed to explain the stylized facts of U.S. Treasury yields; however, model comparison, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing remain thorny issues. The purpose of this paper is to show that Bayesian methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in particular, may help resolve a number of these problems, especially those related to model comparison. We use MCMC to compare the seminal models of Vasicek and Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (CIR). The most surprising result of our analysis is that one of these two models is almost 50000 times more likely than the other. In contrast, results in the previous literature have been much more ambiguous because they are based on a variety of goodness-of-fit measures. A Monte Carlo study shows that these results are not spurious: the MCMC method is able to select the correct data generation model, whereas goodness-of-fit measures are virtually indistinguishable regardless of whether the data were generated from Vasicek or CIR.","[Hughen, W.

Financial Stud., 1993, 6, 327343], and by a Poisson jump process as introduced by Merton [J. Financial Econ., 1976, 3, 125144]. Probability arguments are invoked to find a representation of the solution in terms of expectations over the joint distribution of the underlying process. A combination of Fourier transform in the log stock price and Laplace transform in the volatility is then applied to find the transition probability density function of the underlying process. It turns out that the price is given by an integral dependent upon the early exercise surface, for which a corresponding integral equation is obtained. The solution generalizes in an intuitive way the structure of the solution to the corresponding European option pricing problem obtained by Scott [Math.

Cost-of-illness studies and reviews thereof can be a useful tool for analysing and critically evaluating the cost-related development of colorectal cancer, and they highlight important cost drivers. Methods A systematic review was conducted from 2002 to 2012 to identify cost-of-illness studies related to colorectal cancer, searching the Medline, PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library and the York CRD databases. Results Among the 10 studies (from France, the US, Ireland and Taiwan) included in the review, 6 studies reported prevalence-based estimates and 4 studies focussed on incidence-based data. In the studies included in the review, long-term costs for colorectal cancer of up to $50,175 per patient (2008 values) were estimated. Most of the studies in the review showed that the initial and terminal phases of colorectal cancer care are the most expensive, with continuing treatment being the least costly phase. One study also highlighted that stage I CRC disease was the least costly and stage III the most costly of all 4 stages, due to the high cost impact of biological agents. Conclusions This review has highlighted a trend for rising costs associated with CRC, which is linked to the increasing use of targeted biological therapies. COI studies in colorectal cancer can identify specific components and areas of care that are especially costly, thereby focussing attention on more cost-effective approaches, which is especially relevant to the increased use of biological agents in the field of personalised medicine. COI studies are an important tool for further health economic evaluations of personalised medicine.","[Kriza, Christine; Wahlster, Philip; Niederlaender, Charlotte; Kolominsky-Rabas, Peter] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Hlth Technol Assessment & P, Natl BMBF Cluster Excellence Med Technol Med Vall, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Emmert, Martin] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Management, Sch Business & Econ, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Kriza, C (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Hlth Technol Assessment & P, Natl BMBF Cluster Excellence Med Technol Med Vall, Schwabachanlage 6, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",christine.kriza@uk-erlangen.de; Martin.Emmert@fau.de,,"Kolominsky-Rabas, Peter/0000-0002-7168-058X","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), as part of the Centre of Excellence for Medical Technology [01EX1013B]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), as part of the Centre of Excellence for Medical Technology(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This research is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), project grant no. 01EX1013B, as part of the Centre of Excellence for Medical Technology.",,34,38,40,0,21,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2013,31.0,7,,,,,577,588,,10.1007/s40273-013-0055-4,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,178SV,23636661.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321468600004,0

Events are modeled by transitions in a finite state Markov chain, but unlike traditional regime switching models, transitions not only change the instantaneous return statistics but are accompanied by jumps in the price at the instant of transition. Optimal investment and consumption policies are characterized using stochastic control methods and computed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations and a convex optimization problem. We show that optimal policies are significantly different from those of traditional regime switching or jump-diffusion problems and that the cost of ignoring transition price shocks can be substantial.

In the CAPM, the risk of an asset is expressed through its correlation with the market, widely known as the beta. There is now a general consensus among economists that these portfolio betas are time-varying and that, consequently, any appropriate analysis has to take this variability into account. Recent advances in data acquisition and processing techniques have led to an increased research output concerning high-frequency models. Within this framework, we introduce here a modified functional CAPM and sequential monitoring procedures to test for the constancy of the portfolio betas. As our main results we derive the large-sample properties of these monitoring procedures. In a simulation study and an application to S&P 100 data we show that our method performs well in finite samples.","[Aue, Alexander] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Hormann, Siegfried] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Horvath, Lajos] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Huskova, Marie] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Steinebach, Josef G.] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of California System; University of California Davis; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Charles University Prague; University of Cologne,"Aue, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",alexaue@wald.ucdavis.edu,"Hušková, Marie/L-9819-2017; Horvath, Lajos/R-7559-2019","Hušková, Marie/0000-0002-6868-1362; Horvath, Lajos/0000-0001-8594-4972; Hoermann, Siegfried/0000-0003-0888-1351; Steinebach, Josef G./0000-0003-1237-5152","NSF [DMS 0905400, GACR 201/09/J006, MSM 0021620839]; Banque nationale de Belgique; Communaute francaise de Belgique-Actions de Recherche Concertees [2010-2015]; DFG [STE 306/22-1]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [0905400] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Banque nationale de Belgique; Communaute francaise de Belgique-Actions de Recherche Concertees; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We thank Oliver Linton and three anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

This paper re-examines how three theory-suggested factors affect equity returns and how the test results may differ between developed and the Asian emerging markets. However, on pooling observations, our estimated coefficients are much more accurate, and yield theory-consistent results. Using the panel data method, we find that the equity returns, specified as risk premiums of developed and emerging markets, appear to be determined by variations within the equity markets using all three theory-suggested factors. In the emerging Asian markets, the risk premiums are affected more by the variation over time in income growth while the variations in the other two factors affect the equity premiums as within market variation effects.","[Ariff, M.] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Adv Res Finance, Tokyo, Japan; [Ariff, M.] Bond Univ, Dept Finance, Southport, Qld 4229, Australia; [Marisetty, Vijaya B.] Monash Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Caulfield, Vic 3061, Australia",University of Tokyo; Bond University; Monash University,"Ariff, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Ctr Adv Res Finance, Tokyo, Japan.",ariff13@gmail.com,"Ariff, Mohamed/U-6072-2019",,,,,,28,4,4,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Objective: Our objective was to examine associations between G-CSF use and medical costs after initial adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage (stage I-III) breast cancer (ESBC). Methods: Women diagnosed with ESBC from 1999 to 2005, who had an initial course of chemotherapy beginning within 180 days of diagnosis and including >= 1 highly myelosuppressive agent, were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Medicare claims were used to describe the initial chemotherapy regimen according to the classes of agents used: anthracycline ([A]: doxorubicin or epirubicin); cyclophosphamide (C); taxane ([T]: paclitaxel or docetaxel); and fluorouracil (F). Patients were classified into four study groups according to their G-CSF use: (i) primary prophylaxis, if the first G-CSF claim was within 5 days of the start of the first chemotherapy cycle; (ii) secondary prophylaxis, if the first claim was within 5 days of the start of the second or subsequent cycles; (iii) G-CSF treatment, if the first claim occurred outside of prophylactic use; and (iv) no G-CSF. Patients were described by age, race, year of diagnosis, stage, grade, estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor status, National Cancer Institute (NCI) Co-morbidity Index, chemotherapy regimen and G-CSF use. Total direct medical costs (SUS, year 2009 values) to Medicare were estimated from 4 weeks after the last chemotherapy administration up to 48 months. Medical costs included those for ESBC treatment and all other medical services received after chemotherapy. Least squares regression, using inverse probability weighting (IPW) to account for censoring within the cohort, was used to evaluate adjusted associations between G-CSF use and costs. Results: A total of 7026 patients were identified, with an average age of 72 years, of which 63% had stage II disease, and 59% were ER and/or PR positive. Compared with no G-CSF, those receiving G-CSF primary prophylaxis were more likely to have stage III disease (30% vs 16%; p < 0.0001), to be diagnosed in 2003-5 (87% vs 26%; p < 0.0001), and to receive dose-dense AC-T (26% vs 1%; p < 0.0001),. while they were less likely to receive an F-based regimen (12% vs 42%; p < 0.0001). Overall, the estimated average direct medical cost over 48 months after initial chemotherapy was $US42 628. In multivariate analysis, stage II or III diagnosis (compared with stage I), NCI Co-morbidity Index score 1 or >= 2 (compared with 0), or FAC or standard AC-T (each compared with AC) were associated with significantly higher IPW 48-month costs. Adjusting for patient demographic and clinical factors, costs in the G-CSF primary prophylaxis group were not significantly different from those not receiving primary prophylaxis (the other three study groups combined). In an analysis that included four separate study groups, G-CSF treatment was associated with significantly greater costs (incremental cost = $US2938; 95% CI 285, 5590) than no G-CSF. Conclusions: Direct medical costs after initial chemotherapy were not statistically different between those receiving G-CSF primary prophylaxis and those receiving no G-CSF, after adjusting for potential confounders.","[Griffiths, Robert I.; Gleeson, Michelle L.; Danese, Mark D.] Outcomes Insights Inc, Westlake Village, CA 91362 USA; [Griffiths, Robert I.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [Barron, Richard L.; Chia, Victoria M.; Legg, Jason C.] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [O'Hagan, Anthony] Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Lyman, Gary H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Comprehens Canc Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Amgen; University of Sheffield; Duke University,"Griffiths, RI (通讯作者)，Outcomes Insights Inc, 340 N Westlake Blvd,Suite 200, Westlake Village, CA 91362 USA.",bob@outins.com,"Lyman, Gary/K-5227-2019; O'Hagan, Anthony/B-2992-2016","Lyman, Gary/0000-0002-0823-8086; O'Hagan, Anthony/0000-0002-7994-0702",Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc.(Amgen),"Funding for conduct of the study and preparation of the paper was provided by Amgen Inc.

The joint distribution of the claims in two successive periods is modeled by a copula with discrete or continuous marginal distributions. The first model fits two successive claims by a bivariate copula with discrete marginal distributions. In the second model, a copula is used to model the random effects of the conjoint numbers of successive claims with continuous marginal distributions. Zero-inflated phenomenon is taken into account in the above copula models. The maximum likelihood is applied to estimate the parameters of the discrete copula model. A two-step procedure is proposed to estimate the parameters in the second model, with the first step to estimate the marginals, followed by the second step to estimate the unobserved random effect variables and the copula parameter. Simulations are performed to assess the proposed models and methodologies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Investors may undertake relatively risky investments due to insufficient hedging or overpaying implied by flawed models. The GARCH model with normal innovations (GARCH-normal) has been adopted to depict the dynamics of the returns in many applications. The implied GARCH-normal model is the one minimizing the mean square error between the market option values and the GARCH-normal option prices. In this study, we investigate the model risk of the implied GARCH-normal model fitted to conditional leptokurtic returns, an important feature of financial data. The risk-neutral GARCH model with conditional leptokurtic innovations is derived by the extended Girsanov principle.

This fact is possibly due to the requirement that zero probability is assigned to irrational choices in these concepts. Here, we introduce the epistemic notion of common belief in utility proportional beliefs which also attributes positive probability to irrational choices, restricted however by the natural postulate that the probabilities should be proportional to the utilities the respective choices generate. Besides, we propose a procedural characterization of our epistemic concept.

(2011b), who proposed to only intervene in the compound Poisson risk process at the discrete time points {L-k}(k=0)(infinity) where the event of ruin is checked and dividend decisions are made. In practice, an insurance company typically balances its books (and monitors its solvency) more frequently than deciding on dividend payments. This motivates us to propose a generalization in which ruin is monitored at {Lk}0 whereas dividend decisions are only made at {L-jk}(k=0)(infinity) for some positive integer j. Assuming that the intervals between the time points {L-k}(k=0)(infinity) are Erlang(n) distributed, the Erlangization technique (e.g. Asmussen et al., 2002) allows us to model the more realistic situation with the books balanced e.g. monthly and dividend decisions made e.g. quarterly or semi-annually. Under a dividend barrier strategy with the above randomized interventions, we derive the expected discounted dividends paid until ruin. Numerical examples about dividend maximization with respect to the barrier b and/or the value ofj are given. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Choi, Michael C.

The first two components are typically evaluated on a yearly basis, while the third is viewed from a longer perspective. When considering the value of customers over a period of several years, and examining policy renewals and cross-selling in relation to price adjustments, many insurers may prefer to reduce their short-term benefits so as to focus on their most profitable customers and the long-term value. We show how models of personalized treatment learning can be used to select the policy holders that should be targeted in a company's marketing strategies. An empirical application of the causal conditional inference tree method illustrates how best to implement a personalized cross-sell marketing campaign in this framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A Bonferonni-type correction is used to account for the fact that, with some probability, the moments may not lie in the confidence region. It is shown that the test controls size uniformly over a large class of distributions for the observed data. An important feature of the proposal is that it remains computationally feasible, even when the number of moments is large. The finite-sample properties of the procedure are examined via a simulation study, which demonstrates, among other things, that the proposal remains competitive with existing procedures while being computationally more attractive.","[Romano, Joseph P.] Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shaikh, Azeem M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wolf, Michael] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",Stanford University; University of Chicago; University of Zurich,"Romano, JP (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Sequoia Hall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",romano@stanford.edu; amshaikh@uchicago.edu; michael.wolf@econ.uzh.ch,,"Romano, Joseph/0000-0002-9685-8372","NSF [DMS-0707085, DMS-1227091]; Alfred P.

As biopharmaceuticals are expected to dominate the best-selling pharmaceuticals worldwide by 2016, the emergence of biosimilars imposes an important challenge for governments. At this moment, the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium is limited, with market shares close to 0 %. This study aimed to identify the barriers that impede the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate in depth the barriers to the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium. Respondents were selected through selective sampling so that all different stakeholders were represented (authorities, physicians, pharmacists, patients, academics and industry). Respondents were contacted by e-mail and letter with a request for participation. A thematic framework was used to analyze the data. Three main barriers to the uptake of biosimilars in the Belgian market were identified: a lack of confidence towards biosimilars by some stakeholders; uncertainty about the interchangeability and substitution of biosimilars; and a hospital financing system that discourages the use of them. Providing all stakeholders with objective information on the concept of biosimilars, reforming the financing of hospitals, developing and implementing prescription quota in hospitals, setting up patient registries for biosimilars and speeding up the pricing and reimbursement process of biosimilars are suggested solutions to increase the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium. To fully capture the potential savings of biosimilars, governments should take measures to increase their uptake. The Belgian government, and also the manufacturers of biosimilars, should take measures to reduce the uncertainties related to biosimilars and raise confidence among prescribers. In addition, the financing of hospitals should be reformed and incentives should be developed to stimulate physicians to prescribe biosimilars.","[Dylst, Pieter; Simoens, Steven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Vulto, Arnold] Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Hosp Pharm, Rotterdam, Netherlands",KU Leuven; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Simoens, S (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, Herestr 49,O&N 2,POB 521, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",pieter.dylst@pharm.kuleuven.be; a.vulto@erasmusmc.nl; steven.simoens@pharm.kuleuven.be,,"Vulto, Arnold/0000-0002-8439-2800; Simoens, Steven/0000-0002-9512-2005",,,,,44,50,50,2,19,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2014,32.0,7,,,,,681,691,,10.1007/s40273-014-0163-9,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0KS,24803078.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344625700006,0

We apply an affine model including the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and the Vasicek mode to characterize the interest rate while the stock price is given by the Heston's stochastic volatility (SV) model. The pension manager can invest in cash, bond and stock in the financial market. Thus, the wealth of the pension fund is influenced by the financial risks in the market and the stochastic contribution from the fund participant. The goal of the fund manager is, coping with the contribution rate, to maximize the expectation of the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility of the terminal value of the pension fund over a guarantee which serves as an annuity after retirement. We first transform the problem into a single investment problem, then derive an explicit solution via the stochastic programming method. Finally, the numerical analysis is given to show the impact of financial parameters on the optimal strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Annual costs attributable to CDI are in excess of $US1 billion. This review summarizes appropriate utilization of prevention and treatment methods for CDI that have the potential to reduce the economic and humanistic costs of the disease. Some cost-effective strategies to prevent CDI include screening and isolation of hospital admissions based on C. difficile carriage to reduce transmission in the inpatient setting, and probiotics, which are potentially efficacious in preventing CDI in the appropriate patient population. The most extensively studied agents for treatment of CDI are metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin. Most economic comparisons between metronidazole and vancomycin favor vancomycin, especially with the emergence of metronidazole-resistant C. difficile strains. Metronidazole can only be recommended for mild disease. Moderate to severe CDI should be treated with vancomycin, preferably the compounded oral solution, which provides the most cost-effective therapeutic option. Fidaxomicin offers a clinically effective and potentially cost-effective alternative for treating moderate CDI in patients who do not have the NAP1/BI/027 strain of C. difficile. Probiotics and fecal microbiota transplant have variable efficacy and the US FDA does not currently regulate the content; the potential economic advantages of these treatment modalities are currently unknown.","[Mergenhagen, Kari A.; Wojciechowski, Amy L.] Vet Affairs Western New York Healthcare Syst, Buffalo, NY 14215 USA; [Paladino, Joseph A.] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA; [Paladino, Joseph A.] CPL Associates LLC, Buffalo, NY 14226 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Wojciechowski, AL (通讯作者)，Vet Affairs Western New York Healthcare Syst, 3495 Bailey Ave, Buffalo, NY 14215 USA.",karimergenhagen@gmail.com; amywojciechowski@gmail.com; paladino@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,98,25,36,0,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2014,32.0,7,,,,,639,650,,10.1007/s40273-014-0161-y,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0KS,24807468.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344625700004,0

In a simulation study we see that, depending on the type of cross-ownership, the lognormal model can lead to both over-and underestimation of the actual probability of default of a firm under cross-ownership. In the limit, i.e. if the levels of cross-ownership tend to their maximum possible value, these findings can be shown theoretically as well. Furthermore, we consider the default probability of a firm in general, i.e. without a distributional assumption, and show that the lognormal model is often able to yield only a limited range of probabilities of default, while the actual probabilities may take any value between 0 and 1.","[Karl, Sabine; Fischer, Tom] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Math, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Karl, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Inst Math, Emil Fischer Str 30, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",sabine.karl@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Given the correlated defaults and the counterparty default risk, we use the reduced-form approach to derive the closed-form formulas of mortgage insurance contracts with premium refunds, annual premiums and upfront premiums. Regardless of the nature of the premium structures, the numerical analysis with parameter calibration demonstrates that both the correlated defaults and the counterparty default risk significantly impact mortgage insurance premiums, particularly in long-term mortgage loans.","[Chang, Chia-Chien] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Chia-Chien] NCCU, RIRC, Taipei, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Chang, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan.",cchiac@kuas.edu.tw,,"Chang, ChiaChien/0000-0001-7094-7468",,,,,37,1,1,1,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2014,44.0,2,,,,,303,334,,10.1017/asb.2014.4,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AP3UA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342002100005,0

Similarly, in the multidimensional case, comonotonicity can be defined using the Frechet-Hoeffding upper bound. However, since the multidimensional Frechet-Hoeffding lower bound is not a distribution function, there is no obvious extension of countermonotonicity in multi-dimensions. This paper investigates in depth a new multidimensional extension of countermonotonicity. We first provide an equivalent condition for countermonotonicity in 2-dimension, and extend the definition of countermonotonicity into multidimensions. In order to justify such extensions, we show that newly defined countermonotonic copulas constitute a minimal class of copulas. Two applications will be provided. First, we will study the relationships between multidimensional countermonotonicity and such well-known multivariate concordance measures as Kendall's tau or Spearman's rho. Second, we will give a financial interpretation of multidimensional countermonotonicity via the existing herd behavior index. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A property of the model is that the relation between risk, reward, and the intensity of momentum trading provides a natural limit to the amount of momentum trading that will exist in equilibrium. Properties of the model fit the empirics well. First, the model captures in a parsimonious manner both short-term overreaction and long-term reversals. Second, it predicts that momentum and long-term reversals should be observed in any market where there is noise. Thus, the model gives theoretical support to the empirical evidence that these anomalies are not artifacts of data snooping and to the extant empirical evidence that these anomalies are pervasive. Momentum traders observe noise shocks and trade on it as information. This trading incorporates a predictive role to the noise. That is, if agents believe a past price change to be informative of future price changes and act on this belief, it will be true and trading on this belief will be profitable. Thus, momentum trading is a self-fulfilling action.","Econometr Solut, Ft Worth, TX 76137 USA",,"Jordan, SJ (通讯作者)，Econometr Solut, Ft Worth, TX 76137 USA.",econometric.solutions@yahoo.com,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

An important choice in the method is the number of regressors to use and using too few or too many regressors leads to biased results. This is so particularly when considering multiple risk factors or when simulation is computationally expensive and hence relatively few paths can be used. In this paper we show that by imposing structure in the regression problem we can improve the method by reducing the bias. This holds across different maturities, for different categories of moneyness and for different types of option payoffs and often leads to significantly increased efficiency.","[Letourneau, Pascal; Stentoft, Lars] HEC Montreal, Dept Finance, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Stentoft, Lars] Ctr Interuniv Rech Anal Org, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A5, Canada; [Stentoft, Lars] Univ Quebec, Ctr Interuniv Risque Polit Econ & Emploi ESG UQAM, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Stentoft, Lars] Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Aarhus University,"Létourneau, P (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Finance, 3000 Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",pascal.letourneau@hec.ca,,"Stentoft, Lars/0000-0003-0655-1455; Letourneau, Pascal/0000-0003-2140-7187",CREATES (Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series); Danish National Research Foundation,CREATES (Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series); Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"We wish to thank Michel Denault and Pascale Valery for constructive comments and participants at the IFM2 Mathematical Finance Days 2010 Conference for useful discussions.

This capital cost can be reduced by hedging longevity risk with longevity swaps, a form of reinsurance. We assess the costs of longevity risk management using indemnity based longevity swaps compared to costs of holding capital under Solvency II. We show that, using a reasonable market price of longevity risk, the market cost of hedging longevity risk for earlier ages is lower than the cost of capital required under Solvency II. Longevity swaps covering higher ages, around 90 and above, have higher market hedging costs than the saving in the cost of regulatory capital. The Solvency II capital regulations for longevity risk generates an incentive for life insurers to hold longevity tail risk on their own balance sheets, rather than transferring this to the reinsurance or the capital markets. This aspect of the Solvency II capital requirements is not well understood and raises important policy issues for the management of longevity risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The national pharmaceutical policy of China has multiple objectives: to develop the domestic pharmaceutical industry and encourage innovation, to control escalation of total pharmaceutical expenditures (TPE) which constitute a substantial component of total health expenditures (THE), and to ensure access to essential medicines for poor and uninsured patients. The current pharmaceutical system has been criticized for its high costs, questionable prescribing practices, and poor regulation of drug quality. This study aims to examine the time trends and influential factors of TPE in China. Data from the 2010 China National Health Accounts Report and the 2010 China Health Statistics Year Book were used in the analysis. Time trends of TPE as a share of THE (TPE/THE), of gross domestic product [GDP] (TPE/GDP), and the relationship between TPE/THE and GDP were examined. The growth of TPE was examined after adjusting for health care utilization and GDP. The determinants of the TPE/THE and the TPE/GDP between 1990 and 2009 were investigated by two time-series regression models including the amount of prescriptions dispensed (using proxy variables of health utilization), the price indices of medical services, and the price indices of pharmaceuticals during that time period. Descriptive analyses showed that TPE and THE grew consistently during the years 1990-2009. The ratio of the THE/GDP increased more rapidly in recent years than the TPE/GDP. Furthermore, outpatient pharmaceutical expenditures (PEs) per visit and hospital PEs per admission grew throughout the study period. The amount of outpatient visits did not show a significant growth pattern during the 1990s, despite rapid GDP growth during that period. The time-series models showed that the TPE/THE was negatively associated with GDP during the same year (p = 0.039), as well as the medical consumer price index [CPI] (p = 0.021). The TPE/GDP was influenced by the price index of prescriptions (p < 0.001) and the amount of health services utilization, including inpatient admissions (p = 0.012) and outpatient visits (p = 0.003). The cost escalations in PEs and health expenditures were concurrent with GDP growth. TPE has been the major source of financial burden for patients. Even though the rapid growth in China's economy may ameliorate the overall TPE burden, control of PEs is still a key for successful health system reform.","[Shi, Lizheng; Cheng, Gang; Meng, Qingyue] Peking Univ, China Ctr Hlth Dev Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Shi, Lizheng; Yang, Heidi Y.] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, New Orleans, LA USA",Peking University; Tulane University,"Meng, QY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Hlth Dev Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",qmeng@bjmu.edu.cn,,,China Medical Board,China Medical Board,"All authors have contributed to the development of this manuscript.

For a certain class of portfolio assets, we compute the optimal rebalance frequency.

In lieu of it, this paper considers an approximation of long memory Gegenbauer processes driven by heteroskedastic errors using finite order moving average (MA) and autoregressive (AR) representations. A related state space form is used to estimate parameters by pseudo maximum likelihood and the Kalman filter. As a novel contribution, a comparative assessment of the suggested approximation techniques is performed using a large scale simulation study. It results in extensive Monte Carlo evidence that establish and validate the optimal order of the two approximations as interval estimates. The superiority of the created methodology is illustrated as an original contribution by extending it to non-stationary Gegenbauer processes to compare with similar existing estimation techniques and results in the literature. Finally, the approach is applied to the famous daily Standard and Poor (S and P) 500 series as a real application.","[Dissanayake, G. S.; Peiris, M.

Our analysis relies on a novel generalization of the so-called discounted density which further involves a moment-based component. More specifically, while the usual discounted density contains a discount factor with respect to the time of ruin, we propose to incorporate powers of the sum until ruin of the discounted (and possibly transformed) claims into the density. Probabilistic arguments are applied to derive defective renewal equations satisfied by the moments of discounted aggregate claim costs until ruin.

The models included in the MC study are the (Fractionally Integrated) Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models ((FI)GARCH), the Stochastic Volatility model (SV), the Long Memory Stochastic Volatility model (LMSV) and the Markov-switching Multifractal model (MSM). The MC study enables us to compare the relative forecasting performance of the models accounting for different characterizations of the latent volatility process: specifications that incorporate short/long memory, autoregressive components, stochastic shocks, Markov-switching and multifractality. Forecasts are evaluated by means of mean squared errors (MSE), mean absolute errors (MAE) and value-at-risk (VaR) diagnostics. Furthermore, complementarities between models are explored via forecast combinations. The results show that (i)the MSM model best forecasts volatility under any other alternative characterization of the latent volatility process and (ii)forecast combinations provide systematic improvements upon most single misspecified models, but are typically inferior to the MSM model even if the latter is applied to data governed by other processes.","[Lux, Thomas] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Jaume 1, Banco Espana Chair Computat Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Morales-Arias, Leonardo] WINGAS GmbH, Kassel, Germany",University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Universitat Jaume I,"Lux, T (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany.",lux@economics.uni-kiel.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft is gratefully acknowledged.

Whether, and how much, a consumer transfers assets between accounts depends on the costs of undertaking such transactions. In general, optimal behavior by a consumer facing both information costs and transactions costs is state-dependent, with the timing of observations and the timing and size of transactions depending on the state. Surprisingly, if the fixed component of the transactions cost is sufficiently small, then eventually, with probability 1, a time-dependent rule emerges: the interval between observations is constant and on each observation date, the consumer converts enough assets to liquid assets to finance consumption until the next observation. If the fixed component of transactions costs is large, the optimal rule remains state-dependent indefinitely.","[Abel, Andrew B.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Abel, Andrew B.; Eberly, Janice C.; Panageas, Stavros] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Eberly, Janice C.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Panageas, Stavros] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University; University of Chicago,"Abel, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",abel@wharton.upenn.edu; eberly@kellogg.northwestern.edu; stavros.panageas@chicagobooth.edu,"Eberly, Janice/KCY-3297-2024","Eberly, Janice/0000-0001-9305-0944",,,,,29,62,72,5,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JUL,2013,81.0,4,,,,,1455,1481,,10.3982/ECTA7624,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,190KJ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322338400007,0

We use bidding data from the European Central Bank's auctions for one-week loans, their main channel of monetary policy implementation. Our analysis provides a high-frequency, disaggregated perspective on the 2007 crisis, which was previously studied through comparisons of collateralized and uncollateralized interbank money market rates which do not capture the heterogeneous impact of the crisis on individual banks. Through a model of bidding, we show that banks' bids reflect their cost of obtaining short-term funds elsewhere (e. g., in the interbank market) as well as a strategic response to other bidders. The strategic response is empirically important: while a naive interpretation of the raw bidding data may suggest that virtually all banks suffered an increase in the cost of short-term funding, we find that, for about one third of the banks, the change in bidding behavior was simply a strategic response. We also find considerable heterogeneity in the short-term funding costs among banks: for over one third of the bidders, funding costs increased by more than 20 basis points, and funding costs vary widely with respect to the country-of-origin. The funding costs we estimate using bidding data are also predictive of market-and accounting-based measures of bank performance, reinforcing the usefulness of revealed preference information contained in bids.","[Cassola, Nuno] European Cent Bank, Res Dept, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hortacsu, Ali] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hortacsu, Ali; Kastl, Jakub] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kastl, Jakub] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",European Central Bank; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University,"Cassola, N (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Res Dept, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",Nuno.Cassola@ecb.int; hortacsu@uchicago.edu; jkastl@stanford.edu,,,"NSF [SES-0449625, SES-1123314]; Alfred P.

Existing literature shows that for non-liquidity constrained individuals, delaying benefit claiming for a number of years after retirement is optimal from a utility perspective in a wide variety of cases. In this paper we focus on non-liquidity constrained individuals who wish to defer pension benefits, and investigate the attractiveness of an alternative deferral strategy. The alternative deferral strategy consists of claiming benefits immediately, and using them to buy deferred annuities from an insurance company. We first determine conditions under which the accrual offered by the public pension scheme for delaying benefit claiming is less than actuarially fair from the viewpoint of an insurer who uses the prevailing term structure of interest rates to determine the expected present value of missed and additional benefits. Actuarial unfairness can be generated by, e.g., age-independent accrual rates or slow adjustments of the accrual rates to changes in interest rates. We find that, in particular for men, the degree of actuarial unfairness is such that there is ample room for insurers to profitably offer annuity products that make the alternative deferral strategy preferred to deferring benefit claiming. If individuals choose to strategically exploit these alternative deferral strategies, this will affect benefit claiming behavior in public pension schemes, which in turn affects long run program costs.

Numerical illustrations are provided to make a comparison among these different types of dependence structures. The numerical results can be explained to some extent by the sum of uniform (0, 1) random variables, for which we obtain explicit formulae for the probability density functions of the sum of two random variables in partial comonotonicity cases.

Asymptotic validity of sieve bootstrap augmented DickeyFuller (ADF) unit root tests is shown for test statistics based on full sample and recursive ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized least squares (GLS) detrending. It is also shown that the detrending method in the first step of the bootstrap may differ from the one used in the construction of the test statistic. A simulation study is conducted to analyze the effects of detrending on finite sample performance of the bootstrap test. It is found that full sample OLS detrending should be preferred based on power in the first step of the bootstrap algorithm, and that the decision about the detrending method used to obtain the test statistic should be based on the power properties of the corresponding asymptotic tests.","Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Smeekes, S (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",S.Smeekes@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Smeekes, Stephan/0000-0002-0157-639X",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This research was financially supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

The unknown parameters in the proposed model are estimated by a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach (Lipsitz et al. [Statist. Med., 1994, 13, 11491163]). The GEE approach has been applied in many applications to analyse correlated repeated data due to its less-stringent distributional assumptions and robustness properties. Real data examples are used to illustrate the proposed model. The empirical results confirm that the proposed model compares favorably to the usual DOPM with independence structure, in the sense that the out-of-sample total error rate produced by the former is not only of smaller magnitude, but also of lower volatility.

The results show that quantity demanded of insurance contracts affects the optimal allocation to risky assets in the insurer's investment portfolio.

It is an important extension from empirical as well theoretical perspectives. In the theory of networks a dominant unit is the centre node of a star network and arises as an efficient outcome of a distance-based utility model. Empirically, the extension poses a number of technical challenges that goes well beyond the analysis of IVAR models provided in Chudik and Pesaran. This is because the dominant unit influences the rest of the variables in the IVAR model both directly and indirectly, and its effects do not vanish as the dimension of the model (N) tends to infinity. The dominant unit acts as a dynamic factor in the regressions of the non-dominant units and yields an infinite order distributed lag relationship between the two types of units. Despite this it is shown that the effects of the dominant unit as well as those of the neighborhood units can be consistently estimated by running augmented least squares regressions that include distributed lag functions of the dominant unit and its neighbors (if any). The asymptotic distribution of the estimators is derived and their small sample properties investigated by means of Monte Carlo experiments.","[Chudik, Alexander] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Chudik, Alexander] CIMF, Dallas, TX USA; [Pesaran, M.

To improve asymptotic efficiency, it may be desirable to use many valid instruments. However, finite sample properties of IV estimators can be sensitive to the number of instruments. For a spatial model with endogenous regressors, this paper derives the asymptotic distribution of the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator when the number of instruments grows with the sample size, and suggests a bias-correction procedure based on the leading-order many-instrument bias. The paper also gives the Nagar-type approximate mean square errors (MSEs) of the 2SLS estimator and the bias-corrected 2SLS estimator, which can be minimized to choose instruments as in Donald and Newey (2001). A limited Monte Carlo experiment is carried out to study the finite sample performance of the instrument selection procedure.","[Liu, Xiaodong] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lee, Lung-Fei] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Lee, LF (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lee.1777@osu.edu,,,,,,,16,25,26,1,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Discrete-time approximations of solutions of SDEs with multiplicative noise, similar to the BlackScholes model, are widely used in simulation in finance. The stability criterion presented in this paper is designed to handle both scenario simulation and Monte Carlo simulation, i.e. both strong and weak approximations. Methods are identified that have the potential to overcome some of the numerical instabilities experienced when using the explicit Euler scheme. This is of particular importance in finance, where martingale dynamics arise frequently and the diffusion coefficients are often multiplicative. Stability regions for a range of schemes are visualized and analysed to provide a methodology for a better understanding of the numerical stability issues that arise from time to time in practice. The result being that schemes that have implicitness in the approximations of both the drift and the diffusion terms exhibit the largest stability regions. Most importantly, it is shown that by refining the time step size one can leave a stability region and may face numerical instabilities, which is not what one is used to experiencing in deterministic numerical analysis.","[Platen, Eckhard; Shi, Lei] Univ Technol Sydney, Finance Discipline Grp, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Platen, Eckhard] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Math Sci, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Platen, E (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Finance Discipline Grp, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",eckhard.platen@uts.edu.au,,"Shi, Lei/0000-0002-6226-1762; Platen, Eckhard/0000-0003-4595-3123",,,,,28,2,2,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The test is based on a series long-run variance matrix estimator that involves projecting the time series of interest onto a set of orthonormal bases and using the sample variance of the projection coefficients as the long-run variance estimator. When the number of orthonormal bases K is fixed, a finite-sample-corrected Wald statistic converges to a standard F distribution. When K grows with the sample size, the usual uncorrected Wald statistic converges to a chi-square distribution. We show that critical values from the F distribution are second-order correct under the conventional increasing smoothing asymptotics.

In order to exclude the moral hazard, we assume that both the insurer and reinsurer are obligated to pay more for larger loss in a typical reinsurance treaty. Moreover, the reinsurance premium principle is assumed to satisfy three axioms: law invariance, risk loading and preserving convex order. The proposed class of premium principles is quite general in the sense that it contains all the widely used premium principles except Esscher principle listed in Young (2004). When capital at risk is measured by the value at risk (VaR) or conditional value at risk (CVaR), we find it is optimal for the insurer to cede two separate layers over the prescribed premium principles. By imposing an additional weak constraint on the premium principle, we further get that the reinsurance in the form of a layer is optimal. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of our results, we derive explicitly the optimal one-layer reinsurance for expected value principle and Wang's premium principle, and show that two-layer reinsurance may be optimal for Dutch premium principle.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Chi, YC (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yichun_1982@hotmail.com,,"Chi, Yichun/0000-0001-9272-6471",National Natural Science Foundation of China [11001283]; MOE (China) Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities [12JJD790017]; China Institute for Actuarial Science at Central University of Finance and Economics,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE (China) Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities; China Institute for Actuarial Science at Central University of Finance and Economics,"The author would like to thank two reviewers for the valuable comments.

Value-at-Risk is a standard tool for measuring and controlling the market risk of an asset or portfolio, and is also required for regulatory purposes. Its popularity is partly due to the fact that it is an easily understood measure of risk. The use of Product Partition Models allows us to remain in a Normal setting even in the presence of outlying points, and to obtain a closed-form expression for Value-at-Risk computation. We present and compare two different scenarios: a product partition structure on the vector of means and a product partition structure on the vector of variances. We apply our methodology to an Italian stock market data set from Mib30. The numerical results clearly show that Product Partition Models can be successfully exploited in order to quantify market risk exposure. The obtained Value-at-Risk estimates are in full agreement with Maximum Likelihood approaches, but our methodology provides richer information about the clustering structure of the data and the presence of outlying points.","[Bormetti, Giacomo] Ctr Risk & Secur Study, Inst Adv Studies, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Bormetti, Giacomo; Delpini, Danilo] Natl Inst Nucl Phys, Pavia Unit, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [De Giuli, Maria Elena; Tarantola, Claudia] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Delpini, Danilo] Univ Pavia, Dept Nucl & Theoret Phys, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN); University of Pavia; University of Pavia,"Bormetti, G (通讯作者)，Ctr Risk & Secur Study, Inst Adv Studies, Viale Lungo Ticino Sforza 56, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",giacomo.bormetti@pv.infn.it,"DELPINI, Danilo/AAR-7544-2020","DELPINI, Danilo/0000-0003-3366-720X; De Giuli, Maria Elena/0000-0002-5221-0005; Bormetti, Giacomo/0000-0003-3542-2505; Tarantola, Claudia/0000-0002-5963-3756",University of Pavia,University of Pavia,We would like to thank Guido Montagna and Oreste Nicrosini for helpful comments and suggestions.

Several medications are indicated for the acute treatment of mania and depression associated with bipolar disorder as well as for maintenance therapy; however, these have varying efficacy, tolerability and costs. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a new discrete-event simulation model to analyse the long-term consequences of pharmacological therapy for the management of bipolar I and II disorders (acute treatment of episodes of mania and depression as well as maintenance therapy). Methods: Probabilities of remission and relapse were obtained from clinical trial data and meta-analyses. Costs (year 2011 values) were assessed from a UK healthcare payer's perspective, and included pharmacological therapy and resource use associated with the treatment of mood events and selected adverse events. The health effects were measured in terms of QALYs. Results: For a patient starting with acute depression or in remission at 40 years of age (which was the average age in the clinical trials), quetiapine 300 mg/day was a cost-effective strategy compared with olanzapine 15 mg/day over a 5-year time frame. With acute bipolar depression as a starting episode, the 5-year medical costs were 323 higher and QALYs were 0.038 higher for quetiapine compared with olanzapine, corresponding to a cost-effectiveness ratio of 8600 per QALY gained. Conclusion: Compared with olanzapine, the results suggest that quetiapine is cost effective as a maintenance treatment for bipolar depression.","[Ekman, Mattias; Lindgren, Peter] OptumInsight, Stockholm, Sweden; [Miltenburger, Carolin] OptumInsight, Berlin, Germany; [Meier, Genevieve] AstraZeneca UK Ltd, Luton, Beds, England; [Locklear, Julie C.] AstraZeneca Pharmaceut LP, Wilmington, DE USA; [Chatterton, Mary Lou] MLC Consulting Serv Inc, Wilmington, DE USA",Optum; Optum; AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca,"Ekman, M (通讯作者)，AstraZeneca Nord, Dept Hlth Econ, SE-15185 Sodertalje, Sweden.",mattias.ekman@astrazeneca.com,"Chatterton, Mary Lou/IAP-6660-2023; Lindgren, Peter/AID-5379-2022","Lindgren, Peter/0000-0002-8238-8189; Chatterton, Mary Lou/0000-0003-4902-9448",AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP; AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP(AstraZeneca); AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),"The study was supported by funding from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, the manufacturer of quetiapine, which is gratefully acknowledged.

The weak correlations between the instruments and the relevant first-order condition are modelled as local to zero, and we focus on moderate parameter instabilities. We show that, in the presence of weak identification, asymptotic distributions on the estimators and tests remain robust to moderate instability. Therefore, inference on the subset of stable parameters remains robust to moderate instability of nuisance parameters. In addition, in an unstable model where some parameters are weakly identified, weak-instrument asymptotics in the literature can be used to make valid inference for the weakly identified coefficients after the strongly identified coefficients are concentrated out.","[Li, Hong] Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Xiao, Zhijie] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Brandeis University; Boston College,"Li, H (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",hli@brandeis.edu; xiaoz@bc.edu,,,,,,,49,1,2,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Objective: This study aimed to explore the factors influencing the recommendations of the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG) on the use of new medicines in Wales. Methods: Based on public data, logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the influence of cost effectiveness, the quality and quantity of clinical evidence, disease characteristics (including rarity), budget impact, and a range of other factors on the recommendations of AWMSG and its subcommittee, the New Medicines Group (NMG). Results: Multivariate analyses of 47 AWMSG appraisals between 2007-9 correctly predicted 87% of decisions. The results are suggestive of a positive influence on recommendations of the presence of probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) but, counter-intuitively, a statistically significant negative influence of evidence from high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [odds ratio 0.059; 95% CI 0.005,0.699]. This latter observation may be attributed to our strict definition of high quality, which excluded the use of surrogate endpoints. Putative explanatory variables, including cost effectiveness, budget impact, underlying disease characteristics and 'ultra'-orphan drug status were not statistically significant predictors of final AWMSG decisions based on our dataset. Univariate analyses indicate that medicines with negative recommendations had significantly higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios than those with positive recommendations, consistent with the pursuit of economic efficiency. There is also evidence that AWMSG considers equity issues via an ultra-orphan drugs policy. Conclusions: Consideration of decision uncertainty via PSA appears to positively influence the reimbursement decisions of AWMSG. The significant negative impact of the presence of high-quality RCTs, and the lack of a significant positive impact of other expected factors, may reflect issues in the plausibilityof supporting evidence for medicines that received negative recommendations. Furthermore, it serves to emphasize the difficulties in applying the usual hierarchies of evidence to the HTA process, and in particular to the appraisal of high-cost specialist medicines close to market launch.","[Linley, Warren G.; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Inst Med & Social Care Res, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Inst Med & Social Care Res, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Dean St, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Linley, Warren/0000-0003-2587-3564; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459",Bangor University PhD studentship; Medical Research Council [G0800792] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0800792] Funding Source: UKRI,Bangor University PhD studentship; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Funding for this study was via a Bangor University PhD studentship awarded to WGL.

It has serious health effects and causes substantial costs for society. Objectives: The aim of the present paper was to develop a state-of-the-art decision-analytic model of COPD whereby the cost effectiveness of interventions in Germany can be estimated. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, a smoking cessation programme was evaluated against usual care. Methods: A seven-stage Markov model (disease stages I to IV according to the GOLD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease] classification, states after lung-volume reduction surgery and lung transplantation, death) was developed to conduct a cost-utility analysis from the societal perspective over a time horizon of 10, 40 and 60 years. Patients entered the cohort model at the age of 45 with mild COPD. Exacerbations were classified into three levels: mild, moderate and severe. Estimation of stage-specific probabilities (for smokers and quitters), utilities and costs was based on German data where possible. Data on effectiveness of the intervention was retrieved from the literature. A discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and effects. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess the robustness of the results. Results: The smoking cessation programme was the dominant strategy compared with usual care, and the intervention resulted in an increase in health effects of 0.54 QALYs and a cost reduction of (sic) 1115 per patient (year 2007 prices) after 60 years. In the probabilistic analysis, the intervention dominated in about 95% of the simulations. Sensitivity analyses showed that uncertainty primarily originated from data on disease progression and treatment cost in the early stages of disease. Conclusions: The model developed allows the long-term cost effectiveness of interventions to be estimated, and has been adapted to Germany. The model suggests that the smoking cessation programme evaluated was more effective than usual care as well as being cost-saving. Most patients had mild or moderate COPD, stages for which parameter uncertainty was found to be high. This raises the need to improve data on the early stages of COPD.","[Menn, Petra; Leidl, Reiner; Holle, Rolf] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Menn, P (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Ingolstaedter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",petra.menn@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Leidl, Reiner/GQY-7389-2022; Leidl, Reiner M/B-7209-2009; Holle, Rolf/D-9333-2013","Leidl, Reiner M/0000-0002-7115-7510;",Kompetenznetz Asthma/COPD (Competence Network Asthma/COPD); Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 01G10881-0888],Kompetenznetz Asthma/COPD (Competence Network Asthma/COPD); Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was partly supported by the Kompetenznetz Asthma/COPD (Competence Network Asthma/COPD) funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (FKZ 01G10881-0888).

Objective: Our objective was to assess the general public's maximum willingness to pay (MWTP) for an increase in annual personal income taxes to fund unrestricted access to AD medications. Methods: We randomly recruited 500 Canadians nationally and used computer-assisted telephone interviewing to administer a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained four 'efficacy' scenarios describing an AD medication as capable of symptomatically treating cognitive decline or modifying disease progression. The scenarios also described the medication as having no adverse effects or a 30% chance of adverse effects. We randomized participants to order of scenarios and willingness-to-pay bid values; MWTP for each scenario was the highest accepted bid for that scenario. We conducted linear regression and bootstrap sensitivity analyses to investigate potential determinants of MWTP. Results: Mean MWTP was highest for the 'disease modification/no adverse effects' scenario ($Can130.26) and lowest for the 'symptomatic treatment/30% chance of adverse effects' scenario ($Can99.16). Bootstrap analyses indicated none of our potential determinants (e.g. age, sex) were associated with participants' MWTP. Conclusions: The general public is willing to pay higher income taxes to fund unrestricted access to AD (especially disease-modifying) medications. Consequently, the public should favour placing new AD medications on public drug plans. As far as we are aware, no other study has elicited the general public's willingness to pay for AD medications.","[Oremus, Mark; Tarride, Jean-Eric; Raina, Parminder; Thabane, Lehana; Foster, Gary; Goldsmith, Charlie H.; Clayton, Natasha] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Oremus, Mark; Raina, Parminder] McMaster Univ, McMaster Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Tarride, Jean-Eric] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, PATH, Res Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Thabane, Lehana; Foster, Gary; Goldsmith, Charlie H.] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Biostat Unit, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University,"Oremus, M (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ DTC, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, 50 Main St E,3rd Floor, Hamilton, ON L8N 1E9, Canada.",oremusm@mcmaster.ca,,,Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP 86487],"Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care(Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario); Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR))",Mark Oremus and Jean-Eric Tarride are funded by Career Scientist Awards from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.

In a variant of these games, agents measure the performance of their available strategies over a fixed-length rolling window of prior time-steps. These are the Time Horizon MG/MAJG/$Gs (THMG, THMAJG, TH$G). Their probabilistic dynamics may be completely characterized in Markov-chain formulation. Games of both the standard and TH variants generate time-series that may be understood as arising from a stochastically perturbed determinism because a coin toss is used to break ties. The average over the binomially distributed coin tosses yields the underlying determinism. In order to quantify the degree of this determinism and of higher-order perturbations, we decompose the sign of the time-series they generate (analogous to a market price time-series) into a superposition of weighted Hamiltonian cycles on graphs-exactly in the TH variants and approximately in the standard versions. The cycle decomposition also provides a 'dissection' of the internal dynamics of the games and a quantitative measure of the degree of determinism. We discuss how the outperformance of strategies relative to agents in the THMG-the 'illusion of control'-and the reverse in the THMAJG and TH$G, i.e. genuine control, may be understood on a cycle-by-cycle basis. The decomposition offers a new metric for comparing different game dynamics with real-world financial time-series and a method for generating predictors. We apply the cycle predictor to a real-world market, with significantly positive returns for the latter. Part I provides an overview of the paper and its methodologies with an appendix for the mathematical details of the Markov analysis of the THMG, THMAJG and TH$G. Part I also describes the cycle predictor and applies it to real-world financial series. Part II performs further analyses of the cycle decomposition method as applied to the time-series generated by agent-based models to gain insight into the 'illusion of control' that certain of these games demonstrate, i.e. the fact that the strategies outperform the agents that deploy them. Part II also illustrates both numerical and analytic methods for extracting cycles from a given time-series and applies the method to a number of different real-world data sets, in conjunction with an analysis of persistence.","[Satinover, J.

It is well recognised that significant variability exists in the response of patients to drugs resulting from genetic or biological variations; however, we are only now gradually becoming aware of the complexities involved. Enormous variability occurs in the risk-benefit ratio that will be experienced by each individual patient as a consequence of their overall genetic make-up. Although not a panacea, enhanced scientific knowledge of the genetic basis for such variability offers the potential for a more 'tailored' approach to prescribing in the future, making it more closely attuned to the needs of the individual patient. Such 'personalised' medicine has the potential to revolutionise care provision in a manner that provides a range of challenges to current structures and processes of 'conventional' healthcare delivery. The aim of this paper is to outline such challenges and analyse potential ways in which they may be addressed in the future. It provides non-expert readers with a non-technical case study of the complexities inherent in the evaluation of a pharmacogenetic-test-guided treatment strategy from a health economic perspective. Wherever possible, technical issues have been minimised; however, references are provided for readers who wish to enhance their knowledge of the pharmacological basis of the case study of cytochrome P450 test-guided treatment. The case study aims simply to illustrate the approach and difficulties encountered in the health economic evaluation of complex pharmacogenetic technologies. Such technologies present a range of new and complex issues which have crucial implications for health economists attempting to obtain an accurate assessment of the 'value' of the technology in clinical practice in an array of patient subgroups. Personalised medicine is the future and this paper highlights how pharmaceutical manufacturers, clinicians, regulators and other stakeholders must all play their part in the inevitable and accelerating move into this complex and uncertain future.","[Haycox, Alan; Pirmohamed, Munir; McLeod, Claire; Houten, Rachel; Richards, Sarah] Univ Liverpool, ULMS, Liverpool L69 7ZH, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Haycox, A (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, ULMS, Room GE14,Chatham St, Liverpool L69 7ZH, Merseyside, England.",ahay@liv.ac.uk,"Pirmohamed, Munir/H-6004-2011","Pirmohamed, Munir/0000-0002-7534-7266",Medical Research Council [MR/L006758/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0512-10064] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MR/L006758/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,25,15,16,0,22,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2014,32.0,11,,,,,1055,1061,,10.1007/s40273-014-0190-6,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0LJ,25118988.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344627300004,0

It will be shown that under low-level conditions the sieve estimators of these parameters are consistent, and the estimators of the Euclidean parameters are root N asymptotically normal, given a random sample of size N. The latter result is derived in a different way than in the sieve estimation literature. It appears that this asymptotic normality result is in essence the same as for the finite dimensional case.

It is believed that state-dependent fees are beneficial to policyholders and insurers since they reduce policyholders' incentives to lapse the policies and match the costs incurred by policyholders with the pay-offs received from embedded guarantees. We consider an incomplete financial market which consists of two risky assets modelled with a two-dimensional Levy process. One of the assets is a security which can be traded by the insurer, and the second asset is a security which is the underlying fund for the variable annuity contract. In our model we derive an equation from which the fee for the guaranteed benefit can be calculated and we characterize a strategy which allows the insurer to hedge the benefit. To solve the pricing and hedging problem in an incomplete financial market we apply a quadratic objective. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The counterfactual in a duration model is the length of the spell in case the regressor would have been different. We introduce the structural duration function, which gives these counterfactuals. The advantage of focusing on counterfactuals is that one does not need to identify the mixed proportional hazard model. In particular, we present examples in which the mixed proportional hazard model is unidentified or has a singular information matrix but our estimator for counterfactuals still converges at rate N-1/2, where N is the number of observations.

However, the reinsurer may fail to pay the promised amount when the promised amount exceeds the reinsurer's solvency. As a seller of a reinsurance contract, the initial capital or reserve of a reinsurer should meet some regulatory requirements. We assume that the initial capital or reserve of a reinsurer is regulated by the value-at-risk (VaR) of its promised indemnity. When the promised indemnity exceeds the total of the reinsurer's initial capital and the reinsurance premium, the reinsurer may fail to pay the promised amount or default may occur. In the presence of the regulatory initial capital and the counterparty default risk, we investigate optimal reinsurance designs from an insurer's point of view and derive optimal reinsurance strategies that maximize the expected utility of an insurer's terminal wealth or minimize the VaR of an insurer's total retained risk. It turns out that optimal reinsurance strategies in the presence of the regulatory initial capital and the counterparty default risk are different both from optimal reinsurance strategies in the absence of the counterparty default risk and from optimal reinsurance strategies in the presence of the counterparty default risk but without the regulatory initial capital.

One way to obtain a confidence set for this coefficient is to invert the Anderson-Rubin (AR) test. The AR confidence sets that result have correct coverage under classical assumptions. However, AR confidence sets also have many undesirable properties. It is well known that they can be unbounded when the instruments are weak, as is true of any test with correct coverage. However, even when they are bounded, their length may be very misleading, and their coverage conditional on quantities that the investigator can observe (notably, the Sargan statistic for overidentifying restrictions) can be far from correct. A similar property manifests itself, for similar reasons, when a confidence set for a single parameter is based on inverting an F-test for two or more parameters.","[Davidson, Russell] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Davidson, Russell] Ctr Vieille Charite, AMSE GREQAM, F-13236 Marseille 02, France; [MacKinnon, James G.] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",McGill University; Queens University - Canada,"Davidson, R (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",Russell.Davidson@mcgill.ca; jgm@econ.queensu.ca,,"MacKinnon, James/0000-0002-5457-294X","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chairs programme (Chair in Economics, McGill University); Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canada Research Chairs programme (Chair in Economics, McGill University); Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture","This research was supported, in part, by grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Canada Research Chairs programme (Chair in Economics, McGill University), and the Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture.

Crossover leads to contamination of the initial randomized groups due to a mixing of the effects of the control and experimental treatments in the reference group. This is further complicated by the fact that crossover is often a very selective process whereby patients who switch treatment have a different prognosis than those who do not. Standard statistical techniques, including those that attempt to account for the treatment switch, cannot fully adjust for the bias introduced by crossover. Specialized methods such as rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) models and inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) analyses are designed to deal with selective treatment switching and have been increasingly applied to adjust for crossover. We provide an overview of the crossover problem and highlight circumstances under which it is likely to cause bias. We then describe the RPSFT and IPCW methods and explain how these methods adjust for the bias, highlighting the assumptions invoked in the process. Our aim is to facilitate understanding of these complex methods using a case study to support explanations. We also discuss the implications of crossover adjustment on cost-effectiveness results.","[Ishak, K.

First, we consider finite covariate dependent mixture models, in which the mixing probabilities are proportional to a product of a constant and a kernel and a prior on the number of mixture components is specified.

This paper focuses on the probability that a policyholder reports a claim, where the classical logit link does not provide a right model. This is so because databases related with automobile claims are often unbalanced, containing more non-claims than the presence of claims. In this work an asymmetric logit model, which takes into account the large number of non-claims in the portfolio, is considered. Both, logit and asymmetric logit models from a Bayesian point of view, are used to a sample that was collected from a major automobile insurance company in Spain in 2009, resulting in a dataset of 2,000 passenger vehicle. We establish the validity of the asymmetric model in front of the conventional logit link. The use of a garage, the age of the vehicle and the duration of the client's relation with the company are all shown to be significant explanatory variables by the logit model. The asymmetric model includes, in addition, the length of time the policyholder has held a driving licence and the type of use made of the vehicle. The asymmetric model provides a better fit to the data examined.","[Perez-Sanchez, J. M.; Garcia-Garcia, C.] Univ Granada, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ, Granada 18011, Spain; [Negrin-Hernandez, M.

We provide estimates of the counterfactual distribution of BMI that would have been observed in 2003-2008 had demographics remained fixed at 1980 values, roughly the beginning of the period of increasing overweight and obesity. We find that changes in demographics are partly responsible for the changes in the population distribution of BMI and are capable of explaining about 8.6% of the increase in the combined rate of overweight and obesity among women and about 7.2% of the increase among men. We also use demographic projections to predict a BMI distribution and corresponding rates of overweight and obesity for 2050.","[Kline, Brendan] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Tobias, Justin L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Tobias, JL (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, 403 W State St,KRAN 357, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jltobias@purdue.edu,"Kline, Brendan/JVD-9448-2023","Kline, Brendan/0009-0004-8484-0302",,,,,27,0,1,0,96,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

For processes with the latter property, a transformation along the lines suggested by Nelson and Ramaswamey can be used to give a diffusion with constant volatility and thus a computationally simple binomial lattice. Drift terms in mean-reverting and transformed processes frequently result in either ill-defined probabilities or complex grids. We develop closed-form, legitimate probabilities on a simple grid for univariate and multivariate lattices for well-posed smooth diffusions. The probabilities are based on conditional normal density functions with parameters determined by the diffusion.

We show how the model can be calibrated and applied to the simultaneous modeling of both mortality and longevity risk for several populations. The main contribution of this paper is a stochastic trend component which explicitly models changes in the long-term mortality trend assumption over time. This allows to quantify mortality and longevity risk over the one-year time horizon prescribed by the solvency regimes without relying on nested simulations. We illustrate the practical ability of our model by calculating solvency capital requirements for some example portfolios, and we compare these capital requirements with those from the Solvency II standard formula.","[Boerger, Matthias] Univ Ulm, Inst Insurance, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Boerger, Matthias] Inst Finance & Actuarial Sci Ifa, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Fleischer, Daniel; Kuksin, Nikita] Swiss Reinsurance Co Ltd, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland",Ulm University,"Börger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ulm, Inst Insurance, Helmholtzstr 22, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.",m.boerger@ifa-ulm.de,,,,,,,30,28,31,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,JAN,2014,44.0,1,,,,,1,38,,10.1017/asb.2013.24,0.0,,,38,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AP3TL,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342000400001,0

To do that, we estimate nonparametric betas to measure the possibly time-varying sensitivity of each country stock market to the European market returns. Accounting for the nonparametric specification, we propose a formal test for the constancy of these comovements, as a two-step procedure. A simulation study is presented to ensure the good performance. For the European data, the estimated betas show different patterns for different countries. On the one hand, when the test is applied to the relation between each domestic index and the Eurostock, all betas are significant and time-varying. On the other hand, we find that the IBEX has remaining time-varying comovements with the German and French index returns, not explained by the Eurostock, but not with the Swiss index.

Two prima facie very different phenomena - one dealing with traffic monitoring using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and one with tracking the formation state of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in optical data - are presented. We show that sophisticated image processing methods and adapted, refined hidden state models improve existing remote sensing applications significantly.","[Henke, Daniel; Meier, Erich] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Henke, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",Daniel.Henke@geo.uzh.ch; Erich.Meier@geo.uzh.ch,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,1,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1242,1255,,,,,,14,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600136,0

We model the risk-neutral cumulative distribution function (CDF) using quartic B-splines with power tails so that the resulting risk-neutral probability density function (PDF) has continuity C-2 and arbitrage-free properties. Since the number of knots is selected optimally in constructing the quartic B-spline risk-neutral CDF, our method avoids both overfitting and oversmoothing. To improve computational efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a three-step RNM estimation procedure that transforms a nonlinear optimization problem into a convex quadratic program. Monte-Carlo experiments and applications to S&P 500 index options suggest that the BSP method performs considerably better than the SML method. The BSP method always produces arbitrage-free RNM estimators and almost perfectly recovers the actual risk-neutral PDFs for various hypothetical distributions.","Bank Korea, Seoul 100794, South Korea",Bank of Korea,"Lee, SH (通讯作者)，Bank Korea, 110,3 Ga, Seoul 100794, South Korea.",leecon@bok.or.kr,,,,,,,27,4,6,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Market traders that employ technical analysis use, among other tools, different averages of prices -such as moving and exponential moving averages-and the points where they cross in order to obtain signals for supporting their decisions. However, such signals appear time-delayed so that, when they appear, the major price movement has almost finished. All these kind of means can be computed by very simple digital filters. In this paper we interpret all those averages under the digital filtering framework and the classical theory of control. This allows to modify filter characteristics in function of only one parameter that can change with an error -or the volatility of a given magnitude-in order to obtain different behaviors, as for example, some responses that exhibit a signal overshoots at the same time that the stability of filters are guaranteed. The goal is to reduce the delay of signals following the price movements. The first results are presented together with the candlestick representation of prices and the signals. The performance of such approach is evaluated on back tests using by day-by-day time-series of stocks.","[Rivera Peruyero, Juan Ricardo; Marti-Puig, Pere] Univ Vic UVic, Dept Digital Informat Technol, Vic 08500, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de Vic - Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC),"Peruyero, JRR (通讯作者)，Univ Vic UVic, Dept Digital Informat Technol, Vic 08500, Barcelona, Spain.",juanricardo.rivera@uvic.cat; pere.marti@uvic.cat,"Martí, Pere/I-2797-2015","Martí, Pere/0000-0001-6582-4551",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1256,1267,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600137,0

It uses bivariate copulae to accommodate for the dependence between these quantities. We derive the general distribution of the policy loss without the restrictive assumption of independence. We illustrate that this distribution tends to be skewed and multi-modal, and that an independence assumption can lead to substantial bias in the estimation of the policy loss. Further, we extend our framework to regression models by combining marginal generalized linear models with a copula. We show that this approach leads to a flexible class of models, and that the parameters can be estimated efficiently using maximum-likelihood.

It does so by estimating and solving, using parametric approximations to firms' value functions, a dynamic model that captures important features of the industry such as vertical and horizontal product differentiation, demographic variation in programming tastes, and multi-station ownership. The estimated model predicts that high fees would cause the number of music stations to fall significantly and quite quickly. For example, a fee equal to 10% of revenues would cause a 4.6% drop in the number of music stations within 2 1/2 years, and a 9.4% drop in the long run. The size of the change is limited, however, by the fact that many listeners, particularly in demographics that are valued by advertisers, have strong preferences for music programming.","[Sweeting, Andrew] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Sweeting, Andrew] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Sweeting, Andrew] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Sweeting, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",sweeting@econ.umd.edu,,"Sweeting, Andrew/0000-0002-6351-5162",National Association of Broadcasters; Center for the Study of Industrial Organization at Northwestern University,National Association of Broadcasters; Center for the Study of Industrial Organization at Northwestern University,"I would like to thank Jerry Hausman, Igal Hendel, Aviv Nevo, Amil Petrin, Ariel Pakes, Rob Porter, Steve Berry, Pat Bayer, Peter Arcidiacono, Kate Ho, Allan Collard-Wexler, Paul Ellickson, Arie Beresteanu, three referees, and seminar participants for valuable comments.

Against this background, the combination of reinsurance and capital market solutions (insurance-linked securities) has received an increasing interest. In this paper, we develop a general model of optimal risk-sharing among three representative agents-an insurer, a reinsurer and a financial investor, making a distinction between systematic and idiosyncratic risks. We focus on the impact of regulation on risk transfer, by differentiating reinsurance and securitisation in terms of their impact on reserve requirements.

Otherwise, it reads as an optimization problem over controlled dynamics of McKean-Vlasov type. Both problems lead to the analysis of forward-backward stochastic differential equations, the coefficients of which depend on the marginal distributions of the solutions.

As an estimator for the regression parameter we use the least squares estimator. We show that it is a consistent estimator and derive its asymptotic behavior. The limit distribution is a ratio of functionals of Brownian motions and stable Levy processes, whose characteristic triplets have an explicit analytic representation.

Development economists, on the other hand, have focused extensively on whether institutions cause or are caused by growth yet the relevant literature is still rife with debate. In this article, we use a notion of distributional dominance to tackle both the measurement of multivariate welfare and the evaluation of inter-temporal dependence without hindrance from the mix of discrete (political) and continuous (economic) variables in our data set. On the causality front, our results support the view that institutions promote growth more than growth promotes institutions. On the welfare front, we find that economic growth had a positive impact from 1960 to 2000 but declines in institutional quality over the earlier part of this period were sufficient to produce a decline in overall wellbeing until the mid-1970s. Subsequent improvements in institutions then reversed the trend and, ultimately, wellbeing in 2000 was higher than that in 1960.","[Anderson, Gordon] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hachem, Kinda] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Toronto; University of Chicago,"Anderson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",anderson@chass.utoronto.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We thank the editor, two anonymous referees, and participants at the 2010 IARIW conference in St. Gallen for helpful comments.

In this paper, we derive analytical results for their finite-sample biases up to the second order. In general, the bias results depend on the cumulants (up to the sixth order) as well as the dependency structure of the data. Using an AR(1) process for illustration, we show that a feasible bias-correction procedure based on our analytical results works remarkably well for reducing the bias of the sample skewness. Bias-correction works reasonably well also for the sample kurtosis under some moderate degree of dependency. In terms of hypothesis testing, bias-correction offers power improvement when testing for normality, and bias-correction under the null provides also size improvement. However, for testing nonzero skewness and/or excess kurtosis, there exist nonnegligible size distortions in finite samples and bias-correction may not help.","Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Bao, Y (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ybao@purdue.edu,"Bao, Yong/R-7795-2016","Bao, Yong/0000-0001-6513-1683",,,,,25,18,20,3,46,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We demonstrate that the limiting distribution of consistent IV is not affected by conditioning on exogenous regressors, whereas that of inconsistent OLS is. The OLS asymptotic and simulated actual variances are shown to diminish by extending the set of exogenous variables kept fixed in sampling, whereas such an extension disrupts the distribution of IV and deteriorates the accuracy of its standard asymptotic approximation, not only when instruments are weak. Against this background, the consequences for the identification of parameters of interest are examined for a setting in which (in practice often incredible) assumptions regarding the zero correlation between instruments and disturbances are replaced by (generally more credible) interval assumptions on the correlation between endogenous regressor and disturbance. This yields OLS-based modified confidence intervals, which are usually conservative, as is established by simulation. Often they compare favourably with IV-based intervals and accentuate their frailty. The latter is demonstrated in an empirical illustration.","[Kiviet, Jan F.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Singapore 637332, Singapore; [Kiviet, Jan F.] Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kiviet, Jan F.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands",Nanyang Technological University; University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; University of Amsterdam,"Kiviet, JF (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",jfkiviet@ntu.edu.sg,"Kiviet, Jan/B-8865-2015","Kiviet, Jan/0000-0001-8827-9808",,,,,39,20,22,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

We show that, as the economy becomes more disaggregated, the rate at which aggregate volatility decays is determined by the structure of the network capturing such linkages. Our main results provide a characterization of this relationship in terms of the importance of different sectors as suppliers to their immediate customers, as well as their role as indirect suppliers to chains of downstream sectors. Such higher-order interconnections capture the possibility of cascade effects whereby productivity shocks to a sector propagate not only to its immediate downstream customers, but also to the rest of the economy. Our results highlight that sizable aggregate volatility is obtained from sectoral idiosyncratic shocks only if there exists significant asymmetry in the roles that sectors play as suppliers to others, and that the sparseness of the inputoutput matrix is unrelated to the nature of aggregate fluctuations.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Carvalho, Vasco M.] Univ Pompeu Fabra & Barcelona GSE, Ctr Recerca Econ Int, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Ozdaglar, Asuman] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Tahbaz-Salehi, Alireza] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, Decis Risk & Operat Div, New York, NY 10027 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Pompeu Fabra University; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Columbia University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",daron@mit.edu; vcarvalho@crei.cat; asuman@mit.edu; alirezat@columbia.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023; Tahbaz-Salehi, Alireza/KCX-9521-2024; Carvalho, Vasco/B-4289-2013","Tahbaz-Salehi, Alireza/0000-0002-6860-1836; Carvalho, Vasco/0000-0002-6128-9157","Government of Catalonia [2009SGR1157]; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science Grants Juan de la Cierva [JCI2009-04127, ECO2011-23488, CSD2006-00016]; Barcelona GSE Research Network; Toulouse Network for Information Technology; National Science Foundation [0735956]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-09-1-0420]; Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities; Directorate For Engineering [0735956] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Education and Science Grants Juan de la Cierva(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Barcelona GSE Research Network; Toulouse Network for Information Technology; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),"This paper combines material from Carvalho's Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Chicago (Carvalho (2008)) and Acemoglu, Ozdaglar, and Tahbaz-Salehi (2010).

The outcome of interest varies linearly with a vector of endogenous regressors. The coefficients on these regressors are heterogenous across units and may covary with them. We consider the average partial effect (APE) of a small change in the regressor vector on the outcome (cf. Chamberlain (1984), Wooldridge (2005a)). Chamberlain (1992) calculated the semiparametric efficiency bound for the APE in our model and proposed a vN-consistent estimator. Nonsingularity of the APE's information bound, and hence the appropriateness of Chamberlain's (1992) estimator, requires (i) the time dimension of the panel (T) to strictly exceed the number of random coefficients (p) and (ii) strong conditions on the time series properties of the regressor vector. We demonstrate irregular identification of the APE when T = p and for more persistent regressor processes. Our approach exploits the different identifying content of the subpopulations of stayersor units whose regressor values change little across periodsand moversor units whose regressor values change substantially across periods. We propose a feasible estimator based on our identification result and characterize its large sample properties. While irregularity precludes our estimator from attaining parametric rates of convergence, its limiting distribution is normal and inference is straightforward to conduct. Standard software may be used to compute point estimates and standard errors. We use our methods to estimate the average elasticity of calorie consumption with respect to total outlay for a sample of poor Nicaraguan households.","[Graham, Bryan S.; Powell, James L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Graham, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, 508-1 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bgraham@econ.berkeley.edu; powell@econ.berkeley.edu,"Graham, Bryan S/H-4515-2011","Graham, Bryan/0000-0002-9637-5282","National Science Foundation [SES 0921928]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0921928] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank seminar participants at UC-Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Harvard, Yale, NYU, Princeton, Rutgers, Syracuse, Penn State, University College London, University of Pennsylvania, members of the Berkeley Econometrics Reading Group, and participants in the Conference in Economics and Statistics in honor of Theodore W.

To this end, we assume the existence of commutable life annuities, whose surrender charge is a proportion of their actuarial value. We model a retiree as a utility-maximizing economic agent who can invest in a financial market with a risky and a riskless asset and who can purchase or surrender commutable life annuities. We define the wealth of an individual as the total value of her risky and riskless assets, which is required to be non-negative during her lifetime. We exclude the actuarial value of her annuity income in calculating wealth; therefore, we do not allow the individual to borrow from her future annuity income because this income is contingent on her being alive. We solve this incomplete-market utility maximization problem via duality arguments and obtain semi-analytical solutions. We find that the optimal annuitization strategy depends on the size of proportional surrender charge, with lower proportional surrender charges leading to more annuitization. We also find that full annuitization is optimal when there is no surrender charge or when the retiree is very risk averse. Surprisingly, we find that in the case for which the proportional surrender charge is larger than a critical value, it is optimal for the retiree to behave as if annuities are not commutable. We provide numerical examples to illustrate our results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The real world large market is represented by a sequence of models and, though each of them is arbitrage free, investors may obtain non-risky profits in the limit. Mathematically, absence of the asymptotic arbitrage is expressed as contiguity of envelopes of the sets of equivalent martingale measures and objective probabilities. The classical theory deals with frictionless markets. In the present paper we extend it to markets with transaction costs. Assuming that each model admits consistent price systems, we relate them with families of probability measures and consider their upper and lower envelopes. Themain result concerns the necessary and sufficient conditions for absence of asymptotic arbitrage opportunities of the first and second kinds expressed in terms of contiguity.

Our objective is to find the dividend payment policy which maximizes the cumulative expected discounted dividend pay-outs until the time of bankruptcy imposing a ceiling on the dividend rates. We characterize the optimal value function as the unique bounded viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We prove that there exists an optimal dividend strategy and that this strategy is stationary with a band structure. We study the regularity of the optimal value function. We find a characterization result to check optimality even in the case where the optimal value function is not differentiable. We construct examples where the claim-size distribution is smooth but the optimal dividend policy is not threshold and the optimal value function is not differentiable. We study the survival probability of the company under the optimal dividend policy. We also present examples where the optimal dividend policy has infinitely many bands even in the case that the claim-size distribution has a bounded density. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We decompose a participating life insurance contract in a term life insurance and a savings part and simulate the cash flow distribution of the latter. Simulation results are compared with cash flows resulting from two benchmarks investing in the same portfolio of assets but without investment guarantees and bonus distribution schemes, in order to measure the impact of these two product features. To provide a realistic picture within the two alternatives, we take transaction costs and wealth transfers between different groups of policyholders into account. We show that the payoff distribution strongly depends on the initial reserve situation and managerial discretion. Results indicate that policyholders will in general profit from a better payoff distribution of the participating life insurance compared to a mutual fund benchmark but not compared to an exchange-traded fund benchmark portfolio.

The trend of a time series is usually defined as a smooth additive component which contains information about the time series global change, and we discuss this and other definitions of the trend. We do not aim to review all the novel approaches, but rather to observe the problem from different viewpoints and from different areas of expertise. The article contributes to understanding the concept of a trend and the problem of its extraction. We present an overview of advantages and disadvantages of the approaches under consideration, which are: the model-based approach (MBA), nonparametric linear filtering, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), and wavelets. The MBA assumes the specification of a stochastic time series model, which is usually either an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model or a state space model. The nonparametric filtering methods do not require specification of model and are popular because of their simplicity in application. We discuss the Henderson, LOESS, and Hodrick-Prescott filters and their versions derived by exploiting the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space methodology. In addition to these prominent approaches, we consider SSA and wavelet methods. SSA is widespread in the geosciences; its algorithm is similar to that of principal components analysis, but SSA is applied to time series. Wavelet methods are the de facto standard for denoising in signal procession, and recent works revealed their potential in trend analysis.","[Alexandrov, Theodore; Maass, Peter] Univ Bremen, Ctr Ind Math, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Bianconcini, Silvia; Dagum, Estela Bee] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, Bologna, Italy; [McElroy, Tucker S.] US Census Bur, Div Stat Res, Washington, DC USA",University of Bremen; University of Bologna,"Alexandrov, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Ctr Ind Math, Bibliothekstr 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",theodore@math.uni-bremen.de,"; Maass, Peter/P-5801-2016","BIANCONCINI, SILVIA/0000-0003-4810-5197; Maass, Peter/0000-0003-1448-8345",,,,,90,75,77,3,83,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Rituximab maintenance therapy is associated with significant improvement in progression-free and overall survival in patients with NHL. However, treatment with rituximab causes considerable costs for healthcare systems. Objective: This article provides an overview of economic evaluations of rituximab and appraises their methodological quality. Methods: A systematic literature search of cost-effectiveness studies on rituximab was carried out in nine electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), the German Agency of Health Technology Assessment (DAHTA) database, German Institute for Quality Improvement (DIQ)-Literatur, DIQ-Projekte, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessments (HTA) database and Sozialmedin (SOMED) [languages: English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish and Italian; publication period: 1998 to 2010]. Based on pre-specified inclusion criteria, cost-effectiveness studies were identified that compared standard chemotherapy with standard chemotherapy plus rituximab in patients with a subtype of NHL. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using a quality checklist. Results: Fourteen economic evaluations from seven different countries were included in the review. All economic evaluations reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the add-on therapy with rituximab that were below the country-specific thresholds. The studies differed significantly in their characteristics and methodological rigour. Most studies lacked transparency regarding identification and justification of data. In several studies, the rationale for the model structure was not described appropriately. Conclusion: Adding rituximab to standard chemotherapy is considered a cost-effective treatment option for NHL. However, the results of the analyses should be interpreted with caution due to methodological limitations.","[Auweiler, Philipp W.

The objective of this review was to systematically synthesize published evidence regarding direct costs associated with the treatment of osteoporosis-related fractures in the US. We conducted a systematic literature review of published studies that used claims databases and economic studies reporting costs associated with osteoporosis-related fractures in the US. Studies published between 1990 and 2011 were systematically searched in PubMed (primary source), Ovid HealthSTAR, EMBASE and the websites of large agencies. Data concerning study design, patient population and cost components assessed were extracted with qualitative assessment of study methods, limitations and conclusions. Cost assessment included direct medical and hospitalization (inpatient) costs. The cost differences by age and gender were examined. Of the 33 included studies, 26 reported an estimated total medical cost and hospital resource use associated with osteoporotic fractures. These studies indicated that, in the year following a fracture, medical and hospitalization costs were 1.6-6.2 higher than pre-fracture costs and 2.2-3.5 times higher than those for matched controls. Analysis of the hospitalization costs by osteoporotic fracture type resulted in hip fractures identified as the most expensive fracture type (unit cost range $US8358-32 195), while wrist and forearm fractures were the least expensive (unit cost range $U51885-12 136). Although incremental fracture costs were generally lower in the elderly than in the younger population, total costs were highest for the older (>= 65 years of age) population. Total healthcare costs for fractures were highest for the older female population, but unit fracture costs in women were not consistently found to be higher than for men. The qualitative assessment of the included studies demonstrated that the design and reporting of individual studies were of good quality. However, the findings of this review and comparisons across studies were limited by differences in methodologies used by the different studies to derive costs, the populations included in the studies used and the fracture assessment. Despite the variability in estimates, the literature indicates that osteoporosis-related fractures are associated with high total medical and hospitalization costs in the US. The variability in the cost estimates highlights the importance of comparing the methodologies and the types of costs used when choosing an appropriate unit cost for economic modelling.","[Budhia, Sangeeta; Tang, Michael] Heron Evidence Dev Ltd, Luton LU2 8DL, Beds, England; [Mikyas, Yeshi; Badamgarav, Enkhe] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA",Amgen,"Budhia, S (通讯作者)，Heron Evidence Dev Ltd, Bldg 210A,Butterfield Technol & Business Pk, Luton LU2 8DL, Beds, England.",sangeeta.budhia@heronhealth.com,,,Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc.(Amgen),Funding for this study was provided by Amgen Inc.

NICE had previously considered the use of omalizumab in patients aged 12 years and over. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) and the Centre for Health Economics (CHE) at the University of York were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) to critically appraise the evidence presented by the manufacturer. This article summarizes that review of the evidence, the deliberations of the NICE Appraisal Committee and the resulting NICE guidance. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The relevant patient population was patients aged 6-11 years of age with severe persistent allergic immunoglobulin E-mediated asthma whose condition remained uncontrolled despite best standard care with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonist. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from a pre-planned subgroup analysis of a single randomized controlled trial comparing omalizumab plus standard therapy against standard therapy alone. At a 52-week follow-up, the only outcome to show a statistically significant benefit of omalizumab compared with placebo was the number of exacerbations defined as 'clinically significant' [CS] (relative risk [RR] 0.504; 95% Cl 0.350, 0.725; p < 0.001). At the ERG's request, the manufacturer provided analyses stratified by baseline exacerbation rate, which indicated the effect of omalizumab on CS exacerbations was statistically significant only for those children with exacerbations as baseline. The ERG identified a number of issues relating to the clinical effectiveness results: it was unclear whether the pre-planned subgroup analysis had sufficient power; the definition of CS exacerbation was less severe than that used in UK clinical practice; and the method for imputing exacerbations for those who withdrew from treatment may have underestimated the exacerbation rate. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio based on the manufacturer's results was considerably above the threshold range stated in the NICE Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal. The ERG identified numerous issues relating to the cost-effectiveness results, which included the following: the 10-year time horizon for treatment may exceed that in clinical practice; the assumption of constant exacerbation rates over a lifetime given that adolescence is expected to impact on the severity of asthma; and whether it is appropriate to use health-related quality-of-life data collected in adults for children. The ERG concluded that omalizumab appears to reduce CS exacerbations but there was no evidence of improvement in daily symptoms, CS severe (CSS) exacerbations or hospitalization rates. The main driver of cost effectiveness was the reduction in asthma-related mortality associated with a reduction in CSS exacerbations. As the number of CSS exacerbations avoided was low, as is asthma-related mortality in children, the potential small gain in QALYs associated with omalizumab was not sufficient to compensate for the high treatment cost even under the most favourable scenario analyses. The Appraisal Committee recommended that omalizumab should not be routinely provided for the treatment of severe persistent allergic asthma in children aged 6-11 years.","[Burch, Jane; Wright, Kath; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Griffin, Susan; McKenna, Claire; Walker, Simon] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ CHE, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Paton, James] Royal Hosp Sick Children, Glasgow G3 8SJ, Lanark, Scotland",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; University of Glasgow,"Burch, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",jane.burch@york.ac.uk,"Paton, James Y/B-9541-2008; Wright, Kath/P-1516-2019; Griffin, Susan/AAE-8970-2020","Griffin, Susan/0000-0003-2188-8400; Walker, Simon Mark/0000-0002-5750-3691; Wright, Kath/0000-0002-9020-1572",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [09/98/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 09/98/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

Furthermore, the out-of-sample forecasting performances of both the ARJI-Trend model and the GARCH model are found to have general equivalence for the S&P 500 indices. Our analyses further show that the mini-sized index market is the most efficient with regard to the transmission of information in both the short and long run. This suggests that, following the introduction of E-mini futures, these instruments have come to play a dominant role in price discovery. Overall, our empirical results are very encouraging, insofar as the proposed ARJI-Trend model is found to be a useful tool for helping practitioners to gain a better understanding of the differential attributes between spot, general and mini-sized products in US stock markets.","[Chiang, Shu-Mei] Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Gueishan Shiang 333, Taoyuan County, Taiwan; [Chung, Huimin] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Grad Inst Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Huang, Chien-Ming] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Tamkang University,"Chiang, SM (通讯作者)，Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, 300 Wanshou Rd,Sect 1, Gueishan Shiang 333, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.",shumei@mail.lhu.edu.tw,,"Chiang, Shumei/0000-0002-7087-6257",National Science Council; MoE ATU Plan of the National Chiao Tung University,"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); MoE ATU Plan of the National Chiao Tung University",The authors would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation for the financial support provided by the National Science Council.

We present a recursive scenario approximation approach suitable for financial management problems, leading to a minimal yet sufficient representation of the randomness underlying the decision problem. The method relies on the definition of a benchmark probability space generated through Monte Carlo simulation and the implementation of a scenario reduction scheme. The procedure is tested on an interest rate vector process capturing market and credit risk dynamics in the fixed income market.

Further, we consider how to use the results to perform counterfactual analysis.","[Donald, Stephen G.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hsu, Yu-Chin] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Barrett, Garry F.] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Sydney,"Donald, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",donald@eco.utexas.edu; hsuy@missouri.edu; garry.barrett@sydney.edu.au,,"Barrett, Garry/0000-0002-7669-7110",Afred P.

Objective: Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of rivaroxaban, a once-daily, orally administered Factor Xa inhibitor, for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing THR or TKR. This analysis evaluated the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin, from a US payer's perspective. Methods: A' decision-analytic model was developed to compare the costs and outcomes associated with rivaroxaban and enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE. The model replicated short-term clinical outcomes from the phase III RECORD trials. RECORD1 and RECORD2 compared rivaroxaban 10 mg daily (qd), given for 35 days, with enoxaparin 40 mg qd, given for 35 days or 10 to 14 days, respectively, in patients undergoing THR. RECORD3 compared 10 mg of rivaroxaban qd for 10 to 14 days versus 40 mg of enoxaparin qd for 10 to 14 days in patients undergoing TKR. The decision-analytic model also included data on long-term complications and sequelae as captured in observational studies and databases. It also included direct year 2010 medical costs over 1-year and 5-year time horizons. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of different factors on the results of the model. Results of the cost-effectiveness analysis were reported in terms of symptomatic: VTE events avoided. Results: Rivaroxaban was associated with cost savings of $US511.93 per patient and prevented an average of 0.0145 symptomatic VTE events per patient in the THR population, compared with enoxaparin. For a TKR population, 10 to 14 days of rivaroxaban prophylaxis was associated with cost savings of $US465.74 and prevented an average 0.0193 symptomatic VTE events per patient. Sensitivity analysis suggested that the results of the model were robust, with cost savings ranging from $US133.96-629.57 in the THR population and $US293.01-848.68 in the TKR population, depending on the variables used. Sensitivity analysis also suggested that the economic profile of rivaroxaban is improved when the time horizon of the model is extended from 1 year to 5 years. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the findings of baseline results, showing that rivaroxaban was less costly and more effective in all model simulations for both populations. Conclusions: This decision-analytic model analysis, from the US payer's perspective, concluded that rivaroxaban may be cost saving in both the THR and the TKR populations, when compared with enoxaparin in the US.","[Duran, Aurea; Forster, Fiona] IMS Hlth, London, England; [Sengupta, Nishan] Janssen Global Serv, Worldwide Market Access, Raritan, NJ USA; [Diamantopoulos, Alexander] Symmetron Ltd, London, England; [Kwong, Louis] Harbor UCLA Med Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Kwong, Louis] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lees, Michael] Bayer HealthCare, Uxbridge, Middx, England",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals,"Sengupta, N (通讯作者)，Janssen Global Serv, Worldwide Market Access, 6500 Paseo Padre Pkwy, Fremont, CA 94555 USA.",,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals; Janssen Pharmaceutical Research & Development, LLC.; Johnson Johnson; Astellas; Bayer; Pfizer; sanofi aventis; GSK","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals(Bayer AGBayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals); Janssen Pharmaceutical Research & Development, LLC.; Johnson Johnson(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USA); Astellas(Astellas Pharmaceuticals); Bayer(Bayer AG); Pfizer(Pfizer); sanofi aventis(Sanofi-Aventis); GSK(GlaxoSmithKline)","The authors would like to acknowledge Michael A.

Investment funds use what is perhaps the most basic financial strategy, called 'value investing', i.e. systematically attempting to buy underpriced assets. When funds do not borrow, the price fluctuations of the asset are approximately normally distributed and uncorrelated across time. This changes when the funds are allowed to leverage, i.e. borrow from a bank, which allows them to purchase more assets than their wealth would otherwise permit. During good times, funds that use more leverage have higher profits, increasing their wealth and making them dominant in the market. However, if a downward price fluctuation occurs while one or more funds is fully leveraged, the resulting margin call causes them to sell into an already falling market, amplifying the downward price movement. If the funds hold large positions in the asset, this can cause substantial losses. This in turn leads to clustered volatility: before a crash, when the value funds are dominant, they damp volatility, and after the crash, when they suffer severe losses, volatility is high. This leads to power-law tails, which are both due to the leverage-induced crashes and due to the clustered volatility induced by the wealth dynamics. This is in contrast to previous explanations of fat tails and clustered volatility, which depended on 'irrational behavior', such as trend following. A standard (supposedly more sophisticated) risk control policy in which individual banks base leverage limits on volatility causes leverage to rise during periods of low volatility, and to contract more quickly when volatility becomes high, making these extreme fluctuations even worse.","[Thurner, Stefan] Med Univ Vienna, Sect Sci Complex Syst, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Thurner, Stefan; Farmer, J.

First, we show that stop-loss reinsurance is optimal under both Conditional Value-at-Risk and spectral risk measures. Spectral risk measures thus constitute a more general class of suitable regulatory risk measures than specific Conditional Value-at-Risk. At the same time, the established type of stop-loss reinsurance can be maintained as the optimal risk management strategy that minimizes regulatory capital. Second, we derive the optimal deductibles for stop-loss reinsurance. We show that under Conditional Value-at-Risk, the optimal deductible tends towards restrictive and counter-intuitive corner solutions or plunging, which is a serious objection against its use in regulatory risk management. By means of the broader class of spectral risk measures, we are able to overcome this shortcoming as optimal deductibles are now interior solutions. Especially, the recently discussed power spectral risk measures and the Wang risk measure are shown to avoid any plunging. They yield a one-to-one correspondence between the risk parameter and the optimal deductible and, thus, provide economically plausible risk management strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we develop a family of hierarchical Bayesian paid-incurred claims models, combining the claims reserving models of Hertig (1985) and Gogol (1993). In the process we extend the independent log-normal model of Merz and Wuthrich (2010) by incorporating different dependence structures using a Data-Augmented mixture Copula paid-incurred claims model. In this way the paper makes two main contributions: firstly we develop an extended class of model structures for the paid-incurred chain ladder models where we develop precisely the Bayesian formulation of such models; secondly we explain how to develop advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms to make inference under these copula dependence PIC models accurately and efficiently, making such models accessible to practitioners to explore their suitability in practice. In this regard the focus of the paper should be considered in two parts, firstly development of Bayesian PIC models for general dependence structures with specialised properties relating to conjugacy and consistency of tail dependence across the development years and accident years and between Payment and incurred loss data are developed. The second main contribution is the development of techniques that allow general audiences to efficiently work with such Bayesian models to make inference. The focus of the paper is not so much to illustrate that the PIC paper is a good class of models for a particular data set, the suitability of such PIC type models is discussed in Merz and Wuthrich (2010) and Happ and Wuthrich (2013). Instead we develop generalised model classes for the PIC family of Bayesian models and in addition provide advanced Monte Carlo methods for inference that practitioners may utilise with confidence in their efficiency and validity.

We study the limiting properties of various estimators in an asymptotic framework, which takes both the cross-sectional dimension N and the time dimension T to infinity. In this setting as in the pure cross-sectional setup, the performance of the 2SLS estimator depends on the strength of the identifying conditions imposed on the coefficients of the model, and it fails to be consistent once these conditions break down sufficiently resulting in instruments that are too weakly correlated with the endogenous regressors. On the other hand, the between-group (BG) estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal even when coefficient restrictions fail, but it has the shortcoming that its precision depends only on variations in the cross-sectional dimension; and, hence, it is less efficient and has slower rate of convergence than alternatives, which make better use of the large time dimension. A GMM estimator, which combines the moment conditions of the BG estimator with that of the within-group IV estimator, is more robust to instrument weakness than 2SLS and is more efficient than the BG estimator, but it has a second-order bias even under strong instruments if the assumed covariance restrictions do not hold. To remedy the deficiency of the aforementioned estimators, we propose in this paper two new model averaging estimators, which are weighted averages of the GMM estimator and a bias-corrected GMM estimator. The two proposed estimators have weighting functions that depend on alternative transformations of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is employed here to assess the validity of the covariance restrictions. We show that these new estimators have some nice robustness properties against possible failure of either the coefficient restrictions or the covariance restrictions.","[Chao, John C.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Chao, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",chao@econ.umd.edu,,"Chao, John/0000-0003-3889-0451",,,,,28,1,1,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We present an approximation of distortion risk measures by a piecewise linear approximation of concave distortions. This is used to construct a tractable non-parametric calibration procedure to bid-ask prices based on piecewise linear concave distortion functions. To analyze the specific structure of distortion functions, we calibrate quoted bid-ask prices non-parametrically and w.r.t. parametric families and obtain a jump-linear structure. Hence, we suggest considering the parametric family of ess sup-expectation convex combinations as a possible family of distortion functions. This family allows fast and efficient calibration and has an appealing economic interpretation.","[Bannoer, Karl F.] Deloitte & Touche GmbH, D-81669 Munich, Germany; [Scherer, Matthias] Tech Univ Munich, D-85748 Garching, Germany",Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited; Technical University of Munich,"Bannör, KF (通讯作者)，Deloitte & Touche GmbH, Rosenheimer Pl 4, D-81669 Munich, Germany.",kbannoer@deloitte.de,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The curved structure arises from the imposition of various restrictions on the model, such as moment restrictions, and plays a fundamental role in econometrics and others branches of data analysis. We establish conditions under which the posterior distribution is approximately normal, which in turn implies various good properties of estimation and inference procedures based on the posterior. In the process, we also revisit and improve upon previous results for the exponential family under increasing dimensions by making use of concentration of measure. We also discuss a variety of applications to high-dimensional versions of classical econometric models, including the multinomial model with moment restrictions, seemingly unrelated regression equations, and single structural equation models. In our analysis, both the parameter dimensions and the number of moments are increasing with the sample size.","[Belloni, Alexandre] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Chernozhukov, Victor] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Duke University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Belloni, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",abn5@duke.edu; vchern@mit.edu,,,National Science Foundation; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),We gratefully acknowledge the research support from a National Science Foundation grant.

As an application, we propose a new class of commodity models with mean-reverting jumps based on subordinate OU processes. Further time changing by the integral of a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process plus a deterministic function of time, we induce stochastic volatility and time inhomogeneity, such as seasonality, in the models. We obtain analytical solutions for commodity futures options in terms of Hermite expansions.

Cross-sectional option prices are first generated using Monte Carlo simulation. Using these simulated options data, risk-neutral densities of the underlying asset are estimated using three different non-parametric methods. The performances of these non-parametric estimation methods are then evaluated by comparing the estimated densities with the theoretical density. Unlike previous comparison studies that use traded options data without knowing the true risk-neutral densities, this study uses simulated option data with known data-generating processes and their corresponding risk-neutral densities, hence giving a real evaluation of the non-parametric estimation methods. This study finds that the kernel regression method yields the best performance, followed by the spline interpolation method and the neural network models.","Euromed Management, Domaine Luminy, F-13288 Marseille 9, France",,"Lai, WN (通讯作者)，Euromed Management, Domaine Luminy, BP 921, F-13288 Marseille 9, France.",wanni.lai@euromed-management.com,,,,,,,31,4,5,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The way of operation of the IWMS has a great influence on all of the components of sustainability (environmental, social, ecological). To reach the most optimal degree of the operation, the fully comprehensive mapping of the variables affecting the future efficiency of the system, furthermore the analysis of the interconnections between them and the modeling of their interactions is needed. The planning of IWMS is based fundamentally on the technical and economical possibilities and on the legal frameworks. Modeling of the sustainability and operative efficiency of IWMS's is not in the scope of ongoing researches. The complexity of the systems and the large number of its variables requires the application of complex approach to model the outcomes and future processes. This complex methodology should be able to assess the logical framework of the variables and the interconnections between them. The authors of this paper are studying the applicability of the Fuzzy Cognitive Map methodology (FCM) for modeling the future operation of IWMS's. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of Time Series Analysis method (TSA) to support the FCM modeling of IWMS's. Results of the TSA will be used as input data for FCM. The time series development as input data for FCM is a range of historical data consisting of a sequence of the state vector. We determined 33 factors which play determinative roles in the procedure of waste management. The trend of the studied factors was assessed between the values 0 and 1 from the 1970s to the present. The sequences of the state vector was designed based on the concerning legislative and strategic documents and therefore specifies soundly the role of the factors according to changes in legislation, available techniques, social attribute, economic and institutional environment as a time series The Hungarian environmental policy and legal documents were involved in the development of the Time Series. Regulations regarding municipal waste management have its roots in the 1970s. Therefore the TSA of this study covers all of the determinative strategic documents of waste management regulations in Hungary. The scope of the analyzed documents covers all of the significant legal documents, nation-wide policies and strategic plans and documents regarding municipal waste management set up in the mentioned period. The number of the involved documents was about fifty. In order to develop the Time Series for modeling IWMS we applied a new approach, namely the content analysis a methodology for structuring and analyzing written material. It is a set of procedures for transforming nonstructured information into a format that allows analysis. Content analysis is a set of procedures for collecting and organizing this information. One way to begin structuring written material so that it can be analyzed is to summarize and list the major issues that are contained in it. Then the frequency with which these issues occur can be counted. The steps to be followed in content analysis can be summarized as follows: 1. Decide to use content analysis; 2. Determine what material should be included in content analysis; 3. Select units of analysis; 4. Develop coding categories; 5. Code the material; and 6. Analyze and interpret the results. The analysis of the changes in the significance of the 33 factors defined by experts as determinative sub-elements of the IWMS for the FCM methodology from the '70s till nowadays was set as goal of the research. The significance of the factors compared to each other gives information about the weight of the affected topic in the given time period. In this way consequences can be concluded about the determinative factors and drivers of IWMS's. The results of the analysis can be used as input for the FCM method. Defining the significance of the factors was made by document analysis supported by a newly developed software. For each factors fix searching terms were defined. The searching terms corresponded to the character of the analyzed document. The software used for the analysis is still in the developing phase, the first pilot was made through this analysis. The main result of the analysis is the Time Series Significance Diagram (TSSD) of the 33 factors of IWMS's. The TSSD shows the dynamic changes of the strategic aspects in the analyzed period and so conclusions can be made for the future changes. The results of the TSA will be used in the next steps of the research as input data for the FCM modeling.","[Torma, A.; Buruzs, A.] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Gyor, Hungary",University of Istvan Szechenyi,"Torma, A (通讯作者)，Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Egye Tem Ter 1, Gyor, Hungary.",torma@sze.hu; buruzs@sze.hu,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,6,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,532,533,,,,,,2,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600063,0

The emphasis on NOACs aims to provide an overview of their impact on health economics based on the published cost-effectiveness analyses. The available evidence suggests that the balance from the efficacy and safety point of view makes the treatment with the NOACs a cost-effective alternative to warfarin.

As these quantities usually depend on the tail index of the underlying heteroskedastic time series, estimating the tail index becomes an important task. Since the tail index of such a model is determined by a moment equation, one can estimate the underlying tail index by solving the sample moment equation with the unknown parameters being replaced by their quasi-maximum likelihood estimates. To construct a confidence interval for the tail index, one needs to estimate the complicated asymptotic variance of the tail index estimator, however. In this paper the asymptotic normality of the tail index estimator is first derived, and a profile empirical likelihood method to construct a confidence interval for the tail index is then proposed. A simulation study shows that the proposed empirical likelihood method works better than the bootstrap method in terms of coverage accuracy, especially when the process is nearly nonstationary.","[Chan, Ngai Hang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Deyuan] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Peng, Liang] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Zhang, Rongmao] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Fudan University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Zhejiang University,"Zhang, RM (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Dept Math, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",rmzhang@zju.edu.cn,"peng, liang/HKE-0294-2023","Chan, Ngai Hang/0000-0002-4755-5180","HKSAR-RGC-GRF [400306, 400408, 400410]; HKSAR-RGC-CRF [CityU8/CRF/09]; NSA [H98230-10-1-0170]; NSF [DMS-1005336]; NSFC [11171074, 10801118]; Ph.D. Programs Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [200803351094]","HKSAR-RGC-GRF(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); HKSAR-RGC-CRF; NSA(National Security Agency); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ph.D. Programs Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)","We would like to thank the co-editor and two anonymous referees for their careful readings and helpful suggestions.

After showing that the trimmed mean is not a coherent risk measure, we investigate some related asymptotic properties of the structural parameters in credibility.

The main result furnishes a semi-analytical formula for the price of the foreign exchange European call option. The FX options pricing formula is derived using the probabilistic approach, which leads to explicit expressions for conditional characteristic functions. Stylized numerical examples show that the dynamics of interest rates are important for the valuation of foreign exchange options.

We introduce a measure for how far a type space is from having a common prior, which we term prior distance. If a type space has delta prior distance, then for any bet f it cannot be common knowledge that each player expects a positive gain of delta times the sup-norm of f, thus extending no betting results under common priors. Furthermore, as more information is obtained and partitions are refined, the prior distance, and thus the extent of common knowledge disagreement, can only decrease. We derive an upper bound on the number of refinements needed to arrive at a situation in which the knowledge space has a common prior, which depends only on the number of initial partition elements.","[Hellman, Ziv] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Math, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Hellman, Ziv] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Study Rat, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Hellman, Z (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Math, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",ziv.hellman@mail.huji.ac.il,"Hellman, Ziv/HHN-1929-2022",,European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [249159]; Centre for the Study of Rationality at the Hebrew University; European Research Council (ERC) [249159] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); Centre for the Study of Rationality at the Hebrew University; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This research comprises part of the author's Ph.D. thesis conducted under the supervision of Professor Dov Samet of Tel Aviv University and Professor Sergiu Hart of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

This paper gives identification and estimation results for nonseparable models under time-homogeneity conditions that are like time is randomly assigned or time is an instrument. Partial-identification results for average and quantile effects are given for discrete regressors, under static or dynamic conditions, in fully nonparametric and in semiparametric models, with time effects. It is shown that the usual, linear, fixed-effects estimator is not a consistent estimator of the identified average effect, and a consistent estimator is given. A simple estimator of identified quantile treatment effects is given, providing a solution to the important problem of estimating quantile treatment effects from panel data. Bounds for overall effects in static and dynamic models are given. The dynamic bounds provide a partial-identification solution to the important problem of estimating the effect of state dependence in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. The impact of T, the number of time periods, is shown by deriving shrinkage rates for the identified set as T grows. We also consider semiparametric, discrete-choice models and find that semiparametric panel bounds can be much tighter than nonparametric bounds. Computationally convenient methods for semiparametric models are presented.

A new density estimator for the random coefficients is developed, utilizing FourierLaplace series on spheres. This approach offers a clear insight on the identification problem. More importantly, it leads to a closed form estimator formula that yields a simple plug-in procedure requiring no numerical optimization. The new estimator, therefore, is easy to implement in empirical applications, while being flexible about the treatment of unobserved heterogeneity.

Despite its popularity it has some shortcomings, the most immediate of which is the difficulty of calibrating to market prices of options due to the large number of parameters involved. Since the market trades options on the inflation rate or index, we reformulate their model in terms of the notion of breakeven inflation. The first main advantage is the possibility of describing the prices of the most popular inflation derivatives as functions of just three parameters: breakeven volatility, the volatility of the CPI price index and the correlation between them. Secondly, the resulting BlackScholes-implied volatilities are very straightforward to implement and the geometric interpretation of the model makes it intuitive to calibrate. Lastly, the model permits us to reproduce a realistic picture of the current state of the art of the derivatives market and, in particular, due to its simplicity, it is able to estimate the risk premium priced by the inflation market.","[Cipollini, Alessandro] Deutsch Bank AG London, London EC2 N2B, England; [Cipollini, Alessandro; Canty, Paul] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Math & Applicat, I-20136 Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Cipollini, A (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bank AG London, Winchester House,4 Great Winchester St, London EC2 N2B, England.",alessandro.cipollini@db.com,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We concentrate on the existence and computational complexity of strong equilibria (SE), in which no coalition can improve the cost of each of its members. Our main result reveals a connection to the core in coalitional cost sharing games studied in operations research. For set cover and facility location games this results in a tight characterization of the existence of SE using the integrality gap of suitable linear programming formulations. Furthermore, it allows to derive all existing results for SE in network design cost sharing games with arbitrary sharing via a unified approach. In addition, we show that in general there is no efficiency loss, i.e., the strong price of anarchy is always 1.

An award rule is impartial if one's message never influences whether or not one wins the prize. We explore the consequences of impartiality when each agent nominates a single (other) agent for the prize. On the positive side, we construct impartial nomination rules where both the influence of individual messages and the requirements to win the prize are not very different across agents. Partition the agents in two or more districts, each of size at least 3, and call an agent a local winner if he is nominated by a majority of members of his own district; the rule selects a local winner with the largest support from nonlocal winners, or a fixed default agent in case there is no local winner. On the negative side, impartiality implies that ballots cannot be processed anonymously as in plurality voting. Moreover, we cannot simultaneously guarantee that the winner always gets at least one nomination, and that an agent nominated by everyone else always wins.","[Holzman, Ron] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Math, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Moulin, Herve] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Rice University,"Holzman, R (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Math, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",holzman@tx.technion.ac.il; moulin@rice.edu,"Moulin, Herve/F-3475-2015",,MOVE at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona; NSF [CCF 1101202]; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1101202] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,MOVE at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"Stimulating conversations with Anna Bogomolnaia, Salvador Barbera, Geoffroy De Clippel, John Duggan, Marco Mariotti, Xavier Mora, Ariel Procaccia, and Shinji Ohseto have been very helpful.

Classic insurance mechanisms may be inadequate for dealing with such losses because of the dependencies that exist, inter alia, between the sources of the losses, the huge values of claims, and problems with adverse selection and moral hazard. To cope with the dramatic consequences of extreme events, new financial and insurance instruments are required. One example of a catastrophe-linked security is the catastrophe bond (cat bond), also known as the Act-of-God bond. In this paper we price some catastrophe bonds. We apply models of the risk-free spot interest rate under the assumption that the occurrence of the catastrophe is independent of financial market behavior. We then use Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the numerical properties of the pricing formulas thus obtained. We make a twofold contribution to the literature of catastrophe bond pricing. First, we prove a general pricing formula, which can be applied to cat bonds with different payoff functions under the assumption of different models of the risk-free spot interest rate. Second, we price some new types of cat bonds with interest rate dynamics described by the CIR and the Hull-White model. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper theoretically evaluates this hypothesis. I assume that optimists have limited wealth and take on leverage so as to take positions in line with their beliefs. To have a significant effect on asset prices, they need to borrow from traders with pessimistic beliefs using loans collateralized by the asset itself. Since pessimists do not value the collateral as much as optimists do, they are reluctant to lend, which provides an endogenous constraint on optimists' ability to borrow and to influence asset prices. I demonstrate that the tightness of this constraint depends on the nature of belief disagreements. Optimism concerning the probability of downside states has no or little effect on asset prices because these types of optimism are disciplined by this constraint. Instead, optimism concerning the relative probability of upside states could have significant effects on asset prices. This asymmetric disciplining effect is robust to allowing for short selling because pessimists that borrow the asset face a similar endogenous constraint. These results emphasize that what investors disagree about matters for asset prices, to a greater extent than the level of disagreements. When richer contracts are available, relatively complex contracts that resemble some of the recent financial innovations in the mortgage market endogenously emerge to facilitate betting.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Simsek, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",asimsek@fas.harvard.edu,,"Simsek, Alp/0009-0005-9128-3249",,,,,58,96,130,0,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2013,81.0,1,,,,,1,53,,10.3982/ECTA9956,0.0,,,53,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,076FJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313941600001,0

Different from exogenous liabilities that cannot be controlled, the endogenous liabilities can be controlled by various financial instruments and investors' decisions. For example, a company can raise fund by issuing different kinds of bonds. Types and quantities of the bonds are controlled by the company itself. Investors optimize allocation not only for their assets, but also for their liabilities under our model. This makes the analysis of the problem more challenging than in the setting based on exogenous liabilities. In this paper, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the associated Riccati-type equation by using the Khatri-Rao product technique and the relevant stochastic control theory; we then derive closed form expressions of the efficient strategy and the mean-variance efficient frontier by using the Lagrange multiplier method and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation approach, and we next discuss two degenerated cases; finally, we present some numerical examples to illustrate the results obtained in this paper.

Our results apply even when p is much larger than the sample size, n. We show that the IV estimator based on using Lasso or post-Lasso in the first stage is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal when the first stage is approximately sparse, that is, when the conditional expectation of the endogenous variables given the instruments can be well-approximated by a relatively small set of variables whose identities may be unknown. We also show that the estimator is semiparametrically efficient when the structural error is homoscedastic. Notably, our results allow for imperfect model selection, and do not rely upon the unrealistic beta-min conditions that are widely used to establish validity of inference following model selection (see also Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen (2011b)). In simulation experiments, the Lasso-based IV estimator with a data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument robust procedures. In an empirical example dealing with the effect of judicial eminent domain decisions on economic outcomes, the Lasso-based IV estimator outperforms an intuitive benchmark. Optimal instruments are conditional expectations. In developing the IV results, we establish a series of new results for Lasso and post-Lasso estimators of nonparametric conditional expectation functions which are of independent theoretical and practical interest. We construct a modification of Lasso designed to deal with non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic disturbances that uses a data-weighted l1-penalty function. By innovatively using moderate deviation theory for self-normalized sums, we provide convergence rates for the resulting Lasso and post-Lasso estimators that are as sharp as the corresponding rates in the homoscedastic Gaussian case under the condition that logp = o(n1/3). We also provide a data-driven method for choosing the penalty level that must be specified in obtaining Lasso and post-Lasso estimates and establish its asymptotic validity under non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic disturbances.","[Belloni, A.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Chen, D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, IFW E 48 3, D GESS, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Chernozhukov, V.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hansen, C.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Duke University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago,"Belloni, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",abn5@duke.edu; chendan@ethz.ch; vchern@mit.edu; chansen1@chicagobooth.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1061841] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,73,363,468,6,102,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,NOV,2012,80.0,6,,,,,2369,2429,,10.3982/ECTA9626,0.0,,,61,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,044IL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311612700001,0

The bootstrap samples are constructed using the restricted parameter estimates of the underlying vector autoregressive (VAR) model that obtain under the reduced rank null hypothesis. A full asymptotic theory is provided that shows that, unlike the bootstrap procedure in Swensen (2006) where a combination of unrestricted and restricted estimates from the VAR model is used, the resulting bootstrap data are I(1) and satisfy the null co-integration rank, regardless of the true rank. This ensures that the bootstrap LR test is asymptotically correctly sized and that the probability that the bootstrap sequential procedure selects a rank smaller than the true rank converges to zero. Monte Carlo evidence suggests that our bootstrap procedures work very well in practice.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Rahbek, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Taylor, A.

Firms must produce output in advance. After observing aggregate sales in prior periods, firms post prices for their unsold output. In each period, the demand of a new batch of consumers is randomly activated. Existing customers who have not yet bought and then new customers arrive at the market in random order, observe the posted prices, and either purchase at the lowest available price or delay their purchase decision. We construct a sequential equilibrium in which the output produced and its allocation across consumers is efficient. Thus consumers endogenously sort themselves efficiently, with the highest valuations purchasing first. Transaction prices in each period rise continuously, as firms become more optimistic about demand, followed by a market correction. By the last period, prices are market clearing.","[Deneckere, Raymond] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Peck, James] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Deneckere, R (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",rjdeneck@wisc.edu; peck.33@osu.edu,,,,,,,47,32,38,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2012,80.0,3,,,,,1185,1247,,10.3982/ECTA8806,0.0,,,63,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,947WX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304466200008,0

Firstly, it develops a model for risk assessment in a portfolio of life annuities with long term care benefits. These products are usually represented by a Markovian Multi-State model and are affected by both longevity and disability risks. Here, a stochastic projection model is proposed in order to represent the future evolution of mortality and disability transition intensities. Data from the Italian National Institute of Social Security (INPS) and from Human Mortality Database (HMD) are used to estimate the model parameters. Secondly, it investigates the solvency in a portfolio of enhanced pensions. To this aim a risk model based on the portfolio risk reserve is proposed and different rules to calculate solvency capital requirements for life underwriting risk are examined. Such rules are then compared with the standard formula proposed by the Solvency II project. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper sets out to analyse the impact of herding, which may be interpreted as one of the components of uninformed trading, on the volatility of the Spanish stock market. Herding is examined at the intraday level, considered the most reliable sampling frequency for detecting this type of investor behavior, and measured using the Patterson and Sharma (Working Paper, University of Michigan-Dearborn, 2006) herding intensity measure. Different volatility measures (historical, realized and implied) are employed. The results confirm that herding has a direct linear impact on volatility for all of the volatility measures considered, although the corresponding intensity is not always the same. In fact, herding variables seem to be useful in volatility forecasting and therefore in decision making when volatility is considered a key factor.","[Blasco, Natividad; Ferreruela, Sandra] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Accounting & Finance, Zaragoza, Spain; [Corredor, Pilar] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Business Adm, Navarra, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Blasco, N (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Accounting & Finance, Zaragoza, Spain.",nblasco@unizar.es,"Blasco, Natividad/K-5607-2017; Corredor, Pilar/G-7800-2015; Ferreruela, Sandra/K-6524-2017","Blasco, Natividad/0000-0001-5629-7526; Corredor, Pilar/0000-0003-1739-0095; Ferreruela, Sandra/0000-0001-8760-9350","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [SEJ2006-14809-C03-03/ECON, SEJ2006-14809-C03-01]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2009-12819-C03-02, ECO2009-12819-C03-01]; ERDF; Caja de Ahorros de la Inmaculada; Government of Aragon; Government of Navarra",Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); ERDF(European Union (EU)); Caja de Ahorros de la Inmaculada; Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); Government of Navarra,"The authors are grateful to the anonymous referees and editors for their helpful comments and suggestions with respect to the first version of our paper.

(1) In case of the bonus system, surplus is used to increase the guaranteed death and survival benefit, leading to higher reserves; (2) the interest-bearing accumulation increases only the survival benefit by accumulating the surplus on a separate account; and (3) surplus can also be used to shorten the contract term, which results in an earlier payment of the survival benefit and a reduced sum of premium payments. The pool of participating life insurance contracts with death and survival benefit is modeled actuarially with annual premium payments; mortality rates are generated based on an extension of the Lee-Carter (1992) model, and the asset process follows a geometric Brownian motion. In a simulation analysis, we then compare the influence of different asset portfolios and shocks to mortality on the insurer's risk situation and the policyholder's net present value for the three surplus schemes. Our findings demonstrate that, even though the surplus distribution and thus the amount of surplus is calculated the same way, the type of surplus appropriation scheme has a substantial impact on the insurer's risk exposure and the policyholder's net present value.

A number of analyses have been conducted to assess the cost effectiveness of bisphosphonates in patients with bone metastases secondary to breast cancer, but few in other solid tumours. This is a review of cost-effectiveness analyses in patients with non-breast solid tumours and bone metastases. A literature search was conducted to identify cost-effectiveness analyses reporting the cost per QALY gained of bisphosphonates in patients with metastatic bone disease secondary to non-breast solid tumours. Four analyses met inclusion criteria. These included two in prostate cancer (one of which used a global perspective but expressed results in SUS, and the other reported from a multiple country perspective: France, Germany, Portugal and the Netherlands). The remaining analyses were in lung cancer (in the UK, France, Germany, Portugal and the Netherlands), and renal cell carcinoma (in the UK, France and Germany). In each analysis, the cost effectiveness of zoledronic acid versus placebo was analysed. Zoledronic acid was found to be cost effective in all European countries across all three indications but not in the sole global prostate cancer analysis. Across countries and indications, assumptions regarding patient survival, drug cost and baseline utility (i.e. patient utility with metastatic disease but without an SRE) were the most robust drivers of modelled estimates. Assumptions of SRE-related costs were most often the second strongest cost driver. Further review indicated that particular attention should be paid to the inclusion or exclusion of nonsignificant survival benefits, whether health state utilities were elicited from community or patient samples or author assumptions, delineation between symptomatic and asymptomatic SREs, and the methods with which SRE disutility was modelled over time. While the field of cost-effectiveness analysis in solid tumours other than breast cancer is still evolving, outcomes will likely continue to be driven by drug cost and assumptions regarding treatment benefits. Although considerations such as adverse events and administration costs are important, they were not found to influence cost-effectiveness estimates greatly. As zoledronic acid will lose patent protection in 2013 and subsequently be greatly reduced in price, it is likely that the field of cost effectiveness will change with regard to SRE-limiting agents.

A target population is likely to be characterized by various types of heterogeneity and a dynamic evolution over time. It is therefore important to adequately capture these population effects on the results of a model. There are essentially two different approaches in modelling a population over time: a cohort-based approach and a population-based approach. In a cohort-based model, a closed group of individuals who have at least one specific characteristic or experience in common over a defined period of time is run through a state transition process. The cohort is generally composed of a hypothetical number of representative or 'average' individuals (i.e. the target population is considered to be a homogeneous group). The population-based approach projects the evolution of the estimated prevalent target population and intends to reflect as much as possible the demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the prevalent target population relevant for the decision problem. A cohort-based approach is generally used in most published healthcare decision models. However, this choice is rarely discussed by modellers. In this article, we challenge this assumption. To address the underlying decision problem, we affirm it is crucial that modellers consider the characteristics of the target population. Then, they could opt for using the most appropriate approach. Decision makers should also understand the impact on the results of both types of models in order to make informed healthcare decisions.","[Ethgen, Olivier] Univ Liege, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Liege, Belgium; [Ethgen, Olivier; Standaert, Baudouin] GlaxoSmithKline Biol, Dept Hlth Econ, Wavre, Belgium",University of Liege; GlaxoSmithKline,"Ethgen, O (通讯作者)，CHU Sart Tilman B23, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",o.ethgen@ulg.ac.be,,,,,,,41,27,34,0,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,3,,,,,171,181,,10.2165/11593050-000000000-00000,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,911AK,22283692.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301689500001,0

From this, it follows that for the optimality claim for empirical likelihood in Kitamura (2001) to hold, additional assumptions and qualifications are required. Under stronger assumptions than those in Kitamura (2001), we establish the following optimality result: (i) empirical likelihood controls the rate at which the probability of a Type I error tends to zero and (ii) among all procedures for which the probability of a Type I error tends to zero at least as fast, empirical likelihood maximizes the rate at which the probability of a Type II error tends to zero for most alternatives. This result further implies that empirical likelihood maximizes the rate at which the probability of a Type II error tends to zero for all alternatives among a class of tests that satisfy a weaker criterion for their Type I error probabilities.","[Kitamura, Yuichi] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Santos, Andres] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Shaikh, Azeem M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Yale University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Chicago,"Kitamura, Y (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",yuichi.kitamura@yale.edu; a2santos@ucsd.edu; amshaikh@uchicago.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0551271, SES-0851759, DMS-0820310]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0851759] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",We thank J.

From a transferability point of view, the question arises of whether differences between countries regarding lost productivity are the result of using different calculation methods (methodological differences) or of other between-country differences. When lost productivity data differ significantly across countries, the transferability of lost productivity data across countries is hindered. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether country of residence has a significant influence on the quantity of lost productivity among patients with rheumatic disorders. Confounding factors that might differ between countries were corrected for, while the methodology used to identify and measure lost productivity was kept the same. Methods: This question was investigated by means of an online questionnaire filled out by 200 respondents with a rheumatic disorder per country in four European countries, namely the Netherlands, the UK, Germany and France. In addition to those regarding lost productivity, the questionnaire contained questions about patient characteristics, disability insurance, disease characteristics, quality of life and job characteristics as these variables are expected to influence lost productivity in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism. The data were analysed by regression analyses, in which different components - being absent in last 3 months, number of days absent and presenteeism - of lost productivity were the main outcome measures and other variables, such as gender, impact of disease, shift work, job control, partial disability and overall general health, were corrected for. Results: The results showed that country sometimes has a significant influence on lost productivity and that other variables such as, for example, age, disease severity, number of contract hours, decision latitude, experienced health (as reported on the visual analogue scale) and partial disability, also influence lost productivity. A significant influence of country of residence was found on the variables 'being absent in the last three months', 'number of days absent' and 'quality of work on the last working day'. However, country did not influence 'quantity of work on the last working day' and 'overall presenteeism on the last working day'. Conclusion: It can be concluded that country has a significant influence on lost productivity among patients with rheumatic disorders, when corrected for other variables that have an influence on absenteeism and presenteeism. Transferring lost productivity data across countries without adaptation is hindered by the significant differences between countries in this patient group. As a result, transferring lost productivity data, being either monetary values or volumes of productivity losses, between countries can give wrong estimations of the cost effectiveness of treatments.","[Knies, Saskia] Maastricht Univ, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Dept Hlth Serv Res, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Candel, Math J.

Ever since, a wide variety of anticoagulant drugs have become available for clinical use, including low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH), direct thrombin inhibitors and selective factor Xa inhibitors. Objective: The aim of this study was to critically review the available evidence on the cost and incremental cost effectiveness of anticoagulants in patients with ACS. Methods: Studies were identified using specialist databases (UK NHS Economic Evaluation Database [NHS EED] and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis [CEA] Registry), PubMed and the reference lists of recovered articles. Only studies based on randomized controlled trials were considered for inclusion. Finally, 22 studies were included in the review. Results: Enoxaparin is the only LMWH that has been shown to reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction in patients with non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). In economic studies based on the ESSENCE trial conducted in the late 1990s, enoxaparin was consistently associated with a lower risk of coronary events, a reduction in the number of revascularization procedures and a lower cost per patient than UFH. However, these results refer to patients managed conservatively, with little use of thienopyridines and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and the results are difficult to extrapolate to moderate-to-high-risk patients managed with the present day early invasive strategy. Available studies of LMWH in ACS with persistent elevation of ST-segment (STE-ACS) are limited to patients treated with thrombolysis. In this scenario, enoxaparin was shown to be a dominant alternative compared with UFH in a study based on the ASSENT-3 study and was considered an economically attractive alternative in three studies based on the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 study. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the heterogeneity of the supportive randomized trials and the possible underestimation of bleeding costs. The effectiveness and safety of bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, were evaluated in the ACUITY study (NSTE-ACS patients managed invasively) and the HORIZONS-AMI study (STE acute myocardial infarction patients planned for primary percutaneous coronary intervention). Bivalirudin monotherapy was not inferior to heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor and reduced the risk of major bleeding. The economic evaluations based on these studies suggest that bivalirudin is an attractive alternative to heparin plus a glycoprotein-IIb/IIIa inhibitor. In the OASIS-5 trial, compared with enoxaparin, fondaparinux reduced the mortality in patients with NSTE-ACS, probably because of a reduced risk Of bleeding. In three economic evaluations of fondaparinux versus enoxaparin based on this trial, fondaparinux was the dominant strategy in two of them, and still economically attractive in a third. Taken as a whole, the usefulness of economic studies of anticoagulants in patients with ACS is undermined by the quality of the evidence about their effectiveness and safety; the narrow spectrum of the analysed scenarios; the lack of economic evaluations based on systematic reviews; the limitations of sensitivity analyses reported by the available economic evaluations; and their substantial risk of commercial bias. Conclusions: The available studies suggest that enoxaparin is an economically attractive alternative compared with UFH in patients with NSTE-ACS treated conservatively and STE-ACS patients treated with thrombolysis. Bivalirudin in patients with ACS treated invasively is cost effective compared with heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. In patients with NSTE-ACS, fondaparinux is cost effective compared with enoxaparin. The usefulness of these results for decision making in contemporary clinical practice is limited due to problems of internal and external validity.","[Latour-Perez, Jaime; de-Miguel-Balsa, Eva] Hosp Gen Univ Elche, Intens Care Unit, Elche 03203, Spain",,"Latour-Pérez, J (通讯作者)，Hosp Gen Univ Elche, Intens Care Unit, Cami Vell de Almassera 11, Elche 03203, Spain.",jlatour@coma.es,"de-Miguel-Balsa, Eva/B-6422-2018; White, Howard D/A-7034-2009; Latour-Perez, Jaime/A-1038-2012","de-Miguel-Balsa, Eva/0000-0002-2117-7257; Latour-Perez, Jaime/0000-0003-1169-1292",,,,,73,5,5,0,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,4,,,,,303,321,,10.2165/11589290-000000000-00000,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,921PX,22409291.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302490700003,0

We fully characterize a multivariate Levy process with finite-and infinite-activity components in positive and negative jumps. This process generalizes the variance gamma process, featuring a 'stochastic volatility' effect due to Poisson randomized intensities of positive and negative gamma jumps. Linear and nonlinear dependence is introduced, without restrictions on marginal properties, separately on both positive and negative jumps and on both finite-and infinite-activity jumps. Such a new approach provides greater flexibility in calibrating nonlinear dependence than in other comparable Levy models in the literature. The model is very tractable and a straightforward multivariate simulation procedure is available. An empirical analysis shows an almost perfect fit of option prices across a span of moneyness and maturities and a very accurate multivariate fit of stock returns in terms of both linear and nonlinear dependence.

In this paper, non-standard versions of the tests of serial correlation introduced by Andrews and Ploberger (1996, hereafter AP) are proposed for diagnostic checking of ARMA errors. The original AP tests are designed for the case where the observed time series is generated by ARMA(1,1) models under the alternative and use asymptotic critical values computed by AP. The non-standard testing procedure uses AP statistics calculated from residuals and critical values based on asymptotic distribution theory derived under weak assumptions. The motivation for modifying the original AP tests is that they have attractive properties for the case for which they were originally designed: They are consistent against all non-white noise alternatives and have good all-round power against non-seasonal alternatives compared to several widely used tests in the literature, including those of Box and Pierce (1970, hereafter BP) and Ljung and Box (1978, hereafter LB) tests. A further advantage of the AP tests is that there is no need to specify a cutoff lag-length as is necessary for the BP and LB tests. We compare the non-standard AP tests with the non-standard BP and LB tests proposed by Francq et al. (2005), the tests of Hong and Lee (2007), and the tests using standardized residuals proposed by Chen (2008). In Monte Carlo experiments using ARMA models with GARCH (Generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity), EGARCH (Exponential GARCH) and non-MDS (Martingale difference sequence) innovations, the non-standard AP tests generally have better power than the other tests we consider. This suggests that the power advantage of the original AP tests extends to the more general framework considered in this paper.","[Nankervis, John C.] Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Savin, Nathan E.] Univ Iowa, Tippie Coll Business, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Essex; University of Iowa,"Nankervis, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",jcnank@essex.ac.uk; gene-savin@uiowa.edu,"Nankervis, John C/D-2255-2012",,,,,,29,5,6,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1368-4221,,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

High-frequency trading data arrive at random times. By combining stochastic and agent-based approaches, we develop a model for trading time, trading volume, and price changes. We generate intertrade time (time between successive trades) Delta t(i), and the number of shares traded q(Delta t(i)) as two independent but power-law autocorrelated processes, where Delta t(i) is subordinated to q(Delta t(i)), and Delta t(i) is more strongly correlated than q(Delta t(i)). These two power-law autocorrelated processes are responsible for the emergence of strong power-law correlations in (a) the total number of shares traded N(Delta(T)) and (b) the share volume Q Delta(T) calculated as the sum of the number of shares q(i) traded in a fixed time interval Delta(T). We find that even though q(Delta t(i)) is weakly power-law correlated, due to strong power-law correlations in Delta t(i), the (integrated) share volume Q(Delta(T)) Sigma(Delta T)(i=1) q(Delta t(i)) exhibits strong long-range power-law correlations. We propose that intertrade times and bid-ask price changes share the same volatility mechanism, yielding the power-law autocorrelations in absolute values of price change and power-law tails in the distribution of price changes. The model generates the log-linear functional relationship between the average bid-ask spread < S >(Delta T) and the number of trade occurrences N-Delta T, and between < S >(Delta T) and Q(Delta T). We find that both results agree with empirical findings.","[Podobnik, Boris; Wang, Duan; Stanley, H.

Performance analysis and comparison, based on different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and Brier score, evince a predictive power of these models for FX rates at high frequencies. The achieved results also show that the proposed CTBNC is more effective and more efficient than dynamic Bayesian network classifier.

We will show through some numerical examples that our approximation remains quite good even for the long maturity and/or the high volatility cases, which is a desired feature.

We explore the consequences of this observation for three different strands of the literature. The first is for the value premium anomaly, the second for stock valuation and learning about long-run profitability, and the third is for the St. Petersburg paradox. One of the most surprising results is that the CAPM implies a higher rate of return beta for value stocks than growth stocks.

However, in many existing studies on these problems, risks or losses are often assumed to be independent or comonotonic or exchangeable. In this paper, we propose several new notions of dependence to model dependent risks and give their characterizations through the probability measures or distributions of the risks or through the expectations of the transformed risks. These characterizations are related to the properties of arrangement increasing functions and the proposed notions of dependence incorporate many typical dependence structures studied in the literature for optimal allocation problems. We also develop the properties of these dependence structures. We illustrate the applications of these notions in the optimal allocation problems of deductibles and policy limits and in capital reserves problems. These applications extend many existing researches to more general dependent risks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Proportional reinsurance is to hedge the risk of insurance. Interest rate risk and inflation risk are considered.

To make the market complete, zero-coupon bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are included in the market. The financial market consists of cash, zero-coupon bond, TIPS and stock. We employ the stochastic dynamic programming to derive the closed-forms of the optimal reinsurance and investment strategies as well as the optimal utility function under the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility maximization.

The cluster member process is an additive process. Given the past observations of the process we consider expected values of future increments and their mean squared errors, aiming at application in claims reserving problems. Our proposed process can cope with non-homogeneous observations such as the seasonality of claims arrival or the reducing property of payment processes, which are unavailable in the former models where both center and member processes are time homogeneous.

An efficient allocation is undominated if it cannot be improved, in a specific way, by sidepayments changing the allocation or the game. The set of all such allocations is called the undominated set, and we show that it consists of finitely many polytopes with a core-like structure. One of these polytopes is the -center, consisting of all efficient allocations that minimize the sum of the absolute values of the excesses. The excess Pareto optimal set contains the allocations that are Pareto optimal in the set obtained by ordering the sums of the absolute values of the excesses of coalitions and the absolute values of the excesses of their complements. The -center is contained in the excess Pareto optimal set, which in turn is contained in the undominated set. For three-person games all these sets coincide. These three sets also coincide with the core for balanced games and with the anticore for antibalanced games. We study properties of these sets and provide characterizations in terms of balanced collections of coalitions. We also propose a single-valued selection from the excess Pareto optimal set, the min-prenucleolus, which is defined as the prenucleolus of the minimum of a game and its dual.","[Derks, Jean] Maastricht Univ, Dept Knowledge Engn, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Peters, Hans] Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Sudholter, Peter] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark; [Sudholter, Peter] Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE, Odense, Denmark",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark,"Peters, H (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",jean.derks@maastrichtuniversity.nl; h.peters@maastrichtuniversity.nl; psu@sam.sdu.dk,"Sudhölter, Peter/JDV-4959-2023","Derks, Jean/0000-0003-4000-296X; Sudholter, Peter/0000-0002-9928-6672",,,,,20,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The developed procedure allows several combinations of contract properties. For example, the contract returns may include a guaranteed interest rate and a bonus depending on the yield of a total return equity index. Especially, the contract may include an American-style path-dependent surrender option. The underlying asset and interest rate processes are estimated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, and their simulation is based on their posterior predictive distribution, which is, however, adjusted to give risk-neutral dynamics. Financial guarantees and equity-linked components are common in many life insurance products. From the insurance company's viewpoint, this paper provides a realistic and flexible modelling tool for product design and risk analysis. The focus is on a novel application of advanced theoretical and computational methods, which enable us to deal with a fairly realistic valuation framework and to address model and parameter error issues. Our empirical results support the use of elaborated instead of stylized models for asset dynamics in practical applications.","[Luoma, Arto; Puustelli, Anne] Univ Tampere, Sch Informat Sci, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Luoma, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Sch Informat Sci, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland.",arto.luoma@uta.fi,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We stress the distinction between regression and covariance endogeneity parameters. Such parameters have intrinsic interest (because they measure the effect of latent variables, which induce simultaneity) and play a central role in selecting an estimation method (such as ordinary least-squares or instrumental variable methods). We observe that endogeneity parameters might not be identifiable and we give the relevant identification conditions. These conditions entail a simple identification correspondence between regression endogeneity parameters and the usual structural parameters, while the identification of covariance endogeneity parameters typically fails as soon as global identification fails. We develop identification-robust finite-sample tests for joint hypotheses involving structural and regression endogeneity parameters, as well as marginal hypotheses on regression endogeneity parameters. For Gaussian errors, we provide tests and confidence sets based on standard Fisher critical values. For a wide class of parametric non-Gaussian errors (possibly heavy-tailed), we show that exact Monte Carlo procedures can be applied using the statistics considered. As a special case, this result also holds for usual AR-type tests on structural coefficients. For covariance endogeneity parameters, we supply an asymptotic (identification-robust) distributional theory. Tests for partial exogeneity hypotheses (for individual potentially endogenous explanatory variables) are covered as special cases. The proposed tests are applied to two empirical examples: the relation between trade and economic growth, and the widely studied problem of returns to education.","[Tchatoka, Firmin Doko] Univ Tasmania, Sch Econ & Finance, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Dufour, Jean-Marie] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",University of Tasmania; McGill University,"Tchatoka, FD (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Sch Econ & Finance, Private Bag 85, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Firmin.dokotchatoka@utas.edu.au; jean-marie.dufour@mcgill.ca,,,"William Dow Chair in Political Economy (McGill University); Bank of Canada (Research Fellowship); Toulouse School of Economics (Pierre-de-Fermat Chair of Excellence); Universitad Carlos III de Madrid (Banco Santander de Madrid Chair of Excellence), a Konrad-Adenauer Fellowship (Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation, Germany); Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence (program on Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (MITACS)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture (Quebec)","William Dow Chair in Political Economy (McGill University); Bank of Canada (Research Fellowship); Toulouse School of Economics (Pierre-de-Fermat Chair of Excellence); Universitad Carlos III de Madrid (Banco Santander de Madrid Chair of Excellence), a Konrad-Adenauer Fellowship (Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation, Germany); Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence (program on Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (MITACS)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture (Quebec)","The authors are grateful to Professor Elie Tamer, Co-Editor of the Econometrics Journal, and to two anonymous referees for constructive comments and suggestions.

The efficiency of the new proposed estimators is favourably compared with that of the classical Garman-Klass and Parkinson estimators.","[Saichev, A.; Sornette, D.; Filimonov, V.] ETH, Dept Management, Zurich, Switzerland; [Saichev, A.] NI Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Dept Math, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia; [Sornette, D.] Swiss Finance Inst, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Corsi, F.] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, I-56126 Pisa, Italy",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod; University of Geneva; Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,"Sornette, D (通讯作者)，ETH, Dept Management, Zurich, Switzerland.",dsornette@ethz.ch,"Corsi, Fulvio/JPL-0067-2023","Corsi, Fulvio/0000-0003-2683-4479",,,,,21,1,1,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Market volatility, especially in association with crisis development, may then spill quickly across different markets. This paper considers that volatility spillovers might propagate differently from market to market with respect to positive or negative shocks. We combine the recent advances to capture such asymmetric volatility spillovers. Specifically, we extend the computation of the Diebold Yilmaz spillover index by allowing for negative and positive changes in returns to be considered separately. As a result, by using negative realized semivariance (RS-)and positive realized semivariance (RS+) we devise a methodology which explains the transmission of downside and upside risk among markets. The intra-market analysis of 30 U.S. stocks during 2004-2011 uncovers asymmetries between negative and positive volatility spillovers before, during, and after the financial crisis. Specifically, we show that volatility due to negative returns leads to larger spillovers than that from positive returns, especially during periods of increased uncertainty, while the opposite is evidenced especially during periods of economic growth. In addition, we study the transmission mechanism among the industries and find interesting differences. Positive volatility tends to transmit with larger magnitude than the negative one for some industries, and asymmetric effects are generally much larger. This leads us to the conclusion, that aggregating the spillovers smooths the asymmetric effects in risk transmission mechanism. Aggregated downside and upside systemic risk transmits in a comparable way, but the risk on disaggregated industry level is largely asymmetric, and positive/negative risk spills with different magnitudes.","[Barunik, Jozef; Vacha, Lukas] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Barunik, Jozef; Vacha, Lukas] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague 18200, Czech Republic; [Kocenda, Evzen] Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Prague 11121, Czech Republic; [Kocenda, Evzen] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Prague 11121, Czech Republic; [Kocenda, Evzen] Anglo Amer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kocenda, Evzen] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Kocenda, Evzen] IOS Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany; [Kocenda, Evzen] Univ Michigan, Sch Business, William Davidson Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kocenda, Evzen] CEPR, London, England",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Anglo-American University; Ifo Institut; Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Baruník, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 21, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",barunik@utia.cas.cz; evzen.kocenda@cerge-ei.cz; vachal@utia.cas.cz,"Kocenda, Evzen/R-9674-2017; Barunik, Jozef/G-7617-2014; Vacha, Lukas/G-6896-2014","Kocenda, Evzen/0000-0003-4110-1169;",,,,,0,0,0,0,5,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,185,185,,,,,,1,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600019,0

The new distribution arises from the generalized Lindley distribution proposed by Zakerzadeh and Dolati (2010). This new distribution that depends on two parameters can be considered as an alternative to the classical beta distribution. It presents the advantage of not including any special function in its formulation. After studying its most important properties, some useful results regarding insurance and inventory management applications are obtained. In particular, in insurance, we suggest a special class of distorted premium principles based on this distribution and we compare it with the well-known power dual premium principle. Since the mean of the new distribution can be normalized to give a simple parameter, this new model is appropriate to be used as a regression model when the response is bounded, being therefore an alternative to the beta regression model recently proposed in the statistical literature.

The proposed method consists of three main steps. First, based on a language for defining events in multidimensional time series, mTESL, we identify a number of types of events in time series that corresponding to either incorrect data or data with interference. Second, each event type is restored utilizing an original method that combines real observations, local forecasted values and historical data. Third, an exponential smoothing procedure is applied globally to eliminate noise interference and other random errors so as to provide good quality source data for future work.","[Zhu, B.; Perez, A.; Valente, J.

We analyze the relationship between a firm's reputation and its investment incentives, and derive implications for reputational dynamics. Reputational incentives depend on the specification of market learning. When consumers learn about quality through perfect good news signals, incentives decrease in reputation and there is a unique work-shirk equilibrium with ergodic dynamics. When learning is through perfect bad news signals, incentives increase in reputation and there is a continuum of shirk-work equilibria with path-dependent dynamics. For a class of imperfect Poisson learning processes and low investment costs, we show that there exists a work-shirk equilibrium with ergodic dynamics. For a subclass of these learning processes, any equilibrium must feature working at all low and intermediate levels of reputation and shirking at the top.","[Board, Simon; Meyer-ter-Vehn, Moritz] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Board, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Bunche Hall Rm 8283, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",sboard@econ.ucla.edu; mtv@econ.ucla.edu,,,"NSF [0922321]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0922321] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank a co-editor and three anonymous referees for their invaluable advice.

This can be realized if the total of assets of the pension fund is not fully allocated to individual saving accounts but part of the assets is allocated to a collective reserve (unallocated fund). High capital returns are then used to feed the collective reserve while poor capital market returns (or even losses) are compensated by withdrawals from the collective reserve. Traditional with-profit (or participation) life insurance contracts are basically designed in this way; however in most cases the smoothing process is quite opaque and leaves room for opportunistic management decisions. We introduce a continuous time model to discuss two questions: firstly, what kind of benefit do pension savers draw from a return smoothing mechanism and secondly, how should the smoothing mechanism be steered in order to maximize the benefit for the savers. We will derive limit distributions for the smoothed return process and discuss the risk return profile of smoothed pension schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Though many parametric models have been used in the actuarial literature, these difficulties call for more flexible models for actuarial applications. In this paper, we propose a new class of gamma kernel density estimators (GKDEs) based on the gamma density. We prove that the density of the proposed model converges to that of any loss random variable which is non-negative and continuous, and establish its rate of convergence, under some technical conditions. The proposed model has several advantages over the existing gamma kernel class by Chen (2000) in that it is a valid density for any finite sample and has standard distributional quantities, such as the moments, the conditional tail moments, and the compound distribution with GKDE claim amounts, in analytic form. The model is also a competing model of the Erlang mixture by Lee and Lin (2010) in its flexibility, but with a straightforward implementation and optimization. As numerical examples, we fit the gamma kernel density estimator to actual insurance data and find that the proposed model gives adequate results compared to the Erlang mixture and the Phase-type models.

Antiplatelet medications as adjunctive therapy for PCI are used routinely, with indications for specific agents or their combinations varying depending on the clinical scenario. While the cost effectiveness of well-established agents has been extensively studied, newer drugs have not been evaluated as thoroughly. In addition, the clinical application of some antiplatelet drugs has recently changed, thus making older studies of cost effectiveness less applicable to the current landscape of clinical practice. This article reviews cost-effectiveness considerations of antiplatelet therapies in the treatment of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing PCI. Aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors including clopidogrel and the newer agents prasugrel and ticagrelor, as well as glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors, are discussed. Overall, the use of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor in patients undergoing PCI improves ischaemic outcomes and appears to be cost effective. The few available studies suggest that the recently approved medications prasugrel and ticagrelor are cost-effective alternatives to clopidogrel. However, no direct comparison between these two newer agents is available. The indications for GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors have changed in the current PCI era, and there is a paucity of cost-effectiveness data for their use in contemporary care.","Christiana Care Hlth Syst, Newark, DE 19713 USA; [Weintraub, William S.; Mandel, Leonid; Weiss, Sandra A.] Christiana Care Hlth Syst, Newark, DE 19713 USA",Christiana Care Health System; Christiana Care Health System,"Weintraub, WS (通讯作者)，Christiana Care Hlth Syst, 4755 Ogletown-Stanton Rd, Newark, DE 19713 USA.",wweintraub@christianacare.org,,,Sanofi-Aventis; AstraZeneca; Lilly; Daiichi-Sankyo,Sanofi-Aventis(Sanofi-Aventis); AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); Lilly(Eli Lilly); Daiichi-Sankyo(Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited),"Dr Weintraub has no present conflicts of interest.

Data on patient preferences are valuable to decision makers in a variety of ways. Preferences for outcomes can be used to inform decision and cost-effectiveness models, while preferences for treatments can inform patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and patient-centered care. This project sought to identify and assess the literature reporting on the treatment preferences of adult patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition to cataloging the preference elicitation methods used, we developed and assessed a novel quality assessment checklist for preference-based studies. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and EconLit databases were searched to identify studies examining patient preferences for medications for type 2 diabetes studies published since inception of each database. The review protocol specified inclusion of studies reporting diabetes-treatment preferences among adults with type 2 diabetes, using a range of preference measurement methods. Studies were excluded if participants were not patients with type 2 diabetes and if treatments were not pharmacological therapies targeting glycemic control, or if no primary preference information was collected. Two investigators independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and articles sequentially to select studies for data abstraction based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data on study country, year, number of respondents, preference elicitation method, number of attributes, subgroup analyses, and funding source were abstracted into standardized tables. A novel checklist (PREFS) was used to assess the data quality and validity across different types of preference studies by assessing the following: purpose of the study; respondent sampling; explanation of preference assessment methods; findings reported for total sample; and significance testing. Each item was scored, and an aggregate score was then calculated (ranging from 0 to 5). Of the 2,100 unique citations, 61 met the inclusion criteria. The studies used conjoint analysis (n = 10), time trade-off (n = 6), standard gamble (n = 2), contingent valuation (n = 1), other stated preference methods (n = 39), and revealed preferences (n = 5). Sample sizes ranged from 27 to 14,033, with an average of 562 respondents, and two-thirds included a subgroup analysis. Most studies were conducted in one country, predominantly the USA (n = 27), UK (n = 14), Canada (n = 10), and Germany (n = 7), while 14 were conducted in multiple (2-18) countries across two or more countries. There was an increase in the annual rate of studies published over time from the time of the first publication in 1985 (p = < 0.01). Most (n = 52) studies were funded by pharmaceutical or device companies, with government, academic, association, and hospital sources also funding studies. One study met all five of the PREFS criteria and 12 met four; yet four studies met none of the criteria. The average was 27. Currently, preferences reviews are limited by the mixed quality in the reporting of studies, the publication bias inherent in the literature, a lack of guidelines to conduct various methods, and the difficulty of synthesizing results from different studies. Our study is also limited by its focus on English language articles. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of the methods used in the broad existing body of research into patient preferences for type 2 diabetes medications and can serve as a primary source of information for decision makers. Future work is necessary to assess the utility of the results of reviews of preference information and to develop best-practice guidelines for the reporting of, and methods of conducting, preference studies and systematic reviews of such studies.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group (ScHARR-TAG) at The University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides details of the manufacturer's initial submission, the ERG's clarification questions and the ERG report submitted to NICE. The decision made by NICE is provided alongside a brief comment on additional results produced from an additional analysis requested by NICE on behalf of the Committee. The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based on upon the manufacturer's submission to NICE. The clinical evidence was derived from three randomized controlled trials of golimumab in the treatment of moderate to severe RA: GO-FORWARD and Kay et al. (DMARD-experienced population) and GO-AFTER (tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha inhibitor-experienced population). The ERG considered that the trials were of reasonable methodological quality and measured a clinically relevant range of outcomes. The trials for golimumab, as well as comparator treatments, were synthesized using mixed-treatment comparison methods for the DMARD-experienced population and an indirect comparison using the Bucher method for the TNF-alpha inhibitor-experienced population. The trials used were appropriate, although no definitive judgement regarding the comparative efficacy of golimumab with other biologics was possible. The manufacturer provided a DMARD-experienced population model and a TNF-alpha inhibitor-experienced population model. The models allowed sequences of treatments to be evaluated for each population, although a fully incremental analysis between the use of golimumab following DMARD failure and the use of golimumab following TNF-alpha inhibitor failure was not possible. Several limitations with the model were identified, and after a request from NICE and suspension of the appraisal, the manufacturer submitted sensitivity analyses with an additional American College of Rheumatology 70 % improvement criteria (ACR70) health state included, using SF-36 data directly from the GO-FORWARD study. The annual rate of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score increase for patients receiving palliative treatment was also changed from 0.09 to 0.06. The further analyses provided highlighted the particular sensitivity of the results to HAQ progression rates and the re-administration frequency for rituximab in the TNF-alpha inhibitor-experienced population. The Appraisal Committee concluded that golimumab should be recommended in combination with methotrexate as an option for patients with severe active RA who have failed on conventional DMARDs, or who have failed on a TNF-alpha inhibitor and are contraindicated to or withdrawn from rituximab.","[Tosh, Jonathan; Archer, Rachel; Davis, Sarah; Stevenson, Matt; Stevens, John W.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Tosh, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",j.tosh@sheffield.ac.uk,"Davis, Sarah E/A-2801-2010","Stevens, John/0000-0002-9867-7209; Tosh, Jonathan/0000-0002-8288-4270; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Davis, Sarah/0000-0002-6609-4287",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme [08/118/01 STA],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (project number 08/118/01 STA) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

Simulation Study on the Impact of Direct Meta-Analysis Methods on Health Economic Outcomes,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BAYESIAN METHODS; INCONSISTENCY; INTERVENTIONS,"Decision-analytic cost-effectiveness (CE) models combine many different parameters like transition probabilities, event probabilities, utilities and costs, which are often obtained after meta-analysis. The method of meta-analysis may affect the CE estimate. Our aim was to perform a simulation study that compares the performance of different methods of meta-analysis, especially with respect to model-based health economic (HE) outcomes. A reference patient population of 50,000 was simulated from which sets of samples were drawn. Each sample drawn represented a clinical trial comparing two fictitious interventions. In several scenarios, the heterogeneity between these trials was varied, by drawing one or more of the trials from predefined subpopulations. Parameter estimates from these trials were combined using frequentist fixed (FFE) and random effects (FRE), and Bayesian fixed (BFE) and random effects (BRE) meta-analysis. The pooled parameter estimates were entered into a probabilistic cost-effectiveness Markov model. The four methods of meta-analysis resulted in different parameter estimates and HE outcomes, which were compared with the true values in the reference population. Performance statistics were: (1) the percentage of repetitions that the confidence interval of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis covers the true value (coverage), (2) the difference between the estimated and true value (bias), (3) the mean absolute value of the bias (MAD) and (4) the percentage of repetitions that result in a statistically significant difference between the two interventions (statistical power). As the differences between methods could be due to chance, we repeated every step of the analysis 1,000 times to study whether differences were systematic. FFE, FRE and BFE lead to different parameter estimates, but, when entered into the model, they do not lead to large differences in the point estimates of the HE outcomes, even in scenarios where we built in heterogeneity. Random effects methods do not necessarily reduce bias when heterogeneity is added to the trials, and may even increase bias in certain situations. BRE tends to overestimate uncertainty reflected in the CE acceptability curve. FFE, FRE and BFE lead to comparable HE outcomes. BRE tends to overestimate uncertainty. Based on this study, we recommend FRE as the preferred method of meta-analysis.","[Vemer, Pepijn; Al, Maiwenn J.; Oppe, Mark; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P. M.

This framework is motivated by the case of an electricity producer who wants to hedge a position on the electricity spot price and can trade commodities which are inputs for his system. This extends the essential results of Bouchard and Nguyen (Math Finance, 2011) to continuous time markets. We introduce the generic concept of conditional sure profit along the idea of the no sure profit condition of Rasonyi (Optimality and risk-modern trends in mathematical finance: the Kabanov Fetschrift, 2009). The condition allows one to provide a closedness property for the set of super-hedgeable claims in a very general financial setting.

This paper shows that there is a strong interdependence in such models between the ambiguity attitude and the preference for the timing of the resolution of uncertainty, as defined by the classic work of Kreps and Porteus (1978). The modeling choices made in the domain of ambiguity aversion influence the set of modeling choices available in the domain of timing attitudes. The main result is that the only model of ambiguity aversion that exhibits indifference to timing is the maxmin expected utility of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989). This paper examines the structure of the timing nonindifference implied by the other commonly used models of ambiguity aversion. This paper also characterizes the indifference to long-run risk, a notion introduced by Duffie and Epstein (1992). The interdependence of ambiguity and timing that this paper identifies is of interest both conceptually and practicallyespecially for economists using these models in applications.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Strzalecki, T (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",tomasz_strzalecki@harvard.edu,,,,,,,80,33,39,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2013,81.0,3,,,,,1039,1074,,10.3982/ECTA9619,0.0,,,36,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,146AZ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319062500005,0

We show that under these more realistic circumstances, optimal CPPI strategies are still superior to optimal option based portfolio insurance (OBPI) strategies. The effects of discrete replication and jumps on optimal strategy parameters and certainty equivalent returns (CER) are examined by simulation and turn out to be minor in typical circumstances.

The construction is based on marked point processes and relies on mutually exciting stochastic intensities as introduced by Hawkes. We associate a counting process with the positive and negative jumps of an asset price. By suitably coupling the stochastic intensities of upward and downward changes of prices for several assets simultaneously, we can reproduce microstructure noise (i.e. strong microscopic mean reversion at the level of seconds to a few minutes) and the Epps effect (i.e. the decorrelation of the increments in microscopic scales) while preserving standard Brownian diffusion behaviour on large scales. More effectively, we obtain analytical closed-form formulae for the mean signature plot and the correlation of two price increments that enable us to track across scales the effect of the mean-reversion up to the diffusive limit of the model. We show that the theoretical results are consistent with empirical fits on futures EuroBund and EuroBobl in several situations.","[Bacry, E.] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, CMAP, UMR 7641, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Delattre, S.] Univ Paris Diderot, F-75013 Paris, France; [Delattre, S.] CNRS, UMR 7599, F-75013 Paris, France; [Hoffmann, M.] ENSAE CREST, F-92245 Malakoff, France; [Hoffmann, M.] CNRS, UMR 8050, F-92245 Malakoff, France; [Muzy, J.

The School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG), which produced a review of the evidence within the manufacturer's submission to NICE. This article describes the manufacturer's submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The main evidence was derived from one randomized controlled trial (RCT) of STEMI patients intended for PPCI, comparing bivalirudin with unfractionated heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs). Bivalirudin was associated with a significant reduction in cardiac mortality at 30 days (p = 0.03) and at 1-year follow-up (p = 0.005), and a significant reduction in major bleeding at 30 days (p < 0.001) and 1 year (p < 0.0001), compared with heparin plus GPI. Stent thrombosis up to 24 hours following PPCI was significantly (p < 0.001) more common with bivalirudin. However, there was no significant treatment effect for stent thrombosis from 1 to 30 days (p = 0.28), or at 1-year follow-up (p = 0.53). There were no significant treatment group differences at 30 days and at 1 year in stroke (p = 0.68 and p = 0.99, respectively), in myocardial infarction [MI] (p = 0.90 and p = 0.22, respectively), or in the need for the revascularization of the target vessel for ischaemia (p = 0.18 and p = 0.12, respectively). There were two decision-analytic models: the base-case scenario used 1-year follow-up data from the RCT; and a sensitivity analysis used 3-year follow-up data. Resource use was primarily drawn from this RCT. Health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL) estimates were drawn from a UK cohort study. Both models evaluated the incremental costs and outcomes of bivalirudin compared with heparin plus GPI for patients with STEMI intended for PPCI. The analysis adopted a UK NETS perspective over a lifetime horizon. Unit costs were based on year 2009-2010 prices. The model adopted a decision-tree structure to reflect initial events for the initial period (stroke, repeat MI, minor/major bleeding events, repeat revascularization and death) and a two-state Markov component to simulate longer-term survival. The economic analysis suggested that bivalirudin is expected to dominate the heparin plus GPI strategy. This finding was consistent across the probabilistic sensitivity analysis and the vast majority of deterministic sensitivity analyses undertaken. Three exceptions to this finding were observed for the following sensitivity analyses: (1) the exclusive use of eptifibatide as the GPI (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = 1,764); pound (2) the combination of 100 % eptifibatide use, 100 % radial arterial access and no differential length between strategies for initial hospital stay (ICER = 4,106); pound and (3) a longer length of ward stay (increase of 0.33 days) for the initial hospitalization (ICER = 415) pound. The Appraisal Committee (AC) gave a positive recommendation for bivalirudin for the treatment of adults with STEMI undergoing PPCI.","[Simpson, E.

In this article, we present a calibration method that is based on matching mortality rate sensitivities. Specifically, we introduce a measure called key q-duration, which allows us to estimate the price sensitivity of a life-contingent liability to each portion of the underlying mortality curve. Given this measure, one can easily construct a longevity hedge with a small number of q-forward contracts. We further propose an extension for hedging the longevity risk associated with multiple birth cohorts, and another extension for accommodating population basis risk.","[Li, Johnny Siu-Hang; Luo, Ancheng] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Li, JSH (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",shli@uwaterloo.ca; a2luo@uwaterloo.ca,,,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This work is supported by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

We investigate the NSPKs and NSPNs and their relations to the positive prekernel and to the positive core. It turns out that any NSPK is a subsolution of the positive prekernel. Moreover, we show that an arbitrary NSPK, when applied to a TU game, intersects the set of preimputations whose dissatisfactions coincide with the dissatisfactions of an arbitrary element of any other NSPK applied to this game. This result also provides a new proof of sufficiency of the characterizing conditions for NSPKs introduced by Orshan (Non-symmetric prekernels, discussion paper 60. Center for Rationality, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1994). Any NSPN belongs to its NSPK. Several classes of NSPNs are presented, all of them being subsolutions of the positive core. We show that any NSPN is a subsolution of the positive core provided that it satisfies the equal treatment property on an infinite subset of the universe of potential players. Moreover, we prove that, for any game whose prenucleolus is in its anticore, any NSPN coincides with the prenucleolus.","[Sudholter, Peter] Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Orshan, Guni] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Orshan, Guni] Open Univ Israel, Dept Math, IL-43107 Raanana, Israel",University of Southern Denmark; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Open University Israel,"Sudhölter, P (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",orshan@agri.huji.ac.il; psu@sam.sdu.dk,"Sudhölter, Peter/JDV-4959-2023","Sudholter, Peter/0000-0002-9928-6672",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2009-11213]; ERDF; Edmund Landau Center for Research in Mathematical Analysis and Related Areas; Center for the Study of Rationality at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); ERDF(European Union (EU)); Edmund Landau Center for Research in Mathematical Analysis and Related Areas; Center for the Study of Rationality at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"We are grateful to the associate editor and two anonymous referees of this journal for their comments that helped to improve the writing of this paper.

Asymptotic normality is obtained because the moments are chosen so that the objective function is uniformly bounded in probability and so that a central limit theorem can be applied. Critical values from the normal distribution can be used irrespective of the treatment of the deterministic terms.

In particular, we derive the optimal consumption rate and focus on the impact of mortality rate uncertainty versus simple lifetime uncertainty - assuming that the actuarial survival curves are initially identical - in the retirement phase where this risk plays a greater role. In addition to deriving and numerically solving the partial differential equation (PDE) for the optimal consumption rate, our main general result is that when the utility preferences are logarithmic the initial consumption rates are identical. But, in a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) framework in which the coefficient of relative risk aversion is greater (smaller) than one, the consumption rate is higher (lower) and a stochastic force of mortality does make a difference. That said, numerical experiments indicate that, even for non-logarithmic preferences, the stochastic mortality effect is relatively minor from the individual's perspective. Our results should be relevant to researchers interested in calibrating the lifecycle model as well as those who provide normative guidance (also known as financial advice) to retirees.

When striving for perfection, a person can desire to keep normatively appealing options feasible even if she persistently fails to use these options later. For instance, she can pay not to go to the gym, as in DellaVigna and Malmendier (2006). By contrast, some perfectionists may avoid normatively important tasks for fear of negative self-evaluation of their performance. This paper models perfectionist behaviors in Gul and Pesendorfer's (2001) menu framework where agents may be tempted to deviate from their long-term normative objectives. In addition to self-control costs, I identify a utility component that reflects emotional costs and benefits of perfectionism.

We extend Zheng's approach to the case of dependent data, particularly to the test of Granger causality in quantile. Combining the results of Zheng (1998) and Fan and Li (1999, Journal of Nonparametric Statistics 10, 245-271), we establish the asymptotic normal distribution of the test statistic under a beta-mixing process. The test is consistent against all fixed alternatives and detects local alternatives approaching the null at proper rates. Simulations are carried out to illustrate the behavior of the test under the null and also the power of the test under plausible alternatives.

In this model, the absence of price manipulation in the sense of Huberman and Stanzl can easily be characterized by means of Bochners theorem. This allows us to study the problem of minimizing the expected liquidation costs of an asset position under constraints on the trading times. We prove that optimal strategies can be characterized as measure-valued solutions of a generalized Fredholm integral equation of the first kind and analyze several explicit examples. We also prove theorems on the existence and nonexistence of optimal strategies. We show in particular that optimal strategies always exist and are nonalternating between buy and sell trades when price impact decays as a convex function of time. This is based on and extends a recent result by Alfonsi, Schied, and Slynko on the nonexistence of transaction-triggered price manipulation.

This article employs a well known and powerful maximum-entropy method (MEM) to extend results of Payandeh Najafabadi (2010) to a class of linear credibility, whenever claim sizes have been distributed according to the logconcave distributions. Namely, (i) it employs the maximum-entropy method to approximate an appropriate Bayes' estimator (with respect to either the square-error or the Linex loss functions and general increasing and bounded prior distribution) by a linear combination of claim sizes; (ii) it establishes that such an approximation coincides with the exact credibility formula whenever the require conditions for the exact credibility (see below) are held. Some properties of such an approximation are discussed. Application to crop insurance has been given. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Najafabadi, Amir T.

Copulas have become popular to model such dependencies. However, estimation procedures for copulas often lead to large parameter uncertainty when observations are scarce. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method which combines prior information (e.g. from regulators), observations and expert opinion in order to estimate copula parameters and determine the estimation uncertainty. The combination of different sources of information can significantly reduce the parameter uncertainty compared to the use of only one source. The model can also account for uncertainty in the marginal distributions. Furthermore, we describe the methodology for obtaining expert opinion and explain involved psychological effects and popular fallacies.

In Cetin, Jarrow, and Protter, the arbitrage free price of a European option traded in this illiquid market is equal to the classical value. However, the corresponding hedge does not exist and the price is obtained only in L2-approximating sense. Cetin, Soner, and Touzi investigated the super-replication problem using the same supply curve model but under some restrictions on the trading strategies. They showed that the super-replicating cost differs from the Black-Scholes value of the claim, thus proving the existence of liquidity premium. In this paper, we study the super-replication problem in discrete time but with no assumptions on the portfolio process. We recover the same liquidity premium as in the continuous-time limit.

Still, it has been often proposed in the literature to combine these two approaches by suggesting to hedge a pure financial payoff computed by taking the mean under the historical/objective probability measure on the part of the risk that can be diversified. Not surprisingly, simple examples show that this approach is typically inconsistent for risk adverse agents. We show that it can nevertheless be recovered asymptotically if we consider a sequence of agents whose absolute risk aversions go to zero and if the number of sold claims goes to infinity simultaneously. This follows from a general convergence result on utility indifference prices which is valid for both complete and incomplete financial markets. In particular, if the underlying financial market is complete, the limit price corresponds to the hedging cost of the mean payoff. If the financial market is incomplete but the agents behave asymptotically as exponential utility maximizers with vanishing risk aversion, we show that the utility indifference price converges to the expectation of the discounted payoff under the minimal entropy martingale measure.","[Bouchard, Bruno; Elie, Romuald; Moreau, Ludovic] Univ Paris 09, CREST, CEREMADE, CNRS,UMR 7534, Paris 16, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bouchard, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, CREST, CEREMADE, CNRS,UMR 7534, Paris 16, France.",bouchard@ceremade.dauphine.fr; elie@ceremade.dauphine.fr; moreau@ceremade.dauphine.fr,,,,,,,19,5,5,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

Onset and offset phases of volatility are computed by means of the hierarchical factor segmentation (HFS) algorithm based on high-frequency data. Through these computed volatility phases we search for dynamic patterns by resolving two questions: Is a return's volatility closely associated with significant price changes?, and can we derive an early prediction of the sign of the price change at the offset? Can volatility phases reveal which dimension-return, volume or trading number-is the driving force behind the others? Some computed new features of stock dynamics are counter-intuitive. Almost all significant price changes are marked by volatility within the three dimensions. We develop a data-driven potential-based model to make early predictions of the sign of significant price differences at the end of a volatile period. This model recognizes that when a stock's dynamic enters a volatility state, it typically settles into a subtle imbalance of oscillations between positive and negative returns, and leads to a significant price difference at the offset of volatility. We develop a new statistical analysis to show that a return's volatility onset is more likely to fall behind the onsets of volume and trading number, while the latter two dimensions are very well-correlated with each other. By incorporating this result with behavioral evidence extracted from scatterplots of the logarithm of volume versus the trading number, we postulate that stock dynamics are chiefly driven by a large group of participants, whose collective large-volume trading action is potentially responsible for stimulating volatility in both return and trading number.","[Fushing, Hsieh] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Chen, Shu-Chun; Hwang, Chii-Ruey] Acad Sinica, Inst Math, Taipei, Taiwan",University of California System; University of California Davis; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Fushing, H (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Math Sci Bldg, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",fushing@wald.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,22,8,10,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We first show that, depending on the functional form that we impose in the mean equation, the properties of the model may change and the conditional variance parameter space may be restricted, in contrast to the theory of traditional GARCH processes. Second, we also present a new test for GARCH effects in the GARCH-M context which is simpler to implement than alternative procedures such as in Beg et al. (2001). We propose a new way of dealing with parameters that are not identified by creating composites of parameters that are identified. Third, the finite sample properties of QML estimators are explored in a restricted ARCH-M model and bias and variance approximations are found which show that the larger the volatility of the process the better the variance parameters are estimated. The invariance properties that Lumsdaine (1995) proved for the traditional GARCH are shown not to hold in the GARCH-M. For those researchers who choose not to rely on the first order asymptotic approximation of our proposed test statistic, we also show how our bias expressions can be used to bias correct the QML estimates with a view to improving the finite sample performance of the test. Finally, we show how our new proposed test works in practice in an empirical economic application.","[Iglesias, Emma M.] Univ A Coruna, Dept Appl Econ 2, La Coruna 15071, Spain; [Phillips, Garry D.

While considered a non-life-threatening disease, psoriasis represents a social and financial burden for patients and the healthcare system. Individuals suffer from disfigurement and from social stigmatization. Because the disease is usually persistent, patients with a diagnosis of psoriasis usually need lifelong care, which also means a lifetime of expenses. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive review of the evidence available concerning the social burden and costs of psoriasis. A search for the keywords 'quality of life' (QOL) or 'burden' or 'stigmatization' or 'psychological factors' in PubMed up to January 2010 yielded a total of 817 studies. QOL was affected by psoriasis to a degree comparable with diabetes or cancer. A search for 'cost-of-illness analyses', in the same period, yielded only seven papers satisfying entry criteria. All the studies but one were performed before biologics became available for psoriasis treatment. Direct costs were higher than indirect costs, with hospitalization representing the most significant item. Treatment costs showed wide variations between different studies. Reasons for these discrepancies are manifold including differences in the selection of the sample, as well as in the methods for calculating costs. There is a need to harmonize methodologies. For a final conclusive judgement of the cost effectiveness of innovative therapies such as biological agents, long-term economic consequences have to be evaluated and long-term remission rates and complications considered.","[Raho, Giovanna; Naldi, Luigi] Presidio Osped Matteo Rota, Fdn Ric Osped Maggiore, Ctr Studi GISED, I-24100 Bergamo, Italy; [Koleva, Daniela Mihajlova; Garattini, Livio] CESAV, Ist Mario Negri, Bergamo, Italy",Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS,"Naldi, L (通讯作者)，Presidio Osped Matteo Rota, Fdn Ric Osped Maggiore, Ctr Studi GISED, Via Garibaldi 13-15, I-24100 Bergamo, Italy.",luigi.naldi@gised.it,"Naldi, Luigi/AFM-8982-2022","Naldi, Luigi/0000-0002-3160-2835",,,,,37,58,59,0,17,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,11,,,,,1005,1013,,10.2165/11591580-000000000-00000,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,029JK,22994598.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310491300003,0

Different quantitative models can be set up to determine the optimal index replicating portfolio. In this paper, we propose an alternative based on imposing a constraint on the q-norm (0 < q < 1) of the replicating portfolios' asset weights: the q-norm constraint regularises the problem and identifies a sparse model. Both approaches are challenging from an optimization viewpoint due to either the presence of the cardinality constraint or a non-convex constraint on the q-norm. The problem can become even more complex when non-convex distance measures or other real-world constraints are considered. We employ a hybrid heuristic as a flexible tool to tackle both optimization problems. The empirical analysis of real-world financial data allows us to compare the two index tracking approaches. Moreover, we propose a strategy to determine the optimal number of constituents and the corresponding optimal portfolio asset weights.","[Fastrich, Bjoern; Winker, Peter] Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, D-35394 Giessen, Germany; [Paterlini, Sandra] Univ Modena & Reggio E, Dept Econ, CEFIN & RECent, Modena, Italy; [Winker, Peter] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Winker, P (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.",peter.winker@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,"Paterlini, Sandra/JZE-4432-2024; Paterlini, Sandra/B-3770-2016","Paterlini, Sandra/0000-0003-4269-4496",,,,,26,37,42,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

To systematically review the published literature and to identify studies evaluating the cost effectiveness of different treatments for patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) ACS. A literature search was performed using PubMed and the Cochrane Library until October 2013, with no limit on publication date. The search was conducted using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, limiting articles to those published in the English language and those reporting results of economic evaluations [i.e. cost-effectiveness (CEA), cost-utility (CUA) cost-minimisation (CMA) cost-consequence (CCA) and cost-benefit (CBA) analyses] of the different treatment therapies used for managing patients presenting with NSTE-ACS. Publications such as editorials, letters to the editor, posters, expert opinions, reviews, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses were excluded. All studies included were assessed for their methodological quality using the British Medical Journal checklist. A total of 39 studies were included, presenting a wide variation in terms of methodological approaches and settings, thus resulting in different ranges of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each treatment evaluated. Evidence from the present systematic review suggests that the majority of the available treatments represent either cost-saving or cost-effective options for NSTE-ACS patients. Moreover, the cost effectiveness of the available treatments was found to be dependent on various factors, particularly the risk profile of patients and the cost of treatment, and hence there is a need to take these into consideration when making decisions and choices.","[Gialama, Fotini; Miloni, Evangelia; Maniadakis, Nikos] Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Org & Management, Athens 11521, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Maniadakis, N (通讯作者)，Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Org & Management, 196 Alexandras Ave, Athens 11521, Greece.",nmaniadakis@esdy.edu.gr,"Maniadakis, Nikos/AAZ-6794-2021",,,,,,60,1,1,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2014,32.0,11,,,,,1063,1078,,10.1007/s40273-014-0191-5,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0LJ,25082388.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344627300005,0

In a recent work, we implemented an asymptotic analysis for H-q[X] with a power Young function for the Frechet, Weibull and Gumbel cases separately. A key point of the implementation was that h can be explicitly solved for fixed x and q, which gave rise to the possibility to express Hq[X] in terms of x and q. For a general Young function, however, this does not work anymore and the problem becomes a lot harder. In the present paper, we extend the asymptotic analysis for H-q[X] to the case with a general Young function and we establish a unified approach for the three extreme value cases.

The modelling approaches adopted across these studies were fairly similar, with most models adopting a cohort Markov structure, though one example of a discrete event simulation was identified. While the cohort Markov approach has been acceptable to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the review identifies a number of key uncertainties with these models, including the extrapolation of survival outcomes beyond the period observed by the trial, the effectiveness of second-line therapies, and estimates of health state utility.

In addition, the classical capital allocation framework suggested by Dhaene et al. (2012) is generalized to allow the application of the Value-at-Risk (VaR) measure in combination with a stand-alone proportional allocation criterion (i.e., to accommodate the Haircut allocation principle). Two new proportional capital allocation principles based on GlueVaR risk measures are defined. An example based on insurance claims data is presented, in which allocation solutions with tail-subadditive risk measures are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides an extensive study of how different sets of financial and demographic parameters affect the fair guaranteed fee charged for a GLWB as well as the profit and loss distribution, using tractable equity and stochastic mortality models in a continuous time framework. We demonstrate the significance of parameter risk, model risk, as well as the systematic mortality risk component underlying the guarantee. We quantify how different levels of equity exposure chosen by the policyholder affect the exposure of the guarantee providers to systematic mortality risk. Finally, the effectiveness of a static hedge of systematic mortality risk is examined allowing for different levels of equity exposure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Thanks to risk capital allocation methods and linearity of the loss model, sub-portfolio (or position) contributions can be calculated efficiently. However, factor risk contribution theory in non-linear loss models has received little interest. Our concern is the determination of factor risk contributions to total portfolio risk where portfolio risk is a non-linear function of factor risks.

It is important to assess the psychometric properties of these measures, to ensure that the values obtained by the scoring system are valid for interpretation and utilization by clinicians, researchers and policy makers. Therefore, the objective of this review was to summarize the evidence from published literature on the psychometric properties of generic utility measures in MS. A structured literature search was conducted by using multiple electronic databases. All potentially relevant abstracts and full-text articles were read to identify publications that may be eligible for inclusion in the review. A meta-analysis was conducted to combine correlation coefficient values for convergent validity. The Schmidt-Hunter method, a weighted mean of the correlation coefficient values, was used. Heterogeneity, the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to between-study differences rather than chance, was assessed using the I (2) statistic. The following generic utility measures were identified: the EQ-5D (n = 9)/EQ-5D-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) (n = 1), followed by the Health Utilities Index Mark 3/2 (HUI2/HUI3) (n = 3), the SF-6D (n = 2), the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQOL) (n = 2), and the Quality of Well-Being (QWB) scale (n = 1). Ceiling and floor effects were present for the EQ-5D and the SF-6D, but not for the HUI3. The EQ-5D, the SF-6D and the HUI3 demonstrated excellent reliability. In terms of discriminative ability, the SF-6D and the QWB scale were not able to differentiate between moderately and severely disabled MS patients, and the EQ-5D was not able to differentiate between those who were mildly and moderately disabled. The AQOL and the HUI3, on the other hand, demonstrated good discriminative ability, as both measures were able to differentiate between all levels of disability. As for convergent validity, the HUI2/HUI3 were highly correlated (r = 0.7) against measurement instruments that evaluated impairments such as disease severity, ambulation and manual dexterity. The EQ-5D, SF-6D and the QWB scale demonstrated small to moderate correlations (r = 0.4) against instruments evaluating impairments, and slightly stronger correlations against measures of activity limitations/participation restrictions and health-related quality of life (HRQL) (r = 0.6). To our knowledge this is the first study to review the validity and reliability of generic utility measures in MS. The HUI3 demonstrated the strongest psychometric properties when compared with other utility measures. However, the HUI3 only measures impairment and excludes important components of HRQL such as participation restrictions. The EQ-5D, the SF-6D and the QWB scale, on the other hand, do include items on participation. However, these measures demonstrated a lack of content validity in MS by missing certain domains that were important to the disease, as well as difficulty in differentiating between different levels of disability. The addition of MS-specific 'bolt-ons' to generic utility measures and the development of an MS specific utility measure are possible areas of exploration for future research.","[Kuspinar, Ayse; Mayo, Nancy E.] McGill Univ, Fac Med, Sch Phys & Occupat Therapy, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y5, Canada; [Mayo, Nancy E.] McGill Univ Hlth Ctr, Div Clin Epidemiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; McGill University,"Kuspinar, A (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Fac Med, Sch Phys & Occupat Therapy, 3654 Prom Sir William Osler, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y5, Canada.",ayse.kuspinar@mail.mcgill.ca,"Kuspinar, Ayse/ABC-5857-2021","Kuspinar, Ayse/0000-0002-3886-0407",,,,,55,54,55,0,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2014,32.0,8,,,,,759,773,,10.1007/s40273-014-0167-5,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0KX,24846760.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344626100005,0

The method mixes different copulas with distorted margins to construct new copula functions, and it enables us to model the dependence structure of risks by handling the central and tail parts separately. By applying the method we can modify the tail dependence of a given copula to any desired level measured by tail dependence function and tail dependence coefficients of marginal distributions. As an application, a tight bound for asymptotic Value-at-Risk of order statistics is obtained by using the method. An empirical study shows that copulas constructed by this method fit the empirical data of SPX 500 Index and FTSE 100 Index very well in both central and tail parts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find that stocks with accrued gains have a greater ex-day price drop ratio (PDR) than stocks with accrued losses. We also find a positive relationship between the PDR and the capital gains overhang that has significant explanatory power over the cross-sectional variability of the PDR. Moreover, the capital gains overhang seems to explain part of the time variation of the PDR for a particular stock that can be a winner or loser at different times. We attribute our results to the disposition effect because active (limited) selling by holders of winning (losing) stocks will most likely accelerate (restrain) the downward price adjustment on the ex-dividend day.","[Efthymiou, Vassilis A.; Leledakis, George N.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Leledakis, GN (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Athens, Greece.",gleledak@aueb.gr,"Leledakis, George/C-7614-2015","Leledakis, George/0000-0002-1695-2001",Athens University of Economics and Business Research Center [EP-1682-01],Athens University of Economics and Business Research Center,"The authors thank Hersh Shefrin (Editor) and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

We separate the changes in the composition of the supply of credit from the concurrent changes in the volume of supply and quality, and the volume of demand. We employ a two-stage model that analyzes the granting of loan applications in the first stage and loan outcomes for the applications granted in the second stage, and that controls for both observed and unobserved, time-varying, firm and bank heterogeneity through time*firm and time*bank fixed effects. We find that a lower overnight interest rate induces lowly capitalized banks to grant more loan applications to ex ante risky firms and to commit larger loan volumes with fewer collateral requirements to these firms, yet with a higher ex post likelihood of default. A lower long-term interest rate and other relevant macroeconomic variables have no such effects.","[Jimenez, Gabriel; Saurina, Jesus] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain; [Ongena, Steven] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Peydro, Jose-Luis] ICREA Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Peydro, Jose-Luis] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Peydro, Jose-Luis] Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",Banco de Espana; University of Zurich; Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA; Barcelona School of Economics; City University London,"Jimenez, G (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, POB 28014,Alcala 48, Madrid, Spain.",gabriel.jimenez@bde.es; steven.ongena@bf.uzh.ch; jose.peydro@gmail.com; jsaurina@bde.es,"Peydró, José-Luis/F-3923-2018","Peydró, José-Luis/0000-0002-4542-7353; Ongena, Steven/0000-0002-8381-0062",European Central Bank; Swiss National Bank; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-32434]; ICREA Funding Source: Custom,European Central Bank; Swiss National Bank; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); ICREA(ICREA),"For detailed and constructive comments, we thank the editor, four anonymous referees, Philippe Aghion, Manuel Arellano, Sigbjorn Atle Berg, Sudipto Bhattacharya, Lamont Black, Jose Manuel Campa, Mark Carey, Stephen Cecchetti, Wouter den Haan, Enrica Detragiache, Giovanni Dell'Ariccia, Valeriya Dinger, Gabriele Galati, Paulo Guimaraes, Oliver Hart, Philipp Hartmann, Bengt Holmstrom, Debbie Lucas, Monika Piazzesi, Amit Seru, Andrei Shleifer, Alp Simsek, Frank Smets, Amir Sufi, Jean-Claude Trichet, and participants at the American Finance Association Meetings (San Francisco), the Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition on CreditMarket Turmoil: Causes, Consequences, and Cures (Chicago), CEPR European Summer Symposium in Financial Markets (Gerzensee), the European Central Bank Conference on The Implications of Changes in Banking and Financing on the Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism (Frankfurt), the International Financial Research Forum on Financial Risks (Paris), the International Monetary Fund Conference on Financial Cycles, Liquidity and Securitization (Washington D.

We axiomatize a recursive representation of choice over state contingent infinite horizon consumption problems, where uncertainty about consumption utilities depends on the observable state and the state follows a subjective Markov process. The parameters of the representation are the subjective process that governs the evolution of beliefs over consumption utilities and the discount factor; they are uniquely identified from behavior. We characterize a natural notion of greater preference for flexibility in terms of a dilation of beliefs.

We propose a Two-Stage Bayesian Model Averaging (2SBMA) methodology that extends the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) estimator. By constructing a Two-Stage Unit Information Prior in the endogenous variable model, we are able to efficiently combine established methods for addressing model uncertainty in regression models with the classic technique of 2SLS. To assess the validity of instruments in the 2SBMA context, we develop Bayesian tests of the identification restriction that are based on model averaged posterior predictive p-values. A simulation study showed that 2SBMA has the ability to recover structure in both the instrument and covariate set, and substantially improves the sharpness of resulting coefficient estimates in comparison to 2SLS using the full specification in an automatic fashion. Due to the increased parsimony of the 2SBMA estimate, the Bayesian Sargan test had a power of 50% in detecting a violation of the exogeneity assumption, while the method based on 2SLS using the full specification had negligible power. We apply our approach to the problem of development accounting, and find support not only for institutions, but also for geography and integration as development determinants, once both model uncertainty and endogeneity have been jointly addressed.","[Lenkoski, Alex] Norwegian Comp Ctr, Oslo, Norway; [Eicher, Theo S.] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Raftery, Adrian E.] Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Raftery, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Box 354322, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",raftery@stat.washington.edu,"Raftery, Adrian M/P-2042-2015; Eicher, Theo/HZL-8034-2023",,"DFG [1653]; NIH [R01 HD-54511, R01 GM-084163]; NSF [llS-0534094, ATM-0724721]",DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank David Albouy and Francesco Trebbi for kindly sharing their data as well as Chris Papageorgiou for helpful comments.

The super-replication costs of such event sensitive contingent claims (ESCC), in general, provide little guidance for the pricing of these claims. Instead, we study utility based prices under two scenarios of resolution of uncertainty for event risk: when the event is continuously monitored, or when it is revealed only at the payment date. In both cases, we transform the incomplete market optimal portfolio choice problem of an agent endowed with an ESCC into a complete market problem with a state and possibly path-dependent utility function. For negative exponential utility, we obtain an explicit representation of the utility based prices under both information resolution scenarios and this in turn leads us to a simple characterization of the early resolution premium. For constant relative risk aversion utility functions we propose a simple numerical scheme and study the impact of size of the position, wealth and expected return on these prices.","[Collin-Dufresne, Pierre; Hugonnier, Julien] Quartier UNIL, Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Collin-Dufresne, Pierre; Hugonnier, Julien] Quartier UNIL, Swiss Finance Inst SFI, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Collin-Dufresne, Pierre] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hugonnier, J (通讯作者)，Quartier UNIL, Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",pierre.collin-dufresne@epfl.ch; Julien.Hugonnier@epfl.ch,,"Hugonnier, Julien/0000-0003-1356-5070",,,,,51,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

The first relates to the issue of the appropriate benchmarks for the significance or otherwise of test statistics in a unit root analysis. Currently, critical values are provided for three levels of benchmarks. Using the macroeconomic data set of a developing economy, this study shows that when the highest benchmark is employed in decision making, the associated parsimonious model could be unstable. The second observation centers on the issue of credibility in cointegration analysis. Currently, all variables are entered into a cointegration exercise or, at a higher level of sophistication, only admissible variables; mostly, in both cases, results are analyzed without any serious regard for the signs of the variables. However, related fundamental issues are, when admissible variables bear the a priori signs but are not significant. This study shows using another macroeconomic data set of the developing economy that, the temptation to abandon an error correction parameterization in consequence may signify an invitation to serious model instability.","Univ Ibadan, Dept Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria",University of Ibadan,"Ogun, O (通讯作者)，Univ Ibadan, Dept Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria.",r_ogun@yahoo.com,"Ogun, Oluremi/O-6071-2019; Ogun, Oluremi D./B-1945-2017","Ogun, Oluremi/0000-0002-6367-8324;",,,,,6,0,0,0,1,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,892,903,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600103,0

It is constructed by replacing the constant coefficients of firm-specific predictors in the dynamic ordered probit model (DOPM) of Blume, Lim and MacKinlay (1998) with the smooth functions of macroeconomic variables. Thus, the proposed model allows the effects of firm-specific predictors on credit risk to change with macroeconomic dynamics as investigated by Pesaran, Schuermann, Treutler and Weiner in 2006. The unknown coefficient functions in DOVPM are estimated using a local maximum likelihood method. Real data examples for studying credit ratings are used to illustrate the proposed model. Our empirical results show that macroeconomic dynamics significantly affect the sensitivities of firm-specific predictors on credit ratings, and there are nonlinear relationships between them. Comparing the out-of-sample performance of DOPM and DOVPM using an expanding rolling window approach, our empirical results confirm that the advantages of DOVPM over DOPM are twofold. First, the out-of-sample firm-by-firm rating probabilities predicted by DOVPM are more accurate and robust. Second, the out-of-sample total error rates of the prediction rule based on DOVPM are not only of smaller magnitudes but also of lower volatility. Thus, the proposed DOVPM is a useful alternative for credit rating forecasting.","Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 974, Taiwan",National Dong Hwa University,"Hwang, RC (通讯作者)，Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 974, Taiwan.",rchwang@mail.ndhu.edu.tw,,,"National Science Council, Taiwan, Republic of China","National Science Council, Taiwan, Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The author thanks the reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions, which have greatly improved the presentation of this paper.

Their article was informative. However, it had the limitation that the FRV used to model the life annuity was not a granulated FRV. This followed because the authors assumed that the uncertainty insofar as mortality is entirely due to randomness and that the uncertainty with respect to interest rates is entirely due to fuzziness. The concern is that such a dichotomy may be problematic since, in actuality, the uncertainty of both the mortality parameter and the interest rate parameter can have both random and fuzzy features. The purpose of this article is to address the mortality portion of this dichotomy and, to this end, we model future lifetime as a FRV. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed strategy also considers the effects of portfolio rearrangement costs on growth optimality and recommends a suboptimal portfolio for discrete investment periods. We do not assume any parametric structure for the market process, only a first-order Markov property. The model introduced is based on kernel-based agents' (experts') approximation of the maximum theoretical growth rate with transaction costs. Although the optimal solution is theoretically a complex Bellman programming problem, our suboptimal empirical result appears to be attractive for Dow Jones 30 shares. The paper presents a performance analysis where the return of the empirical log-optimal portfolio is compared with passive portfolio counterparts compiled from similar components using the CAPM, the three-factor model and the four-factor model. The proposed methods, in the presence of transaction costs, provide a significant positive abnormal return compared with the preceding equilibrium models, and is even a survivorship bias-free setup.","[Ormos, Mihaly; Urban, Andras] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Finance, Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Ormos, M (通讯作者)，Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Finance, Muegyet Rkp 9,Bld R 202, Budapest, Hungary.",ormos@finance.bme.hu,"Ormos, Mihály/E-1051-2011","Ormos, Mihaly/0000-0002-3224-7636",New Hungary Development Plan [TAMOP-4.2.1/B-09/1/KMR-2010-0002],New Hungary Development Plan,The authors thank Laszlo Gyorfi for his careful reading of the manuscript and useful advice.

In the first part, we extend the characterization of comonotonicity by Cheung (2010) and show that the sum of two random variables is minimal with respect to the convex order if and only if they are counter-monotonic. Three simple and illuminating proofs are provided. In the second part, we investigate upper comonotonicity by means of the tail convex order. By establishing some useful properties of this relatively new stochastic order, we prove that an upper comonotonic random vector must give rise to the maximal tail convex sum, thereby completing the gap in Nam et al.

The relationship between the tail convex order and risk measures along with conditions under which the additivity of risk measures is sufficient for upper comonotonicity is also explored.

To develop a model to simulate smokers over their lifetimes accounting for multiple quit attempts and relapses which will allow for prediction of the long-term health and economic impact of smoking cessation strategies. A discrete event simulation (DES) that models individuals' life course of smoking behaviours, attempts to quit, and the cumulative impact on health and economic outcomes was developed. Each individual is assigned one of the available strategies used to support each quit attempt; the outcome of each attempt, time to relapses if abstinence is achieved, and time between quit attempts is tracked. Based on each individual's smoking or abstinence patterns, the risk of developing diseases associated with smoking (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke) is determined and the corresponding costs, changes to mortality, and quality of life assigned. Direct costs are assessed from the perspective of a comprehensive US healthcare payer ($US, 2012 values). Quit attempt strategies that can be evaluated in the current simulation include unassisted quit attempts, brief counselling, behavioural modification therapy, nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline, with the selection of strategies and time between quit attempts based on equations derived from survey data. Equations predicting the success of quit attempts as well as the short-term probability of relapse were derived from five varenicline clinical trials. Concordance between the five trials and predictions from the simulation on abstinence at 12 months was high, indicating that the equations predicting success and relapse in the first year following a quit attempt were reliable. Predictions allowing for only a single quit attempt versus unrestricted attempts demonstrate important differences, with the single quit attempt simulation predicting 19 % more smoking-related diseases and 10 % higher costs associated with smoking-related diseases. Differences are most prominent in predictions of the time that individuals abstain from smoking: 13.2 years on average over a lifetime allowing for multiple quit attempts, versus only 1.2 years with single quit attempts. Differences in abstinence time estimates become substantial only 5 years into the simulation. In the multiple quit attempt simulations, younger individuals survived longer, yet had lower lifetime smoking-related disease and total costs, while the opposite was true for those with high levels of nicotine dependence. By allowing for multiple quit attempts over the course of individuals' lives, the simulation can provide more reliable estimates on the health and economic impact of interventions designed to increase abstinence from smoking. Furthermore, the individual nature of the simulation allows for evaluation of outcomes in populations with different baseline profiles. DES provides a framework for comprehensive and appropriate predictions when applied to smoking cessation over smoker lifetimes.","[Getsios, Denis; Revankar, Nikhil; Ward, Alexandra J.; Ishak, K.

We consider dynamic stochastic models with general and heterogeneous bequest tastes and labor productivities. We limit ourselves to simple but realistic linear or two-bracket tax structures to obtain tractable formulas. We show that long-run optimal inheritance tax rates can always be expressed in terms of aggregate earnings and bequest elasticities with respect to tax rates, distributional parameters, and social preferences for redistribution. Those results carry over with tractable modifications to (a) the case with social discounting (instead of steady-state welfare maximization), (b) the case with partly accidental bequests, (c) the standard Barro-Becker dynastic model. The optimal tax rate is positive and quantitatively large if the elasticity of bequests to the tax rate is low, bequest concentration is high, and society cares mostly about those receiving little inheritance. We propose a calibration using micro-data for France and the United States. We find that, for realistic parameters, the optimal inheritance tax rate might be as large as 50%-60%or even higher for top bequests, in line with historical experience.","[Piketty, Thomas] Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France; [Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Saez, Emmanuel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Paris School of Economics; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Piketty, T (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",piketty@pse.ens.fr; saez@econ.berkeley.edu,"MOTREB, ayoub EL/AAB-1710-2019",,"Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; NSF [SES-0850631, SES-1156240]; MacArthur Foundation",Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MacArthur Foundation,"We thank the editor, Tony Atkinson, Alan Auerbach, Peter Diamond, Emmanuel Farhi, Mikhail Golosov, Louis Kaplow, Wojciech Kopczuk, Stefanie Stantcheva, Matt Weinzierl, Ivan Werning, four anonymous referees, and numerous seminar participants for very helpful comments and stimulating discussions.

An affine specification using Levy processes as building blocks leads to analytically tractable pricing formulas for volatility derivatives, such as VIX options, as well as efficient numerical methods for pricing of European options on the underlying asset. The model has the convenient feature of decoupling the vanilla skews from spot/volatility correlations and allowing for different conditional correlations in large and small spot/volatility moves.

We propose sup-Wald tests of the null hypothesis that the process has an autoregressive unit root throughout the sample against the alternative hypothesis that the process alternates between stationary and unit root regimes. We derive the limit distributions of the tests under the null and establish their consistency under the relevant alternatives. We further show that the tests are inconsistent when directed against the incorrect alternative, thereby enabling identification of the nature of persistence in the initial regime. We also propose hybrid testing procedures that allow ruling out of stable stationary processes or ones that are subject to only stationary changes under the null, thereby aiding the researcher in interpreting a rejection as emanating from a switch between a unit root and stationary regime. The computation of the test statistics as well as asymptotic critical values is facilitated by the dynamic programming algorithm proposed in Perron and Qu (2006, Journal of Econometrics 134, 373-399) which allows imposing within- and cross-regime restrictions on the parameters.

However, some popular provisions of GMWB contracts, like the deferred life annuity structure, rollup interest rate guarantees, and surrender options are hard to be evaluated analytically and are rarely addressed in the academic literature. This paper proposes a flexible tree model that can accurately evaluate the values and the fair insurance fees of GMWBs. The flexibility of our tree allows us to faithfully implement the aforementioned provisions without introducing significant numerical pricing errors. The mortality risk can also be easily incorporated into our pricing model. Our numerical results verify the robustness of our tree and demonstrate how the aforementioned provisions and the mortality risk significantly influence the values and the fair insurance fees of GMWBs.

In particular, we derive three Lagrange multiplier (LM) and likelihood ration (LR) tests that restrict our generalized model to obtain (i) the Anselin model, (ii) the Kapoor, Kelejian, and Prucha model, and (iii) the simple random effects model that ignores the spatial correlation in the residuals. For two of these three tests, we obtain closed form solutions and we derive their large sample distributions.

Various observations continue to hold true for this wider class of processes yielding more general results in a transparent way without additional effort. We illustrate this point with an example from risk theory by showing that the ruin probability for a defective risk process can be seen as a triple transform of various quantities of interest on the event of ruin. In particular, this observation is used to identify the triple transform in a simple way when either claims or interarrivals are exponential. We also show how to extend these results to modulated risk processes, where exponential distributions are replaced by phase-type distributions. In addition, we review and streamline some basic exit identities for defective Levy and Markov additive processes. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The ERG produced a review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology contained within the manufacturer's submission to NICE. The ERG also independently modified the manufacturer's decision analytic model to examine the impact of altering some of the key assumptions. The main evidence was derived from a single phase 11 randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma only, in which the licensed dose of trabectedin was compared with a different dose of trabectedin. Additional data were also presented from three uncontrolled phase 11 trials. Supplementary studies were used to represent best supportive care (BSC). The median overall survival (OS) was 13.9 months for the licensed dose of trabectedin in the main randomized controlled trial (RCT) and ranged from 9.2 months to 12.8 months in the other studies included. Supplementary studies supplied by the manufacturer, and assumed to represent BSC, had median OS of 5.9-6.6 months. The progression-free survival (PFS) rates at 6 months for trabectedin were 35.5 % in the main RCT and 24.4-29 % in the other studies included. The PFS rates at 6 months were 8-14 % for BSC. In the manufacturer's original submission to NICE, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of trabectedin compared with BSC was approximately 44,000 per QALY gained. After amendment of errors identified by the ERG, the ICER reported by the manufacturer increased to approximately 61,000. The ERG concluded that, despite clarifications from the manufacturer and the revisions made to the model, there was still considerable uncertainty in the ICER. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) gave a negative initial recommendation, although indicated that trabectedin in aMSTS met the end-of-life criteria. Subsequently, the manufacturer submitted a patient access scheme (PAS) where any cycles beyond the fifth were provided at no cost by the manufacturer.

The MISE is shown to have a convergence rate n-1 for the threshold parameter and a regular n-1/2 rate for the remaining parameters. Moreover, it turns out that the estimates for both parts are asymptotically independent in that their limiting distributions are the same as what they would be if the other part were known.

The key idea is to express the options price as a sum of prices of various compound exchange options, each with different pairs of subordinate multi- or single-asset options. The underlying asset prices are assumed to follow lognormal processes, although our results can be extended to certain other price processes for the underlying. For some multi-asset options a strong condition holds, whereby each compound exchange option is equivalent to a standard single-asset option under a modified measure, and in such cases an almost exact analytic price exists. More generally, approximate analytic prices for multi-asset options are derived using a weak lognormality condition, where the approximation stems from making constant volatility assumptions on the price processes that drive the prices of the subordinate basket options. The analytic formulae for multi-asset option prices, and their Greeks, are defined in a recursive framework. For instance, the option delta is defined in terms of the delta relative to subordinate multi-asset options, and the deltas of these subordinate options with respect to the underlying assets. Simulations test the accuracy of our approximations, given some assumed values for the asset volatilities and correlations. Finally, a calibration algorithm is proposed and illustrated.","[Venkatramanan, Aanand] Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, Henley Business Sch Reading, Reading RG6 6BA, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Venkatramanan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, Henley Business Sch Reading, Reading RG6 6BA, Berks, England.",aanand.venkat@gmail.com,,"Alexander, Carol/0000-0003-1247-0184",,,,,25,17,21,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

This paper adapts the specification test for functional data developed by Bugni, Hall, Horowitz, and Neumann (2009, Econometrics Journal 12, S1-S18) to the presence of missing observations. By using a worst case scenario approach, our method is able to extract the information available in the observed portion of the data while being agnostic about the nature of the missing observations. The presence of missing data implies that our test will not only result in the rejection or lack of rejection of the null hypothesis, but it may also be inconclusive. Under the null hypothesis, our specification test will reject the null hypothesis with a probability that, in the limit, does not exceed the significance level of the test. Moreover, the power of the test converges to one whenever the distribution of the observations conveys that the null hypothesis is false. Monte Carlo evidence shows that the test may produce informative results (either rejection or lack of rejection of the null hypothesis) even under the presence of significant amounts of missing data. The procedure is illustrated by testing whether the Burdett-Mortensen labor market model is the correct framework for wage paths constructed from the National Longitudinal Survery of Youth, 1979 survey.","Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Bugni, FA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",federico.bugni@duke.edu,,,Robert Eisner Memorial Fellowship; Dissertation Year Fellowship,Robert Eisner Memorial Fellowship; Dissertation Year Fellowship,"I am indebted to my advisers, Joel Horowitz, Rosa Matzkin, and Elie Tamer, for their guidance and support.

In some cases, contracts can achieve nothing and so, for example, the hold-up problem may be severe. This paper shows that if the mechanism is designed in such a way that sending a message involves a small cost, then renegotiation essentially does not restrict the set of efficient implementable functions. Given a weak preference-reversal condition, any Pareto-efficient, bounded social choice function can be implemented in subgame-perfect equilibrium in a renegotiation-proof manner, for any strictly positive message cost. The key point is that messages themselves can act as punishments.","[Evans, Robert] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 ITP, England; [Evans, Robert] Univ Cambridge St Johns Coll, Cambridge CB2 ITP, England",University of Cambridge,"Evans, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, St Johns St, Cambridge CB2 ITP, England.",robert.evans@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,21,6,6,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2012,80.0,5,,,,,2089,2104,,10.3982/ECTA8772,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,011RG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309181900008,0

A key feature of the approach is that it may be possible to rank two auctions even if neither dominates the other for all combinations of types.

Roughly speaking, the first-price auction is more profitable than the second-price auction when the strong bidder's distribution is flatter and more disperse than the weak bidder's distribution. Applications include auctions with one-sided externalities. Moreover, contrary to previous work, reserve prices are easily handled.

Such products, usually referred as Alternative Risk Transfer (ART) products include: (re)insurance contracts that bundle several risks under a single policy; multi-trigger products where the payment of benefits depends upon the occurrence of several events; and insurance linked securities that place insurance risks in the capital market. Pricing of these complex products usually requires tailor-made complex valuation methods that combine derivative pricing and actuarial science techniques for each product, as well as strong distributional assumptions on the ART's underlying risk factors. We present here an alternative methodology to compute bounds on the price of ART products when there is limited information on the distribution of the underlying risk factors. In particular, we develop a general optimization-based method that computes upper and lower price bounds for different ART products using market data and possibly expert information about the underlying risk factors. These bounds are useful when the structure of the product is too complex to develop analytical or simulation valuation methods, or when the scarcity of data makes it difficult to make strong distributional assumptions on the risk factors. We illustrate our results by computing bounds on the price of a floating retention insurance contract, and a catastrophe equity put (CatEPut) option. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper introduces a copula regression model to examine the three types of expenses in a longitudinal context. In our method, elliptical copulas are employed to accommodate the between-subject contemporaneous and lag dependencies, as well as the within-subject serial correlations of the three types. Flexible distributions are allowed for the marginals of each type with covariates incorporated in distribution parameters. A model validation procedure based on a t-plot method is proposed for in-sample and out-of-sample validation purposes. The multivariate longitudinal model effectively addresses the typical features of expenses data: the heavy tails, the strong individual effects and the lack of balance. The analysis is performed using property casualty insurance company expenses data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners of years 2001-2006. A unique set of covariates is determined for each type of expenses. We found that underwriting expenses and loss adjustment expenses are complements rather than substitutes. The model is shown to be successful in efficiency classification. Also, a multivariate predictive density is derived to quantify the future values of an insurer's expenses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the bootstrap method or the least squares procedure, the proposed empirical likelihood-based confidence interval is applicable regardless of whether the underlying autoregressive process is stationary, unit root, near-integrated, or even explosive, thereby providing a unified approach for interval estimation of an AR(1) model to encompass all situations.

The classical condition is existence of q >= 2 and q > (d + 1/2)(-1) moments of the innovation sequence. When d is close to -1/2 this moment condition is very strong. Our main result is to show that when d is an element of (-1/2, 0) and under some relatively weak conditions on u(t), the existence of q >= (d + 1/2)(-1) moments is in fact necessary for the FCLT for fractionally integrated processes and that q > (d + 1/2)(-1) moments are necessary for more general fractional processes. Davidson and de Jong (2000, Econometric Theory 16, 643-666) presented a fractional FCLT where only q > 2 finite moments are assumed.

We show that a multivariate Erlang mixture could be an ideal multivariate parametric model for insurance modeling, especially when modeling dependence is a concern. When multivariate losses are governed by a multivariate Erlang mixture, many quantities of interest such as joint density and Laplace transform, moments, and Kendall's tau have a closed form. Further, the class is closed under convolutions and mixtures, which enables us to model aggregate losses in a straightforward way. We also introduce a new concept called quasi-comonotonicity that can be useful to derive an upper bound for individual losses in a multivariate stochastic order and upper bounds for stop-loss premiums of the aggregate loss. Finally, an EM algorithm tailored to multivariate Erlang mixtures is presented and numerical experiments are performed to test the efficiency of the algorithm.","[Lin, X.

By choosing the scenario in Q(alpha) which minimizes net asset value at the end of the time period, we propose the idea of the least solvent likely event (LSLE) as a solution to the forward stress testing problem. By considering the support function of the convex scenario set Q(alpha), we establish theoretical properties of the LSLE when financial risk factors can be assumed to have a linear effect on the net assets of an insurer. In particular, we show that the LSLE may be interpreted as a scenario causing a loss equivalent to the Value-at-Risk (VaR) at confidence level alpha, provided the alpha-quantile is a subadditive risk measure on linear combinations of the risk factors. In this case, we also show that the LSLE has an interpretation as a per-unit allocation of capital to the underlying risk factors when the overall capital is determined according to the VaR. These insights allow us to define alternative scenario sets that relate in similar ways to coherent measures, such as expected shortfall. We also introduce the most likely ruin event (MLRE) as a solution to the problem of reverse stress testing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our aim is to study the dependence between her risk aversion and the distribution of the optimal terminal payoff. Economic intuition suggests that high risk aversion leads to a rather concentrated distribution, whereas lower risk aversion results in a higher average payoff at the expense of a more widespread distribution. Dybvig andWang (J. Econ. Theory, 2011, to appear) find that this idea can indeed be turned into a rigorous mathematical statement in one-period models. More specifically, they show that lower risk aversion leads to a payoff which is larger in terms of second order stochastic dominance. In the present study, we extend their results to (weakly) complete continuous-time models. We also complement an ad-hoc counterexample of Dybvig and Wang, by showing that these results are  fragile, in the sense that they fail in essentially any model, if the latter is perturbed on a set of arbitrarily small probability. On the other hand, we establish that they hold for power investors in models with (conditionally) independent increments.","[Beiglboeck, Mathias; Temme, Johannes] Univ Wien, Fak Math, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Muhle-Karbe, Johannes] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Vienna; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Muhle-Karbe, J (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",mathias.beiglboeck@univie.ac.at; johannes.temme@univie.ac.at; johannes.muhle-karbe@math.ethz.ch,,,"Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P21209, P19456]; National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK); Swiss National Science Foundation; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P19456, P21209] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"The first and third author gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), under grant P21209 resp.

This algorithm improves previous work based on the ellipsoid method and can also be used to compute stable solutions for instances of the stable roommates problem with payments. Second we show that the nucleolus of an n-player matching game with a nonempty core can be computed in O(n(4)) time.

We formulate the problem as a combined stochastic control and optimal stopping problem. As criterion for the optimization we select a loss function that penalizes both the deviance of the running consumption rate from a desired consumption rate and the deviance of the final wealth at the time of annuitization from a desired target. We find closed-form solutions for the problem and show the existence of three possible types of solutions depending on the free parameters of the problem. In numerical applications we find the optimal wealth that triggers annuitization, compare it with the desired target and investigate its dependence on both parameters of the financial market and parameters linked to the risk attitude of the retiree. Simulations of the behaviour of the risky asset seem to show that, under typical situations, optimal annuitization should occur a few years after retirement.","[Vigna, Elena] Univ Turin, Turin, Italy; [Vigna, Elena] Coll Carlo Alberto, CeRP, Turin, Italy; [Hojgaard, Bjarne] Spar Nord Bank, Aalborg, Denmark; [Gerrard, Russell] Cass Business Sch, Fac Actuarial Sci & Stat, London, England",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; City University London,"Vigna, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Turin, Italy.",elena.vigna@econ.unito.it,"Gerrard, Russell/V-6564-2019","Gerrard, Russell/0000-0002-8932-8752",Regione Piemonte,Regione Piemonte(Regione Piemonte),"We thank Emanuele Luca for help with the Perl programming, Massimo Marinacci for support and encouragement and two anonymous referees for useful comments that improved the paper.

Importantly, the model can generate the long memory property in volatility and allow the unconditional variance of time series to be time-varying. These properties cannot be derived from most existing non-parametric or semi-parametric volatility models. We show that the kernel estimate of the model is consistent and its asymptotic distribution is mixed normal. For an empirical application of the model, we study the daily S&P 500 index return volatility using the VIX index as the covariate.

The use of the MGFs as primary prophylaxis to prevent febrile neutropenia (FN) has grown considerably over the past decade and professional guidelines regarding their use have broadened the settings in which these agents are indicated. Recent data also suggest a potential role for them in reducing infection-related and all-cause mortality. The cost and effectiveness of these agents will continue to gain visibility as companies pursue approval for bio-similar agents in the US, similar to their recent approval in Europe. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to review the available pharmaco-economic literature on the MGFs, which is particularly timely in light of the recent passage of healthcare reform and the increasing focus on cost control. The cost of treating cancer in the US is rising faster than the already rapid increase in overall medical expenditure. The clinical utility and cost effectiveness of supportive care measures in oncology must therefore be weighed carefully. This review focuses on the use of different formulations of MGFs for primary and secondary prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Methods: A MEDLINE search was performed to find studies that became available since the prior review of this topic was published in Pharmacoeconomics in 2003. Results: Acceptable cost-minimization estimates for primary prophylaxis with the MGFs in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy have been provided by several studies in the US. Of the commonly used agents in the US, pegfilgrastim appears to be superior to the currently recommended dose and schedule of filgrastim in terms of cost minimization, and primary prophylaxis appears to be less costly than secondary prophylaxis. However, the cost benefits of primary prophylaxis in Europe are not as pronounced as in the US, due to the lower costs of medical care. Data continue to emerge suggesting a decreased risk of early mortality from averted infections as well as the possibility of a disease-specific mortality benefit through maintaining the relative dose intensity of chemotherapy with MGF support. Conclusion: This evidence will prove valuable in assessing the overall cost effectiveness and cost utility of the MGFs in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.","[Lyman, Gary H.] Duke Univ, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Lyman, Gary H.] Duke Canc Inst, Durham, NC 27705 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Lyman, GH (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Med, 2424 Erwin Rd, Durham, NC 27705 USA.",gary.lyman@duke.edu,"Lyman, Gary/K-5227-2019","Lyman, Gary/0000-0002-0823-8086",,,,,75,23,24,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,6,,,,,497,511,,10.2165/11590130-000000000-00000,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,953DK,22540394.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304846900004,0

The underlying microstructure model accommodates the inherent properties of ultra high-frequency data with the assumption of continuous efficient price processes. In this model, microstructure noise and trading times are endogenous but do not only depend on the prices. Using the (observed) last traded prices of the assets, we develop a new approach that enables to approximate the values of the efficient prices at some random times. Based on these approximated values, we build an estimator of the integrated volatility and give its asymptotic theory. We also give a consistent estimator of the integrated covariation when two assets (asynchronous by construction of the model) are observed.","[Rosenbaum, Mathieu] CMAP Ecole Polytech, UMR CNRS 7641, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Robert, Christian Yann] CREST ENSAE Paris Tech, Paris, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Rosenbaum, M (通讯作者)，CMAP Ecole Polytech, UMR CNRS 7641, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",mathieu.rosenbaum@polytechnique.edu,,,,,,,37,26,27,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Medicaid programmes are concerned about carve-outs because the use of non-included services may rise, limiting the efficiencies anticipated with the implementation of managed care. There also exist concerns that patients with serious mental illness may receive reduced care through managed care and consequently have poorer outcomes. Objective: This study examined prescription drug utilization among Medicaid recipients with the implementation of a mental health carve-out plan in Florida. In particular, this study examined short-run changes in the utilization of antipsychotic medications among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or episodic mood disorders with the implementation of Prepaid Mental Health Plans (PMHPs) in Florida Medicaid. Methods: This study used Medicaid data from 38 counties in Florida that implemented the PMHP programme in 2005 and 2006. The sample was limited to individuals aged <= 64 years who were continuously enrolled in Medicaid. Individuals were required to have at least two diagnoses of schizophrenia, episodic mood disorders, delusional disorders or other non-organic disorders (three-digit International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] code of 295-298). Five different outcome measures were examined on a monthly basis for the 6 months pre- and post-PMHP implementation: penetration; adherence; Medicaid expenditures for antipsychotics; polypharmacy (multiple antipsychotic medications); and whether dosing was within guidelines. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate associations between individual and insurance characteristics, and the outcome variables. The analyses were conducted; using SAS procedure GENMOD. Empirical (robust) standard errors were calculated to account for repeated observations on the same individual. Results: There were 153 720 monthly observations for the 12 810 people in the sample. Seventy-four percent of the sample was aged between 21 and 54 years, while 65% were female, 30% White, 14% Black and 44% Hispanic. The large proportion of Hispanics stems from the introduction of the PMHP programme in Dade County (Miami). The results indicate the implementation of the PMHP was associated with increased penetration, but reduced adherence, polypharmacy and expenditures by the Medicaid agency. There was no change in the likelihood of prescriptions being written within recommended dosage ranges. Conclusion: The introduction of the PMHP was associated with short-run changes in medication utilization among individuals with serious mental illness.","[Robst, John] Univ S Florida, Dept Mental Hlth Law & Policy, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Robst, John] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33612 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Robst, J (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Dept Mental Hlth Law & Policy, 13301 Bruce B Downs Blvd, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",jrobst@usf.edu,,"Robst, John/0000-0003-1965-0233",Florida AHCA,Florida AHCA,Funding for this project was provided by the Florida AHCA.

By selectively revealing information, the planner may upset a given self-confirming equilibrium, in order to achieve a preferred outcome for him.

We present a general analytic approach for pricing discretely sampled generalized variance swaps under the stochastic volatility models with simultaneous jumps in the asset price and variance processes. The resulting pricing formula of the gamma swap is in closed form while those of the corridor variance swaps and conditional variance swaps take the form of one-dimensional Fourier integrals. We also verify through analytic calculations the convergence of the asymptotic limit of the pricing formulas of the discretely sampled generalized variance swaps under vanishing sampling interval to the analytic pricing formulas of the continuously sampled counterparts. The proposed methodology can be applied to any affine model and other higher moments swaps as well. We examine the exposure to convexity (volatility of variance) and skew (correlation between the equity returns and variance process) of these discretely sampled generalized variance swaps. We explore the impact on the fair strike prices of these exotic variance swaps with respect to different sets of parameter values, like varying sampling frequencies, jump intensity, and width of the monitoring corridor.","[Zheng, Wendong; Kwok, Yue Kuen] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Kwok, YK (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",maykwok@ust.hk,,"Kwok, Yue Kuen/0000-0002-3474-445X",Hong Kong Research Grants Council [642110],Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council under Project 642110 of the General Research Funds.,,29,58,60,3,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

More recently, the higher order risk preferences of prudence (third-order) and temperance (fourth-order) also have been shown to be quite important. While a majority of the population seems to exhibit both risk aversion and these higher order risk preferences, a significant minority does not. We show how both risk-averse and risk-loving behaviors might be generated by a simple type of basic lottery preference for either (1) combining good outcomes with bad ones, or (2) combining good with good and bad with bad, respectively. We further show that this dichotomy is fairly robust at explaining higher order risk attitudes in the laboratory. In addition to our own experimental evidence, we take a second look at the extant laboratory experiments that measure higher order risk preferences and we find a fair amount of support for this dichotomy. Our own experiment also is the first to look beyond fourth-order risk preferences, and we examine risk attitudes at even higher orders.","[Deck, Cary] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Deck, Cary] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Schlesinger, Harris] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ & Finance, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Deck, C (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, 425 WCOB, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",cdeck@walton.uark.edu; hschlesi@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,38,77,82,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2014,82.0,5,,,,,1913,1943,,10.3982/ECTA11396,0.0,,,31,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AQ6FP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342905900010,0

Given a certain balance sheet structure of financial institutions, a large number of valid matrices of interbank exposures is created by a random generator. Assuming a certain loss given default, domino effects are simulated. The main results are, first, that financial stability depends not only on the completeness and interconnectedness of the network, but also on the distribution of interbank exposures within the system (measured by entropy). Second, looking at random graphs, the sign of the correlation between the degree of equality of the distribution of claims and financial stability depends on the connectivity of the financial system as well as on additional parameters that affect the vulnerability of the system to interbank contagion. Third, the more concentrated the assets are within a money center model, the less stable it is.

Practically all patients with RA require initiation with disease-modifying antirheumatic treatment to retard or stop progression, control disease manifestations and reduce the disease burden. If disease course is monitored with adjustment of medication, lifestyle factors, and exercise, as well as physical activity levels, co-morbidities may be prevented in the course of RA. During the last decade, major progress has been made in treating RA through early identification and treatment of the disease. Many patients still experience premature work disability and co-morbidities.

The regressors can be either I(0) or nearly integrated (NI) processes. We show that this kind of nonlinearity in the regression function can significantly affect the relevance of the instruments. In particular, such instruments become weak when the signal of the regressor is strong, as it is in the NI case. Instruments based on integrable functions of lagged NI regressors display long range dependence and so remain relevant even at long lags, continuing to contribute to variance reduction in IV estimation. However, simulations show that ordinary least square (OLS) is generally superior to IV estimation in terms of mean squared error (MSE), even in the presence of endogeneity. Estimation precision is also reduced when the regressor is nonstationary.","[Kasparis, Ioannis] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Phillips, Peter C.

There remains an important policy question as to whether IVIG used as a first-line treatment is worth the money spent. Thus, the objective of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of adding IVIG to the standard treatment of platelet transfusion and corticosteroids, for the treatment of childhood ITP with life-threatening bleeding in the context of Thailand. A cost-effectiveness analysis using a hybrid model consisting of a decision tree and Markov models was conducted with a societal perspective. The effectiveness and utility parameters were determined by systematic reviews, while costs and mortality parameters were determined using a retrospective electronic hospital database analysis. All costs were presented in 2012 US$. The discount rate of 3 % was applied for both costs and outcomes. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $3,172 per quality-adjusted life-year gained ($/QALY) for the addition of IVIG versus standard treatment alone. The probability of response to corticosteroids was the most influential parameter on ICER. According to the willingness-to-pay of Thailand, of approximately $3,861/QALY, the probability of IVIG being cost effective was 33 %. The addition of IVIG to standard treatment in the treatment of childhood ITP with life-threatening bleeding is possibly a cost-effective intervention in Thailand. However, our findings were highly sensitive. Policy makers may consider our findings as part of the information for their decision making.","[Sruamsiri, Rosarin; Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Naresuan Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Practice, Ctr Pharmaceut Outcomes Res, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Pratoomsoot, Chayanin] Naresuan Univ, Fac Publ Hlth, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Naresuan University; Naresuan University; Monash University; Monash University Sunway; University of Queensland; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Chaiyakunapruk, N (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor, Malaysia.",nathorn.chaiyakunapruk@monash.edu,"Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth/AFR-0151-2022","Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth/0000-0002-6981-1771; Pratoomsoot, Chayanin/0000-0002-1073-5145","National List of Essential Medicine, Thailand; Thailand Research Fund (TRF) through Royal Golden Jubilee PhD program [PHD/0356/2550, PHD/0127/2552]","National List of Essential Medicine, Thailand; Thailand Research Fund (TRF) through Royal Golden Jubilee PhD program(Thailand Research Fund (TRF))","This study was supported by grants from the subcommittees of the National List of Essential Medicine, Thailand and the Thailand Research Fund (TRF) through the Royal Golden Jubilee PhD program (Grant No. PHD/0356/2550 to P.

When someone purchases an asset, his peers may also want to purchase it, both because they learn from his choice (social learning) and because his possession of the asset directly affects others' utility of owning the same asset (social utility). We randomize whether one member of a peer pair who chose to purchase an asset has that choice implemented, thus randomizing his ability to possess the asset. Then, we randomize whether the second member of the pair: (i) receives no information about the first member, or (ii) is informed of the first member's desire to purchase the asset and the result of the randomization that determined possession. This allows us to estimate the effects of learning plus possession, and learning alone, relative to a (no information) control group. We find that both social learning and social utility channels have statistically and economically significant effects on investment decisions. Evidence from a follow-up survey reveals that social learning effects are greatest when the first (second) investor is financially sophisticated (financially unsophisticated); investors report updating their beliefs about asset quality after learning about their peer's revealed preference; and, they report motivations consistent with keeping up with the Joneses when learning about their peer's possession of the asset. These results can help shed light on the mechanisms underlying herding behavior in financial markets and peer effects in consumption and investment decisions.","[Bursztyn, Leonardo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bursztyn, Leonardo; Yuchtman, Noam] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ederer, Florian] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Ferman, Bruno] Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Yuchtman, Noam] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bursztyn, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, 110 Westwood Plaza,C-513, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",bursztyn@ucla.edu; florian.ederer@yale.edu; bruno.ferman@fgv.br; yuchtman@haas.berkeley.edu,"Ederer, Florian/GPG-1283-2022","Ferman, Bruno/0000-0001-7286-5677; Ederer, Florian/0000-0002-3018-7908",Garwood Center for Corporate Innovation; Russell Sage Foundation; UCLA CIBER,Garwood Center for Corporate Innovation; Russell Sage Foundation; UCLA CIBER,"We would like to thank the co-editor and three anonymous referees, Sushil Bikhchandani, Aislinn Bohren, Arun Chandrasekhar, Shawn Cole, Rui de Figueiredo, Fred Finan, Uri Gneezy, Dean Karlan, Navin Kartik, Larry Katz, Peter Koudijs, Kory Kroft, Nicola Lacetera, David Laibson, Edward Leamer, Phil Leslie, Annamaria Lusardi, Kristof Madarasz, Gustavo Manso, Ted Miguel, Kris Mitchener, Adair Morse, Paul Niehaus, Andrew Oswald, Yona Rubinstein, Andrei Shleifer, Ivo Welch, as well as seminar participants at Berkeley, Columbia, FGV-SP, Frankfurt, GWU, HBS, LSE, MIT, Munich, NYU, PUC-Rio, UCLA, UCSD, SEEDEC, Simon Fraser, SITE, Stanford, Vienna, Yale, Yonsei, and Zurich for helpful comments and suggestions.

Thus policy choices today can cast a long shadow over future choices purely through information transmission and absent any formal institutional constraints or real state variables. The model we develop utilizes a recent innovation that represents the policy mapping as the realized path of a Brownian motion.

Most importantly, we exploit the existence of a population threshold, which partly determined a local government's choice of democracy to implement a regression-discontinuity design. The results indicate that direct democracies spend 40-60 percent less on public welfare. Our interpretation is that direct democracy may be more prone to elite capture than representative democracy since the elite's potential to exercise de facto power is likely to be greater in direct democracy after democratization.","[Hinnerich, Bjorn Tyrefors; Pettersson-Lidbom, Per] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Hinnerich, BT (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",bjorn.hinnerich@ne.su.se; pp@ne.su.se,,,Handelsbanken's Research Foundations,Handelsbanken's Research Foundations,"This is a revised and extensively rewritten version of the paper The Policy Consequences of Direct versus Representative Democracy: A Regression Discontinuity Approach.

Although policy makers have tried to address these issues, they have not yet found an effective balance between government regulation and market forces. Our objective was to explore the impact of market competition on pharmaceutical pricing under Chinese government regulation. Data from 11 public tertiary hospitals in three cities in China from 2002 to 2005 were used to explore the effect of generic and therapeutic competition on prices of antibiotics and cardiovascular products. A quasi-hedonic regression model was employed to estimate the impact of competition. The inputs to our model were specific attributes of the products and manufacturers, with the exception of competition variables. Our results suggest that pharmaceutical prices are inversely related to the number of generic and therapeutic competitors, but positively related to the number of therapeutic classes. In addition, the product prices of leading local manufacturers are not only significantly lower than those of global manufacturers, but are also lower than their non-leading counterparts when other product attributes are controlled for. Under the highly price-regulated market in China, competition from generic and therapeutic competitors did decrease pharmaceutical prices. Further research is needed to explore whether this competition increases consumer welfare in China's healthcare setting.","[Wu, Jing] Tianjin Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Xu, Judy] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Gordon] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; 306 Hosp PLA, Dept Pharm, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Peking University,"Wu, J (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",jingwu@tju.edu.cn,,"Wu, Jing/0000-0002-6012-2785",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203155]; Humane Social Science Fund Project of Ministry of Education China [13YJAZH108],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humane Social Science Fund Project of Ministry of Education China(Ministry of Education, China)",This study is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number 71203155) and Humane Social Science Fund Project of Ministry of Education China (Grant Number 13YJAZH108).

Here one wishes to select a handful of entities from a large pool of entities via a process of screening through a hierarchy of sieves. The process is not unlike the percolation of a liquid through a porous medium. The probability model developed here is based on a nested and adaptive Bayesian approach that results in the product of beta-binomial distributions with common parameters. The common parameters happen to be the observed data. I call this the percolated beta-binomial distribution. The model turns out to be a slight generalization of the probabilistic model used in percolation theory. The generalization is a consequence of using a subjectively specified likelihood function to construct a probability model. The notion of using likelihoods for constructing probability models is not a part of the conventional toolkit of applied probabilists. To the best of my knowledge, a use of the product of beta-binomial distributions as a probability model for Bernoulli trials appears to be new.

The plan has the choice of using either a customised hedge or an index hedge, with the degree of hedge effectiveness being closely related to the correlation between the value of the hedge and the value of the pension liability. The key contribution of this paper is to show how correlation and, therefore, hedge effectiveness can be broken down into contributions from a number of distinct types of risk factors. Our decomposition of the correlation indicates that population basis risk has a significant influence on the correlation. But recalibration risk as well as the length of the recalibration window are also important, as is cohort effect uncertainty. Having accounted for recalibration risk, additional parameter uncertainty has only a marginal impact on hedge effectiveness. Finally, the inclusion of Poisson risk only starts to become significant when the smaller population falls below about 10,000 members over age 50. Our case study shows that, at least for medium and large pension plans, longevity risk can be substantially hedged using index hedges as an alternative to customised longevity hedges. As a consequence, when the hedger's population involves more than about 10,000 members over age 50, index longevity hedges (in conjunction with the other components of an ALM strategy) can provide an effective and lower cost alternative to both a full buy-out of pension liabilities or even to a strategy using customised longevity hedges.","[Cairns, Andrew J.

Put differently, players, after making a decision, sometimes face it again without recalling having 'been there before'. Piccione and Rubinstein (Game Econ Behav 20(1):3-24, 1997b) have argued that absentmindedness may lead to time inconsistencies. Specifically, in certain cases, a player's optimal strategy as calculated when called to choose an action (the action stage) deviates from the optimal strategy as calculated in a preceding planning stage, although preferences remain constant and no new information is revealed between the two stages. An alternative approach assumes that the player maximizes expected payoff in the action stage while considering his actions at other decision nodes to be immutable. With this approach, no time inconsistencies arise. The present paper explores this issue from a behavioral point of view. We elicit participants' strategies in an experimental game of absentmindedness, separately for a planning stage and an action stage. We find systematic and robust time inconsistencies under four variations of the experiment and using ten different parameterizations of the game. We conclude that real decisions under absentmindedness without commitment are susceptible to time inconsistencies.","[Levati, M. Vittoria] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Levati, M.

Such situations may emerge when dealing with small populations, such as small countries (possibly previously part of a larger country), a specific geographic area of a (large) country, a life annuity portfolio or a pension fund, or when the investigation is restricted to the oldest ages. The critical issues arising from the volatility of data due to the small sample size (especially at the highest ages) may be made worse by missing records; this is the case, for example, of a small country previously part of a larger country, or a specific geographic area of a country, given that in some periods mortality data could have been collected just at an aggregate level. We suggest to 'replicate' the mortality of the small population by mixing appropriately the mortality data obtained from other populations. We design a two-step procedure. First, we obtain the average mortality of 'neighboring' populations. Three alternative approaches are tested for the assessment of the average mortality; conversely, the identification and the weight of the neighboring populations are obtained through (standard) optimization techniques. Then, following a sort of credibility approach, we mix the original mortality data of the small population with the average mortality of the neighboring populations. In principle, the approach described in the paper could be adopted for any population, whatever is its size, aiming at improving mortality projections through information collected from other groups. Through backtesting, we show that the procedure we suggest is convenient for small populations, but not necessarily for large populations, nor for populations not showing noticeable erratic effects in data. This finding can be explained as follows: while the replication of the original data implies the increase of the size of the sample, it also involves a smoothing of data, with a possible loss of specific information relating to the group referred to. In the case of small populations showing major erratic movements in mortality data, the advantages gained from the larger sample size overcome the disadvantages of the smoothing effect.

All these generalized quantiles share the important property of elicitability, which has received a lot of attention recently since it corresponds to the existence of a natural backtesting methodology. In this paper we investigate the case of M-quantiles as the minimizers of an asymmetric convex loss function, in contrast to Orlicz quantiles that have been considered in Bellini and Rosazza Gianin (2012). We discuss their properties as risk measures and point out the connection with the zero utility premium principle and with shortfall risk measures introduced by Follmer and Schied (2002). In particular, we show that the only M-quantiles that are coherent risk measures are the expectiles, introduced by Newey and Powell (1987) as the minimizers of an asymmetric quadratic loss function. We provide their dual and Kusuoka representations and discuss their relationship with CVaR. We analyze their asymptotic properties for alpha -> 1 and show that for very heavy tailed distributions expectiles are more conservative than the usual quantiles. Finally, we show their robustness in the sense of lipschitzianity with respect to the Wasserstein metric. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The use of the apparatus of continuous stochastic processes actually reduces the problem of fluctuations of the level of a water body to classical problems of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and statistical radio engineering. On the basis of a continuous model describing the fluctuations in the lake level we obtained a quantitative estimate of the effect of the product of level fluctuations and river inflow-outflow on the statistical characteristics in the lake level. In the case of small variability of the inflow-outflow this effect can be neglected, but this is impermissible in those cases when the coefficients of variation of the inflow-outflow are close to unity. The correlation function of lake level fluctuations corresponds (in the simplest case) to the component of the two-dimensional Markov process, but in the case of lags far exceeding the correlation time of inflow-outflow and apparent evaporation we can consider that the level fluctuations are described sufficiently well by a first-order Markov process. The examined model permits finding the characteristics of overshoots of the level and generalizing all statistical characteristics to the case of cross-correlation of the river inflow-outflow and apparent evaporation.

Numerical, analytical and semi-analytical techniques are used in order to solve the nonlinear equations of motion of this complex dynamical system. However, this system may be simplified by removing some of the aforementioned external forces in function of the scientific requirements for the mission, for example, in the case of maintenance of an Earth satellite or space debris catalogue. In this work we present a new approach called hybrid perturbation theory, which may combine a numerical, analytical and semianalytical techniques with statistical time series models [1, 2]. This combination allows for an increase in the accuracy of these integration methods for predicting the position and velocity of any artificial satellite or space debris object, as well as modeling higher-order terms and other external forces not considered in the numerical, analytical or semianalytical theory. The aim of this paper is to develop a Hybrid Orbit Propagator based on an analytical theory in order to model the effect produced by the flattening of the Earth so that this technique can be validated. This Hybrid Orbit Propagator incorporates the analytical integration of the Kepler problem as the integration technique, whereas the forecasting technique is the Additive Holt-Winters.","[San-Martin, Montserrat; San-Juan, Juan Felix; Perez, Ivan] Univ La Rioja, GRUCACI, Logrono 26004, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja,"San-Martín, M (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, GRUCACI, C Luis de Ulloa S-N, Logrono 26004, Spain.",montse.sanmartin@unirioja.es; juanfelix.sanjuan@unirioja.es; ivan.perez@unirioja.es,"Pérez, Iván/L-7939-2014; San-Juan, Juan Félix/L-5640-2014; San-Martín, Montserrat/L-8045-2014","Pérez, Iván/0000-0003-2916-1150; San-Juan, Juan Félix/0000-0003-1897-2361;",,,,,2,0,0,0,2,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,498,498,,,,,,1,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600059,0

A major determinant of systemic risk is the interconnectedness of the international financial market. We propose to analyze interdependencies in the financial market using copulas, in particular using flexible vine copulas, which overcome limitations of the popular elliptical and Archimedean copulas. To investigate contagion effects among financial institutions, we develop methods for stress testing by exploiting the underlying dependence structure. New approaches for Archimedean and, especially, for vine copulas are derived. In a case study of 38 major international institutions, 20 insurers and 18 banks, we then analyze interdependencies of CDS spreads and perform a systemic risk stress test. The specified dependence model and the results from the stress test provide new insights into the interconnectedness of banks and insurers. In particular, the failure of a bank seems to constitute a larger systemic risk than the failure of an insurer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The term structure of interest rates is assumed to be random, as are the streams of assets and liabilities. A new inequality for changes in the portfolio surplus in response to changes in the term structure of interest rates is proven. A comparison with other immunization inequalities shows that it gives better lower bounds for a wide variety of scenarios. The inequality is sharp in the sense that the lower bound is attainable for some interest rate perturbations. Whenever net insurance premiums are considered, it is factorized into a product of two terms: one depending only on the change of interest rates, and the other depending only on the portfolio structure. Hence the second term may be treated as a measure of the interest rate risk. We call it L-2-measure, because it is related to the second order distance between assets and liabilities. Explicit formulas for this measure for portfolios of some life products vs streams of net premiums are given. Applications to the Merton's, Vasicek's and simple log-normal models of interest rate are also provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a methodology review of reports where probability distributions had been elicited from experts to be used in model-based health technology assessments. Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the CRD database were searched from inception to April 2013. Reference lists were checked and citation mapping was also used. Studies describing their approach to the elicitation of probability distributions were included. Data was abstracted on pre-defined aspects of the elicitation technique. Reports were critically appraised on their consideration of the validity, reliability and feasibility of the elicitation exercise. Fourteen articles were included. Across these studies, the most marked features were heterogeneity in elicitation approach and failure to report key aspects of the elicitation method. The most frequently used approaches to elicitation were the histogram technique and the bisection method. Only three papers explicitly considered the validity, reliability and feasibility of the elicitation exercises. Judged by the studies identified in the review, reports of expert elicitation are insufficient in detail and this impacts on the perceived usability of expert-elicited probability distributions. In this context, the wider credibility of elicitation will only be improved by better reporting and greater standardisation of approach.

The surplus process of the insurer is assumed to follow a Brownian motion with drift. The financial market consists of one risk-free asset and one risky asset whose price process satisfies Heston's SV model. By adopting the stochastic dynamic programming approach, closed-form expressions for the optimal strategies and the corresponding value functions are derived. Furthermore, a verification result and some technical conditions for a well-defined value function are provided. Finally, some of the model's economic implications are analyzed by using numerical examples and simulations. We find that ignoring model uncertainty leads to significant utility loss for the AAI. Moreover we propose an alternative model and associated investment strategy which can be considered more adequate under certain finance interpretations, and which leads to significant improvements in our numerical example.

For this purpose, we use a robust measure of moments called L-moments, and their extensions to a multivariate framework. The random matrix theory allows us to extract factors which contain real information from the estimator of the correlation matrix obtained using the L-moments (henceforth the Lcorrelation matrix). An empirical study of the American market shows the coherence of such an approach and highlights the consistency of the Lcorrelation matrix in comparison with the sample correlation matrix. For both estimators of the correlation matrix, it seems that the largest eigenvalue corresponds to the market, and that the other eigenvalues which contain information partition the set of all stocks into distinct sectorial groups. An analysis of the group of stocks shows that the selected stocks obtained from the Lcorrelation matrix outperform those obtained from the sample correlation matrix in terms of the Sharpe ratio, although the sample correlation matrix provides a well-diversified portfolio in terms of volatility in an out-of-sample investment approach.","Univ Paris 01, Finance CES CNRS, F-75647 Paris 13, France",,"Yanou, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Finance CES CNRS, 106 Bd Hop,Off 513, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",ghislain.yanou@malix.univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,38,5,5,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

A literature search was conducted in PubMed to identify published studies of process utility. Articles were included if they were written in the English language and reported empirical measures of process utility that could be incorporated into the QALY calculation; those studies reporting utilities that were not anchored on a scale of 0 representing dead and 1 representing full health were excluded from the review. Fifteen studies published between 1996 and 2012 were included. Studies included respondents from the USA, Australia, Scotland and the UK, Europe and Canada. Eight of the included studies explored process utility associated with treatments; six explored process utility associated with screening procedures or tests; and one was performed in preventative care. A variety of approaches were used to detect and measure process utility: four studies used standard gamble techniques; four studies used time trade-off (TTO); one study used conjoint analysis and one used a combination of conjoint analysis and TTO; one study used SF-36 data; one study used both TTO and EQ-5D; and three studies used wait trade-off techniques. Measures of process utility for different drug delivery methods ranged from 0.02 to 0.27. Utility estimates associated with different dosing strategies ranged from 0.005 to 0.09. Estimates for convenience (able to take on an empty stomach) ranged from 0.001 to 0.028. Estimates of process utility associated with screening and testing procedures ranged from 0.0005 to 0.031. Both of these estimates were obtained for management approaches to cervical cancer screening. The identification of studies through conventional methods was difficult due to the lack of consistent indexing and terminology across studies; however, the evidence does support the existence of process utility in treatment, screening and preventative care settings. There was considerable variation between estimates. The range of methodological approaches used to identify and measure process utility, coupled with the need for further research into, for example, the application of estimates in economic models, means it is difficult to know whether these differences are a true reflection of the amount of process utility that enters into an individual's utility function, or whether they are associated with features of the studies' methodological design. Without further work, and a standardised approach to the methodology for the detection and measurement of process utility, comparisons between estimates are difficult. This literature review supports the existence of process utility and indicates that, despite the need for further research in the area, it could be an important component of an individual's utility function, which should at least be considered, if not incorporated, into cost-utility analyses.","[Brennan, Victoria K.] RTI Hlth Solut, Business & Conf Ctr, Sheffield S1 4DE, S Yorkshire, England; [Dixon, Simon] Univ Sheffield Regent Court, ScHARR, HEDS, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",Research Triangle Institute; University of Sheffield,"Brennan, VK (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, Business & Conf Ctr, Veloc House,3 Solly St, Sheffield S1 4DE, S Yorkshire, England.",vbrennan@rti.org; s.dixon@shef.ac.uk,,"Dixon, Simon/0000-0001-7394-7009",,,,,43,47,48,0,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2013,31.0,8,,,,,677,691,,10.1007/s40273-013-0066-1,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,189EK,23771494.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322249900005,0

Parametric survival analysis methods can be applied to identify an appropriate statistical model for the observed data, which can then be extrapolated to derive a complete time-to-event curve. This paper describes the properties of the most commonly used statistical distributions as a basis for these models and describes an objective process of identifying the most suitable parametric distribution in a given dataset. The approach can be applied with both individual-patient data as well as with survival probabilities derived from published Kaplan-Meier curves.

In the model, fund managers allocate capital conditional on recent performance to a value strategy, a momentum strategy, and a carry strategy. Subsequent estimation results reveal that (1) a large part of the behavior of currency managers can indeed be described by these three simple strategies, and (2) currency managers shift capital from recent winning styles to recent losing styles, and hence apply a negative feedback strategy. We finally show that a negative feedback strategy is indeed optimal, but currency managers could improve performance by applying it less aggressively if they were able to.","[Verschoor, Willem F.

In general, state space models involve a system of equations, whereas MIDAS regressions involve a single equation. As a consequence, MIDAS regressions might be less efficient, but could also be less prone to parameter estimation error and/or specification errors. We examine how MIDAS regressions and Kalman filters match up under ideal circumstances, that is in population, and in cases where all the stochastic processeslow and high frequencyare correctly specified. We characterize cases where the MIDAS regression exactly replicates the steady state Kalman filter weights. We compare MIDAS and Kalman filter forecasts in population where the state space model is misspecified. We also compare MIDAS and Kalman filter forecasts in small samples. The paper concludes with an empirical application. Overall we find that the MIDAS and Kalman filter methods give similar forecasts.

On the other hand, ordinal concavity and ordinal strategic substitutes are sufficient for some uniqueness properties of PS networks. Additionally, we elaborate on the relation of the link externality properties to definitions in the literature.","Univ Bielefeld, Inst Math Econ, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld,"Hellmann, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Inst Math Econ, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",thellmann@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,"Hellmann, Tim/M-3913-2018","Hellmann, Tim/0000-0001-6168-2533",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The author owes gratitude to Berno Buchel, Herbert Dawid, John Quah, Frank Riedel, Walter Trockel, and audiences from various conferences for valuable comments, ideas, and discussions, and acknowledge financial support by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

Our formulation of the nonlinear pricing game encompasses various specifications of informed and liquidity trading, including the case in which nature chooses whether the market-order trader is informed or a liquidity trader.

We formalize the problem in terms of minimization of relative entropy with respect to the prior under calibration constraints and use convex duality methods to solve the problem: the dual problem is shown to be an intensity control problem, characterized in terms of a HamiltonJacobi system of differential equations, for which we present an analytical solution. Given a set of observed CDO tranche spreads, our method allows to construct a default intensity process which leads to tranche spreads consistent with the observations. We illustrate our method on ITRAXX index data: our results reveal strong evidence for the dependence of loss transitions rates on the previous number of defaults, and offer quantitative evidence for contagion effects in the (risk-neutral) loss process.","[Cont, Rama] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Cont, Rama; Minca, Andreea] Univ Paris 06, Lab Probabil & Modeles Aleatoires, CNRS, F-75252 Paris, France",Columbia University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite,"Cont, R (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 06, Lab Probabil & Modeles Aleatoires, CNRS, 12 Rue Cuvier, F-75252 Paris, France.",Rama.Cont@Columbia.edu,,"CONT, Rama/0000-0003-1164-6053; MINCA, Andreea/0000-0002-2216-9793",Finance Concepts,Finance Concepts,"We thank Marco Avellaneda, Damiano Brigo, Bruno Dupire, YuHang Kan, Johannes Ruf, Kay Giesecke, and Igor Halperin and participants at the Workshop on PDEs in finance (Stockholm, Aug 2007), the Stanford Financial mathematics seminar (Oct 07), Conference on Credit Risk (Chicago, Oct 07), the CCCP 2007 Conference (Princeton, Nov 07), the Standard and Poors Credit Risk Summit (New York, Nov 07), the Conference on Credit Risk (Evry, 2008), the Chicago University Credit Risk conference (2008), and the Bachelier 2008 Congress for helpful remarks.

Traditional health state valuation questions and discrete choice experiments are two approaches that could be used to value health. Objective To measure whether public values for health vary with the age of the affected individual. Methods A discrete choice experiment was administered via the Internet in December 2007 to measure preferences for different attributes of influenza-related health-related quality of life: age of hypothetical affected individual (range 1-85 years), length of episode (days of illness), severity of illness (workdays lost) and time trade-off or willingness-to-pay amounts. Each respondent answered identical choice questions for a hypothetical family member and for himself/herself. Data on sociodemographic characteristics and influenza illness experience were also collected. Respondents were US adults randomly sampled from an Internet survey panel (n = 1,012). The relative value of attributes was estimated using generalized estimating equations and controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and illness experience. Marginal time traded and marginal willingness to pay using discrete choice and traditional time trade-off or willingness-to-pay questions were compared. Results Respondents preferred shorter influenza episodes but did not significantly prefer fewer workdays lost if episode length was held constant. Respondents were more likely to choose to avert uncomplicated illness in children and less likely to choose to avert uncomplicated illness in working-age adults. Marginal time trade-off and willingness-to-pay amounts elicited using discrete choice questions were larger than those elicited using direct valuation questions. Conclusions Approaches that assume values for health-related quality of life do not vary with the age of a patient may bias economic analyses that use these values. If patient age could affect valuations, then age should be included in the valuation exercise. Additional research should evaluate the effect of patient age on values for other conditions.","[Prosser, Lisa A.] Univ Michigan Hlth Syst, Dept Pediat & Communicable Dis, Child Hlth Evaluat & Res Unit, Div Gen Pediat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Prosser, Lisa A.; Rusinak, Donna; Shi, Ping] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Populat Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Prosser, Lisa A.; Rusinak, Donna; Shi, Ping] Harvard Univ, Pilgrim Hlth Care Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Messonnier, Mark] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Immunizat & Resp Dis, Atlanta, GA USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; University of Manchester; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"Prosser, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan Hlth Syst, Dept Pediat & Communicable Dis, Child Hlth Evaluat & Res Unit, Div Gen Pediat, 300 N Ingalls St,Room 6E14,SPC 5456, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lisapros@med.umich.edu,"Payne, Katherine/AAJ-3728-2020","Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350",Harvard-CDC Joint Initiative in Vaccine Economics; RCUK,Harvard-CDC Joint Initiative in Vaccine Economics; RCUK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),Funding for this project was provided from the Harvard-CDC Joint Initiative in Vaccine Economics.

A separate account termed as sub-account is set up for the investment. Unlike a mutual fund, a VA offers a guaranteed minimum death benefit or GMDB and often offers A guaranteed minimum living benefit or GMLB during the accumulation phase of the VA contract. Almost all the research to date has focused on single premium variable annuities (SPVAs), i.e. it is assumed that an annuitant makes a single lump-sum contribution at the time of issue. In this paper, we study flexible premium variable annuities (FPVAs) that allow contributions during the accumulation phase. We derive a valuation formula for guarantees embedded in FPVAs and show that the delta hedging strategy for an FPVA is substantially different from that for an SPVA. The numerical examples illustrate that the cost in the form of mortality and expense (M&E) fee for an FPVA in many situations is significantly higher than the cost for a similar SPVA. This finding suggests that the current pricing practice by most VA providers that charges the same M&E fee for both should be re-examined.","[Chi, Yichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Lin, X.

The fitted model is applied to derive statistics such as return level and expected tail loss of the claim distribution, and ruin probability bounds are obtained.

This paper is concerned with the behaviour of the distributions of the overshoot and undershoots of a high level, for a Levy process which drifts to -infinity and satisfies a Cramer or a convolution equivalent condition. We derive these asymptotics under minimal conditions in the Cramer case, and compare them with known results for the convolution equivalent case, drawing attention to the striking and unexpected fact that they become identical when certain parameters tend to equality. Thus, at least regarding these quantities, the medium-heavy tailed convolution equivalent model segues into the light-tailed Cramer model in a natural way. This suggests a usefully expanded flexibility for modelling the insurance risk process. We illustrate this relationship by comparing the asymptotic distributions obtained for the overshoot and undershoots, assuming the Levy process belongs to the GTSC class. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Thus estimates of tail probabilities (reinsurance prices) and percentiles (solvency capital requirements) are typically subject to substantial parameter uncertainty. We study the bias and MSE of estimators of tail probabilities and percentiles, with focus on 1-parameter exponential families. Using asymptotic arguments it is shown that tail estimates are subject to significant positive bias. Moreover, the use of bootstrap predictive distributions, which has been proposed in the actuarial literature as a way of addressing parameter uncertainty, is seen to double the estimation bias. A bias corrected estimator is thus proposed. It is then shown that the MSE of the MLE, the parametric bootstrap and the bias corrected estimators only differ in terms of order O(n(-2)), which provides decision-makers with some flexibility as to which estimator to use. The accuracy of asymptotic methods, even for small samples, is demonstrated exactly for the exponential and related distributions, while other 1-parameter distributions are considered in a simulation study. We argue that the presence of positive bias may be desirable in solvency capital calculations, though not necessarily in pricing problems.","[Tsanakas, A.] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England; [Landsman, Z.] Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel",City University London; University of Haifa,"Tsanakas, A (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",a.tsanakas.1@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2012,42.0,1,,,,,123,152,,10.2143/AST.42.1.2160738,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,010FV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309081000006,0

Our objective is to determine the amount of economic capital needed for the whole portfolio and to compute the amount of capital to be allocated to each risk X-1, ... , X-n. To do so, we use a top-down approach. For (X-1, ... , X-n), we consider risk models based on multivariate compound distributions defined with a multivariate counting distribution. We use the TVaR to evaluate the total capital requirement of the portfolio based on the distribution of S, and we use the TVaR-based capital allocation method to quantify the contribution of each risk. To simplify the presentation, the claim amounts are assumed to be continuously distributed. For multivariate compound distributions with continuous claim amounts, we provide general formulas for the cumulative distribution function of S, for the TVaR of S and the contribution to each risk. We obtain closed-form expressions for those quantities for multivariate compound distributions with gamma and mixed Erlang claim amounts. Finally, we treat in detail the multivariate compound Poisson distribution case. Numerical examples are provided in order to examine the impact of the dependence relation on the TVaR of S, the contribution to each risk of the portfolio, and the benefit of the aggregation of several risks.

Methods: The search was conducted using keywords and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms designed to exhaustively capture health state utility values across a variety of known economic, health technology assessment and peer-reviewed publication databases. The values were then critically reviewed from the perspective of the NICE reference case (2008 methods guide). Results: The search resulted in a large number of repeat references across databases suggesting good sensitivity. Thirty-three articles were selected for inclusion and subjected to a critical review including their methodological quality, symmetry with the NICE reference case, sample size and country source. This critical review led to a shortlist of nine utility studies, all of which had potential for inclusion in cost-utility models or a meta-analysis. Conclusions: A relatively large number of utilities have been collected in weight change and T2DM. Many of these utility values are not suitable for inclusion in a NICE submission. A better way of reviewing the methodological quality of utilities is needed.","[Doyle, Scott; Lloyd, Andrew] Oxford Outcomes, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England; [Doyle, Scott; Gray, Alastair] Univ Oxford, Dept Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Moore, Lee] Roche Prod Ltd, Welwyn Garden City AL7 3AY, Herts, England; [Ray, Joshua] F Hoffmann La Roche & Co Ltd, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Oxford; Roche Holding; Roche Holding,"Lloyd, A (通讯作者)，Oxford Outcomes, Seacourt Tower,West Way, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England.",andrew.lloyd@oxfordoutcomes.com,,,Roche; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0509-10206] Funding Source: researchfish,Roche(Roche Holding); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"Roche provided research support and funding for this study.

Most of these services have been developed from a healthcare professional perspective. However, for the future uptake and long-term sustainability of these services as well as for better and sustained health outcomes for patients, it is vital to gain an understanding of patients' preferences. We can then structure healthcare services to match these preferences and needs rather than around clinical viewpoints alone. Objective: The aim of this study was to elicit patient preferences for pharmacy-based specialized asthma services using a discrete choice experiment and to explore the value/importance that patients place on the different attributes of the asthma service. The existence of preference heterogeneity in the population was also investigated. Methods: The study was conducted with asthma patients who had recently experienced a specialized asthma management service at their pharmacy in New South Wales, Australia. Pharmacists delivering the asthma service mailed out the discrete choice questionnaires to participating patients at the end of 6 months of service provision. A latent class (LC) model was used to investigate each patient's strength of preference and preference heterogeneity for several key attributes related to asthma service provision: frequency of visits, access to pharmacist, interaction with pharmacy staff, availability of a private area for consultation, provision of lung function testing, type and depth of advice provision, number of days with asthma symptoms and cost of service. Results: Eighty useable questionnaires (of 170 questionnaires sent out) were received (response rate 47.1%). The study identified various key elements of asthma services important to patients. Further, the LC analysis revealed three classes with differing patient preferences for levels of asthma service provision. Patients in the Minimalistic Model class valued provision of lung function testing and preferred more frequent service visits. Cost of service had a negative effect on service preference for patients in this class. Patients in the Partial Model class mainly derived utility from the provision of lung function testing and comprehensive advice at the pharmacy and also wanted more frequent service visits. The Holistic Model class patients considered all attributes of the service to be important when making a choice. While the majority of the service attributes had a positive effect on preference for patients in this class, cost of service and days with symptoms of asthma had a negative effect on service preference. These patients also preferred fewer service visits. Conclusion: The study identified various key attributes that are important to patients with respect to community pharmacy-based asthma services. The results also demonstrate the existence of preference heterogeneity in the population. Asthma service providers need to take these findings into consideration in the design and development of future service models so as to increase their uptake and ensure their long-term sustainability.","[Naik-Panvelkar, Pradnya; Saini, Bandana] Univ Sydney, Fac Pharm, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Armour, Carol] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Armour, Carol] Univ Sydney, Woolcock Inst Med Res, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Rose, John M.] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; Woolcock Institute of Medical Research; University of Sydney,"Naik-Panvelkar, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Pharm, S114,Pharm Bldg A15, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",pradnya.naikpanvelkar@sydney.edu.au,"Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021","Armour, Carol/0000-0002-2930-2227; Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980","Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement; Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney (Sydney, NSW, Australia)","Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Health & Ageing); Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney (Sydney, NSW, Australia)","The authors would like to thank the patients for their participation in the study as well as the pharmacists for their help in recruiting the patients.

Particular emphasis is placed on multivariate conditional Spearman's rho (MCS), a new measure of multivariate conditional dependence that describes the association between large or extreme negative returns-so-called tail dependence. We demonstrate that MCS has a number of advantages over conventional measures of tail dependence, both in theory and in practical applications. In the analysis of univariate financial series, data are filtered to remove temporal dependence as a matter of routine. We show that standard filtering procedures may strongly influence the conclusions drawn concerning tail dependence. We give empirical applications to two large data sets of high-frequency asset returns. Our results have immediate implications for portfolio risk management, derivative pricing and portfolio selection. In this context we address portfolio tail diversification and tail hedging. Amongst other aspects, it is shown that the proposed modeling framework improves the estimation of portfolio risk measures such as the value at risk.","[Schmidt, Rafael] Bank Int Settlements, Risk Control, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Penzer, Jeremy] Capital One Bank Europe, Nottingham NG2 3HX, England; [Schmid, Friedrich] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ & Social Stat, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",Bank for International Settlements (BIS); University of Cologne,"Schmidt, R (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Risk Control, Aeschenpl, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",rafael.schmidt@gmx.de,,,,,,,45,5,6,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The number of disease-year equivalents and deaths attributable to COPD are high. Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of the disease recommend an individualized step-up approach in which treatment is intensified when results are unsatisfactory. Objective: Our objective was to present a systematic review of the cost effectiveness of pharmacological maintenance treatment for COPD and to discuss the methodological strengths and weaknesses of the studies. Methods: A systematic literature search for economic evaluations of drug therapy in COPD was performed in MEDLINE, EM BASE, the Economic Evaluation Database of the UK NHS (NIS-EED) and the European Network of Health Economic Evaluation Databases (EURONHEED). Full economic evaluations presenting both costs and health outcomes were included. Results: A total of 40 studies were included in the review. Of these, 16 were linked to a clinical trial, 14 used Markov models, eight were based on observational data and two used a different approach. The few studies on combining short-acting bronchodilators were consistent in finding net cost savings compared with monotherapy. Studies comparing inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with placebo or no maintenance treatment reported inconsistent results. Studies comparing fluticasone with salmeterol consistently found salmeterol to be more cost effective. The cost-effectiveness studies of tiotropium versus placebo, ipratropium or salmeterol pointed towards a reduction in total COPD-related healthcare costs for tiotropium in many but not all studies. All of these studies reported additional health benefits of tiotropium. The cost-effectiveness studies of the combination of inhaled long-acting beta(2)-agonists and ICS all report additional health benefits at an increase in total COPD-related costs in most studies. The cost-per-QALY estimates of this combination treatment vary widely and are very sensitive to the assumptions on mortality benefit and time horizon. Conclusions: The currently available economic evaluations indicate differences in cost effectiveness between COPD maintenance therapies, but for a more meaningful comparison of results it is important to improve the consistency with respect to study methodology and choice of comparator.","[Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P.

In 2005, the standard of care for adjuvant treatment was significantly changed with the approval of temozolomide. Carmustine wafers have also gained some popularity. Phase III trials are currently evaluating bevacizumab in conjunction with the standard temozolomide regimen. Despite these recent advances in pharmacotherapy, roughly two-thirds of patients do not survive longer than 2 years after diagnosis. Meanwhile, the costs of treatment are substantial. The goal of this study is to review the clinical, cost-of-illness, and cost-effectiveness literature relevant to treating glioblastoma. Estimates of the economic burden of glioblastoma within different healthcare systems were converted to 2013 US dollars. Temozolomide has demonstrated a 2.5-month increase in overall survival and a 1.9-month increase in progression-free survival, relative to radiotherapy alone. Carmustine wafers have also been shown to increase overall survival by 2.3 months, compared with placebo wafers. Cost-effectiveness studies of temozolomide have produced incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, adjusted to 2013 US dollars, with a range from US$73,586 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (UK National Health Service perspective) to US$105,234 per QALY (US societal perspective).

We focus specifically on ARCH processes with a linear volatility (called LARCH processes), for which the Gaussian quasi-likelihood estimator may be inconsistent. Our approach generalizes that of Beran and Schutzner (2009) and gives an interesting alternative to the WLSE used by Francq and Zakoian (2010) for an autoregressive process with LARCH errors. The family of contrasts is indexed by a single parameter that controls the smoothness of an approximated quasi-likelihood function. Under mild conditions, the resulting estimators are shown to be strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. The optimal asymptotic variance is also given. For LARCH processes, an atypical result is obtained: under assumptions, we show that the limiting distribution of the estimators can be arbitrarily close to a Gaussian distribution supported on a line. Extensions to multivariate processes are also discussed.","[Truquet, Lionel] Univ Rennes 1, F-35014 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Truquet, L (通讯作者)，Campus Ker Lann,Rue Blaise Pascal,BP 37203, F-35172 Bruz, France.",lionel.truquet@ensai.fr,"Truquet, Lionel/HTQ-8785-2023",,,,,,25,4,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Under this type of asymptotics, the weighting matrix in the second-step GMM criterion function converges weakly to a random matrix and the two-step GMM estimator is asymptotically mixed normal. Nevertheless, the Wald statistic, the GMM criterion function statistic, and the Lagrange multiplier statistic remain asymptotically pivotal. It is shown that critical values from the fixed-smoothing asymptotic distribution are high order correct under the conventional increasing-smoothing asymptotics. When an orthonormal series covariance estimator is used, the critical values can be approximated very well by the quantiles of a noncentral F distribution. A simulation study shows that statistical tests based on the new fixed-smoothing approximation are much more accurate in size than existing tests.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Sun, YX (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",yisun@ucsd.edu,,,NSF [SES-0752443],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"An earlier version of this paper is available as Sun (2014b).

Using estimates for three short rate models, two of which are based on the Wishart process whilst the third one belongs to the standard affine framework, we price these structured products using the FFT methodology. Thanks to the Wishart tractability the hedge ratios are also easily computed. As the models are estimated on the same dataset, our results illustrate how the fa discrepancies (meaning differences in the likelihood functions) between models translate in terms of derivatives pricing errors, and we show that the models can produce different price evolutions for the Range Accrual Notes. The differences can be substantial and underline the importance of model risk both from a static and a dynamic perspective. These results are confirmed by an analysis performed at the hedge ratios level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For the class of Archimedean copulas, the marginal components of the CTE vector satisfy the following properties: positive homogeneity (PH), translation invariance (TI), monotonicity (MO), safety loading (SL) and VaR inequality (VIA). In case marginal risks satisfy the subadditivity (MSA) property, the marginal CTE components are also sub-additive and hitherto coherent risk measures in the usual sense. Moreover, the increasing risk (IR) or stop-loss order preserving property of the marginal CTE components holds for the class of bivariate Archimedean copulas.

The venue was the Owen Glenn Building, the spectacular new home of the Auckland Business School and the Department of Economics at the University of Auckland. The meeting was organized by my colleagues, co-authors, and close companions Donggyu Sul and Chirok Han. Chirok did double duty by videotaping the evening, Donggyu coordinated festivities with consummate skill, and we settled in to a memorable evening. Econometricians, old friends, former students, two of my former teachers, faculty, and senior administrators were gathered together to celebrate my 60th birthday. Many had traveled long distances from overseas and navigated busy schedules to come to this event. It was a singular honor. My wife and daughter were with me. Opening speeches from Bas Sharp and John McDermott broke the ice with endearing tales from the past and jokes about some mysterious hole in my vita. I stood at the front table, looked out, and felt a glow of fellowship envelop me. I was fortunate indeed. Life had bestowed many gifts. The warmth of family, friends, and collegiality were at the top of the list. My education and early training in New Zealand were a clear second. What follows is a graduate student story. It draws on the first part of the speech I gave that evening at the NZESG conference dinner. It mixes personal reflections with recollections of the extraordinary New Zealanders who shaped my thinking as a graduate student and beginning researcher-people who have had an enduring impact on my work and career as an econometrician. The story traces out these human initial conditions and unit roots that figure in my early life of teaching and research.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Risk management corresponds to decisions regarding proportional reinsurance, whereas liquidity management has two components: distribution of dividends and costly equity issuance. Contingent on whether proportional or fixed costs of reinvestment are considered, singular stochastic control or stochastic impulse control techniques are used to seek strategies that maximize the firm value. We find that, in a proportional-costs setting, the optimal strategies are always mixed in terms of risk management and refinancing. In contrast, when fixed issuance costs are too high relative to the firm's profitability, optimal management does not involve refinancing. We provide analytical specifications of the optimal strategies, as well as a qualitative analysis of the interaction between refinancing and risk management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, modelling inherently poses challenges that need to be dealt with since models always represent a simplification of reality. The aim of this study was to identify and explore the challenges in modelling CVD interventions. A document analysis was performed of 40 model-based CEAs of CVD interventions published in high-impact journals. We analysed the systematically selected papers to identify challenges per type of intervention (test, non-drug, drug, disease management programme, and public health intervention), and a questionnaire was sent to the corresponding authors to obtain a more thorough overview. Ideas for possible solutions for the challenges were based on the papers, responses, modelling guidelines, and other sources. The systematic literature search identified 1,720 potentially relevant articles. Forty authors were identified after screening the most recent 294 papers. Besides the challenge of lack of data, the challenges encountered in the review suggest that it was difficult to obtain a sufficiently valid and accurate cost-effectiveness estimate, mainly due to lack of data or extrapolating from intermediate outcomes. Despite the low response rate of the questionnaire, it confirmed our results. This combination of a review and a survey showed examples of CVD modelling challenges found in studies published in high-impact journals. Modelling guidelines do not provide sufficient guidance in resolving all challenges. Some of the reported challenges are specific to the type of intervention and disease, while some are independent of intervention and disease.","[Burgers, Laura T.; Redekop, William K.; Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Burgers, Laura T.; Redekop, William K.; Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Severens, JL (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",burgers@bmg.eur.nl; severens@bmg.eur.nl,"Redekop, Ken/AAA-2423-2020","Redekop, Ken/0000-0001-9538-4083",,,,,66,3,3,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2014,32.0,7,,,,,627,637,,10.1007/s40273-014-0155-9,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0KS,24748448.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344625700003,0

In this context, cost-effectiveness analyses applying quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as outcome measures for economic evaluation of improved approaches to TB control are increasingly important. While the methodology applied to derive the effectiveness data is commonly reported, less information is given regarding the derivation of utility weights in the calculation of QALYs for TB treatment. To date, despite the particular complexities of the disease, TB health effects have not been fully measured and there is no agreement on how disutility of TB disease should be accounted for. Consequently, disutility values in published studies vary considerably, and often appear to lack empirical evidence. As the need for a solid heath-economics rationale for investment in new tools against TB grows, adequate and comprehensive methods for assessing the impairments caused by different types of TB must be developed. Focusing on the assessment of DALYs as a measure of outcome in economic evaluation, we have built an exemplary model calculation applying the original TB data for Germany as reported to the Robert Koch Institute. Our work demonstrates that the use of standard equations provided in the scientific literature probably results in an underestimation of lost DALYs compared with probabilistic techniques. Providing distributions around epidemiological averages, coupled with Monte Carlo simulation to address uncertainty, may result in more realistic values. In line with a previous recommendation by the World Health Organization, it appears worthwhile to consider this more intricate approach to providing healthcare resource allocation decisions, particularly for TB.","[Diel, R.] Univ Med Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Inst Epidemiol, D-24015 Kiel, Germany; [Lampenius, N.] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Accounting & Finance, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Diel, R (通讯作者)，Univ Med Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Inst Epidemiol, Niemannsweg 11, D-24015 Kiel, Germany.",roland.diel@epi.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,45,10,10,0,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2014,32.0,7,,,,,617,626,,10.1007/s40273-014-0159-5,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0KS,24849396.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344625700002,0

In contrast to former studies, we examine two different regions, namely the USA and Europe, and disentangle firm and sector specific impacts. Our econometric analysis shows that environmental and social activities of a firm compared with other firms within the industry are valued by financial markets in both regions. However, the respective positive effects on average monthly stock returns between 2003 and 2006 are more robust in the USA and, in addition, non-linear. Our analysis furthermore points to biased parameter estimates if incorrectly specified econometric models are applied: the seemingly significantly negative effect of environmental and social performance of the industry to which a firm belongs strongly declines and mostly becomes insignificant if the explanation of stock performance is based on the Fama-French three-factor or the Carhart four-factor models instead of the simple Capital Asset Pricing Model.","[von Arx, Urs; Ziegler, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Ctr Corp Responsibil & Sustainabil, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland; [von Arx, Urs] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ziegler, Andreas] Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, D-34109 Kassel, Germany",University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universitat Kassel,"Ziegler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Ctr Corp Responsibil & Sustainabil, Zahringerstr 24, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",andreas.ziegler@uni-kassel.de,,,,,,,60,27,30,5,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We critically examine the conditions under which displaced services would represent an economically meaningful threshold value. We first show that if we assume that the least cost-effective services are displaced to finance a new technology, then the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the displaced services (d) only coincides with that related to the opportunity cost of adopting that new technology, the ICER of the most cost-effective service in expansion (n), under highly restrictive conditions-namely, complete allocative efficiency in existing provision of health care interventions. More generally, reimbursement of new technology with a fixed budget comprises two actions; adoption and financing through displacement and the effect of reimbursement is the net effect of these two actions. In order for the reimbursement process to be a pathway to allocative efficiency within a fixed budget, the net effect of the strategy of reimbursement is compared with the most cost-effective alternative strategy for reimbursement: optimal reallocation, the health gain maximizing expansion of existing services financed by the health loss minimizing contraction. The shadow price of the health effects of a new technology, beta(c) = (1/n + 1/d - 1/m)(-1) accounts for both imperfect displacement (the ICER of the displaced service, d < m, the ICER of the least cost-effective of the existing services in contraction) and the allocative inefficiency (n < m) characteristic of health systems.","[Eckermann, Simon] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Pekarsky, Brita] Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of South Australia,"Eckermann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",seckerma@uow.edu.au,,,,,,,28,28,28,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2014,32.0,4,,,,,319,325,,10.1007/s40273-014-0140-3,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AG9RP,24515251.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335757400002,0

In applications often one has to estimate the risk measure given a random sample from an unknown distribution. The distribution could either be truly unknown or could be the distribution of a complex function of economic and idiosyncratic variables with the complexity of the function rendering indeterminable its distribution. Hence statistical procedures for the estimation of Haezendonck-Goovaerts risk measures are a key requirement for their use in practice. A natural estimator of the Haezendonck-Goovaerts risk measure is the Haezendonck-Goovaerts risk measure of the empirical distribution, but its statistical properties have not yet been explored in detail. The main goal of this article is to both establish the strong consistency of this estimator and to derive weak convergence limits for this estimator. We also conduct a simulation study to lend insight into the sample sizes required for these asymptotic limits to take hold. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

From the practical standpoint, the proposed model offers great flexibility and allows us to obtain credit spread curves of many different shapes, including double humped term structures. Furthermore, an approximate closed-form solution is derived, which is accurate, easy to implement, and allows for an efficient calibration to realized credit spreads.

The estimator is based on first differences and then a local linear regression is applied to estimate the unknown coefficients. To avoid a non-negligible asymptotic bias, we need to introduce a higher-dimensional kernel weight. This enables us to remove the bias at the price of enlarging the variance term and, hence, achieving a slower rate of convergence. To overcome this problem, we propose a one-step backfitting algorithm that enables the resulting estimator to achieve optimal rates of convergence for this type of problem. It also exhibits the so-called oracle efficiency property. We also obtain the asymptotic distribution. Because the estimation procedure depends on the choice of a bandwidth matrix, we also provide a method to compute this matrix empirically. The Monte Carlo results indicate the good performance of the estimator in finite samples.","[Rodriguez-Poo, Juan M.] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Rodriguez-Poo, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Avda Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",rodrigjm@unican.es; soberonap@unican.es,"; Rodriguez-Poo, Juan Manuel/F-6994-2016","Soberon, Alexandra/0000-0001-5268-6751; Rodriguez-Poo, Juan Manuel/0000-0001-8751-3025",Programa Nacional de Formacion de Profesorado Universitario/Spanish Ministry of Education [AP-2007-02209],Programa Nacional de Formacion de Profesorado Universitario/Spanish Ministry of Education,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the Programa Nacional de Formacion de Profesorado Universitario/Spanish Ministry of Education (Ref.

The importance of school characteristics in the housing market can be seen in the jump in house prices at school district boundaries where peer characteristics change. The question of whether schools with more attractive peers are really better in a value-added sense remains open, however. This paper uses a fuzzy regression-discontinuity design to evaluate the causal effects of peer characteristics. Our design exploits admissions cutoffs at Boston and New York City's heavily over-subscribed exam schools. Successful applicants near admissions cutoffs for the least selective of these schools move from schools with scores near the bottom of the state SAT score distribution to schools with scores near the median. Successful applicants near admissions cutoffs for the most selective of these schools move from above-average schools to schools with students whose scores fall in the extreme upper tail. Exam school students can also expect to study with fewer nonwhite classmates than unsuccessful applicants. Our estimates suggest that the marked changes in peer characteristics at exam school admissions cutoffs have little causal effect on test scores or college quality.","[Abdulkadiroglu, Atila] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Angrist, Joshua; Pathak, Parag] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Duke University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Abdulkadiroglu, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",atila.abdulkadiroglu@duke.edu; angrist@mit.edu; ppathak@mit.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1056325] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,55,153,213,8,80,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2014,82.0,1,,,,,137,196,,10.3982/ECTA10266,0.0,,,60,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA7KQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331276700004,0

Although most of the literature treats the MVH problem by the duality method, here we study an equivalent system consisting of three BSDEs and try to provide more explicit expressions directly implementable by practitioners. Under the Bayesian and Kalman-Bucy frameworks, we find that a relevant BSDE can yield a semi-closed solution via a simple set of ODEs which allow quick numerical evaluation. This renders the remaining problems equivalent to solving European contingent claims under a new forward measure, and it is straightforward to obtain a forward looking non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation scheme. We also give a special example where the hedging position is available in a semi-closed form. For more generic set-ups, we provide explicit expressions of an approximate hedging portfolio by an asymptotic expansion. These analytic expressions not only allow the hedgers to update the hedging positions in real time but also make a direct analysis of the terminal distribution of the hedged portfolio feasible by standard Monte Carlo simulation.","[Fujii, Masaaki; Takahashi, Akihiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Takahashi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",akihikot@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Fujii, Masaaki/0000-0002-3332-068X",Center for Advanced Research in Finance (CARF); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25380389] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Center for Advanced Research in Finance (CARF); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This research is partially supported by Center for Advanced Research in Finance (CARF).,,23,6,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

To this end, we combine a multilevel Poisson dynamic linear model (DLM) with a new approach to handle missing data. The missing data approach resembles multiple imputation, using all available data and properly estimating the uncertainty due to the missingness and the amount of data available. The multilevel Poisson DLM is estimated using a stepwise Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. For a two-level model, first the model at Level 2 is estimated. Then, the model at Level 1 is estimated, conditional on the Level 2 model. Predictors at Level 1 and 2 can be included. We illustrate the model with a data set from clinical psychiatry, on the differential effects of three treatments to panic disorder, during the first year of treatment. The severity of the condition was measured through the number of panic attacks experienced every week for each patient in the study ($n$ = 73 patients). We consider several model variants for both levels and select the final model using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC). Even though the sample sizes per treatment group are fairly small, we are able to detect differences between treatments, both in the Level 1 and the Level 2 model. Our analyses showed that patients in the cognitive behavioural therapy group showed less progress than patients in the other therapy groups. Post-hoc analyses have been performed to detect differences in disorder severity between both genders and between agoraphobic and non-agoraphobic patients.","[Krone, Tanja; Albers, Casper J.; Timmerman, Marieke E.] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Krone, T (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",t.krone@rug.nl; c.j.albers@rug.nl; m.e.timmerman@rug.nl,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,285,285,,,,,,1,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600032,0

We analyse the influence of the daily wind index on Pseudo-nitzschia values from the day water samples were collected up to six days earlier.

Due to the autocorrelation structure, we combined the partial adjustment model with the ZINB.

Following Engle and Kozicki (1993), the common CH features property is expressed in terms of testable overidentifying moment restrictions. However, as we show, these moment conditions have a degenerate Jacobian matrix at the true parameter value and therefore the standard asymptotic results of Hansen (1982) do not apply. We show in this context that Hansen's (1982) J-test statistic is asymptotically distributed as the minimum of the limit of a certain random process with a markedly nonstandard distribution. If two assets are considered, this asymptotic distribution is a fifty-fifty mixture of (2)(H-1) and (2)(H), where H is the number of moment conditions, as opposed to a (2)(H-1). With more than two assets, this distribution lies between the (2)(H-p) and (2)(H) (p denotes the number of parameters). These results show that ignoring the lack of first-order identification of the moment condition model leads to oversized tests with a possibly increasing overrejection rate with the number of assets. A Monte Carlo study illustrates these findings.","[Dovonon, Prosper] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Dovonon, Prosper; Renault, Eric] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Dovonon, Prosper; Renault, Eric] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Renault, Eric] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Concordia University - Canada; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Brown University,"Dovonon, P (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",prosper.dovonon@concordia.ca; Eric_Renault@brown.edu,,,FQRSC,FQRSC,"We would like to thank Manuel Arellano, Yves Atchade, Valentina Corradi, Giovanni Forchini, Silvia Goncalves, and Enrique Sentana for helpful comments.

The existing literature is constrained both by the relatively small number of age comparison groups within preference-elicitation studies, and by a paucity of methodological robustness tests for order and framing effects and the reliability and transitivity of preferences that would strengthen confidence in the results. This paper reports the results of a study aimed at estimating granulated age-related weights for health gains across the age spectrum that can potentially inform health care decision-making. A sample of 2,500 participants recruited from the health care consumer panels of a social research company completed a person trade-off (or 'matching') study designed to estimate age-related weights for 5- and 10-year life extensions. The results are presented in terms of matrices for alternative age comparisons across the age spectrum. The results revealed a general, although not invariable, tendency to give more weight to health gains, expressed in terms of life extensions, in younger age groups. In over 85% of age comparisons, the person trade-off exercises revealed a preference for life extensions by the younger of the two age groups that were compared. This pattern held regardless of the method of aggregating responses across study participants. Moreover, the relative weight placed on life extensions by the younger of the two age groups was generally, although not invariably, found to increase as the age difference between the comparator age groups increased. Further analyses revealed that the highest mean relative weight placed on life extensions was estimated for 30-year-olds when the ratio of means method was used to aggregate person trade-off responses across study participants. The highest mean relative weight placed on life extensions was estimated for 10-year-olds for 5-year life extensions and for 30-year-olds for 10-year life extensions, when the median of individual ratios method was used to aggregate person trade-off responses across study participants. Methodological tests framed around alternative referents in the person trade-off questions and the stability of preferences had no discernible effects on the study results. This study has produced new evidence on age-related weights for health gains that can potentially inform health care decision-making.","[Petrou, Stavros; Kandala, Ngianga-Bakwin] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Robinson, Angela] Univ E Anglia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Baker, Rachel] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Yunus Ctr Social Business & Hlth, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",University of Warwick; University of East Anglia; Glasgow Caledonian University,"Petrou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",S.Petrou@warwick.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Kandala, Ngiianga-Bakwin/JVP-0158-2024; Baker, Rachel M/B-8469-2013","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Baker, Rachel M/0000-0002-3451-2018","UK Medical Research Council; MRC [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),Funding from the UK Medical Research Council for this study is gratefully acknowledged.

This, in particular, applies to the inverse Gaussian process when the safety loading is less than one. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper argues that private information, held by the potential applicant pool, explains rejections. I formulate this argument by developing and testing a model in which agents may have private information about their risk. I first derive a new no-trade result that theoretically explains how private information could cause rejections. I then develop a new empirical methodology to test whether this no-trade condition can explain rejections. The methodology uses subjective probability elicitations as noisy measures of agents' beliefs. I apply this approach to three nongroup markets: long-term care, disability, and life insurance. Consistent with the predictions of the theory, in all three settings I find significant amounts of private information held by those who would be rejected; I find generally more private information for those who would be rejected relative to those who can purchase insurance, and I show it is enough private information to explain a complete absence of trade for those who would be rejected. The results suggest that private information prevents the existence of large segments of these three major insurance markets.","[Hendren, Nathaniel] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hendren, Nathaniel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hendren, N (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",nhendren@fas.harvard.edu,,,NIA NIH HHS [T32 AG000186] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,37,83,106,1,51,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2013,81.0,5,,,,,1713,1762,,10.3982/ECTA10931,0.0,,,50,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,227BY,24187381.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325084100001,0

But sometimes these fluctuations can become determinant, especially when unforeseen large drops in asset prices are observed that could result in huge losses or even in market crashes. The evidence shows that these events happen far more often than would be expected under the generalised assumption of normally distributed financial returns. Thus it is crucial to model distribution tails properly so as to be able to predict the frequency and magnitude of extreme stock price returns. In this paper we follow the approach suggested by McNeil and Frey in 2000 and combine GARCH-type models with the extreme value theory to estimate the tails of three financial index returns S&P 500, FTSE 100 and NIKKEI 225 representing three important financial areas in the world. Our results indicate that EVT-based conditional quantile estimates are more accurate than those from conventional GARCH models assuming normal or Student's t distribution innovations when doing not only in-sample but also out-of-sample estimation. Moreover, these results are robust to alternative GARCH model specifications. The findings of this paper should be useful to investors in general, since their goal is to be able to forecast unforeseen price movements and take advantage of them by positioning themselves in the market according to these predictions.","[Furio, Dolores; Climent, Francisco J.] Univ Valencia Spain, Dept Financial Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Furió, D (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia Spain, Dept Financial Econ, Ave Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",m.dolores.furio@uv.es,"Furió, Dolores/K-5957-2017; Climent, Francisco/I-2846-2017","Furió, Dolores/0000-0002-1033-9599; Climent, Francisco/0000-0003-2698-889X",,,,,26,11,13,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user friendly manner. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines efforts into one current, useful reporting guidance. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication. The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. A list of possible items based on a systematic review was created. A two round, modified Delphi panel consisting of representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, government, and the editorial community was conducted. Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed. The recommendations are contained in a user friendly, 24 item checklist. A copy of the statement, accompanying checklist, and this report can be found on the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluations Publication Guidelines Task Force website (www.ispor.org/TaskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp). We hope CHEERS will lead to better reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the CHEERS statement is being co-published across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups, to endorse CHEERS. The author team plans to review the checklist for an update in five years.","[Husereau, Don] Inst Hlth Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Ottawa, Dept Epidemiol & Community Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Petrou, Stavros] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Carswell, Chris] Adis Int, PharmacoEconomics, Auckland, New Zealand; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Clin Epidemiol Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Greenberg, Dan] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Augustovski, Federico] Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy IECS, Hlth Econ Evaluat & Technol Assessment, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Augustovski, Federico] Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Briggs, Andrew H.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA",University of Ottawa; University of York - UK; University of Warwick; Adis International; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; Ben Gurion University; University of Buenos Aires; University of Glasgow; Research Triangle Institute,"Husereau, D (通讯作者)，879 Winnington Ave, Ottawa, ON K2B 5C4, Canada.",donh@donhusereau.com,"Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020; Husereau, Don/AAJ-7722-2021; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Moher, David/I-3408-2019","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Husereau, Don/0000-0002-4416-6876; Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Moher, David/0000-0003-2434-4206; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548; Carswell, Christopher/0000-0003-0828-0548",International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,All CHEERS Task Force members are volunteers.

The assets are Lucas trees; a collection of Lucas trees is a Lucas orchard. The model generates return correlations that vary endogenously, spiking at times of disaster. Since disasters spread across assets, the model generates large risk premia even for assets with stable cashflows. Very small assets may comove endogenously and hence earn positive risk premia even if their cashflows are independent of the rest of the economy. I provide conditions under which the variation in a small asset's price-dividend ratio can be attributed almost entirely to variation in its risk premium.","Stanford Univ, Stanford Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Martin, I (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ian.martin@stanford.edu,,,,,,,34,52,62,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2013,81.0,1,,,,,55,111,,10.3982/ECTA8446,0.0,,,57,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,076FJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313941600002,0

To quantify the economic benefit that dealers derive from this advantage, we study detailed data from Canadian Treasury auctions, where dealers observe customer bids while preparing their own bids. In this setting, dealers can use information on customer bids to learn about (i) competition, that is, the distribution of competing bids in the auction, and (ii) fundamentals, that is, the ex post value of the security being auctioned.

In particular, such a model, which consists of a system of several non-linear partial differential equations, is solved using a new numerical method that combines an operator splitting procedure with the differential quadrature (DQ) finite difference scheme. This approach allows one to reduce the partial differential problems to systems of linear equations of very small dimension, so that pricing portfolios of many life insurances becomes a relatively easily task. Numerical experiments are presented showing that the method proposed is very accurate and fast. In addition, the limit behavior of portfolios of life insurances as the number of contracts tends to infinity is investigated. This analysis reveals that the prices of portfolios comprising more than five thousand policies can be accurately approximated by solving a linear partial differential equation derived in Young (2007, 2008).

One bargainer, the builder, can propose and build a coalition over two stages. We examine the hypothesis that both absolute and relative payoffs affect the coalition formation process (and outcome). We observe many inefficient two-person final coalitions, and that the distribution of outcomes is sensitive to the constellation of both absolute and relative payoffs. Relative payoffs appear to be applied more myopically than has been observed in bilateral sequential bargaining games or suggested by social preference models. We hypothesize that the prevalence of two-person coalitions stems from builder's uncertainty about individual acceptance thresholds. In fact, allowing nonbinding communication among the bargainers increases the prevalence of efficient coalitions. The main implication is that efficient coalition building involves strategies for mitigating the strategic uncertainty inherent in building coalitions.","[Brosig-Koch, Jeannette E.] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ & Business Adm, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Bolton, Gary E.] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",University of Duisburg Essen; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Brosig-Koch, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",gbolton@psu.edu; jeannette.brosig@uni-due.de,,"Brosig-Koch, Jeannette/0000-0003-4420-0787","U.S. National Science Foundation Grant [0351408]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0351408] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","U.S. National Science Foundation Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Bolton gratefully acknowledges the support of the U.S. National Science Foundation Grant #0351408.

We consider an incumbent who operates in two independent markets and has private information about his production cost. In one of the markets, there is a potential entrant offering a differentiated product. The most reasonable perfect Bayesian equilibrium is either the least-cost separating equilibrium or the pooling equilibrium where both types of incumbents set the low-cost monopoly prices. This equilibrium may involve a downward distortion in the pre-entry prices of both markets. Our model has interesting implications for antitrust regulation as well as for international trade policy. First, predatory tests based on a single market are inadequate for a multimarket incumbent. Second, a lower price in a foreign market is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the existence of entry deterrence in a foreign market.","[Pires, Cesaltina Pacheco] Univ Evora, Dept Gestao, CEFAGE UE, Evora, Portugal; [Jorge, Silvia Ferreira] Univ Aveiro, DEGEI, GOVCOPP, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal",University of Evora; Universidade de Aveiro,"Pires, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, Dept Gestao, CEFAGE UE, Evora, Portugal.",cesaltina.pires@gmail.com,"Pires, Cesaltina/A-3871-2010; Jorge, Silvia Ferreira/B-6005-2009","Pires, Cesaltina/0000-0001-8024-8935; Jorge, Silvia Ferreira/0000-0003-0651-7433","Fundacao para Ciencia e Tecnologia [BD/857/2000]; Fundo Social Europeu, III EU Framework; FCT program POCTI","Fundacao para Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundo Social Europeu, III EU Framework; FCT program POCTI","We are grateful to one anonymous referee and to William Thomson for valuable comments.

Heuristically, for H > 1/2 this means that the noise traders has some memory, in the sense that any increment from time t on has a positive correlation with its value at t.

We generalize the idea of variance and covariance in the new skewness-aware asset pricing and allocation framework. We show via computational experiments that the proposed approach results in improved and intuitively appealing asset allocation when returns follow real-world or simulated skewed distributions.

Given the historical measure, the dynamics of assets being modeled by Garch-type models with generalized hyperbolic innovations and the pricing kernel is an exponential affine function of the state variables, we show that the risk-neutral distribution is unique and again implies a generalized hyperbolic dynamics with changed parameters. We provide an empirical test for our pricing methodology on two data sets of options, respectively written on the French CAC 40 and the American SP 500. Then, using our theoretical result associated with Monte Carlo simulations, we compare this approach with natural competitors in order to test its efficiency. More generally, our empirical investigations analyse the ability of specific parametric innovations to reproduce market prices in the context of an exponential affine specification of the stochastic discount factor.","[Chorro, Christophe; Guegan, Dominique; Ielpo, Florian] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75013 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Guégan, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",dguegan@univ-paris1.fr,"Chorro, Christophe/AAS-7908-2020; chorro, christophe/ABB-6835-2020","Chorro, Christophe/0000-0002-1214-9000;",,,,,38,26,28,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

A potentially important, but often overlooked, aspect of chemotherapy is the cost associated with administration. This study aims to develop a better understanding of these costs, and in doing so, develop a model to estimate the comparative cost of administering alternative chemotherapy protocols for economic evaluation or local decision making. Methods: We identified the potential tasks and choices related to administering intravenous chemotherapy, grouped tasks according to anticipated resource use, and allocated costs to each task using data from an evidence-based collection of cancer protocols or from primary data collection. The resources were costed from a healthcare system perspective using standard data sources within Australia. The model was applied to alternative protocols used in the treatment of three different cancers: locally advanced and metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, adjuvant colorectal cancer and adjuvant breast cancer. Results: For the three cancer types examined, the cost of completed administration ranged from 1274 Australian dollars ($A) to $A3015 (year 2009 values) for 13 different protocols potentially used for the initial treatment of locally advanced and metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer; $A5175-8445 for seven protocols for adjuvant colorectal cancer treatment; and $A1494-4074 for seven protocols for adjuvant breast cancer treatment. Conclusions: The results are of practical significance to those undertaking economic evaluations and to decision makers who use this information within the area of chemotherapy. The examples used suggest that administration costs per visit varied inversely with the number of visits. The results provide information where little has previously been available and may allow decisions about costs and resource allocation to be made with more certainty. Although our model uses costs from the public health system within an Australian state (New South Wales), it can be adapted for use in other jurisdictions.","[Haywood, Philip; van Gool, Kees; Haas, Marion; Gallego, Gisselle] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [de Raad, Johan] Univ Utrecht, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Utrecht Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacotherapy, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Pearson, Sallie-Anne; Faedo, Margaret; Ward, Robyn] Univ New S Wales, Fac Med, Prince Wales Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; Utrecht University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Haywood, P (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",phaywoodnewzealand@gmail.com,"Haas, Marion Ruth/H-2732-2017; Gallego, Gisselle/AAD-6026-2019; Ward, Robyn L/I-2313-2013; Gallego, Gisselle/AAG-2398-2019; van Gool, Kees/JXW-8446-2024","Gallego, Gisselle/0000-0002-3243-8176; Ward, Robyn L/0000-0002-6877-8906; van Gool, Kees/0000-0002-1424-9304; Haywood, Philip/0000-0001-5031-8648",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [455366],National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"Funding for this study was provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) through a research programme grant (no. 455366).

The effect of the vintage of prescription drugs (and other variables) on the life expectancy and age-adjusted mortality rates of residents of Germany is examined, using longitudinal, annual, state-level data during the period 2001-7. The estimates imply that about one-third of the 1.4-year increase in German life expectancy during the period 2001-7 was due to the replacement of older drugs by newer drugs. The effect of the vintage of chemotherapy treatments on age-adjusted cancer mortality rates of residents of France is also investigated, using longitudinal, annual, cancer-site-level data during the period 2002-6. The estimates imply that chemotherapy innovation accounted for at least one-sixth of the decline in French cancer mortality rates, and may have accounted for as much as half of the decline.","[Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, 504 Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",frank.lichtenberg@columbia.edu,,,Merck Sharpe; Dohme Corporation; Servier Laboratories,Merck Sharpe; Dohme Corporation; Servier Laboratories,"This research was supported by Merck Sharpe and Dohme Corporation and by Servier Laboratories.

Contrary to the conclusion of the mutual fund separation theorem, we show that the optimal risky asset mix will reflect an agent's risk attitude as long as background risk is not independent of investment risk. This result can, however, be used to solve the risky asset allocation puzzle. We also unveil that optimal insurance to shift background risk is determined through establishing a hedging portfolio against investment risk and is an arrangement maintaining the balance between growth and volatility of expected consumption. Because the optimal insurance we obtain generally leads to a smoother consumption path, it may plausibly explain the equity premium puzzle in the financial literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our new idea, called the geometric shortcut, allows an efficient simulation for the case of independent obligors. It is even possible to show that, when the average default probability tends to zero, its asymptotic efficiency is higher than that of the naive algorithm. The geometric shortcut is also useful for models with dependent obligors and can be used for dependence structures modeled with arbitrary copulae. The paper contains the details for simulating the risk of the normal copula credit risk model by combining outer importance sampling with the geometric shortcut. Numerical results show that the new method is efficient in assessing tail loss probabilities and expected shortfall for credit risk portfolios. The new method outperforms all known methods, especially for credit portfolios consisting of weakly correlated obligors and for evaluating the tail loss probabilities at many thresholds in a single simulation run.","[Sak, Halis] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Math & Stat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Sak, Halis] Yeditepe Univ, Dept Syst Engn, Kayisdagi Istanbul, Turkey; [Hormann, Wolfgang] Bogazici Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-80815 Bebek, Turkey",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Yeditepe University; Bogazici University,"Sak, H (通讯作者)，WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Math & Stat, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",halis.sak@wu.ac.at,"Hormann, Wolfgang/GZL-1496-2022","Sak, Halis/0000-0001-9205-0619",TUBITAK BIDEB [2211]; Bogazici Research Fund project [07HA301],TUBITAK BIDEB(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Bogazici Research Fund project(Bogazici University),The authors thank two anonymous referees for their valuable suggestions that improved the paper substantially.

This paper considers the macroeconomic information incorporated in unobserved common equity market factors, as well as the possibility that the macroeconomic sensitivities of the factors differ across alternative levels of volatility. Several models are estimated for 15 developed equity markets to examine the economic composition of the common factors, thereby providing an alternative perspective on the economic fundamentals underlying equity markets. A formal Bayesian selection process suggests that a common structure incorporating global and European factors is preferred to the baseline case of a single global factor or the extended scenario of dual global factors. The common factors are associated with a small set of macroeconomic variables.","[Tsiaplias, Sarantis] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Tsiaplias, S (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",stsiaplias@live.com,"Tsiaplias, Sarantis/R-3006-2019","Tsiaplias, Sarantis/0000-0001-6728-2418",,,,,44,0,0,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The surrender charge of a life annuity is a proportion of its value. Ruin occurs when the total of the value of the risky and riskless assets and the surrender value of the life annuity reaches zero. We find the optimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender strategies in two situations: (i) the value of the risky and riskless assets is allowed to be negative, with the imputed surrender value of the life annuity keeping the total positive; (ii) the value of the risky and riskless assets is required to be non-negative. In the first case, although the individual has the flexibility to buy or sell at any time, we find that the individual will not buy a life annuity unless she can cover all her consumption via the annuity and she will never sell her annuity. In the second case, the individual surrenders just enough annuity income to keep her total assets positive. However, in this second case, the individual's annuity purchasing strategy depends on the size of the proportional surrender charge. When the charge is large enough, the individual will not buy a life annuity unless she can cover all her consumption, the so-called safe level. When the charge is small enough, the individual will buy a life annuity at a wealth lower than this safe level. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we consider the interaction between interrelated perspectives of a societal decision maker (e.g. the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] in the UK) charged with the responsibility for approving new health interventions for reimbursement and the company that holds the patent for a new intervention. We establish optimal decision making from societal and company perspectives, allowing for trade-offs between the value and cost of research and the price of the new intervention. Given the current level of evidence, there exists a maximum (threshold) price acceptable to the decision maker. Submission for approval with prices above this threshold will be refused. Given the current level of evidence and the decision maker's threshold price, there exists a minimum (threshold) price acceptable to the company. If the decision maker's threshold price exceeds the company's, then current evidence is sufficient since any price between the thresholds is acceptable to both. On the other hand, if the decision maker's threshold price is lower than the company's, then no price is acceptable to both and the company's optimal strategy is to commission additional research. The methods are illustrated using a recent example from the literature.","[Wilan, Andrew R.] SickKids Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wilan, Andrew R.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Eckermann, Simon] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto; University of Wollongong,"Wilan, AR (通讯作者)，CHES, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",andy@andywillan.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [44868-08],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),A.R.

This paper shows identification of average and quantile treatment effects in the presence of the double selection problem into (i) a selective subpopulation (e.g., workingselection on unobservables) and (ii) a binary treatment (e.g., trainingselection on observables) based on weighting observations by the inverse of a nested propensity score that characterizes either selection probability.

The case of type 2 diabetes illustrates this difficulty. In spite of its high disease burden, type 2 diabetes is poorly documented through existing cost-effectiveness analyses. We support this statement by an exhaustive literature review that enables us to precisely pinpoint the limitations of models used for the assessment of newly marketed (and expensive) drugs. We find that models are mostly restricted to surrogate endpoints and based on non-inferiority clinical trial data; they also show biases in the choice of comparators and inclusion criteria. Such limitations undermine the scope and applicability of HTA practice guidelines based on cost-effectiveness evidence. Nevertheless, cost-effectiveness models remain an opportunity to better inform decision makers and to reduce the uncertainty surrounding their decisions. HTA agencies are best placed to provide incentives for companies to improve the quality of the cost-effectiveness studies submitted for pricing and reimbursement decisions. One such incentive is to include stages of discussion between the company and the health authority during the evaluation process.","[Raimond, Veronique] Haute Autorite Sante, Hlth Econ & Publ Hlth Dept, F-93218 La Plaine St Denis, France; [Josselin, Jean-Michel] Univ Rennes 1, Fac Econ, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Josselin, Jean-Michel] CREM CNRS, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Rochaix, Lise] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Universite de Rennes; Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Raimond, V (通讯作者)，Haute Autorite Sante, Hlth Econ & Publ Hlth Dept, 2 Ave Stade France, F-93218 La Plaine St Denis, France.",v.raimond@has-sante.fr,"Raimond, Veronique/P-9529-2018","Raimond, Veronique/0000-0002-0331-4991",French National Authority for Health (HAS),French National Authority for Health (HAS),This research was conducted and funded by the French National Authority for Health (HAS).

The costs associated with HNC are complex, as the disease involves multiple sites, and treatment may require a multidisciplinary medical team and different treatment modalities. Databases (MEDLINE and Embase) were searched to identify studies published in English between October 2003 and October 2013 analyzing the economics of HNC in adult patients. Additional relevant publications were identified through manual searches of abstracts from recent conference proceedings. Of 606 studies initially identified, 77 met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated in the assessment. Most included studies were conducted in the USA. The vast majority of studies assessed direct costs of HNC, such as those associated with diagnosis and screening, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, side effects of treatment, and follow-up care. The costs of treatment far exceeded those for other aspects of care. There was considerable heterogeneity in the reporting of economic outcomes in the included studies; truly comparable cost data were sparse in the literature. Based on these limited data, in the US costs associated with systemic therapy were greater than costs for surgery or radiotherapy. However, this trend was not seen in Europe, where surgery incurred a higher cost than radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Most studies investigating the direct healthcare costs of HNC have utilized US databases of claims to public and private payers. Data from these studies suggested that costs generally are higher for HNC patients with recurrent and/or metastatic disease, for patients undergoing surgery, and for those patients insured by private payers. Further work is needed, particularly in Europe and other regions outside the USA; prospective studies assessing the cost associated with HNC would allow for more systematic comparison of costs, and would provide valuable economic information to payers, providers, and patients.","[Wissinger, Erika; Foster, Talia] Evidera, Lexington, MA USA; [Griebsch, Ingolf; Lungershausen, Juliane] Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH & Co KG, Ingelheim, Germany; [Pashos, Chris L.] UBC, Lexington, MA 02420 USA",Evidera; Boehringer Ingelheim,"Pashos, CL (通讯作者)，UBC, 430 Bedford St,Suite 100, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",clpashos@msn.com,"Griebsch, Ingolf/JRW-6501-2023",,Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH,Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH(Boehringer Ingelheim),"This research was funded in part by Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH.

These thresholds were based upon criteria set out by the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which reflected the potential economic returns of interventions. The CHOICE project sought to evaluate a variety of health interventions at a subregional level and classify them into broad categories to help assist decision makers, but the utility of the thresholds for within-country decision making for individual interventions (given budgetary constraints) has not been adequately explored. To examine whether the 'WHO-CHOICE thresholds' reflect funding decisions, we examined the results of two recent reviews of cost-effectiveness analyses of human papillomavirus and rotavirus vaccination in LMICs, and we assessed whether the results of these studies were reflected in funding decisions for these vaccination programmes. We found that in many cases, programmes that were deemed cost effective were not subsequently implemented in the country. We consider the implications of this finding, the advantages and disadvantages of alternative methods to estimate thresholds, and how cost perspectives and the funders of healthcare may impact on these choices.","[Newall, A.

We investigate this issue by examining the predictive power of three implied volatility indices, VIX, VXN and VDAX, on the underlying index returns. We extend previous research by also focusing on characterised selected stocks and examine the relationship between implied volatility indices and future returns across different sectors and classified portfolios. Our findings suggest that implied volatility indices are good predictors of 20-days and 60-days forward looking returns and illustrate insignificant predictive power for very short term (1-day and 5-days) returns.","[Rubbaniy, G.] Zayed Univ, Coll Business, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Asmerom, Robel] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas] Lahore Sch Econ, Lahore, Pakistan; [Naqvi, Bushra] Lahore Univ Management Sci, SDSB, Lahore, Pakistan",Zayed University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Lahore School of Economics; Lahore University of Management Sciences,"Rizvi, SKA (通讯作者)，Lahore Sch Econ, Main Campus,Burki Rd, Lahore, Pakistan.",kumail@lahoreschool.edu.pk,"Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas/AAR-2381-2021; Rubbaniy, Ghulame/AAK-6262-2020","Naqvi, Bushra/0000-0002-1990-3547; Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas/0000-0003-1246-0912",,,,,23,19,23,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The objectives of this study were (a) to perform a systematic literature review to identify existing health economic evaluation models for economic evaluation of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in RA; and (b) to test the appropriateness of a stepwise model-selection process. First, we searched Medline and Embase to identify relevant studies in the English language, published between 1 January 2002 and 31 August 2012. From the included studies, all unique models were identified. Second, we applied a multi-step approach to model selection. Models that did not meet all minimal methodological and structural requirements based on the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) criteria were excluded. Next, models were assessed on the basis of their fit when transferred to the Dutch health care setting. The criteria for model fit were transferability factors, as published by Welte et al., after exclusion of those that were deemed transferable by simple adaptation. Finally, the remaining models underwent a general quality check using the Philips checklist. Models showing good fit and high quality were considered to be transferable to the Dutch health care setting, using simple adaptation. The systematic literature search identified 498 articles, which included 33 unique health economic evaluation models. Only six models passed the minimal methodological and structural requirements. Two of these models had an imperfect transferability fit to the Dutch health care setting, according to the Welte method. The remaining four models were, according to the Philips method, of good quality and were expected to be transferable by a simple adaptation. This study introduces a stepwise approach for selecting health economic evaluation models that are transferable by a simple adaptation. The approach seems feasible and can be applied in various therapeutic areas, provided that the minimal methodological and structural requirements are defined accordingly. Availability of health economic evaluation models coupled with structured model selection could improve the efficiency, quality and comparability of health economic research.","[van Haalen, H. G.

We make three contributions. First, we provide a necessary condition for incentive compatibility that takes the form of an envelope formula for the derivative of an agent's equilibrium expected payoff with respect to his current type. It combines the familiar marginal effect of types on payoffs with novel marginal effects of the current type on future ones that are captured by impulse response functions. The formula yields an expression for dynamic virtual surplus that is instrumental to the design of optimal mechanisms and to the study of distortions under such mechanisms. Second, we characterize the transfers that satisfy the envelope formula and establish a sense in which they are pinned down by the allocation rule (revenue equivalence). Third, we characterize perfect Bayesian equilibrium-implementable allocation rules in Markov environments, which yields tractable sufficient conditions that facilitate novel applications. We illustrate the results by applying them to the design of optimal mechanisms for the sale of experience goods (bandit auctions).","[Pavan, Alessandro] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Segal, Ilya] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Toikka, Juuso] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Northwestern University; Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Pavan, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",alepavan@northwestern.edu; ilya.segal@stanford.edu; toikka@mit.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0961693] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,54,189,235,2,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2014,82.0,2,,,,,601,653,,10.3982/ECTA10269,0.0,,,53,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AE0TF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333678400005,0

We discuss Jeffreys priors, the connection to the errors-in-the-variables problems and more general error distributions. We propose, as an alternative to the inverted Wishart prior, a new Cholesky-based prior for the covariance matrix of the errors in IV regressions. We argue that this prior is more flexible and more robust thanthe inverted Wishart prior since it is not based on only one tightness parameter and therefore can be more informative about certain components of the covariance matrix and less informative about others. We show how prior-posterior inference can be formulated in a Gibbs sampler and compare its performance in the weak instruments case for synthetic as well as two illustrations based on well-known real data.","[Lopes, Hedibert F.; Polson, Nicholas G.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Lopes, HF (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",hlopes@chicagobooth.edu,"Lopes, Heno F/H-9825-2013","Lopes, Hedibert/0000-0002-8429-0353",University of Chicago Booth School of Business,University of Chicago Booth School of Business(University of Chicago),"The authors would like to thank The University of Chicago Booth School of Business for providing financial support for our research.

Since this problem is time inconsistent we attack it by placing the problem within a game theoretic framework and look for subgame perfect Nash equilibrium strategies. This particular problem has already been studied in Basak and Chabakauri where the authors assumed a constant risk aversion parameter. This assumption leads to an equilibrium control where the dollar amount invested in the risky asset is independent of current wealth, and we argue that this result is unrealistic from an economic point of view. In order to have a more realistic model we instead study the case when the risk aversion depends dynamically on current wealth. This is a substantially more complicated problem than the one with constant risk aversion but, using the general theory of time-inconsistent control developed in Bjork and Murgoci, we provide a fairly detailed analysis on the general case. In particular, when the risk aversion is inversely proportional to wealth, we provide an analytical solution where the equilibrium dollar amount invested in the risky asset is proportional to current wealth. The equilibrium for this model thus appears more reasonable than the one for the model with constant risk aversion.","[Bjoerk, Tomas] Stockholm Sch Econ, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Murgoci, Agatha] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zhou, Xun Yu] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Stockholm School of Economics; Copenhagen Business School; University of Oxford,"Björk, T (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Finance, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",Tomas.Bjork@hhs.se,,"Murgoci, Agatha/0000-0002-6998-0137",,,,,21,299,325,13,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

In particular, we extend the recently introduced FEM-BV-GEV framework for statistical regression analysis of block-maxima based on Generalized Extreme Value distribution (GEV) [1]. Thereby the presence of systematically missing covariates is reflected by the non-stationarity of the model parameters. The involved non-stationarity and the ill-posedness of the inverse problem are resolved by deploying the Finite Element time series analysis Methodology with Bounded Variation of model parameters (FEM-BV) [2]. The proposed FEM-BV-GPD approach allows a well-posed problem formulation and goes beyond probabilistic a priori assumptions of methods for analysis of extremes based on, e.g., non-stationary Bayesian mixture models and smoothing kernel methods. The robustness of the FEM-BV-GPD approach with respect to the systematically missing information is presented on a test-case.","[Kaiser, Olga; Horenko, Illia] Univ Lugano, Inst Computat Sci, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland",Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Kaiser, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lugano, Inst Computat Sci, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland.",olga.kaiser@usi.ch; illia.horenko@usi.ch,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,1,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,836,847,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600095,0

For a given number of cointegration relationships, general hypothesis testing is considered, where testing for linearity is of particular interest. Under the null of linearity, parameters of nonlinear components vanish, leading to a nonstandard testing problem. We apply so-called sup-tests to resolve this issue, which requires development of new (uniform) functional central limit theory and results for convergence of stochastic integrals. We provide a full asymptotic theory for estimators and test statistics. The derived asymptotic results prove to be nonstandard compared to results found elsewhere in the literature due to the impact of the estimated cointegration relations. This complicates implementation of tests motivating the introduction of bootstrap versions that are simple to compute. A simulation study shows that the finite-sample properties of the bootstrapped tests are satisfactory with good size and power properties for reasonable sample sizes.","[Kristensen, Dennis] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kristensen, Dennis] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Rahbek, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Copenhagen,"Kristensen, D (通讯作者)，UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",d.kristensen@ucl.ac.uk,"; Kristensen, Dennis/A-7894-2009","Rahbek, Anders/0000-0002-2549-1913; Kristensen, Dennis/0000-0001-9713-1784","Danish National Research Foundation; Velux Foundation; National Science Foundation [SES-0961596]; Danish Council for Independent Research, Social Sciences [10-079774]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1, ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F015879/1, ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); Velux Foundation(Velux Fonden); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Danish Council for Independent Research, Social Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","We thank the co-editor Michael Jansson and editor Peter C.

Electronic searches in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library) identified the cost-effectiveness models. Modeling approaches and structural assumptions were abstracted for all models. For three case studies of multiple analyses that compared the cost effectiveness of two drug regimens using the same clinical data inputs, differences in results were compared with differences in modeling approaches and structural assumptions. Forty-one model publications were reviewed. Recent models included Monte Carlo simulations, Markov models, or discrete-event simulation models, all including multiple lines of therapy and capturing the long-expected duration of efficacy of highly active antiretroviral therapy. In the three case studies, assumptions about the duration of efficacy after the trial time period, whether differences between the two regimens persist after the trial time period, the sequence of regimens after initial regimen failure, and the cost and utility assigned to adverse events, but not the modeling approach, were the most important factors in explaining differences in the results. As the models and treatment pathways get more complex, models should be validated using clinical trial data and local observational databases. The results of sensitivity analyses testing the impact of the structural assumptions that might change the results as identified in this review should also be presented in modeling papers.","RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",Research Triangle Institute,"Mauskopf, J (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 200 Pk Off Dr,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",jmauskopf@rti.org,,"Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548",,,,,48,10,11,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2013,31.0,11,,,,,1031,1050,,10.1007/s40273-013-0098-6,0.0,,,20,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,257ZD,24234860.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000327425600006,0

Recently, rivaroxaban, a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) which offers some distinct advantages over warfarin, the standard of care in a world without NOACs, has been introduced and is now recommended by international guidelines. The aim of this study was to evaluate, from a Belgian healthcare payer perspective, the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus use of warfarin for the treatment of patients with non-valvular AF at moderate to high risk. A Markov model was designed and populated with local cost estimates, safety-on-treatment clinical results from the pivotal phase III ROCKET AF trial and utility values obtained from the literature. Rivaroxaban treatment was associated with fewer ischemic strokes and systemic embolisms (0.308 vs. 0.321 events), intracranial bleeds (0.048 vs. 0.063), and myocardial infarctions (0.082 vs. 0.095) per patient compared with warfarin. Over a lifetime time horizon, rivaroxaban led to a reduction of 0.042 life-threatening events per patient, and increases of 0.111 life-years and 0.094 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) versus warfarin treatment. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a,not sign8,809 per QALY or a,not sign7,493 per life-year gained. These results are based on valuated data from 2010. Sensitivity analysis indicated that these results were robust and that rivaroxaban is cost-effective compared with warfarin in 87 % of cases should a willingness-to-pay threshold of a,not sign35,000/QALY gained be considered. The present analysis suggests that rivaroxaban is a cost-effective alternative to warfarin therapy for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF in the Belgian healthcare setting.","[Kleintjens, Joris; Li, Xiao; Saka, Omer] Deloitte Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Grp, Brussels, Belgium; [Simoens, Steven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, Louvain, Belgium; [Thijs, Vincent] VIB, Neurobiol Lab, Vesalius Res Ctr, Louvain, Belgium; [Thijs, Vincent] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Expt Neurol Dept Neurosci, Louvain, Belgium; [Thijs, Vincent] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Leuven Res Inst Neurosci & Dis LIND, Louvain, Belgium; [Thijs, Vincent] Univ Hosp Leuven, Dept Neurol, Louvain, Belgium; [Goethals, Marnix] Mariaziekenhuis Noord Limburg, Overpelt, Belgium; [Rietzschel, Ernst R.] Univ Ghent, Dept Internal Med Cardiovasc Dis, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Rietzschel, Ernst R.] Ghent Univ Hosp, Ghent, Belgium; [Rietzschel, Ernst R.] Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Asukai, Yumi] IMS Hlth, London, England; [Evers, Thomas] Bayer HealthCare, Global Market Access HEOR, Wuppertal, Germany; [Faes, Petra; Vansieleghem, Stefaan; De Ruyck, Mimi] Bayer HealthCare, Market Access Dept, B-1831 Diegem, Machelen, Belgium",Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited; KU Leuven; Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB); KU Leuven; KU Leuven; KU Leuven; KU Leuven; University Hospital Leuven; Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University Hospital; Ghent University; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals,"De Ruyck, M (通讯作者)，Bayer HealthCare, Market Access Dept, JE Mommaertslaan 14, B-1831 Diegem, Machelen, Belgium.",mimi.deruyck@bayer.com,"Thijs, Vincent/C-3647-2009; Li, Xiao/AAV-3113-2020","Thijs, Vincent/0000-0002-6614-8417; Li, Xiao/0000-0002-1918-1791; Simoens, Steven/0000-0002-9512-2005",Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals; Bayer Healthcare,Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals(Bayer AGBayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals); Bayer Healthcare(Bayer AGBayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals),"This study was supported by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals.

Invertibility of demand is important in several contexts, including identification of demand, estimation of demand, testing of revealed preference, and economic theory exploiting existence of an inverse demand function or (in an exchange economy) uniqueness of Walrasian equilibrium prices. We introduce the notion of connected substitutes and show that this structure is sufficient for invertibility. The connected substitutes conditions require weak substitution between all goods and sufficient strict substitution to necessitate treating them in a single demand system. The connected substitutes conditions have transparent economic interpretation, are easily checked, and are satisfied in many standard models. They need only hold under some transformation of demand and can accommodate many models in which goods are complements. They allow one to show invertibility without strict gross substitutes, functional form restrictions, smoothness assumptions, or strong domain restrictions. When the restriction to weak substitutes is maintained, our sufficient conditions are also nearly necessary for even local invertibility.","[Berry, Steven; Haile, Philip] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gandhi, Amit] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Yale University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Berry, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, 37 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",steven.berry@yale.edu; agandhi@ssc.wisc.edu; philip.haile@yale.edu,"Berry, Steven/AAD-9621-2021",,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This paper combines and expands on selected material first explored in Gandhi ( 2008) and Berry and Haile (2009).

The goal of the scheme is to maintain the stable purchasing power of the plan participants, i.e., to minimize the square deviations of the distribution and a predetermined level by choosing the optimal dynamic asset allocation proportions. We formalize the problem into a continuous-time stochastic optimal control problem and establish the optimal dynamic asset allocation strategy by stochastic dynamic programming method.

If returns or losses follow a multivariate elliptical distribution, the use of risk measures that satisfy certain well-known properties is equivalent to risk management in the classical mean-variance framework. The tail mean-variance criterion does not satisfy these properties, however, and the precise optimal solution typically requires the use of numerical methods. We use a convex optimization method and a mean-variance characterization to find an explicit and easily implementable solution for the tail mean variance model. When a risk-free asset is available, the optimal portfolio is altered in a way that differs from the classical mean-variance setting. A complete solution to the optimal portfolio in the presence of a risk-free asset is also provided. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
