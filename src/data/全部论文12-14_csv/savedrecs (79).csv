Our setting encompasses asymmetric interaction and heterogeneous agents' characteristics. We examine the impact of a rise of cross-effects on aggregate efforts. We show that the sign of the comparative static effects is related to a condition of balancedness of the interaction. Moreover, we point out that asymmetry and heterogeneous characteristics are sources of non-monotonic variation of aggregate efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze the case when in addition to this so called context-effects bias there is also a concern for flexibility, in the spirit of the literature initiated by Kreps (1979) and Dekel et al. (2001). Since the context-effects bias and the desire for flexibility both increase the inclination of a decision maker to choose larger menus, our analysis allows the disentangling of the effect of the behavioral bias from the effect of the rational desire from flexibility. We find a weak condition on the set of ex post preferences under which the two effects are identifiable. We show that our representation is essentially unique. From a methodological viewpoint, our paper provides a novel technique of identifying probabilities on the state space of subjective uncertainty introduced by Dekel et al. (2001) when this state space is infinite. This method renders the infinite state space essentially finite with respect to a certain salient property. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We consider two distance functions the Shephard output distance function and the directional output distance function and define both in price space. The former is multiplicative in nature and satisfies homogeneity, whereas the latter is additive and satisfies the translation property. Functional equation methods yield the translog specification in the case of the Shephard distance function and a quadratic specification in the case of the directional distance function. Monte Carlo evidence suggests that the quadratic specification outperforms the translog in large samples and in true models with plenty of curvature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This evidence is based on testing linearity against either smooth nonlinearity or piece-wise linearity, but there is no framework that encompasses both. This paper provides an econometric framework that allows for both breaks and smooth nonlinearity in between breaks. We estimate the unknown break-dates simultaneously with other parameters via nonlinear least-squares. Using new central limit results for nonlinear processes, we provide inference methods on break-dates and parameter estimates and several instability tests.

In order to enable the minority nationalities to achieve full development in the society Chinese government conducts bilingual education among them. This article aims to investigate how bilingual education influences minority nationality students' construction of identity through the analysis of discourse. Critical discourse analysis and tools of SFL (systematic functional linguistics) is applied in the research. Through the analysis of three types of discourse, namely, Chinese textbooks, brief introduction of Minzu universities and the students' self-recommendation letters, the ideology of ethnic identity and national identity embodied in the discourse is revealed. It is found that the institutional discourse in educational community conveys a strong sense of nationalism, thus the bilingual education leads the minority nationality student to form a weak sense of ethnic identity, which is manifested in the self-recommendation letters. It is suggested that bilingual education among the minority students should not only cultivate students' national identification but also to cultivate students' ethnic identification and global identification, if students are to be prepared to deal with the community affairs and the international affairs.","[Cao, Yanping] Yunnan Normal Univ, Foreign Language Sch, Kunming, Peoples R China",Yunnan Normal University,,caoyanping2@sohu.com,"cao, yanping/E-3381-2010",,,,,,13,0,0,1,3,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-3900-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,12,,,,,,708,715,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA9CM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339165700137,0

Nevertheless, and contrary to the existing results in the bootstrap literature for regression models subject to error heteroskedasticity, the Edgeworth expansion for the pairs bootstrap that we develop here shows that this method is not second-order accurate. We argue that this is due to the fact that the conditional mean parameters of realized regression models are heterogeneous under stochastic volatility.

Common approaches that sum or average responses across different illness components must be unidimensional and have small unique variances to avoid aggregation bias and misinterpretation of clinical data. This study sought to evaluate the unidimensionality of the IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) and to explore person-centered cluster analytic methods for characterizing multivariate-based patient profiles. Methods: Ninety-eight Rome-diagnosed patients with IBS completed the IBS-SSS and a single, global item of symptom severity (UCLA Symptom Severity Scale) at pretreatment baseline of a clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health, k-means cluster analyses were performed on participants' symptom severity scores. Results: The IBS-SSS was not unidimensional. Exploratory cluster analyses revealed four common symptom profiles across five items of the IBS-SSS. One cluster of patients (25%) had elevated scores on pain frequency and bowel dissatisfaction, with less elevated but still high scores on life interference and low pain severity ratings. A second cluster (19%) was characterized by intermediate scores on both pain dimensions but more elevated scores on bowel dissatisfaction. A third cluster (18%) had elevated scores across all IBS-SSS subcomponents. The fourth and the most common cluster (37%) had relatively low scores on all dimensions except bowel dissatisfaction and life interference due to IBS symptoms. Conclusions: Patient-reported outcome end points and research on IBS more generally relying on multicomponent assessments of symptom severity should take into account the multidimensional structure of symptoms to avoid aggregation bias and to optimize the sensitivity of detecting treatment effects.","[Lackner, Jeffrey M.] SUNY Buffalo, Div Gastroenterol, Dept Med, ECMC, Buffalo, NY 14215 USA; [Jaccard, James] NYU, Silver Sch Social Work, New York, NY USA; [Baum, Charles] Takeda Pharmaceut Int, Deerfield, IL USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; New York University; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.","Lackner, JM (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Div Gastroenterol, Dept Med, ECMC, 462 Grider St, Buffalo, NY 14215 USA.",lackner@buffalo.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health/NIDDK [67878, 77738]",National Institutes of Health/NIDDK(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)),This research was supported in part by research grants 67878 and 77738 from the National Institutes of Health/NIDDK.,,40,9,9,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2013,16,1.0,,,,,97,103,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.08.2207,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,077WN,23337220.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314060200012,0

The variation in the characteristics and enactment date of the laws provides an opportunity to measure the impact of increasing access to mental health care on mental health outcomes, as evidenced by state suicide rates. In contrast with previous research, results show that when states enact laws requiring insurance coverage to include mental health benefits at parity with physical health benefits, the suicide rate decreases significantly by 5%.

The choice should depend primarily on the study design and the conceptual framework for that study.","[Norton, Edward C.; Miller, Morgen M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norton, Edward C.; Miller, Morgen M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wang, Jason J.; Coyne, Kasey; Kleinman, Lawrence C.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Hlth Evidence & Policy, New York, NY USA; [Kleinman, Lawrence C.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Pediat, New York, NY USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Norton, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, M3108 SPH 2,1415 Washington Hts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ecnorton@umich.edu,"Kleinman, Lawrence/AAS-6934-2021; , Edward/AAQ-1719-2021; Wang, Jason/AAG-8248-2019",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631; Kleinman, Lawrence/0000-0002-4024-2229","AHRQ [1R18HS018032]; NIH/NCRR [3UL1RR029887, 3UL1RR029887-03S1]",AHRQ(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); NIH/NCRR(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)),"Source of financial support: The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from AHRQ (Grant 1R18HS018032), NIH/NCRR (3UL1RR029887), and NIH/NCRR (3UL1RR029887-03S1).",,23,12,13,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1137,1140,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.001,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244817.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300019,0

The objectives of this article were to analyze the possible application of MCDA approaches in health technology assessment and to describe their relative advantages and disadvantages. Methods: This article begins with an introduction to the most common types of MCDA models and a critical review of state-of-the-art methods for incorporating multiple criteria in health technology assessment. An overview of MCDA is provided and is compared against the current UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence health technology appraisal process. A generic MCDA modeling approach is described, and the different MCDA modeling approaches are applied to a hypothetical case study. Results: A comparison of the different MCDA approaches is provided, and the generic issues that need consideration before the application of MCDA in health technology assessment are examined. Conclusions: There are general practical issues that might arise from using an MCDA approach, and it is suggested that appropriate care be taken to ensure the success of MCDA techniques in the appraisal process.","[Thokala, Praueen] Univ Sheffield, HEDS, ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Duenas, Alejandra] Sch Management LEM CNRS, IESEG, Paris, France",University of Sheffield; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IESEG School of Management,"Thokala, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, HEDS, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",p.thokala@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366",NICE Decision Support Unit,NICE Decision Support Unit,"Source of financial support: This research has received financial support from the NICE Decision Support Unit, but NICE had no responsibility or control over the content of this article.",,67,203,222,1,82,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1172,1181,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.015,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244821.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300023,0

The idea is that all the players have the same chances to make proposals. This means that players maintain their own right to talk when joining a coalition. The resulting value coincides with the weighted Shapley value in the game between coalitions, with weights given by the size of the coalitions. Moreover, the Harsanyi paradox (forming a coalition may be disadvantageous) disappears for convex games. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

First, we consider Markov processes with possible conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown forms and establish the consistency, asymptotic normality, and semi-parametric efficiency of the LGMM estimator. Second, we undertake a higher-order asymptotic expansion and demonstrate that the LGMM estimator possesses some appealing bias reduction properties for positively autocorrelated processes. Our analysis of the asymptotic expansion of the LGMM estimator reveals an interesting contrast with the OLS estimator that helps to shed light on the nature of the bias correction performed by the LGMM estimator. The practical importance of these findings is evaluated in terms of a bond and option pricing exercise based on a diffusion model for spot interest rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike previous proposals, our method does not require smooth estimation of the derivatives of nonparametric curves. Distinguishing features of our approach are that critical values are pivotal under the null in finite samples and that the test is invariant to any monotonic continuous transformation of the explanatory variable. The test statistic is the sup-norm of the difference between the empirical copula function and its least concave majorant with respect to the explanatory variable coordinate. The resulting test is able to detect local alternatives converging to the null at the parametric rate n(-1/2), with n the sample size. The finite sample performance of the test is examined by means of a Monte Carlo experiment and an application to testing intergenerational income mobility. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The core findings are that birth year exposure to malaria eradication was associated with increases in Raven Progressive Matrices test scores and consumption expenditures, but not schooling. Additionally, cohorts born after eradication both entered and exited school earlier than their pre-eradication counterparts. These effects were only seen for men and explanations for this are assessed. Collectively, these findings suggest that improvements in infant health help explain secular increases in cognitive test scores, that better cognition may link early life health to adulthood earnings, and that human capital investments through childhood and young adulthood respond sensitively to market returns to early life endowment shocks.

We provide a nonparametric theory of leverage estimation in the context of a continuous-time stochastic volatility model with jumps in returns, jumps in variance, or both. Leverage is defined as a flexible function of the state of the firm, as summarized by the spot variance level. We show that its point-wise functional estimates have asymptotic properties (in terms of rates of convergence, limiting biases, and limiting variances) which crucially depend on the likelihood of the individual jumps and co-jumps as well as on the features of the jump size distributions. Empirically, we find economically important time-variation in leverage with more negative values associated with higher variance levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, there is little guidance on how individual-specific preferences and cost data can be combined to inform health care decisions about customized care. Therefore, we propose a discrete choice experiment-based approach that illustrates how to analyze the cost-effectiveness of customized (and noncustomized) care programs to provide information for hospital managers. Methods: We exploit the fact that choice models make it possible to determine whether preference heterogeneity exists and to obtain individual-specific parameter estimates. We present an approach of how to combine these individual-specific parameter estimates from a random parameter model (mixed logit model) with cost data to analyze the cost-effectiveness of customized care and demonstrate our method in the case of follow-up after breast cancer treatment. Results: We found that there is significant preference heterogeneity for all except two attributes of breast cancer treatment follow-up and that the fully customized care program leads to higher utility and lower costs than the current standardized program. Compared with the single alternative program, the fully customized care program has increased benefits and higher costs. Thus, it is necessary for health care decision makers to judge whether the use of resources for customized care is cost-effective. Conclusions: Decision makers should consider using the results obtained from our methodological approach when they consider implementing customized health care programs, because it may help to find ways to save costs and increase patient satisfaction.","[Benning, Tim M.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Kimman, Merel L.] George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kimman, Merel L.; Boersma, Liesbeth J.] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, GROW Res Inst, Dept Radiat Oncol,Maastro Clin, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Dirksen, Carmen D.] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Boersma, Liesbeth J.] MAASTRO Clin, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Dellaert, Benedict G.

The paper incorporates behavioral elements involved in the process of dieting: effort exerted in dieting, influence of social norms concerning body weight, time-inconsistent present biased preferences, and a distinction between naivete and sophistication. The model explains cyclic dieting and provides interesting insights on the extent of weight-loss dieting. The extent of dieting is an increasing function of initial body weight and a decreasing function of the effort exerted in dieting and the strength of social norms concerning ideal weight. Income and diet strictness have an ambiguous effect. In addition, greater dieting efforts are not necessarily balanced against a slowdown in body metabolism or a higher initial body weight.

The incentive schemes can be based on output measures, interpreted as the principal's payoffs, as well as input measures, regarded as observation of some of the agents' efforts. We identify that a unifying feature of the optimal incentive schemes, called all-or-nothing payments, arises in three natural scenarios of the general framework: unobservable inputs, verifiable inputs, and observable but unverifiable inputs. Our framework and results embed and generalize several previous studies on multitask principal-agent problems with a limited liability constraint. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A Framework for Coverage Decisions",VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,cost-effectiveness; coverage with evidence development; health technology assessment; only in research; patient access scheme,HEALTH TECHNOLOGY-ASSESSMENT; OUTCOMES; DRUGS; CARE; MEDICARE; PAYMENT; NHS,"Background: Until recently, purchasers' options regarding whether to pay for the use of medical technologies have been binary in nature: a treatment is either covered or not. Policies, however, have emerged that expand the decision options, for example, linking coverage to evidence development, an option increasingly used for treatments with limited/uncertain evidence. There has been little effort to reconcile the features of technologies with the available decision options. Methods: We described a framework within which different decision options can be evaluated. We distinguished two sources of value in terms of health: the value of the technology per se and the value of reducing decision uncertainty. The costs of reversing decisions were also considered. Findings: Purchasers should weigh the expected benefits of coverage against the possibility that the decision may need to be reversed and the chance that adoption will hinder evidence generation. Based on the purchaser's range of authority over access, research, and price and on the characteristics of the technology with regard to reversibility and evidence, different decisions may be appropriate. The framework clarified the assessments needed to establish the appropriateness of different decisions. A taxonomy of coverage decisions was suggested. Conclusions: A range of decision options may facilitate paying for the use of promising medical technologies despite their uncertain evidence. It is important that the option be chosen on the basis of not only the expected value of a technology but also the value of further research, the anticipated effect of coverage on further research, and the costs associated with reversing the decision.","[Walker, Simon; Sculpher, Mark; Claxton, Karl; Palmer, Steve] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Claxton, Karl] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Walker, S (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",simon.walker@york.ac.uk,,"Walker, Simon Mark/0000-0002-5750-3691; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913","Pfizer; National Institute for Health Research NHS; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE); Medical Research Council [MC_U145079308, G0802659] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0802659, MC_U145079308] Funding Source: UKRI",Pfizer(Pfizer); National Institute for Health Research NHS; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This work was supported in part by an unrestricted educational grant from Pfizer.

Unlike the classical regression dealing exclusively with mean relationship, our model can be used to analyze the entire dependent structure in distribution. Technically, we treat density functions as random elements and represent the regression relationship as a compact linear operator in the Hilbert spaces of square integrable functions. We propose a consistent estimation procedure for our model, and develop a test to investigate the dependent structure of moments. An empirical example is provided to illustrate how our methodology can be implemented in practical applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For such a model, we derive the asymptotic theory of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator. In particular, we establish consistency and obtain limit distribution. The limit distribution is generally non-Gaussian and represented as a functional of Brownian motions. However, it becomes Gaussian if the covariate has innovation uncorrelated with the squared innovation of the model or the volatility function is linear in parameter. We provide a simulation study to demonstrate the relevance and usefulness of our asymptotic theory. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper is to analyse this relationship at the household level for Fiji, a developing country in the South Pacific, using original household survey data. To allow for the endogeneity of SES status in the household health production function, we utilize a simultaneous equation approach where estimates are achieved by full information maximum likelihood. By restricting our sample to one, relatively small island, and including area and district hospital effects, physical geography effects are unpacked from income effects. We measure SES, as permanent income which is constructed using principal components analysis. An alternative specification considers transitory household income. We find that a 1% increase in wealth (our measure of permanent income) would lead to a 15% decrease in the probability of an incapacitating illness occurring intra-household. Although the presence of a strong relationship indicates that relatively small improvements in SES status can significantly improve health at the household level, it is argued that the design of appropriate policy would also require an understanding of the various mechanisms through which the relationship operates.

Models are estimated using restricted-use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2000-2005. The IV model, which exploits genetic variation in weight as a natural experiment, yields estimates of the impact of obesity on medical costs that are considerably higher than the estimates reported in the previous literature. For example, obesity is associated with $656 higher annual medical care costs, but the IV results indicate that obesity raises annual medical costs by $2741 (in 2005 dollars). These results imply that the previous literature has underestimated the medical costs of obesity, resulting in underestimates of the economic rationale for government intervention to reduce obesity-related externalities.

We used clinic blood pressure readings, patients' tolerance, and cost saving as measures to evaluate the impact of a therapeutic interchange program implemented at a medical center in Taiwan. Methods: Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital initiated a therapeutic interchange program involving angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Data were retrospectively collected for 444 outpatients who were converted from other ARBs to candesartan. Evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, adverse effects associated with therapy, and drug costs was conducted before and after the program implementation. Results: Patients whose treatment was converted to candesartan experienced no statistically significant differences in blood pressure, and the average number of antihy-pertensive agents used per patient remained unchanged. A direct cost savings of US$62,237 was estimated for the 444 patients studied. Only 3.15% of the patients developed adverse drug reactions potentially related to candesartan, and none required hospitalization. Conclusions: Based on the results of this retrospective chart review, the present ARB therapeutic interchange program was successfully developed and implemented. This is the first study to establish the positive impact of a well-run ARB therapeutic interchange program in Taiwan.","[Lee, Yen-Ying; Yen, Yu-Hsuan; Chen, Hsiang-Yin] Taipei Med Univ, Wan Fang Hosp, Dept Pharm, Taipei 116, Taiwan; [Lin, You-Meei] Taipei Med Univ, Shuang Ho Hosp, Dept Pharm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lee, Yen-Ying; Lin, You-Meei; Yen, Yu-Hsuan; Chen, Hsiang-Yin] Taipei Med Univ, Sch Pharm, Taipei 116, Taiwan; [Hsiao, Paul] Santa Clara Valley Hlth & Hosp Syst, Dept Pharm, San Jose, CA USA",Taipei Medical University; Taipei Municipal WanFang Hospital; Taipei Medical University; Shuang Ho Hospital; Taipei Medical University,"Chen, HY (通讯作者)，Taipei Med Univ, Wan Fang Hosp, Dept Pharm, 111,Sec 3,Hsing Long Rd, Taipei 116, Taiwan.",shawn@tmu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Shawn Hsiang-Yin/0000-0001-5535-7152",,,,,26,2,2,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S111,S115,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.001,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265056.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000020,0

There is an ongoing, heated policy debate over whether these laws have increased marijuana use among non-patients. In this paper, I address that question empirically by studying marijuana possession arrests in cities from 1988 to 2008. I estimate fixed effects models with city-specific time trends that can condition on unobserved heterogeneities across cities in both their levels and trends. I find that these laws increase marijuana arrests among adult males by about 15-20%. These results are further validated by findings from data on treatment admissions to rehabilitation facilities: marijuana treatments among adult males increased by 10-20% after the passage of medical marijuana laws.

How rare disease is defined therefore has major financial implications, both for pharmaceutical companies and for insurers or public drug reimbursement programs. All existing definitions are based, somewhat arbitrarily, on disease incidence or prevalence. Objectives: What is proposed here is a functional definition of rare based on an assessment of the feasibility of measuring the efficacy of a new treatment in conventional randomized controlled trials, to inform regulatory authorities and funding agencies charged with assessing new therapies being considered for public funding. Methods: It involves a five-step process, involving significant negotiations between patient advocacy groups, pharmaceutical companies, physicians, and public drug reimbursement programs, designed to establish the feasibility of carrying out a randomized controlled trial with sufficient statistical power to show a clinically significant treatment effect Results and Conclusions: The steps are as follows: 1) identification of a specific disease, including appropriate genetic definition; 2) identification of clinically relevant outcomes to evaluate efficacy; 3) establishment of the inherent variability of measurements of clinically relevant outcomes; 4) calculation of the sample size required to assess the efficacy of a new treatment with acceptable statistical power; and 5) estimation of the difficulty of recruiting an adequate sample size given the estimated prevalence or incidence of the disorder in the population and the inclusion criteria to be used","[Clarke, Joe T.

Methods: A systematic review of the published literature (1990-2010) using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PsychINFO identified studies examining the application of health psychology theory to adherence to medication in adult patients. Two independent reviewers extracted data on medication, indication, study population, adherence measure, theory, model, survey instruments, and results. Heterogeneity in theoretical model specification and empirical investigation precluded a meta analysis of data. Results: Of 1756 unique records, 67 articles were included (sociocognitive = 35, self-regulation = 21, social support = 11). Adherence was most commonly measured by self-report (50 of 67). Synthesis of studies highlighted the significance (P <= 0.05) of self-efficacy (17 of 19), perceived barriers (11 of 17), perceived susceptibility (3 of 6), necessity beliefs (8 of 9), and medication concerns (7 of 8).

The results of genetic tests oftentimes may not lead to well-defined clinical interventions; however, Lynch syndrome, a genetic mutation for which carriers are at an increased risk for colorectal cancer, can be identified through genetic testing, and meaningful health interventions are available via increased colonoscopic surveillance. Valuations of test information for such conditions ought to account for the full impact of interventions and contingent outcomes. Objectives: To conduct a discrete-choice experiment to elicit individuals' preferences for genetic test information. Methods: A Web-enabled discrete-choice experiment survey was administered to a representative sample of US residents aged SO years and older. In addition to specifying expenditures on colonoscopies, respondents were asked to make a series of nine selections between two hypothetical genetic tests or a no test option under the premise that a relative had Lynch syndrome. The hypothetical genetic tests were defined by the probability of developing colorectal cancer, the probability of a false-negative test result, privacy of the result, and out-of-pocket cost A model specification identifying necessary interactions was derived from assumptions of risk behavior and the decision context and was estimated using random-parameters logit. Results: A total of 650 respondents were contacted, and 385 completed the survey. The monetary equivalent of test information was approximately $1800. Expenditures on colonoscopies to reduce mortality risks affected valuations. Respondents with lower income or who reported being employed significantly valued genetic tests more. Conclusion: Genetic testing may confer benefits through the impact of subsequent interventions on private individuals.","[Kilambi, Vikram] Northwestern Univ, Ctr Engn & Hlth, Evanston, IL USA; [Johnson, F.

We analyze a process of heuristics based on ex-post regret as a guide to understand how to play games of incomplete information with private values. While our dynamics has a strong component of inertia, its key is that with a small probability actions are modified in the direction of ex-post regrets. We apply stochastic stability to identify the strategies that will be used in the long run in 2 x 2 games (i.e., two players with two actions each). For a class of 2 x 2 games, which includes quasi-supermodular games satisfying weak dominance, the resulting theory predicts cautious behavior in the long run, as stochastically stable strategies are minimax regret equilibria. A minimax regret equilibrium is independent of the beliefs about the opponents' types and actions (only the supports matter) and suggests a safe way to play the game. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Valid tools to measure the patient-reported impact of nocturia are essential for evaluating the value of treatment, but the available tools are suboptimal. Objectives: This study reports the development and validation of the Nocturia Impact Diary an augmented form of the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire designed to be completed in conjunction with the widely used 3-day voiding diary. Methods: The process comprised three steps: Step 1: Development of a concept pool using the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire and data from relevant studies; Step 2: Content validity study; Step 3: Psychometric testing of construct validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the diary in a randomized, placebo controlled study in patients with nocturia. Results: Step 1: Fourteen items and 4 domains were included in the first draft of the diary. Step 2: Twenty-three patients with nocturia participated in the cognitive debriefing study. Items were adjusted accordingly, and the content validity was high. Step 3: Fifty-six patients were randomized to desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet or placebo. The diary demonstrated high construct validity, with good sensitivity and a good fit to Rasch model, as well as high internal consistency, discriminatory ability, and acceptable sensitivity to change. Results indicated that the diary was unidimensional. Conclusions: The Nocturia Impact Diary is a convenient, validated patient-reported outcome measure it should be used in conjunction with a voiding diary to capture the real-life consequences of nocturia and its treatment.","[Holm-Larsen, Tove] Pharma Evidence, Farum, Denmark; [Holm-Larsen, Tove] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Drug Design & Pharmacol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Andersson, Fredrik; van der Meulen, Egbert; Norgaard, Jens Peter] Ferring Int PharmaSci Ctr, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Andersson, Fredrik] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Med Technol Assessment, Linkoping, Sweden; [Yankov, Vladimir] Ferring Pharmaceut Inc, Parsippany, NJ USA; [Rosen, Raymond C.] New England Res Inst, Watertown, MA USA","University of Copenhagen; Ferring Pharmaceuticals; Linkoping University; Ferring Pharmaceuticals; HealthCore, Inc","Andersson, F (通讯作者)，Ferring Pharmaceut AS, Kay Fiskers Plads 11, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark.",fredrik.andersson@ferring.com,,"Holm-Larsen, Tove/0009-0003-3108-303X",Ferring Pharmaceuticals,Ferring Pharmaceuticals(Ferring Pharmaceuticals),This study was sponsored by Ferring Pharmaceuticals.,,28,14,14,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2014,17,6.0,,,,,696,706,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.06.007,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AP8XS,25236993.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342363300005,0

The qualification may be time-constant as in gender, or time-varying as in residential location. When the qualification is time-varying, there appear four groups: the newly qualified (in-movers), the already qualified (in-stayers), the newly disqualified (out-movers), and the already disqualified (out-stayers). A change in qualification may affect the response variable of interest even when the treatment effect is zero, which is an 'untreated moving effect'. Also, when the treatment effect is not zero, it may be different across the four groups. The conventional difference in differences fails to remove untreated moving effects and ignores the possible treatment effect heterogeneity across the groups. This paper shows how to account for untreated moving effects and proposes 'the effect on in-stayers' as the main effect of interest. Our proposal can be implemented with least squares estimator for panel models or with nonparametric methods.

One class is based on the COP; another is based on smoother functions. We show that the test statistics are asymptotically normal under the null hypothesis and a sequence of Pitman local alternatives. We also show that the tests possess an asymptotic optimality property in terms of average power. Simulations suggest that the tests are well behaved in finite samples. Applications to some economic and financial time series indicate that our tests reveal some interesting nonlinear causal relations which the traditional linear Granger causality test fails to detect.

Our model is motivated by an example in the theory of assets with short-selling where there is risk and ambiguity. Agents have Bewley's incomplete preferences. As an inertia principle is assumed in markets, equilibria are individually rational. It is shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an individually rational efficient allocation or of an equilibrium is that the relative interiors of the risk adjusted sets of probabilities intersect. The more risk averse, the more ambiguity averse the agents, the more likely is an equilibrium to exist. The paper then turns to incomplete preferences represented by a family of concave utility functions. Several definitions of efficiency and of equilibrium with inertia are considered. Sufficient conditions and necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the existence of efficient allocations and equilibria with inertia.","[Dana, R.

EVIDENCE FROM AN AUSTRALIAN PANEL,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,child health; income gradient; chronic conditions; panel data; Australia,FAMILY INCOME; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; ECONOMIC-STATUS; ORIGINS; CARE,"The literature to date shows that children from poorer households tend to have worse health than their peers, and the gap between them grows with age. We investigate whether and how health shocks (as measured by the onset of chronic conditions) contribute to the income-child health gradient and whether the contemporaneous or cumulative effects of income play important mitigating roles. We exploit a rich panel dataset with three panel waves called the Longitudinal Study of Australian children. Given the availability of three waves of data, we are able to apply a range of econometric techniques (e. g. fixed and random effects) to control for unobserved heterogeneity. The paper makes several contributions to the extant literature. First, it shows that an apparent income gradient becomes relatively attenuated in our dataset when the cumulative and contemporaneous effects of household income are distinguished econometrically. Second, it demonstrates that the income-child health gradient becomes statistically insignificant when controlling for parental health and health-related behaviours or unobserved heterogeneity.

Statin use is associated with a small increase in BMI and moderate (20-33%) increases in the probability of being obese. Statin use was also associated with a significant (e.g., 15% of mean) increase in moderate alcohol use among men. There was no consistent evidence of a decrease in smoking associated with statin use, and exercise worsened somewhat for females. Statin use was associated with increased physical activity among males. Finally, there was evidence that statin use increased the use of blood pressure medication and aspirin for both males and females, although estimates varied considerably in magnitude. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that healthy diet is a strong substitute for statins, but there is only uneven evidence for the hypothesis that investments in disease prevention are complementary.

First, how has the practice of UK pediatric cost-utility analyses evolved over time, in particular how are health-related outcomes assessed and valued? Second, how do the methods compare to the limited guidance available, in particular, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) reference case(s)? Methods: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were conducted for the period May 2004 to April 2012 and the Paediatric Economic Database Evaluation database for the period May 2004 to December 2010. Identified studies were screened by three independent reviewers. Results: Forty-three studies were identified, 11 of which elicit utility values through primary research. A discrepancy was identified between the methods used for outcome measurement and valuation and the methods advocated within the NICE reference case. Despite NICE recommending the use of preference-based instruments designed specifically for children, most studies that were identified had used adult measures. In fact, the measurement of quality-adjusted life-years is the aspect of economic evaluation with the greatest amount of variability and the area that most digressed from the NICE reference case. Conclusions: Recommendations stemming from the review are that all studies should specify the age range of childhood and include separate statements of perspective for costs and effects as well as the reallocation of research funding away from systematic review studies toward good quality primary research measuring utilities in children.","[Adlard, Nick; Kinghorn, Philip; Frew, Emma] Univ Birmingham, Sch Hlth & Populat Sci, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Kinghorn, P (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Sch Hlth & Populat Sci, Hlth Econ Unit, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",p.kinghorn@bham.ac.uk,"Frew, Emma/AAO-5141-2021","Frew, Emma/0000-0002-5462-1158; Adlard, Nicholas/0000-0001-6912-1685; Kinghorn, Philip/0000-0002-9333-1962",,,,,57,17,18,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,454,461,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.02.007,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24969007.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900020,0

We also find that, in the presence of real micro uncertainty about individual endowments, the rate of inflation is higher (equivalently, the real rate of interest is lower) than it would be in a certainty-equivalent economy; to wit, one in which every agent's endowment is replaced by its expected value. Thus, underlying microeconomic uncertainty and borrowing constraints are shown to generate additional inflation.

Next, in a model that relaxes the constraint that agents have strict preferences over their potential mates, we show that no solution exists that satisfies Pareto optimality, anonymity, and converse consistency.

We develop an OLG model where longevity, pollution and growth are endogenous. The authorities may provide two types of public services, public health and environmental maintenance, that participate to extend agents' life expectancy and to sustain growth in the long term. We show that global dynamics might be featured by a high growth rate equilibrium, associated with longer life expectancy and an environmental poverty trap. We examine changes in public policies: increasing public intervention on health or environmental maintenance display opposite effects on global dynamics, i.e. on the size of the trap and on the level of the stable balanced growth path. On the contrary, each type of public policy induces a negative leverage on the long-run rate of growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We contrast the effects of two reforms for home health agencies. The home health interim payment system in 1997 lowered both types of payment; our conceptual model predicts a decline in the likelihood of use and costs, both of which we find.

This yields the rotated BEKK (RBEKK) model. The extension to DCC-type parameterizations is given, introducing the rotated DCC (RDCC) model.

This lack of investigation is surprising given that evidence from the contingent valuation literature suggests that welfare estimates are sensitive to different specifications of the utility function. Objective: This study investigates the effect of different specifications of the utility function on results within a DCE. Methods: The DCE elicited the public's preferences for waiting time for hip and knee replacement and estimated willingness to wait (WTW). Results: The results showed that the WTW for the different patient profiles varied considerably across the three different specifications of the utility function. Assuming a linear utility function led to much higher estimates of marginal rates of substitution (WTWs) than with nonlinear specifications.

Our results suggest that model averaging does not dominate other well designed prediction model specification methods, and that using hybrid combination factor/shrinkage methods often yields superior predictions. More specifically, when using recursive estimation windows, which dominate other windowing approaches, hybrid models are mean square forecast error best around 1/3 of the time, when used to predict 11 key macroeconomic indicators at various forecast horizons. Baseline linear (factor) models also win around 1/3 of the time, as do model averaging methods. Interestingly, these broad findings change noticeably when considering different sub-samples. For example, when used to predict only recessionary periods, hybrid models win in 7 of 11 cases, when condensing findings across all windowing approaches, estimation methods, and models, while model averaging does not win in a single case. However, in expansions, and during the 1990s, model averaging wins almost 1/2 of the time. Overall, combination factor/shrinkage methods win approximately 1/2 of the time in 4 of 6 different sample periods. Ancillary findings based on our forecasting experiments underscore the advantages of using recursive estimation strategies, and provide new evidence of the usefulness of yield and yield-spread variables in nonlinear prediction model specification.

The consistency of parameter estimators and the validity of their economic interpretations as marginal effects depend crucially on the correct functional form specification of the linear panel data model. In this paper, a new class of residual-based tests is proposed for checking the validity of dynamic panel data models with both large cross-sectional units and time series dimensions. The individual and time effects can be fixed or random, and panel data can be balanced or unbalanced. The tests can detect a wide range of model misspecifications in the conditional mean of a dynamic panel data model, including functional form and lag misspecification. They check a large number of lags so that they can capture misspecification at any lag order asymptotically. No common alternative is assumed, thus allowing for heterogeneity in the degrees and directions of functional form misspecification across individuals. Thanks to the use of panel data with large N and T, the proposed nonparametric tests have an asymptotic normal distribution under the null hypothesis without requiring the smoothing parameters to grow with the sample sizes. This suggests better nonparametric asymptotic approximation for the panel data than for time series or cross sectional data. This is confirmed in a simulation study. We apply the new tests to test linear specification of cross-country growth equations and found significant nonlinearities in mean for OECD countries' growth equation for annual and quintannual panel data.

The invalidity of conventional tests when regressors are persistent has led to a large literature dealing with inference in predictive regressions with local to unity regressors. Magdalinos and Phillips (2009b) recently developed a new framework of extended IV procedures (IVX) that enables robtist chi-square testing for a wider class of persistent regressors. We extend this robust procedure to an even wider parameter space in the vicinity of unity and apply the methods to long-horizon predictive regression. Existing methods in this model, which rely on simulated critical values by inverting tests under local to unity conditions, cannot be easily extended beyond the scalar regressor case or to wider autoregressive parametrizations. In contrast, the methods developed here lead to standard chi-square tests, allow for multivariate regressors, and include predictive processes whose roots may lie in a wide vicinity of unity. As such they have many potential applications in predictive regression. In addition to asymptotics under the null hypothesis of no predictability, the paper investigates validity under the alternative, showing how balance in the regression may be achieved through the use of localizing coefficients and developing local asymptotic power properties under such alternatives. These results help to explain some of the empirical difficulties that have been encountered in establishing predictability of stock returns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Detailed measures of noise are linked with longitudinal data on individual health outcomes based on the exact address information. Controlling for individual heterogeneity and spatial sorting into different neighborhoods, we find that aircraft noise significantly increases sleeping problems and headaches. Models that do not control for such heterogeneity and sorting substantially underestimate the negative health effects, which suggests that individuals self-select into residence based on their unobserved sensitivity to noise. Our study demonstrates that the combination of quasi-experimental variation and panel data is very powerful for identifying causal effects in epidemiological field studies.

There has always been considerable uncertainty at product launch about the ultimate real-world clinical and economic performance of new products, but this appears to have increased in recent years. PBRSAs represent one mechanism for reducing this uncertainty through greater investment in evidence collection while a technology is used within a health care system. The objective of this Task Force report was to set out the standards that should be applied to good practices-both research and operational- in the use of a PBRSA, encompassing questions around the desirability, design, implementation, and evaluation of such an arrangement This report provides practical recommendations for the development and application of state-of-the-art methods to be used when considering, using, or reviewing PBRSAs. Key findings and recommendations include the following. Additional evidence collection is costly, and there are numerous barriers to establishing viable and cost-effective PBRSAs: negotiation, monitoring, and evaluation costs can be substantial. For good research practice in PBRSAs, it is critical to match the appropriate study and research design to the uncertainties being addressed. Good governance processes are also essential. The information generated as part of PBRSAs has public good aspects, bringing ethical and professional obligations, which need to be considered from a policy perspective. The societal desirability of a particular PBRSA is fundamentally an issue as to whether the cost of additional data collection is justified by the benefits of improved resource allocation decisions afforded by the additional evidence generated and the accompanying reduction in uncertainty. The ex post evaluation of a PBRSA should, however, be a multidimensional exercise that assesses many aspects, including not only the impact on long-term cost-effectiveness and whether appropriate evidence was generated but also process indicators, such as whether and how the evidence was used in coverage or reimbursement decisions, whether budget and time were appropriate, and whether the governance arrangements worked well There is an important gap in the literature of structured ex post evaluation of PBRSAs. As an innovation in and of themselves, PBRSAs should also be evaluated from a long-run societal perspective in terms of their impact on dynamic efficiency (eliciting the optimal amount of innovation).","[Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Univ Washington, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Dept Pharm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Briggs, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [de Pouvourville, Gerard] ESSEC Business Sch, Cergy Pontoise, France; [Grueger, Jens] F Hoffmann La Roche & Cie AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Mohr, Penny E.] Ctr Med Technol Policy, Baltimore, MD USA; [Severens, J.

The results indicate that improved household water infrastructure improves water quality and health outcomes in an environment where point-of-source water quality is good but where recontamination is widespread, leading to unsafe point-of-use drinking water. Moreover, usage rates of 88% after 7 months are encouraging with regard to sustainable adoption. Our estimates suggest that the provision of improved household water infrastructure could keep clean water clean' at a cost of only 5% of the costs of providing households with improved public water supply. Given the general consensus in the literature that recontamination of water from improved public sources is a severe public health problem, improved transport and storage technologies appear to be an effective low-cost supplement to the current standard of financing public water supply for poor rural communities.

They obtained evidence that the probability of marijuana use increased sharply at the age of 21, consistent with the hypothesis that alcohol and marijuana are complements, but inadvertently conditioned on having used marijuana at least once since the last survey. Applying the Y&EY research design to all NLSY97 respondents ages 19 through 22, we find no evidence that alcohol and marijuana are complements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We explain change throughout the distribution of expenditures, providing insight into how expenditure growth and its explanation differ along the distribution. We analyse Dutch data on actual health expenditures linked to hospital discharge and mortality registers. Full distribution decomposition delivers findings that would be overlooked by examination of changes in the mean alone. The growth rate of hospital expenditures is greatest at the middle of the distribution and is driven mainly by changes in the distributions of determinants. Pharmaceutical expenditures increase most rapidly at the top of the distribution and are mainly attributable to structural changes, including technological progress, making treatment of the highest cost cases even more expensive. Changes in hospital practice styles make the largest contribution of all determinants to increased spending not only on hospital care but also on pharmaceuticals, suggesting important spill over effects.

The activities used in back translation training are described. The statistical significance of the research results was computed by employing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) soft.

This implies that when back translation is applied in class, students' development of learning translation is put in the first place.

Objective: To investigate whether responses to binary choice health state valuation questions differ by administration mode: online versus face to face. Methods: Identical surveys including demographic, self-reported health status, and seven types of binary choice valuation questions were administered in online and computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) settings. Samples were recruited following procedures employed in typical online or CAPI studies. Analysis included descriptive comparisons of the distribution of responses across the binary options and probit regression to explain the propensity to choose one option across modes of administration, controlling for background characteristics. Results: Overall, 422 (221 online; 201 CAPI) respondents completed a survey. There were no overall age or sex differences. Online respondents were educated to a higher level than were the CAPI sample and general population, and employment status differed. CAPI respondents reported significantly better general health and health/life satisfaction. CAPI took significantly longer to complete. There was no effect of the mode of administration on responses to the valuation questions, and this was replicated when demographic differences were controlled. Conclusions: The findings suggest that both modes may be equally valid for health state valuation studies using binary choice methods (e.g., discrete choice experiments). There are some differences between the observable characteristics of the samples, and the groups may differ further in terms of unobservable characteristics. When designing health state valuation studies, the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches must be considered.","[Mulhern, Brendan; Brazier, John; Rowen, Donna; Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, London, England; [Bansback, Nick] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Devlin, Nancy] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; Brunel University; University of British Columbia; University of Sheffield,"Mulhern, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",b.mulhern@sheffield.ac.uk,"Devlin, Nancy/M-3816-2014; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Tsuchiya, Aki/A-2167-2010","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Bansback, Nick/0000-0002-1510-3462; Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063",MRC [G0901500]; Medical Research Council [G0901500] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0901500] Funding Source: UKRI,MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This study was funded by the MRC Methodology Programme (reference no.

In this paper we present results from a field experiment in Nigeria in which we offered cervical cancer screening to women at randomly chosen prices. To test our hypothesis, we also offered women a lottery where the payoff was a subsidy towards the cost of cervical cancer treatment (conditional upon a diagnosis of cervical cancer). We find that women randomly selected to receive the conditional cancer treatment subsidy were about 4 percentage points more likely to take up screening than those in the control group. We also show that reducing the price of screening by 10 cents increased take-up by about 1 percentage point. These results offer compelling evidence that the optimal set of subsidies to increase take-up of preventive testing in developing countries, must include subsidies towards treatment costs (in addition to price subsidies).

For the level-stationarity hypothesis, the test statistic we propose is a modified version of the popular KPSS statistic, in which ranks substitute the original observations. We prove that the rank KPSS statistic shares the same limiting distribution as the standard KPSS statistic under the null and diverges under 1(1) alternatives. For the trend-stationarity hypothesis, we apply the same rank KPSS statistic to the residuals of a Theil-Sen regression on a linear trend. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the Theil-Sen estimator under short memory errors and prove that the Theil-Sen detrended rank KPSS statistic shares the same weak limit as the least-squares detrended KPSS. We study the asymptotic relative efficiency of our test compared to the KPSS and prove that it may have unbounded efficiency gains under fat-tailed distributions compensated by very moderate efficiency losses under thin-tailed distributions. For this and other reasons discussed in the body of the article our rank KPSS test turns out to be a valuable alternative to the KPSS for most real-world economic and financial applications. The weak convergence results and asymptotic representations proved in this article should interest a wider audience than that concerned with stationarity testing, as they extend to ranks analogous invariance principles widely used in unit-root econometrics.

To investigate the disease cost and then raise awareness of the importance of screening for cervical cancer and promote early detection, this paper employs contingent valuation and willingness to pay (WTP) method to study how health-related quality of life, disease severity, and after-treatment disease status affect patients WTP for a complete remission of the disease. The inclusive criteria for the study were primary case outpatients at least 3?months after they had received therapy at the time of our study period. Face-to-face interviews were conducted for the retrospective format of the survey. The result of the study indicates a lifetime WTP of $US21?221.96 for Taiwanese cervical cancer patients, which is significantly higher than the cost of screening for early detection. Disease stages do not show a consistent pattern in influencing WTP, but patients with surgery are willing to pay a significantly higher amount for a complete remission from the disease than patients without. In addition, mental health, positive attitudes toward life, and quality of life also are key factors that influence WTP.

In fact, a scaled version of this LM test was proposed by Pesaran (2004) and its finite sample bias was corrected by Pesaran et al. (2008). This was done in the context of a heterogeneous panel data model. This paper derives the asymptotic bias of this scaled version of the LM test in the context of a fixed effects homogeneous panel data model. This asymptotic bias is found to be a constant related to n and T, which suggests a simple bias corrected LM test for the null hypothesis. Additionally, the paper carries out some Monte Carlo experiments to compare the finite sample properties of this proposed test with existing tests for cross-sectional dependence.

Whether the order in which the methods are applied alters the relative utilities obtained by each method is unknown. Objective: We sought to determine whether the order in which SG and TTO utilities were obtained affects the relative values of the utilities obtained by each technique. Methods: Utilities were assessed for 29 health states from 4016 parents by using SG and TTO. The assessment order was randomized by respondent. For analysis by health state, we calculated (SG-TTO) for each assessment and tested whether the SG-TTO difference was significantly different between the two groups (SG first and TTO first). For analysis by individual, we calculated a risk-posture coefficient, gamma, defined by the utility curve, SG = TTO gamma. We predicted gamma through regression analysis with the covariates: child age, child sex, birth order, respondent age, respondent education level, and assessment method order. Results: In 19 of 29 health states, the SG - TTO difference was significantly greater (more risk averse) when TTO was assessed first. In the regression analysis, child age and assessment method order were significant predictors of risk attitude. The risk posture coefficient gamma was higher (more risk-seeking) with increasing child age and in the SG-first respondents. Conclusion: The order in which the SG versus TTO method is used strongly influences the relative values of the utilities obtained.","[Finnell, S.

We evaluate whether the existing DRGs for AMI patients would benefit from additional patient-related and treatment-related factors that are found in administrative data across countries. In most countries, the set of patient and quality variables performed better than the DRG variables. Our results suggest that DRG systems in all countries could be improved by including additional explanatory factors or by refining the existing DRGs. Our results suggest that for AMI and possibly for other related episodes, a refinement of DRGs to include information on patient severity, procedures and levels of complications could improve the ability of DRGs to explain resource use. It seems possible to improve DRG-like hospital payment systems through the inclusion of episode-specific variables.

We measure financial sustainability by a hospital-specific yearly probability of default (PD) trying to mirror the ability of hospitals to survive in the market in the long run. The results show that private ownership is associated with significantly lower PDs than public ownership. Moreover, path dependence in the PD is substantial but far from 100%, indicating a large number of improvements and deteriorations in financial sustainability over time. Yet, the general public hospitals have the highest path dependence. Overall, this indicates that public hospitals, which are in a poor financial standing, remain in that state or even deteriorate over time, which may be conflicting with financial sustainability.

Methods: By using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare, we identified 1500 breast cancer patients who died and had complete cost information within the database. Patients were followed for up to 48 months (partitions) after diagnosis, and their actual total cost was calculated in each partition. We then simulated patterns of administrative and dropout censoring and also added censoring to patients receiving chemotherapy to simulate comparing a newer to older intervention. For each censoring simulation, we performed 1000 IPW regression analyses (bootstrap, sampling with replacement), calculated the average value of each coefficient in each partition, and summed the coefficients for each regression parameter to obtain the cumulative values from 1 to 48 months. Results: The cumulative, 48-month, average cost was $67,796 (95% confidence interval [CI] $58,454-$78,291) with no censoring, $66,313 (95% CI $54,975-$80,074) with administrative censoring, and $66,765 (95% CI $54,510-$81,843) with administrative plus dropout censoring. In multivariate analysis, chemotherapy was associated with increased cost of $25,325 (95% CI $17,549-$32,827) compared with $28,937 (95% CI $20,510-$37,088) with administrative censoring and $29,593 ($20,564-$39,399) with administrative plus dropout censoring. Adding censoring to the chemotherapy group resulted in less accurate IPW estimates. This was ameliorated, however, by applying IPW within treatment groups. Conclusion: IPW is a consistent estimator of population mean costs if the weight is correctly specified. If the censoring distribution depends on some co-variates, a model that accommodates this dependency must be correctly specified in IPW to obtain accurate estimates.","[Griffiths, Robert I.; Gleeson, Michelle L.; Danese, Mark D.] Outcomes Insights Inc, Westlake Village, CA 91362 USA; [Griffiths, Robert I.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [O'Hagan, Anthony] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Johns Hopkins University; University of Sheffield,"Griffiths, RI (通讯作者)，Outcomes Insights Inc, 340 N Westlake Blvd,Suite 200, Westlake Village, CA 91362 USA.",bob@outins.com,"O'Hagan, Anthony/B-2992-2016","O'Hagan, Anthony/0000-0002-7994-0702",Amgen,Amgen(Amgen),Amgen provided financial support for this study.,,21,17,19,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15,5.0,,,,,656,663,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.03.1388,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867774.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100008,0

The approach uses a flexible model for the joint distribution of the dependent and independent variables and then extracts the conditional distributions of interest from the estimated joint distribution. We use a finite mixture of multivariate normals (FMMN) to estimate the joint distribution. The conditional distributions can then be assessed analytically or through simulations. The discrete variables are handled through the use of latent variables. The estimation procedure employs an MCMC algorithm. We provide a characterization of the Kullback-Leibler closure of FMMN and show that the joint and conditional predictive densities implied by the FMMN model are consistent estimators for a large class of data generating processes with continuous and discrete observables. The method can be used as a robust regression model with discrete and continuous dependent and independent variables and as a Bayesian alternative to semi- and non-parametric models such as quantile and kernel regression. In experiments, the method compares favorably with classical nonparametric and alternative Bayesian methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A solution may not exist if, for example, the instrument is not valid. This paper discusses the problem of testing the null hypothesis that a solution exists against the alternative that there is no solution. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of a solution and show that uniformly consistent testing of an unrestricted null hypothesis is not possible. Uniformly consistent testing is possible, however, if the null hypothesis is restricted by assuming that any solution to the integral equation is smooth. Many functions of interest in applied econometrics, including demand functions and Engel curves, are expected to be smooth. The paper presents a statistic for testing the null hypothesis that a smooth solution exists. The test is consistent uniformly over a large class of probability distributions of the observable random variables for which the integral equation has no smooth solution. The finite-sample performance of the test is illustrated through Monte Carlo experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Because of the two dimensions, geographical (districts) and political (parties), the problem is called bi-apportionment. Often the allocation of seats to districts is pre-determined and furthermore distorted meaning that the ratios of the number of assigned seats to population size vary significantly across districts. The paper surveys proposed bi-apportionment methods with a focus on the conflict that may arise between party-proportional representation and district distortions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The student-optimal stable matching is strongly efficient for the students, given an acyclic profile of the colleges' preference relations.

Such a situation may arise when there are many weak instruments. With many weak instruments, existing approaches to first-stage regularization can lead to a large bias relative to standard errors. We propose a jackknife instrumental variables estimator (JIVE) with regularization at each jackknife iteration that helps alleviate this bias. We derive the limiting behavior for a ridge-regularized JIV estimator (RJIVE), verifying that the RJIVE is consistent and asymptotically normal under conditions which allow for more instruments than observations and do not require consistent model selection. We provide simulation results that demonstrate the proposed RJIVE performs favorably in terms of size of tests and risk properties relative to other many-weak instrument estimation strategies in high-dimensional settings. We also apply the RJIVE to the Angrist and Krueger (1991) example where it performs favorably relative to other many-instrument robust procedures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The autonomous agents search for vacant tasks guided by their own preference orders over available tasks. The goal of the central planner is to maximise the total value of the assignment, taking into account the behaviour of the uncontrolled agents. Such optimisation problems arise in numerous real-world situations, ranging from organisational economics to crowdsourcing and disaster response. We show that the problem faced by the central planner can be transformed into a mixed integer bilevel optimisation problem. Then we demonstrate how this program can be reduced to a disjoint bilinear program, which is much more manageable computationally. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This adds to the current literature that only investigates this relationship in either the population as a whole or two subpopulations, pre-retirement and post-retirement. We now investigate if there are further additional subpopulations in the years to and from retirement. We take an information criteria approach to select the optimal model of subpopulations from a full range of potential models. This approach is similar to that proposed for linear models. Our contribution is to show how this may also be applied to nonlinear models and without the need for estimating subsequent subpopulations conditional on previous fixed subpopulations. Our main finding is that the association of social capital with health diminishes at retirement, and this decreases further 10 years after retirement. We find a strong positive significant association of social capital with health, although this turns negative after 20 years, indicating potential unobserved heterogeneity. The types of social capital may differ in later years (e. g. less volunteering) and hence overall social capital may have less of an influence on health in later years.

In such a case, whether information is disclosed depends on the intensity of competition, the difference of the adverse effect between the two sellers, and the timing at which pricing and information disclosure decisions are made.

By defining unawareness and knowledge in terms of preferences over acts in unawareness structures and showing their equivalence to the epistemic notions of unawareness and knowledge, we try to build a bridge between decision theory and epistemic logic.

Methods: Randomized controlled trials evaluating the NVF relative risk reduction (RRR) with oral bisphosphonates or bazedoxifene were identified by a systematic literature review and combined by means of a network meta-analysis. A subgroup of patients with a FRAX score of 20% or more in the bazedoxifene phase III osteoporosis study was selected as the population of interest on the basis of the bazedoxifene label. In one analysis (analysis 1), the placebo response of the subgroup with a FRAX score of 20% or more was the benchmark to select comparable bisphosphonate trials. Additional analyses incorporated the aggregate data from the bisphosphonate trials with all the FRAX subgroups (analysis 2) or with the individual patient data from the bazedoxifene trial (analysis 3). Results: Nine identified bisphosphonate trials (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate; N = 23,440 patients) with a similar placebo response as observed for the subgroup of high risk patients in the bazedoxifene trial were included in analysis 1. The results of the network meta-analysis of this study set suggest that bazedoxifene is expected to have an RRR of 043 (95% credible interval [Crl] -0.19 to 0.72) versus alendronate, 0.58 (95% Crl 005-081) versus ibandronate, and 0.39 (95% Crl -0.29 to 0.70) versus risedronate. Analyses in which treatment effects with bisphosphonates were projected to a population with a FRAX score of 20% or more with meta regression approaches (analysis 2 and analysis 3) provide similar findings. Conclusion: Based on an indirect comparison of randomized trials, bazedoxifene is expected to have at least a comparable RRR of NVF as alendronate, ibandronate, and risedronate in women with higher risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis.","[Ellis, Alexandra G.; Jansen, Jeroen P.] Mapi, Boston, MA USA; [Reginster, Jean-Yves] Univ Liege, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Luo, Xuemei; Cappelleri, Joseph C.] Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Chines, Arkadi] Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, PA USA; [Sutradhar, Santosh] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA",University of Liege; Pfizer; Pfizer; Pfizer,"Jansen, JP (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",jeroen.jansen@tufts.edu,"Reginster, Jean-Yves/AGC-6097-2022","Jansen, Jeroen Paul/0000-0003-2686-9217; Ellis, Alexandra/0000-0002-5128-0255","Pfizer, Inc.; Pfizer","Pfizer, Inc.(Pfizer); Pfizer(Pfizer)","This study was sponsored by Pfizer, Inc.

Although CPOE has been shown to improve medication safety and reduce health care costs, these improvements have been demonstrated largely in the inpatient setting; the cost-effectiveness in the ambulatory setting remains uncertain. Objective: The objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of CPOE in reducing medication errors and adverse drug events (ADEs) in the ambulatory setting. Methods: We created a decision-analytic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of CPOE in a midsized (400 providers) multidisciplinary medical group over a 5-year time horizon-2010 to 2014-the time frame during which health systems are implementing CPOE to meet Meaningful Use criteria. We adopted the medical group's perspective and utilized their costs, changes in efficiency, and actual number of medication errors and ADEs. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Scenario analyses were explored. Results: In the base case, CPOE dominated paper prescribing, that is, CPOE cost $18 million less than paper prescribing, and was associated with 1.5 million and 14,500 fewer medication errors and ADEs, respectively, over 5 years. In the scenario that reflected a practice group of five providers, CPOE cost $265,000 less than paper prescribing, was associated with 3875 and 39 fewer medication errors and ADEs, respectively, over 5 years, and was dominant in 80% of the simulations. Conclusions: Our model suggests that the adoption of CPOE in the ambulatory setting provides excellent value for the investment, and is a cost-effective strategy to improve medication safety over a wide range of practice sizes.","[Forrester, Sara H.; Hepp, Zsolt; Roth, Joshua A.; Wirtz, Heidi S.; Devine, Emily Beth] Univ Washington, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Sch Pharm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Roth, Joshua A.] Grp Hlth Cooperat Puget Sound, Grp Hlth Res Inst, Seattle, WA USA; [Devine, Emily Beth] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat & Med Educ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Devine, Emily Beth] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Group Health Cooperative; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Devine, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",bdevine@uw.edu,"Devine, Beth/ITU-0067-2023","Roth, Joshua/0000-0001-6621-8342","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [5K08 HS014739]; Allergan, Inc.

Methods: All warning letters (WLs) or notices of violation (NOVs) issued by the FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion were reviewed for PRO violations (n = 213). Each letter containing a PRO violation was reviewed to determine the type of violation: 1) PRO measure not fit for purpose, 2) study design/interpretation of results, 3) statistical analysis, and 4) no treatment benefit Results: Forty-one (19%) letters contained information about PRO infringements. Noticeable spikes in letters were shown in 2007 (37%) and 2010 (31%) after the issuance of the draft and final PRO Guidance, respectively. The most common violation was PRO measure not fit for purpose (54%), specifically: use of individual items (45%), insufficient evidence of content validity (36%), and broadening of the claim beyond what the PRO measures (27%). Issues with study design/interpretation of results were also high (49%), particularly broadening of claim beyond what was measured in the trial (55%) and no PRO measure used (50%). Conclusions: A fifth of the letters issued to companies contained PRO violations, with most related to poor selection of the PRO measure used or trying to broaden the claim. More guidance from the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion about what is considered substantial evidence in this area could help reduce the number of letters issued.","[Symonds, Tara; Hackford, Claire; Abraham, Lucy] Pfizer Ltd, Patient Reported Outcomes Ctr Excellence, Global Market Access, Primary Care, Walton Oaks KT20 7NS, Surrey, England",Pfizer,"Symonds, T (通讯作者)，Pfizer Ltd, Patient Reported Outcomes Ctr Excellence, Global Market Access, Primary Care, Walton Oaks KT20 7NS, Surrey, England.",Tara.symonds@pfizer.com,,,,,,,10,9,9,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,433,437,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.03.1718,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24969004.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900017,0

It is a common practice in financial management to evaluate the performance of a financial investment on the basis of the information ratio with the neglect of some important properties that are typical for financial returns out of which this indicator of investment performance is computed. Usually daily, weekly or monthly historical returns of the held investment are used to compute (or rather more precisely estimate) the information ratio and then the obtained result is annualized under some simplifying assumptions. The final value of this indicator may thus be imprecise and one might consider its correction for autocorrelation that is present in financial returns. The paper points to a method of correcting the information ratio for first-order autocorrelation.","[Bod'a, Martin; Kanderova, Maria] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Bod'a, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",martin.boda@umb.sk; maria.kanderova@umb.sk,"Boďa, Martin/J-3602-2016","Boďa, Martin/0000-0002-7503-6898",,,,,6,1,1,1,4,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-1685-5,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2014,44,,,,,,49,53,,10.5729/lnms.vol44.49,0.0,,,5,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC9DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356316000008,0

While these financial assets differ greatly in their characteristics, their diversity has received little attention in the literature. Filling this important gap in the literature, this paper views debt and equity as financial contracts, and asks why they are optimal instead of other financial contracts. By endogenizing the bankruptcy process, this paper shows how debt and equity arise as a consequence of an optimal allocation of cash-flow rights and monitoring rights, and how equity leads to dividend signaling.

At a technical level, the analysis requires a significant departure from existing continuous time modeling because it cannot be done within a probability space framework. This is because ambiguity about volatility leads invariably to a set of nonequivalent priors, that is, to priors that disagree about which scenarios are possible. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Of the various voting methods discussed prominently in the literature, five methods are subject to monotonicity failures: Alternative Vote (AV), Plurality Runoff (P-R), and Dodgson's, Nanson's. and Coombs' methods. Two of these methods (AV and P-R) are used in practice. In the 2nd World Congress of the Public Choice Societies conducted in March 2012 in Miami, Fl., Nicholas Miller presented a paper in which he defined, inter alia, a novel type of monotonicity failure which he called 'double monotonicity failure' and investigated some of its properties in three-candidate elections under the AV and P-R methods. The present paper extends Miller's investigation by showing that all the aforementioned voting methods may display double monotonicity failure, as well as by interacting double monotonicity failure with the question of whether the monotonicity failures improve or worsen the apparent welfare of the voters whose votes change. We determine which of the four resulting cases can arise in each of the aforementioned five voting methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Each agent has unit demand, and has strict preferences over the objects. There are q(j) units of object j available and the problem is balanced in the sense that Sigma(j) q(j) = n. An allocation specifies the amount of each object j that is assigned to each agent i, when the objects are divisible: when the objects are indivisible and exactly one unit of each object is available, an allocation is interpreted as the probability that agent i is assigned one unit of object j. In our setting, agent preferences over objects are extended to preferences over allocations using the natural lexicographic order. The goal is to design mechanisms that are efficient, envy-free, and strategy-proof. Schulman and Vazirani show that an adaptation of the probabilistic serial mechanism satisfies all these properties when q(j) >= 1 for all objects j. Our first main result is a characterization of problems for which efficiency, envy-freeness, and strategy-proofness are compatible. Furthermore, we show that these three properties do not characterize the serial mechanism. Finally, we show that when indifferences between objects are permitted in agent preferences, it is impossible to satisfy all three properties even in the standard setting of house allocation in which all object supplies are 1.

We exploit a natural experiment created by child tax benefits, which rewards births that occur just before the new year, to better understand the full costs of elective c-sections and inductions. Using data on all births in the U.S. from 1990 to 2000, we first confirm that expectant parents respond to the financial incentives by electing to give birth in December rather than January. We find that most of the manipulation comes from changes in the timing of c-sections. Small birth timing changes, even at full-term, lead to lower birthweight, a lower Apgar score, and an increase in the likelihood of being low birthweight. (C ) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We show that an ARFIMA process subject to a mean shift and a change in the long memory parameter can be well approximated by an autoregressive (AR) model and suggest using an information criterion (AIC or Mallows' C-p) to choose the order of the approximate AR model. Our method avoids the issue of estimation inaccuracy of the long memory parameter and the issue of spurious breaks in finite sample. Insights from our theoretical analysis are confirmed by Monte Carlo experiments, through which we also find that our method provides a substantial improvement over existing prediction methods. An empirical application to the realized volatility of three exchange rates illustrates the usefulness of our forecasting procedure. The empirical success of the HAR-RV model can be explained, from an econometric perspective, by our theoretical and simulation results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

After a thorough description of Fujita and Thisse (2002). we introduce a different migration law a la Krugman (1991a). Although individuals do not foresee price changes, the steady state outcome does not vary qualitatively: the unique steady state is a symmetric distribution of skilled labour across regions. We can prove that this interior steady state is asymptotically stable, which represents a net improvement in the dynamic analysis of the long run with respect to Fujita and Thisse. When we model the economy using the Romer (1990) model applied to two regions and allowing for inter-regional skilled migration, then there exists a solution path that converges to an asymmetric steady state. In effect, the new steady state depends on technology, fixed costs, knowledge spillovers and transportation costs.

We propose a bivariate kernel covariance estimator that nests existing estimators as special cases. Our estimator improves upon existing estimators in terms of robustness, efficiency, and adaptiveness. For distributional approximations, we considered two types of asymptotics: the increasing-smoothing asymptotics and the fixed-smoothing asymptotics. Under the former asymptotics, the Wald statistic based on our covariance estimator converges to a chi-square distribution. Under the latter asymptotics, the Wald statistic is asymptotically equivalent to a distribution that can be well approximated by an F distribution. Simulation results show that our proposed testing procedure works well in finite samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we extend the continuous time optimal replacement model in the firm under technological progress by considering the possibility of repairing/replacing the machines during their lifetime period. In our model, two possible decisions can be recognized by the managers in which the machines are repaired under the efficiency condition or replaced under the availability of technological progress in the firm. As a special case, we restrict the model to the more real case in which all the growth, purchase price and repair cost functions are assumed to be in the exponential form. The solvability of the model in this case is also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Peyghami, M.

I propose defining similarity in terms of a quasimetric. I suggest a particular quasimetric and explore the properties of the empirical similarity model given this function. The proposed function belongs to the class of quasimetrics induced by skewed norms. Finally. I provide a skewness axiom that, when imposed in lieu of the symmetry axiom in the main result of Billot et al. (2008), characterizes an exponential similarity function based on a skewed norm.

We study conditions under which the latent factors can be estimated asymptotically without rotation. We derive the limiting distributions for the estimated factors and factor loadings when N and T are large and make precise how identification of the factors affects inference based on factor augmented regressions. We also consider factor models with additive individual and time effects. The asymptotic analysis can be modified to analyze identification schemes not considered in this analysis.

Among the applicants for medical school, people who attended medical school have on average 1.5 more years of completed education than people who did not. They are also more likely to have been exposed to a health-related education curriculum. The results show only modest impacts on health outcomes. Attending medical school reduces alcohol consumption and being underweight somewhat, and has a small positive impact on self-reported health status. It has, however, a small negative effect on the frequency of physical exercise and no significant impact on smoking, and being overweight or obese. Attending medical school does have a large positive impact on the probability of being registered for donations of organs. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The Canadian Hemophilia Outcomes-Kids Life Assessment Tool (CHO-KLAT) is a disease-specific measure of quality of life that was recently revised to facilitate cross-cultural adaptation. This study assessed the validity and reliability of version 2.0 of the CHO-KLAT (CHO-KLAT(2.0)). Methods: Content validity was assessed via detailed cognitive debriefing to confirm that Canadian boys understood the CHO-KLAT(2.0). The measurement properties of the CHO-KLAT(2.0) were assessed in comparison to those of the PedsQL, the Haemo-QoL, and two global ratings. Most children completed the CHO-KLAT(2.0) a second time to assess test-retest reliability. Results: Cognitive debriefing was completed with 12 boys (age 8.6-17.8 years) and 9 of their parents and resulted in no substantive changes. Sixty boys (mean age 11.8 years) participated in the validation phase, which showed a mean CHO-KLAT(2.0) score of 75.4 +/- 12.0, strong correlations with the PedsQL (r = 0.62, P < 0.001) and Haemo-QoL (r = 0.64, P < 0.001), and moderate correlations with global ratings of hemophilia bother (p = -0.39, P = 0.002) and health (p = -0.47, P = 0.0002). Test-retest concordance was better among parents (0.79) than among boys (0.63). Conclusions: This study establishes the measurement properties of the CHO-KLAT(2.0). The summary scores are very similar to those from the original development study, and thus, these have not been affected by the revisions. These results provide reference standards for comparing data from other countries to the Canadian experience and to estimate sample sizes for future clinical trials.","[Young, Nancy L.; Burke, Tricia A.] Laurentian Univ, Sch Rural & Northern Hlth, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada; [Young, Nancy L.; Blanchette, Victor] Dept Pediat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wakefield, Cindy; Blanchette, Victor] Hosp Sick Children, Div Hematol & Oncol, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Ray, Randi] Laurentian Univ, Sch Human Kinet, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada; [McCusker, Patricia J.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Pediat Hematol, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",Laurentian University; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); Laurentian University; University of Manitoba,"Young, NL (通讯作者)，Laurentian Univ, Sch Rural & Northern Hlth, 935 Ramsey Lake Rd, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.",nyoung@laurentian.ca,"Young, Nancy/G-3934-2011","Young, Nancy/0000-0002-1739-3299",Bayer Canada; Canada Research Chair from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research,Bayer Canada(Bayer AG); Canada Research Chair from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research,Source of financial support: The study was funded with a grant from Bayer Canada.

Methods: A patient-level simulation model was developed with the intention of being capable of evaluating multiple topics within National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's colorectal cancer clinical guideline. The model simulates disease and treatment pathways from preclinical disease through to detection, diagnosis, adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatments, follow-up, curative/palliative treatments for metastases, supportive care, and eventual death. The model parameters were informed by meta-analyses, randomized trials, observational studies, health utility studies, audit data, costing sources, and expert opinion. Unobservable natural history parameters were calibrated against external data using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Economic analysis was undertaken using conventional cost-utility decision rules within each guideline topic and constrained maximization rules across multiple topics. Results: Under usual processes for guideline development, piecewise economic modeling would have been used to evaluate between one and three topics. The Whole Disease Model was capable of evaluating 11 of 15 guideline topics, ranging from alternative diagnostic technologies through to treatments for metastatic disease. The constrained maximization analysis identified a configuration of colorectal services that is expected to maximize quality-adjusted life-year gains without exceeding current expenditure levels. Conclusions: This study indicates that Whole Disease Model development is feasible and can allow for the economic analysis of most interventions across a disease service within a consistent conceptual and mathematical infrastructure. This disease-level modeling approach may be of particular value in providing an economic basis to support other clinical guidelines.","[Tappenden, Paul; Chilcott, Jim; Brennan, Alan; Squires, Hazel] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Glynne-Jones, Rob] East & North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, Northwood, Middx, England; [Tappenden, Janine] NHS Fdn Trust, Doncaster & Bassetlaw Hosp, Doncaster, England",University of Sheffield,"Tappenden, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",p.tappenden@sheffield.ac.uk,"Squires, Hazel/GSO-3900-2022; Brennan, Alan/B-4459-2009","Chilcott, James/0000-0003-1231-7817; Squires, Hazel/0000-0002-2776-4014; Brennan, Alan/0000-0002-1025-312X",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [RDA/PAS03/2007/076],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (study reference RDA/PAS03/2007/076).

The players' clocks are de-synchronized in that they learn of the investment opportunity at different times. Thus, the model captures situations where players are heterogeneous with respect to the amount of information that they possess at any instant. In this framework, previous literature has uncovered an inverted-U shaped relationship between a player's equilibrium expected expenditures and the measure of his competitors. This result no longer holds when the increase in the measure of players leads to a decrease in the degree of clock synchronization in the game. We show that the result reemerges if information arrives only at discrete times, and thus, a player's strategic beliefs are updated between decision times in a measurably meaningful way.

(We do not assume any structure on X or V.) A variable population voting rule F takes any number of anonymous votes drawn from V as input, and produces a nonempty subset of X as output. The rule F satisfies reinforcement if, whenever two disjoint sets of voters independently select some subset y subset of x, the union of these two sets will also select y. We show that F satisfies reinforcement if and only if F is a balance rule. If F satisfies a form of neutrality, then F satisfies reinforcement if and only if F is a scoring rule (with scores taking values in an abstract linearly ordered abelian group,R); this generalizes a result of Myerson (1995).

Statistical methods can only address selection bias if they make plausible assumptions. No quality assessment tool is available for appraising CEAs that use observational studies. We developed a new checklist to assess statistical methods for addressing selection bias in CEAs that use observational data. The checklist criteria were informed by a conceptual review and applied in a systematic review of economic evaluations. Criteria included whether the study assessed the no unobserved confounding' assumption, overlap of baseline covariates between the treatment groups and the specification of the regression models. The checklist also considered structural uncertainty from the choice of statistical approach. We found 81 studies that met the inclusion criteria: studies tended to use regression (51%), matching on individual covariates (25%) or matching on the propensity score (22%). Most studies (77%) did not assess the no observed confounding' assumption, and few studies (16%) fully considered structural uncertainty from the choice of statistical approach. We conclude that published CEAs do not assess the main assumptions behind statistical methods for addressing selection bias. This checklist can raise awareness about the assumptions behind statistical methods for addressing selection bias and can complement existing method guidelines for CEAs.

This article carefully studies the effects of US agricultural policies on prices and quantities of 10 agricultural commodities and nine food categories in the United States over time. Using a detailed multimarket model, we simulate the counterfactual removal of measures of support applied to US agricultural commodities in 1992, 1997, and 2002 and quantify the effects on US food consumption and caloric intake. To parameterize the simulations, we calculate three alternative measures of consumer support (the implicit consumer subsidy from policies that support producers) for the 10 agricultural commodities using information about government expenditures on agricultural commodities from various sources. Our results indicate thatholding all other policies constantremoving US subsidies on grains and oilseeds in the three periods would have caused caloric consumption to decrease minimally whereas removal of all US agricultural policies (including barriers against imports of sugar and dairy products) would have caused total caloric intake to increase. Our results also indicate that the influence of agricultural policies on caloric intake has diminished over time.

To account for unobserved heterogeneity in price responsiveness, we use finite mixture models. We recover two latent groups, one is significantly responsive to price, but the other is unresponsive. The group with greater responsiveness is disadvantaged in multiple domains, including health, financial resources, education and perhaps even planning abilities. These results have policy implications. The unresponsive group drinks more heavily, suggesting that a higher tax would fail to curb the negative alcohol-related externalities. In contrast, the more disadvantaged group is more responsive to price, thus suffering greater deadweight loss, yet this group consumes fewer drinks per day and might be less likely to impose negative externalities.

Information is essential to obtain manufacturing authorization from the national drug agency and, in this way, make profits on the market. Considering this activity, however, the public stakeholder has to face a conflict of interests. On the one side, there is society's necessity to make advances in medicine and, of course, to promote pharmaceutical companies' investments in this specific phase (new generation). On the other side, there is the duty to protect patients involved in these experimental treatments (old generation). To abide by this moral duty, a protection system was developed through the years, based on two legal institutions: informed consent and institutional review board. How should an efficient protection system that would take human experimentation into account be shaped? Would it be possible for the national protection system of patients' rights to affect the choice of whether to develop a clinical trial in a given country or not? Looking at Europe and considering a protection system that is shaped around institutional review boards, this article is an empirical work that tries to give answers to these open questions. It shows how a protection system that can minimize the time necessary to start a trial can positively affect pharmaceutical clinical research, that is, the choice of pharmaceutical companies to start innovative medical treatments in a given country.","Univ Piemonte Orientale, POLIS Inst, I-15121 Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Ippoliti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, POLIS Inst, I-15121 Alessandria, Italy.",roberto.ippoliti@unipmn.it,"Ippoliti, Roberto/ABA-7329-2020","Ippoliti, Roberto/0000-0001-9199-452X",,,,,35,0,1,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2013,16,1.0,,,,,148,154,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.09.010,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,077WN,23337226.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314060200018,0

We find that the NHI only has an effect on the death hazard, and it is the least healthy who benefit the most. The death hazard falls by 1648% and 39% for the least health and the healthiest, respectively. The decline in the hazard ratio for the least healthy among the uninsured is 58% greater than that of their counterparts among the insured. Moreover, female participants benefit more from the NHI than male participants. We find no significant effect of the NHI in the SEShealth gradient except for the educationdeath hazard gradient. The gap in the education-death hazard gradient between the insured and previously uninsured is significantly reduced by 731% after 1995. The hazard ratio among the less-educated in the treatment group also falls by 55% relative to that in the comparison group.

However, it is non-preference-based and not amenable for use across policy decision-making contexts. Our objective was to statistically map from the MSIS-29, version 2, to the EuroQol five-dimension (EQ-5D) and the six-dimension health state short form (derived from short form 36 health survey) (SF-6D) to estimate algorithms for use in cost-effectiveness analyses. Methods: The relationships between MSIS-29, version 2, and EQ-5D and SF-6D scores were estimated by using data from a cohort of people with multiple sclerosis in South West England (n = 672). Six ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit, and censored least adjusted deviation (CLAD) regression analyses were conducted on estimation samples, including the use of subscale and item scores, squared and interaction terms, and demographics. Algorithms from models with the smallest estimation errors (mean absolute error [MAE], root mean square error [RMSE], normalized RMSE) were then assessed by using separate validation samples. Results: Tobit and CLAD. For the EQ-5D, the OLS models including subscale squared terms, and item scores and demographics performed comparably (MAE 0.147, RMSE 0.202 and MAE 0.147, RMSE 0.203, respectively), and estimated scores well up to 3 years post-baseline. Estimation errors for the SF-6D were smaller (OLS model including squared terms: MAE 0.058, RMSE 0.073; OLS model using item scores and demographics: MAE 0.059, RMSE 0.08), and the errors for poorer health states found with the EQ-5D were less pronounced. Conclusions: We have provided algorithms for the estimation of health state utility values, both the EQ-5D and SF-6D, from scores on the MSIS-29, version 2. Further research is now needed to determine how these algorithms perform in practical decision-making contexts, when compared with observed EQ-5D and SF-6D values.","[Hawton, Annie] Univ Exeter, Hlth Econ Grp, PenCLAHRC, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Zajicek, John] Univ Plymouth, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Clin Neurol Res Grp, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Wright, Dave] Univ Plymouth, Ctr Hlth & Environm Stat, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth; University of Exeter; University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth,"Hawton, A (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Hlth Econ Grp, PenCLAHRC, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Veysey Bldg,Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England.",annie.hawton@pms.ac.uk,,"Murray, Dianna/0000-0003-3481-825X; Hawton, Annemarie/0000-0002-1336-5899",Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; Peninsula Medical School Foundation; UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Comprehensive Clinical Research Network; NIHR; PenCLAHRC National Institute for Health Research Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care,Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; Peninsula Medical School Foundation; UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Comprehensive Clinical Research Network(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); PenCLAHRC National Institute for Health Research Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care,"Source of financial support: The South West Impact of Multiple Sclerosis (SWIMS) project has been supported through funding from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Peninsula Medical School Foundation, and the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Comprehensive Clinical Research Network.

This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness and costs from a US societal perspective of a multigene recurrence score (RS) assay for patients recently diagnosed with stage II colon cancer (T3, proficient DNA mismatch repair) eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: RS was compared with guideline-recommended clinicopathological factors (tumor stage, lymph nodes examined, tumor grade, and lymphovascular invasion) by using a state-transition (Markov) lifetime model. Data were obtained from published literature, a randomized controlled trial (Quick And Simple And Reliable) of adjuvant chemotherapy, and rates of chemotherapy use from the National Cooperative Cancer Network Colon/Rectum Cancer Outcomes study. Life-years, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and lifetime costs were examined. Results: The RS is projected to reduce adjuvant chemotherapy use by 17% compared with current treatment patterns and to increase quality-adjusted life expectancy by an average of 0.035 years. Direct medical costs are expected to decrease by an average of $2971 per patient. The assay was cost saving for all subgroups of patients stratified by clinicopathologic factors. The most influential variables affecting treatment decisions were projected years of life remaining, recurrence score, and patients' disutilities associated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions: Use of the multigene RS to assess recurrence risk after surgery in stage II colon cancer (T3, proficient DNA mismatch repair) may reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy without decreasing quality-adjusted life expectancy and be cost saving from a societal perspective. These findings need to be validated in additional cohorts, including studies of clinical practice as assay use diffuses into nonacademic settings.","[Hornberger, John] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hornberger, John; Chien, Rebecca] Cedar Associates LLC, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Lyman, Gary H.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA; [Lyman, Gary H.] Duke Canc Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Chien, Rebecca] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Meropol, Neal J.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Case Comprehens Canc Ctr, Seidman Canc Ctr, Univ Hosp Case Med Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Stanford University; Duke University; Duke University; Columbia University; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University Hospital,"Hornberger, J (通讯作者)，3715 Haven Ave,Suite 100, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",ujch@stanford.edu,"Lyman, Gary/K-5227-2019; Hornberger, John/M-4932-2019","Lyman, Gary/0000-0002-0823-8086;","Genomic Health, Inc.","Genomic Health, Inc.","Source of financial support: Genomic Health, Inc., through an independent research contract (specifics of the independence clause are available on request).",,44,19,29,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1014,1021,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.07.012,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244802.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300004,0

One option is to recommend the use of one generic utility measure, but this raises the issue of comparability when the preferred measure is inappropriate or unavailable. Many cancer trials do not include generic measures such as the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire and instead include condition-specific measures and use these to generate utility estimates. We analyze the comparability of generic, condition-specific, and mapped utility values for a multiple myeloma cancer patient data set. Methods: Generic EQ-5D, condition-specific EORTC-8D, and EQ-5D utility values mapped from the EORTC QLQ-C30 were compared by using psychometric and statistical analysis to determine discrimination across severity groups, responsiveness, and agreement. Results: Generic, condition-specific, and mapped utility estimates were responsive over time and show discriminative validity. The EQ-5D had higher responsiveness and detected a greater change across severity groups and treatment periods than did the EORTC-8D but has a higher proportion of responses at full health (12.8%). Differences in the EQ-5D and the EORTC-8D were due at least in part to differences in the classification system. Mapped EQ-5D estimates had a smaller SD and do not reflect the severe range of health states reported by using the EQ-5D. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that condition-specific EORTC-8D or mapped EQ-5D utility estimates are broadly comparable to directly obtained EQ-5D utilities for a multiple myeloma patient data set. However, EORTC-8D estimates captured changes in quality of life for patients in mild health states that were not captured by the EQ-5D, but estimated lower utility gains than did the use of the EQ-5D directly.","[Rowen, Donna; Young, Tracey; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Young, Tracey] Univ Sheffield, NIHR Res Design Serv Yorkshire & Humber, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Gaugris, Sabine] Janssen Cilag Ltd, High Wycombe, Bucks, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; Johnson & Johnson,"Rowen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",d.rowen@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Young, Tracey A/A-4543-2010","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Young, Tracey/0000-0001-8467-0471; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109",MRC-NIHR Methodology Research Program [06/97/04],MRC-NIHR Methodology Research Program,Source of financial support: This study was partly funded by MRC-NIHR Methodology Research Program (project number 06/97/04).,,31,42,42,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1059,1068,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.08.2201,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244808.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300010,0

This system-level approach can provide a consistent mathematical infrastructure for the economic evaluation of virtually any intervention across a disease pathway. Methods: The framework has been developed for cancer but is broadly generalizable to other diseases. It has been informed by pilot work, a systematic review of economic analyses, a qualitative examination of model development processes, and other literature from the fields of operational research, statistics, and health economics. Results: The framework is built on three principles: 1) the model boundary and breadth should capture all relevant aspects of the disease and its treatment from preclinical disease through to death, 2) the model should be developed such that the decision node is conceptually transferable across the model, and 3) the costs and consequences of service elements should be structurally related. A generalized process for developing Whole Disease Models is presented. Discussion: Although this approach involves a nontrivial investment of time and resource, its value may be realized when 1) multiple options for service change require economic analysis at a single time point, 2) a disease service changes rapidly and the model can be reused, 3) current services within a pathway have not been subjected to economic analysis, 4) upstream events are expected to have important downstream effects, or 5) simple cost-utility decision rules fail to reflect the complexity of the decision-makers' objectives.","[Tappenden, Paul; Chilcott, Jim; Brennan, Alan; Squires, Hazel; Stevenson, Matthew] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Tappenden, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",p.tappenden@sheffield.ac.uk,"Brennan, Alan/B-4459-2009; Squires, Hazel/GSO-3900-2022",", Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Brennan, Alan/0000-0002-1025-312X; Chilcott, James/0000-0003-1231-7817; Squires, Hazel/0000-0002-2776-4014",National Institute for Health Research [RDA/PAS03/2007/076],National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),Source of financial support: This study was funded through a Personal Award Scheme Fellowship by the National Institute for Health Research (project reference RDA/PAS03/2007/076).,,41,41,42,1,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1127,1136,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.07.008,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244816.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300018,0

He goes on to show that if transitivity is weakened to quasi-transitivity as the coherence property imposed on a social relation, the set of decisive coalitions is a filter. We examine the notion of decisiveness with acyclical or Suzumura consistent social preferences and without the assumption that the social relation is reflexive and complete. This leads to a new set-theoretic concept applied to product spaces. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the posterior distribution of phi is inconsistent in the frequentist sense. We interpret this fact as the ill-posedness of the Bayesian inverse problem defined by the relation that characterizes the structural function phi. To solve this problem, we construct a regularized posterior distribution, based on a Tikhonov regularization of the inverse of the marginal variance of the sample, which is justified by a penalized projection argument. This regularized posterior distribution is consistent in the frequentist sense and its mean can be interpreted as the mean of the exact posterior distribution resulting from a Gaussian prior distribution with a shrinking covariance operator.(C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We establish a local asymptotic normality property - with respect to intercept, regression coefficient, the scale parameter sigma of the error, and the scale parameter sigma(u) of individual effects (which is the parameter of interest) - for given (scaled) density f(1) of the error terms, when n tends to infinity and T is fixed. This result allows, via the Hajek representation theorem, for developing asymptotically optimal rank-based tests for the null hypothesis sigma(u) = 0 (absence of individual effects). These tests are locally asymptotically optimal at correctly specified innovation densities f(1), but remain valid irrespective of the actual underlying density. The limiting distribution of our test statistics is obtained both under the null and under sequences of contiguous alternatives. A local asymptotic linearity property is established in order to control for the effect of substituting estimators for nuisance parameters. The asymptotic relative efficiencies of the proposed procedures with respect to the corresponding pseudo-Gaussian parametric tests are derived. In particular, the van der Waerden version of our rank-based tests uniformly dominates, from the point of view of Pitman efficiency, the classical Honda test. Small-sample performances are investigated via a Monte-Carlo study, and confirm theoretical findings. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The National Health Security Office, the institute managing the Universal Coverage Scheme in Thailand, recently called for more rational, transparent, and fair decisions on the public reimbursement of health interventions. This article describes the application of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to guide the coverage decisions on including health interventions in the Universal Coverage Scheme health benefit package in the period 2009-2010. Methods: We described the MCDA priority-setting process through participatory observation and evaluated the rational, transparency, and fairness of the priority-setting process against the accountability for reasonableness framework. Results: The MCDA was applied in four steps: 1) 17 interventions were nominated for assessment; 2) nine interventions were selected for further quantitative assessment on the basis of the following criteria: size of population affected by disease, severity of disease, effectiveness of health intervention, variation in practice, economic impact on household expenditure, and equity and social implications; 3) these interventions were then assessed in terms of cost-effectiveness and budget impact; and 4) decision makers qualitatively appraised, deliberated, and reached consensus on which interventions should be adopted in the package. Conclusion: This project was carried out in a real-world context and has considerably contributed to the rational, transparent, and fair priority-setting process through the application of MCDA. Although the present project has applied MCDA in the Thai context, MCDA is adaptable to other settings.","[Youngkong, Sitaporn; Tantivess, Sripen; Mohara, Adun; Teerawattananon, Yot] Minist Publ Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, Muang 11000, Nonthaburi, Thailand; [Youngkong, Sitaporn; Baltussen, Rob] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Nijmegen Int Ctr Hlth Syst Res & Educ, Dept Primary & Community Hlth, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Youngkong, S (通讯作者)，Minist Publ Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, Tiwanon Rd, Muang 11000, Nonthaburi, Thailand.",sitaporn.y@hitap.net,"Baltussen, R.M.P.M./L-4181-2015; Youngkong, Sitaporn/HLP-3122-2023","Teerawattananon, Yot/0000-0003-2217-2930",World Health Organization,World Health Organization(World Health Organization),"Source of financial support: The first author was supported by the World Health Organization under its Fellowship Program to study at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, The Netherlands.",,33,83,87,0,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15,6.0,,,,,961,970,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.006,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999148.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800024,0

This optimization problem is challenging since the standard SIS epidemiological model describing the spread of the disease contains a nonconvexity. Neither optimal control nor standard discrete-time dynamic programming can be used to identify the optimal policy. We modify the standard dynamic programming algorithm and show how familiar, elementary arguments can be used to reach conclusions about the optimal policy. We show that under certain conditions it is optimal to focus the entire annual budget on one group at a time rather than divide it among several groups, as is often done in practice. We also show that under certain conditions it remains optimal to focus on one group when faced with a wealth constraint instead of an annual budget. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
