Such interferences lead to the Mortality Paradox: the worse the survival conditions of the poor are, the lower the measured poverty is. We examine several solutions to avoid that paradox. We identify conditions under which the extension, by means of a fictitious income, of lifetime income profiles of the prematurely dead neutralizes the noise due to differential mortality. Then, to account not only for the missing poor, but, also, for the hidden poverty (premature death), we use, as a fictitious income, the welfare-neutral income, making indifferent between life continuation and death.

However, the users of renewable fuels will not pay for tradable carbon allowances. Advanced energy production technologies enable the switch from fossil fuels to renewable wood fuels, and therefore wood fuels may constitute a competitive substitute for fossil fuels, especially if the price of allowances is relatively high. In this context we analyzed plant level Finnish data from years 2005-2008 with mixed models. Econometric equations were specified and estimated for the wood-fossil fuel ratios, and for the fossil fuel cost shares. We found that the EU ETS has short term impacts on the fuel mixes of the energy plants. The elasticity of substitution between fossil and non-fossil fuels is larger under the ETS. Large plants have adjusted their fuel technology choices toward more wood using and fuel price sensitive forms. The size of energy plants and heterogeneity among them across the industries determine the extent of fuel substitution. However plants' regional locations have limited roles in the interfuel flexibility.","[Linden, Mikael] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Hlth & Social Management, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland; [Makela, Matti; Uusivuori, Jussi] Finnish Forest Res Inst Metla, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland",University of Eastern Finland; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Uusivuori, J (通讯作者)，Finnish Forest Res Inst Metla, POB 18, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland.",jussi.uusivuori@metla.fi,,,,,,,32,6,7,0,21,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,34.0,2,,,,,145,167,,10.5547/01956574.34.2.5,0.0,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,109KV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316368300005,0

The paper explored the probability weighted method of moments (PWMM) applied to estimation of the GPD parameters. The PWMM algorithm requires specification of the CDF estimate of the so-called excess variable and depends on the choice of the order of the probability weighted moments. Through the simulation study, the paper investigated statistical properties of the GPD parameter estimates with reference to the PWMM algorithm specification. The simulation experiment was designed with the use of fat tailed distributions with parameters assessed on the basis of the empirical daily data for DJIA index. The results showed that, in comparison to the commonly used CDF formula, the choice of the alternative empirical distribution function improved the statistical properties of PWMM estimates.

The latency of the volatility process is retained by augmenting data points between price observations. The convergence of the likelihood function can be obtained with mild regularity conditions. Such an approach reconciles discrete and continuous time models, and it can be implemented easily under the context of the simulated maximum likelihood.

But both approaches assume defined capacity of all edges. In our problem we know the capacity of edges as well. But contrary to the previous problems we consider that the edges capacity can be increased. The increase of the edges capacity can be done because we have some investment means which can be used for increasing the edges capacity. But in the practice, it often happens that same quantity values, having the character of constants in the model, cannot be exactly given.

One of the methods used for the business cycle analysis is based on the study of composite indicators which combine several individual economic indexes. The indexes can be divided into groups of leading, coincident and lagging ones with regard to the reference time series (usually GDP or industrial production index). The dependency between cycles of the individual indicators and the reference series can be determined with cross correlations and it is essential to adjust the time series first, so we get rid of the trend and seasonal component. The traditional approach (used by OECD and other organizations) is using algorithms like Hodrick-Prescott filter for the decomposition of the time series. We compare this methodology with smoothing the series of growth rates and with direct usage of the year-to-year growth rates. We discuss how these methods affect the cross correlations and the selection of the individual indexes for the composite indicators.","[Vrana, Lenka] Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,lenka.vrana@vse.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,5,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1016,1021,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000172,0

There is a complex relationship between the personality and social cultural environment. Many academics, including Maslow and Rokeach, have conducted a great deal of work about the personality and environment, but they have never reached an agreement about how the environmental culture regulates and changes the individual personality. Therefore, it is feasible for us to follow their route to explore the factors, mechanisms and variables influencing the individual personality from the standpoint of social environmental culture and thus breed more healthy and sound individual personality for the harmonious and scientific society. Neither a trait nor a scene, culture is a system, or a syndrome, which derives from humanities. During its long course of development, culture has always been regarded as the collection of manners, values, faiths, norms and behaviors institutionalized and conventionalized by various means in certain groups of people. It is characterized by dynamics, normalization, distinction and sharing. As the existent pattern of individuals under special culture, personality is the synthesis of relatively stable non-intelligent psychological characteristics and behavior tendency that differentiates individuals. It is an outcome of culture, covering demand, motive, interest, attitude, value, and so on. Personality is often manifested by the temperament, character, capability, individuality, value and thinking mode through which we adapt to the environment. Living in the cultural environment, we individuals are affected, chosen, molded and created by culture. Our external behavior and internal psychology, affected by the environment and our goals, have the characteristics of integrity, stability, specificity and sociality. The relationship between personality and certain social culture is one of mutual interdependence. In a certain environment, the raising system molds our personality. The synthesis of individual personality composes the group personality or the basic personality structure, and then turns into culture, which affects the raising system. Therefore, the personality and human behavior are not embodied by natural category. They are more determined by specific cultural model, namely, the basic attitudes dominating the thought and action of the individual and group. Such attitudes, usually found in the dynamic, interactive and lasting effect between human and environment, endow the individual experience with form and direction, and refer to the individual's idea and practice on the true, the good and the beautiful manifested in specific situation. Hence, development becomes the core of environmental culture - the social dynamic factors, political factors and other variables interact with each other and complete the formation of environmental culture. The environmental culture, consisting of environmental perceptive culture, environmental standard culture, environmental material culture and environmental folk culture, is the group reflection of people's understands of the nature, and perception of the relationship between themselves and the environment during the process of social practice. Mingled and expanded through cultural elements, such as the language and signs, the normative system, the social relationship and organization, and the material products, the environmental culture affects and adjusts the individual personality system. The development of individual personality varies with different environmental culture.","[Zhao Chongping] Chongqing Business Vocat Coll, Res Dept, Chongqing, Peoples R China",,,cqszyzcp@163.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,12,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,19.0,,,,,,393,396,,,,,,4,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA3ZX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335235900072,0

More hours worked by the mother tend to be negatively related to positive routines like eating meals as a family or at regular times, or having family rules about hours of television watched. Many of these same routines are significantly related to the probability of being obese, implying that family routines may be a mechanism by which maternal employment intensity affects children's obesity. However, inclusion of family routines in the obesity regression does not appreciably change the estimated effect of maternal employment hours. Thus, the commonly estimated deleterious effect of maternal employment on children's obesity cannot be explained by family routines, leaving the exact mechanisms an open question for further exploration.

A specific concern has been that the independent variables that comprise these models may have a disparate impact on these demographic groups. By disparate impact we mean that a variable's predictive power might arise not from its ability to predict future performance within any demographic group, but rather from acting as a surrogate for group membership. Using a unique source of data that combines a nationally representative sample of credit bureau records with demographic information from the Social Security Administration and a demographic information company, we examine the extent to which credit history scores may have such a disparate impact. Our examination yields no evidence of disparate impact by race (or ethnicity) or gender. However, we do find evidence of some limited disparate impact by age, in which the use of variables related to an individual's length of credit history appear to lower the credit scores of older individuals and increase them for the young.","[Avery, Robert B.; Brevoort, Kenneth P.; Canner, Glenn] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Avery, RB (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",ravery@frb.gov; kenneth.p.brevoort@frb.gov; gcanner@frb.gov,,,,,,,17,15,18,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,DEC,2012,40.0,,,1,,,S65,S114,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2012.00348.x,0.0,,,50,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,062UO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312948500004,0

The variables used in both the descriptive and analytical analyses are: the price of primary inputs and agricultural products, the public investment in the agricultural sector and the evolution of farmer income. Results from descriptive analysis highlight a degradation of the farmer's purchasing power and an unfavourable distribution of growth to employees in this sector. Econometric analysis shows a structural change in the data between the structural adjustment period (mid-1980s until mid- 1990s) and the post-adjustment period, with an acceleration of the degradation of exchange terms during the second period.

We show, even though technology exhibits the same productivity for each variety, firms drop some of varieties with trade integration. In addition, our results reveal that, contrary to the standard theoretical literature, the relationship between the decision to export and trade costs is non-linear.

Key objectives of sustainable or green freight logistics systems are the mitigation of negative environmental and human health effects of distribution operations and the realization of a major modal shift in transport preferences, while at the same time achieving internal generalized cost efficiency and quality of services. Pursuing these goals requires the introduction of a range of measures. These measures call for private and public actors to take up various initiatives and adopt policies. Usually, it is more effective to combine different actions into an integrated package of measures than to introduce single instruments in isolation. This article explores the nexus between sustainability and port hinterland container logistics. In particular, the methodology and results of an empirical analysis based on applications of a network programming tool called the interport model are presented and discussed. The model enables an examination of all possible effects on inland container flows and their associated internal and external costs due to public and private initiatives in the field of port hinterland container logistics. The empirical analysis aims to evaluate the impact of a set of simultaneous policy options and operational measures on the competitiveness and sustainability of hinterland multimodal distribution of import and export containers handled at the seaports of the Campania region located in Southern Italy. The loading units can transit through the dry port facilities (the so called interports) located in the same region and/or through extra regional railway terminals, before reaching their ultimate inland destinations or the seaports. The integrated package of measures simulated by means of the model includes: (i) infrastructure policy, (ii) improvements of rail services, (iii) regulatory changes in terms of customs authorizations and procedures, (iv) removal of technical and legal barriers to fair and non-discriminatory competition in the market of rail traction between regional seaports and interports, (v) new business models integrating container logistics operations between seaports and interports, and (vi) social marginal cost charging of transport operations. Once this package of instruments is introduced, higher private and social cost efficiency of port hinterland container distribution through the investigated regional logistics system can be achieved. For instance, it has been estimated an annual saving of the order of about 12,660 tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions from transport corresponding to an external cost reduction of 0.27 million euros from the observed real life situation, whereas the estimated saving in terms of air pollution (CO, NOX, PM, SO2, VOC) from transport is approximately 220 tonnes per year corresponding to an external benefit of 1.31 million euros. The most immediate priority appears to be the customs and intermodal logistics integration of seaports and interports by means of full implementation of the extended gateway concept as a way to increase the rail share of modal split and improve the overall cost efficiency of the system. In addition, the simultaneous introduction of a social marginal cost charging policy can contribute to make the regional interports a viable solution to expand the hinterland reach of the regional seaport cluster.

In the descriptive analysis conducted in this article, we compare the effects of mental and physical health status on labor force participation, employing propensity score methods to investigate whether these effects differ for self- and proxy respondents. The authors initially find some evidence that seems to suggest systematic differences between proxy and self-reporters in the effects of health on labor force participation, raising the possibility that self-reporters may be biased in their health assessments. After we control for objective baseline indices of mental and physical health status, however, differences between subjective health assessments and labor force participation become smaller and statistically insignificant. These results suggest that self-reports do not lead to overestimates of the importance of good physical or mental health on labor force participation, after one controls for objective health conditions in the models. Although we conclude that propensity score matching is a useful way to align observations with covariates in estimating the effects of health on labor force participation, we find that the appropriate specification of matching variables-and in particular, the inclusion of objective health measures-is critical for understanding whether self-reporting bias matters in this context.","[Sickles, Robin] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Leroux, Justin] HEC Montreal, Inst Appl Econ, CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Leroux, Justin] CIRPEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Prevent Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",Rice University; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Sickles, R (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",rsickles@rice.edu,"Leroux, Justin/AAI-3365-2020; Sickles, Robin/IRZ-2742-2023",,,,,,16,8,17,1,18,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We consider 10 assets from the New York Stock Exchange and compare 125 models based 1-, 5- and 20-day-ahead conditional variance forecasts over a period of 10 years using the model confidence set (MCS) and the superior predictive ability (SPA) tests. Model performance is evaluated using four statistical loss functions which account for different types and degrees of asymmetry with respect to over-/under-predictions. When considering the full sample, MCS results are strongly driven by short periods of high market instability during which multivariate GARCH models appear to be inaccurate. Over relatively unstable periods, i.e. the dot-com bubble, the set of superior models is composed of sophisticated specifications such as orthogonal and dynamic conditional correlation (DCC), both with leverage effect in the conditional variances. However, unlike the DCC models, our results show that the orthogonal specifications tend to underestimate the conditional variance. Over calm periods, a simple assumption like constant conditional correlation and symmetry in the conditional variances cannot be rejected. Finally, during the 20072008 financial crisis, accounting for non-stationarity in the conditional variance process generates superior forecasts. The SPA test suggests that, independently from the period, the best models do not provide significantly better forecasts than the DCC model of Engle (2002, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 20: 339350) with leverage in the conditional variances of the returns.

However; the was farmers re-act to this reform, and how they select the most appropriate AES still remain puzzling and relatively under-explored. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to analyze the factors affecting the likelihood of farmers to use different types of AES. We analyze the decisions to use three different types of AES made by a sample of famers (443) in Italy (Marche region). This decision-making mechanism is related to the use of AES introduced by Marche Regional Administration (MRA) in a policy reform in 2005. By adopting this approach, we highlight the relevance of social capital and local networks in driving the decision to use services more related to information, knowledge sharing and diffusion, while the agricultural specialization remains the main factor affecting fanners likelihood to use specialized and targeted services.","[Pascucci, Stefano] Management Studies Grp MST, Wageningen, Netherlands; [de-Magistris, Tiziana] Ctr Agrofood Res & Technol CITA, Agrofood Econ Unit, Zaragoza, Spain",,"Pascucci, S (通讯作者)，Management Studies Grp MST, Wageningen, Netherlands.",,,"de Magistris, Tiziana/0000-0001-5480-183X",R.T.I.

The study finds that no forecast gains over a simple AR(1) specification exist at any of the forecast horizons that are considered, regardless of whether point or density forecasts are utilised in the evaluation. Non-parametric methods are used in conjunction with simulation techniques to learn about the models and their forecasts. It is shown graphically that the nonlinearity in the conditional means (or point forecasts) of the ESTAR model decreases as the forecast horizon increases. The non-parametric methods show also that the multiple steps ahead forecast densities are normal looking with no signs of bi-modality, skewness or kurtosis.","Univ St Gallen, Inst Math & Stat, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Buncic, D (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Math & Stat, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",daniel.buncic@unisg.ch,,,,,,,28,4,4,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Global parameters results are estimated using spatial error model specifications while more local effects are estimated by geographically weighted regression. Global results are typical in that structural characteristics such as floor space and contextual characteristics such as level of in-migration are important in residential prices. Local results, however, indicate significant spatial variation in the effect of both structural amenities and locational context on housing prices. In a simpler specification, rents are shown to respond positively to both median house prices levels and the supply of apartments available at market prices, but also with significant spatial variation across China.","[Hanink, Dean M.; Cromley, Robert G.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Ebenstein, Avraham Y.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel",University of Connecticut; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Cromley, RG (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, Campus Unit 4148,215 Glenbrook Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",dean.hanink@uconn.edu; robert.cromley@uconn.edu; ebenstein@mscc.huji.ac.il,"Ebenstein, Avraham/AAK-6482-2020","Ebenstein, Avraham/0000-0003-1276-4537",,,,,29,45,48,1,90,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In recent years, the number of cases handled by the Rights Commissioners has grown hugely. A close examination of the cases handled by the service suggests that the Rights Commissioners allow vulnerable workers to pursue cases of alleged breaches of employment rights.

Toward this end, the article extends a flexible nonlinear inference to the panel data analysis where the random error components are incorporated into the flexible approach. The article reports clear evidence of nonlinearity in the panel and confirms earlier claims in the literature-oil price increases are statistically and economically significant while oil price decreases are not and previous upheaval in oil prices causes the marginal effect of any given oil price change to be reduced. Our result suggests that the nonlinear oil-macroeconomy relation is generally observable over different industrialized countries and it is desirable for one to use the nonlinear function of oil price change for GDP forecast.","Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Kim, DH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",dongkim@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,53,7,8,0,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The authors develop a dual regression model of the score and prize earning equations that considers the prize earnings as the ultimate output, scores as the intermediate outputs, and golfing skills as the inputs. Therefore, it enables efficiencies to be compared in the production processes of scores and prize earnings.

Based on in-depth interviews and an original survey of Russian firms, the article demonstrates a dramatic decline in threats related to private coercion, due partly to firms' increased reliance on formal legal institutions. By contrast, state threats to property rights have increased sharply.

What are the effects of such co-operation across the eastern borders of the EU and what are the prospects for bringing this region's countries closer to the EU without offering them the possibility of formal EU membership? Using the tools of social network analysis and regression methods, this article investigates the effect of the EU's external governance on the previously neglected societal level by focusing on cross-border inter-firm networks. The findings show that the diffusion of organizational practices is occurring within these networks which have emerged as the result of EU governance efforts abroad. The article explores the causal mechanisms of this diffusion, and also identifies factors that impede or catalyze the transfer of organizational practices. It also points to the relevance of neofunctionalism in explaining integration between the EU and its eastern neighbours.","[Turkina, Ekaterina] HEC Montreal, Dept Int Business, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Postnikov, Evgeny] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Turkina, E (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Int Business, Edifice Cote St Catherine,3000 Chemin Cote St Cat, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",ekaterina.turkina@hec.ca,,"Postnikov, Evgeny/0000-0002-4366-8401",,,,,51,9,10,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This article intends to underpin some good ideas but also to raise some criticalities. A first criticism goes towards its standard approach and its technicist dimension. A second criticality is its bias towards large-sized farms that may destabilize family-run agriculture, which is the only reality in the rural world. A third criticality addresses the ultra-productivist model of agriculture in this plan which is dangerous for the environment and natural resources. Choices made at production levels do not seem to take in serious consideration the protection of food security in the country. The aggregation-based organization is viewed with some skepticism, mainly for its pretention to be easily replicable. The second pillar forced us to question whether it will be a supporting accompanying measure or a dumping ground of the first pillar....As to the governance of the Green Morocco Plan, it seems to be too red-tape and elitist, which may raise some concern.","Inst Agron & Vet Hassan II, Rabat, Morocco",,"Akesbi, N (通讯作者)，Inst Agron & Vet Hassan II, Rabat, Morocco.",,,,,,,,63,33,35,2,25,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2012,11.0,2,,,,,12,23,,,,,,12,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,003SD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308630700003,0

In addition to the influence of social characteristics such as ethnicity and qualifications in determining employment rates, experiences of discrimination, poor health and caring responsibilities affect many young women. Neighbourhood variations in the reasons for worklessness, even among highly employable young women, suggest that the multiple issues affecting disadvantaged groups are also influenced by local job markets. Occupational segregation and clustering into particular industries are added constraints for young women which are largely ignored in welfare policies seeking to address youth unemployment.","Sheffield Hallam Univ, Dept Architecture & Planning, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England",Sheffield Hallam University,"Escott, K (通讯作者)，Sheffield Hallam Univ, Dept Architecture & Planning, City Campus, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England.",k.escott@shu.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,19,21,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In this paper, we contribute to this effort by examining the network relationships of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) across four issues areas: the environment, health, human rights, and development. Using originally coded data on over 4000 INGOs, we find that the characteristics of network relations across the four areas are in fact quite different. Further, we find that these differences are driven in part by the characteristics of the INGOs, including whether they are located in the global North or South and their ties to intergovernmental organizations. Finally, we highlight the crucial bridge role of organizations that focus on a hybrid of multiple issue-areas within the overall network.","[Murdie, Amanda] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Davis, David R.] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Kansas State University; Emory University,"Murdie, A (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",amurdie@ksu.edu; poldd@emory.edu,"Murdie, Amanda/GQB-5152-2022","Murdie, Amanda/0000-0002-6459-0594",,,,,85,50,61,0,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The objective is to minimize the total network costs, which are generalized costs that may include the monetary, risk, time, and social costs. The model assumes that disruptions may have an impact on both the network link capacities as well as on the product demands. Two different cases of disruption scenarios are considered. In the first case, we assume that the impacts of the disruptions are mild and that the demands can be met. In the second case, the demands cannot all be satisfied. For these two cases, we propose two individual performance indicators. We then construct a bi-criteria indicator to assess the supply chain network performance for critical needs. An algorithm is described which is applied to solve a spectrum of numerical examples in order to illustrate the new concepts.

This paper attempts to develop a utility indifference-based model for evaluating the reservation spreads of swap receivers and payers based on the principle of expected wealth utility equivalence rather than the traditional risk-neutral argument. Under the proposed model framework, this paper addresses the determination of the swap spreads. When the incompleteness of real estate markets and heterogeneity of representative agents are taken into consideration, it is shown that the agents' risk preferences and heterogeneous beliefs about expected future property returns are the remarkable determinants for the swap spreads. Our model also identifies market power and the settlement rules in the event of counterparty default as important factors in determining the swap spreads. Our model provides a possible interpretation for the difference between the spreads predicted by the traditional models and the actual market spreads.","[Fan, Gang-Zhi] Konkuk Univ, Dept Real Estate Studies, Seoul 143701, South Korea; [Pu, Ming] SW Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Chengdu 610074, Peoples R China; [Ong, Seow Eng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore",Konkuk University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; National University of Singapore,"Fan, GZ (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Real Estate Studies, 1 Hwayang Dong, Seoul 143701, South Korea.",puming@swufe.edu.cn; fan10@konkuk.ac.kr; seong@nus.edu.sg,"Ong, Seow Eng/ABB-9098-2020",,,,,,61,3,4,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The purpose of this article is to provide evidence on habit and addictive behavior toward antibiotics by exploring variations in the average consumption of antibiotics across 20 Italian regions. Using a balanced panel data set (2000-2009), we estimate myopic and rational addiction models, in which antibiotic consumption depends upon demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population, the supply of health care in the community, antibiotic price, and the capital stock of endogenous bacterial resistance measured by past and future consumption. Our empirical evidence shows that past antibiotic consumption stimulates current consumption and is also consistent with the rational addiction hypothesis. The low price elasticity of antibiotic demand suggests that policy measures targeted at antibiotic co-payments may not be effective in controlling antibiotic consumption. There is scope for other policy interventions, such as incentives and information campaigns targeted at doctors.","[Filippini, M.; Masiero, G.] Univ Lugano, Dept Econ, Lugano, Switzerland; [Filippini, M.] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland; [Masiero, G.] Univ Bergamo, Dept Econ & Technol Management, Bergamo, Italy",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Bergamo,"Masiero, G (通讯作者)，Univ Lugano, Dept Econ, Lugano, Switzerland.",massimo.filippini@usi.ch; giuliano.masiero@unibg.it,"Filippini, Massimo/K-8155-2013","Filippini, Massimo/0000-0002-5972-4439; MASIERO, Giuliano/0000-0001-5480-0829",,,,,39,8,8,1,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The extension of mixed logit to incorporate scale heterogeneity in a generalised mixed logit (GMXL) model provides a way to accommodate these sources of influence, observed and unobserved. The small but growing number of applications of the GMXL model have parameterized scale heterogeneity as a single estimate; however it is often the case that analysts pool data from more than one source, be it revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) sources, or multiple SP sources, inducing the potential for differences in the scale factor between the data sources. Existing practice has developed ways of accommodating scale differences between data sources by adopting a scale homogeneity assumption within each data source (e.g., the nested logit trick) that varies between data sources. This paper extends the state of the art by incorporating data-source specific scale differences in scale heterogeneity setting across pooled RP and SP data set. An example of choice amongst RP and SP transport modes (including two 'new' SP modes) is used to obtain values of travel time savings that vary significantly between a model that accounts for scale heterogeneity differences within pooled RP and SP data, and the other where differences in scale heterogeneity is also accommodated between RP and SP data.

Under what circumstances are states likely to take this step? We argue that NGO monitoring allows states to provide domestic publics with credible evidence regarding successful cooperation, but that this credibility carries a cost: if states fail to cooperate, a participating NGO will expose this failure and thus delegitimize the cooperation effort. Our formal analysis indicates that states obtain a dual benefit from NGO participation: in addition to enhanced legitimacy, NGO scrutiny helps states credibly commit to high cooperation levels vis-a-vis each other. The increased costs of failure, however, may deter state use of NGO monitoring. Surprisingly, we find that NGO monitoring is the most useful for states when the cooperation cost is relatively low. We explore the empirical relevance of our theoretical argument in NGO monitoring of World Bank development projects and compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. We also explain why NGO monitoring has been disallowed in the Global Environment Facility. Our analysis provides a firm strategic foundation for the idea that NGO participation sometimes confers benefits to states, and our theory has several empirically falsifiable implications.","[Pallas, Christopher L.] Kennesaw State Univ, Int Conflict Management Program, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA; [Pallas, Christopher L.] Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA; [Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University; University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University; Columbia University,"Pallas, CL (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Int Conflict Management Program, 1000 Chastain Rd,MD 2201, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",clp2795@gmail.com; ju2178@columbia.edu,,,,,,,63,17,21,0,87,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We find that average height followed a general upward time trend, but the economic downturn in the 1880s slowed down the increase in rural average-heights while the economic crisis subsequent to World War I had only a minor effect. Moreover, social-class affiliation was the most important determinant of differences in the biological standard of living, with class and regional disparities remaining constant, for the most part, during the observation period. Lower-class individuals' ability to overcome economic stress was limited, with the result that their biological standard of living, as reflected in the cyclicality of deviations from average height, was likely to be affected by cycles in economic activity.

The crucial step in DGS is when the auctioneer selects a so-called minimal overdemanded set of items because the specific selection may affect a number of performance measures such as the number of iterations and the ratio of elicited preferences. The computational results show that (i) DGS graphs are typically large even for relatively small numbers of bidders and items, (ii) DGS converges slowly and (iii) DGS performs well in terms of preference elicitation. The paper also demonstrates that the modification to DGS based on the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm outperforms all investigated rules for selecting a minimal overdemanded set of items in DGS both in terms of termination speed and preference elicitation.","[Andersson, Tommy; Andersson, Christer] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Andersson, T (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",tommy.andersson@nek.lu.se,,,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees for extremely helpful comments on this paper.

However, the effect of a larger body size on social network ties or friendship formations is less well understood. In this paper, we explore the extent to which higher body weight results in social marginalization of adolescents. Using data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents, we estimate endogeneity-corrected models including school-level fixed effects that account for bi-directionality and unobserved confounders to ascertain the effect of body weight on social network ties. We find that obese adolescents have fewer friends and are less socially integrated than their non-obese counterparts. We also find that such penalties in friendship networks are present among whites but not African-Americans or Hispanics, with the largest effect among white females. These results are robust to common environmental influences at the school-level and to controls for preferences, risk attitudes, low self-esteem and objective measures of physical attractiveness.

These acquisitions, however, are often destined to fail. Post-acquisition capability transfer implications have been mentioned as the primary reason for such high failure rates. Nonetheless, we still do not know how to enhance post-acquisition transfer of target's capabilities. Prior post-acquisition research has broadly focused on two aspects, namely: post-acquisition capability transfer vs. developing a general acquisition capability. This present study argues for a synthesis of these two prior post acquisition literature streams. As a result, the importance of a grafting capability that is, an acquisition capability specifically developed for transferring capabilities is recognized. The findings of this study show that in contrast with the existing literature on capabilities that focuses more on deliberate learning mechanisms, the microfoundations of such a grafting capability are search activities that is, ad hoc problem solving. In addition, it is shown that the effect of such search activities could be strengthening when firms involved have common knowledge.","[Amiryany, Nima; Huysman, Marleen] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Cloodt, Myriam] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Schijven, Mario] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Eindhoven University of Technology; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Amiryany, N (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",namiryany@vu.nl,"Cloodt, Myriam/AAY-3882-2020",,,,,,93,0,0,0,13,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,712,+,,,,,,6,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500114,0

This prediction is tested with a laboratory experiment that elicits a Gittins index and a willingness to pay on six two-armed bandits.

A countrys geographical location does, however, not only determine its agricultural conditions or disease environment. It also pins down a countrys relative position vis--vis other countries, affecting its ease of access to foreign markets. This paper assesses the importance of market access for manufactures in explaining the observed income differences between SSA countries over the period 19932009. We construct yearly, theory-based measures of each SSA countrys market access using the information contained in bilateral manufacturing trade flows. Using these measures, we find a robust positive effect of market access on economic development that has increased in importance during the last decade. Interestingly, when further unraveling this finding, access to other SSA markets in particular turns out to be important.","[Bosker, Maarten] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bosker, Maarten] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bosker, Maarten] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Garretsen, Harry] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Garretsen, Harry] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Utrecht University; University of Groningen; University of Cambridge,"Bosker, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bosker@ese.eur.nl; j.h.garretsen@rug.nl,,,,,,,52,26,31,1,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Experiences from developed countries and countries in transition show that the optimal credit risk policy is an essential prerequisite for accelerating economic development. The effectiveness of the mechanism in achieving this goal involves the fulfilment of certain conditions: stabilization of prices and elimination of price disparities, coordination of movements of exchange rates, inflation and interest rates, etc. In countries with a diversified financial structure, achieving these prereqisits, as weel as the formation of interest rates on the blanced value is realized through the action of the market mechanism. Given that most of these issue are present in Macedonia, it is necessary to identify and cretically re-assess the effects of credit risk policy on economic development, as well as preventive measures to reduce risk.(2) While financial institutions have faced difficulties over the years for a multitude of reasons, the major cause of serious banking problems countinues to be directly related to credit standards for borrowers and counterparties, portfolio risk management, or a lock of attention to changes in economic or other circumstances that can lead to a deterioration in the credit standing of a bank's counterparties.

The model is designed to capture correlations among random components influencing these decisions. For empirical investigation, the model is estimated using a data set collected in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in 2001. Considering the fact that work duration involves medium- to long-term decision making compared to short-term activity scheduling decisions, work duration is considered endogenous to work start time decisions. The empirical model reveals many behavioral details of commuters' mode choice, work start time and duration decisions. The primary objective of the model is to predict workers' work schedules according to mode choice, which is considered a skeletal activity schedule in activity-based travel demand models. However, the empirical model reveals many behavioral details of workers' mode choices and work scheduling. Independent application of the model for travel demand management policy evaluations is also promising, as it provides better value in terms of travel time estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Several approaches for solving such models have been developed and are already known. Depending on type of the objective function (convex or non-convex), there are, among others, two common ways of solving these models. The solution of the models can either be found by plain modification of simplex algorithm or, if non-convex, in a different specific ways. Using an auxiliary model of integer (bivalent) programming is one way to deal with the problem. For each linear model, there is also dual model and its properties and purpose is widely known. This paper is to describe dual associated model for general piecewise linear model with auxiliary model. This dual model provides an additional knowledge useful for solution of models that cannot be solved in any common way. The properties of this dual model would be described further in this paper.

One explanation for this is that housing markets are thin, resulting in price bargaining between sellers and buyers. If the relative bargaining power of buyers varies, so will sales prices. One hypothesis is that the relative bargaining strength of buyers coming from outside the local market relative to that of local residents is weak, because distant buyers have high search costs and may know less about the nuances of the local market. Our results, based upon a large number of single-family home transactions from the state of Florida, lend support to this hypothesis. Another related hypothesis is that buyers' price expectations are anchored to prices they were accustomed to at their previous residence. Hence, if they come from high price markets they will tend to pay more for their new home.

Using data from 1984 to 1990, a period during which a large scale trade liberalization occurred, a dynamic investment equation is estimated using the system-GMM estimator developed by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998). Consistent with theory, the empirical analyses show that a reduction in import protection on final goods leads to lower plant-level investment, whereas reductions in tariffs and import license coverage on intermediate inputs result in higher investment. Also, firms with larger import costs experience a larger increase in investment following a reduction in import protection. On the other hand, higher markup firms lower investment more aggressively following reductions in tariffs and import license coverage on final goods.","[Kandilov, Ivan T.; Leblebicioglu, Ash] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Kandilov, IT (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",ivan_kandilov@ncsu.edu; alebleb@ncsu.edu,,"Kandilov, Ivan/0000-0002-0761-8095",,,,,33,12,14,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

However, it is assumed that the former and the latter are different in terms of external utilities. Under the assumptions, we have developed a unified agent based model and have made simulation for analyzing the emergence process of innovation and deviation. The simulation results are confirmed through manual simulation and case analysis in order to obtain an in-depth understanding of inextricably linked organisational phenomena, and to distinguish the similarities and differences between innovation and deviation.","[Kobayashi, Tomomi; Takahashi, Satoshi; Kunigami, Masaaki; Yoshikawa, Atsushi; Terano, Takao] Tokyo Inst Technol, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology,,kbys@triton.ocn.ne.jp,"Yoshikawa, Atsushi/AAU-6741-2020; Yoshikawa, Atsushi/AAH-9604-2021","Yoshikawa, Atsushi/0000-0001-7020-5085;",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,778,791,,,,,,14,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500122,0

In this study, we first examine the sensitivity of retail firm returns to a real estate factor over the period 1998-2008. The retail industry is chosen because of the significant use of real estate in a typical retail firm's production function. Consistent with our expectations, retail stocks exhibit positive real estate risk exposure, even after controlling for sensitivity to general market risk as well as other standard risk factors. The second part of our analysis examines whether the intensity of real estate ownership and the use of off-balance operating leases to finance real property holdings are reflected in the market and real estate betas of retail stocks. We find that greater use of off-balance sheet operating leases is associated with higher market betas. In fact, the use of operating leases appears to have a larger impact on sensitivity to market risk than does the use of on-balance sheet debt. Our findings also confirm our hypothesis that real estate intensive firms display significantly greater exposure to a real estate factor. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that investors are fully aware of the risk associated with off-balance sheet operating leases.","[Ling, David C.; Naranjo, Andy; Ryngaert, Michael] Univ Florida, Hough Grad Sch Business, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ling, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Hough Grad Sch Business, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",ling@ufl.edu,,,,,,,16,18,19,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The threat of confiscation of criminal proceeds derived from any form of organized crime (drug trafficking, arms trafficking, corruption, fraud), puts the criminals in a position to find a another way to legalize criminal dirty money. The legalization process is very complex with numerous activities, with an order not to reveal the criminal origin of money, and thus avoid the danger of their confiscation. As criminals build a safe strategy for legalization of criminally acquired proceeds, that the state should build a system to protect the financial system from the entry of criminal money which will be threat for national and international economy and affecting the reliability of the financial system. Republic of Macedonia has actively joins on the fight against money laundering through harmonization of national legislation and acceptance of the recommendation of international legal acts, and active approach to building the institutional system to prevent of money laundering. The system for prevention of money laundering is a complex and composed process of three main pillars with aimed to build a strategy which include measures and activities to identify suspicious financial transactions, identification of criminals and providing evidence of the committed crime that resulted in criminal proceeds and security, freezing and confiscation through criminal money trail. The first pillar of the system consists of entities - a legal category of natural persons and legal entities performing legal or financial services which have a legal obligation for their customer. analysis and identification of suspicious financial transactions and inform Financial Intelligence Unit for suspicious activities of their clients. While the third pillar is law enforcement bodies which includes public prosecution bodies, Ministry of Interior, Financial Police and etc. The System for prevention of money laundering functioned in two ways. First way is when the entities identifying suspicious transactions and inform Financial Intelligence Units, then delivered the data to law enforcement entities for the provision of evidence and prosecution of money launders, and the second way is when through detection of crime, and following the money. Banks have a legal obligation to undertake the following actions for detection of money laundering: customer due diligence, to follow certain transactions or activities, to collect, store and provide data for suspicious transactions and customers. The control of entry of criminal money is strengthened through legal provisions, their implementation. Most important is to recognition and identification of criminal money, their sources and of course taking legislative measures and action for submission of data on suspicious transactions of individuals and legal entities on domestic and foreign countries. In that way, banks should take appropriate measures and activities aimed at applying the correct legal decisions, and activities of education staff in order to recognize, identification suspicious customers, suspicious transactions, and reporting to the competent state bodies and institutions for financial intelligence and prosecution of perpetrators of crimes for acts arising from crime and money laundering.

Socially responsible universities foster the development of entrepreneurial behavior and social responsibility of their students and show that they know and can respond to actual social issues, not only through projects referred to community development, but also through programs and courses that educate young people how to become active participants in the process of making positive social changes. Such educational programs, also known as academic service learning programs, allow students transfer knowledge and skills gained in the classroom into practical projects within their communities thus becoming more socially aware and active. Such programs are important component of socially responsible performance of universities; they reinforce the connection between universities and local communities, show that universities are capable to recognize what is going on in their society and actively participate in the development of the culture where socially responsible behavior of its actors is not a mean to an end but an end itself. In Croatia most universities are neglecting the responsibility they have toward their community thus focusing merely on educational and research component. This paper describes the case of the academic service learning course Entrepreneurial skill I at Faculty of Economics in Osijek as one of the rare examples of fostering development of social responsibilities of students. This course encourages students to stop being passive observers of social phenomena, but instead, through active participation in the community, to have direct impact on solving current social issues and develop skills with which they will ensure successful employment. The project Contribution to the Community within the course is an important activity that helps students retain and improve their skills, provides opportunity to explore new options, gives pleasure because of participating in solving community's problems, and contributes to building problem solving capacity. Fostering and developing entrepreneurial mindset of students affects both their personal development and the economic and social development of the community they live in. The methodology used to identify models used for development of entrepreneurial behaviors of college students is based on a review of literature (entrepreneurship education, knowledge society, universities. social responsibility, academic service learning programs, higher education and economic development) and qualitative studies and recommendations related to supporting students. active engagement in the community and collaboration between local communities, universities and students.","[Peric, Julia] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,,julia@efos.hr,"Perić, Julia/AAC-3447-2022","Perić, Julia/0000-0001-8031-7435",,,,,20,5,6,3,15,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,365,375,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600041,0

Yet, little is known about the shape of transmission cost functions. Reasons for this can be a lack of consensus about the definition of transmission output and the complexitity of the relationship between optimal grid expansion and output expansion. Knowledge of transmission cost functions could help firms (Transcos) and regulators plan transmission expansion and could help design regulatory incentive mechanisms. We explore transmission cost functions when the transmission output is defined as point-to-point transactions or financial transmission right (FTR) obligations and particularly explore expansion under loop-flows. We test the behavior of FTR-based cost functions for distinct network topologies and find evidence that cost functions defined as FTR outputs are piece-wise differentiable and that they contain sections with negative marginal costs. Simulations, however, illustrate that such unusual properties do not stand in the way of applying price-cap incentive mechanisms to real-world transmission expansion. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol33-No1-5","[Rosellon, Juan] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Vogelsang, Ingo] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Weigt, Hannes] European Univ Inst, FSR, Florence, Italy",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Boston University; European University Institute,,juan.rosellon@cide.edu,,"Rosellon, Juan/0000-0003-3811-1278; Weigt, Hannes/0000-0002-2036-9177","Programa Interinstitucional de estudios sobre la Region de America del Norte (PIERAN) at El Colegio de Mexico,; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Conacyt [p. 60334]","Programa Interinstitucional de estudios sobre la Region de America del Norte (PIERAN) at El Colegio de Mexico,; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Conacyt(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","Juan Rosellon acknowledges support of the Programa Interinstitucional de estudios sobre la Region de America del Norte (PIERAN) at El Colegio de Mexico, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and Conacyt (p. 60334).

The results of this study indicate that the variables are cointegrated and the causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth in Portugal is bi-directional. Uni-directional causalities running from energy price and real income to employment are also found. Contrary to earlier studies, our results indicate that Portugal is an energy-dependent economy and energy-conservation policies could be detrimental to its economic growth and development. Therefore, renewable energy sources such as bio-fuel, solar power hydro power, wind power, and wave power should be aggressively explored to ensure sufficient supply of energy to support the growth of the Portuguese economy in an environment-friendly manner.","[Tang, Chor Foon; Tan, Eu Chye] Univ Malaya, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Tang, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",tcfoon@yahoo.com,"Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222",,,,,92,26,28,0,31,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2012,33.0,4,,,,,23,48,,10.5547/01956574.33.4.2,0.0,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,012QL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309251500002,0

This problem can be greatly exacerbated by the general trade system procedure used to compile the U.N. statistics, as opposed to the special trade practice used for the World Trade Organization Integrated Database.

Results show that airfare discount schemes for island residents raise demand and positively affect competition and the number of flights at the route level. These effects are evident in France and Italy, but are particularly marked in Spain. By contrast, public service obligations (PSOs) reduce competition on the protected routes, while their effect on the number of flights differs depending on national regulations. In Spain, routes protected with PSOs have greater flight frequencies than those on unprotected routes of similar characteristics, but in France, Italy and the UK the opposite result is found. The empirical model also finds that on routes with low-cost airlines market concentration is smaller and there is a larger number of flights. This result is relevant for the design of universal service policy, since in recent years low-cost airlines have entered a number of thin routes and have increased access to air transportation.

This study examines residential relocation of families whose children attend a charter school. We develop a conceptual model that predicts where relocating families are likely to move, given ex ante distance and direction to the school. The model is parameterized using data from student mailing address changes. We find that families are almost twice as likely to relocate toward the school as would be expected if the school did not exert any attraction. Moreover, although families are not required to live near the school, the child's school exerts a significantly stronger attraction than parent workplaces. This result may have important implications for mitigating urban sprawl, fostering urban renewal and promoting sustainable real estate development.","[Danielsen, Bartley R.; Zhao, Jing] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Harrison, David M.] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",North Carolina State University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Danielsen, BR (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",brdaniel@ncsu.edu; david.m.harrison@ttu.edu; jzhao9@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,14,4,6,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2014,42.0,4,,,,,1008,1041,,10.1111/1540-6229.12074,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,AU5FK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345632400007,0

Only a handful of studies have been conducted so far to identify the generators of paratransit trips and most focused on the home end of the trips. Given some of the inconsistencies in past studies and the scarcity of studies on the generators of trips away from home, this study attempts to identify the generators of paratransit trips beginning and ending at clients' homes and away from home. It uses an extremely large dataset consisting of 1.91 million trips made by NJ TRANSIT's Access Link clients, socioeconomic data from the American Community Survey, employment data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, and establishment data from Dun and Bradstreet. The analytical methods include an ordinary least squares model (OLS) and several spatial generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to identify the characteristics of census block groups associated with Access Link trip generation at home and away from home, Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to identify the types of establishments located in the immediate vicinity of drop-offs, and a multinomial logit model (MNL) to examine the relationship between the characteristics of the establishments in the vicinity of drop-offs and the characteristics of the dropped-off clients. Together, the various analyses provide useful insights about paratransit trip generators at the macro and micro levels. Some implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While the state's hegemonic project of social development through technological progress was manifest in similar methodological agendas in the oeuvre of two leading protagonists, nevertheless it allowed for radically different views of sociology's role.

It uses an integrated econometric model of latent variable connecting multiple discrete choices. Empirical models are estimated by using a bicycle demand survey conducted in the City of Toronto in 2009. Empirical investigations reveal that latent perceptions of 'bikeability' and 'safety consciousness' directly influence the choice of biking. It is also found that the choice of the level of bike ownership (number of bikes) is directly influenced by latent 'comfortability of biking'. The number of bikes owned moreover has a strong influence on the choices of biking for different purposes. It is clear that bike users in the City of Toronto are highly safety conscious. Increasing on-street and separate bike lanes proved to have the maximum effects on attracting more people to biking by increasing the perception of bikeability in the city, comfortability of biking in the city and increasing bike users' sense of safety. In terms of individuals' characteristics, older males are found to be the most conformable and younger females are the least comfortable group of cyclists in Toronto. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using macroeconomic data for Switzerland, we compare the TL to a symmetric normalized quadratic (SNQ) function on which global curvature restrictions can be imposed. When both functions are unrestricted for curvature, convexity in prices is violated more often than concavity in factor endowments. The number of points for which both curvature conditions hold is sensitive to the date at which local restrictions are imposed on the TL, but estimated TL elasticities are robust. Through searching for an appropriate date, the TL matched the SNQ's ability to impose curvature conditions at all points. However, many TL and SNQ elasticities differ in sign and magnitude. The likelihood dominance criterion and in-sample forecasts comparisons favored the TL. Thus, choosing a functional form solely based on the possibility of imposing global curvature conditions is not advised.","[Nana, Guy Chapda] Univ Laval, Minist Finances & Econ, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Nana, Guy Chapda] Univ Laval, Ctr Res Econ Environm Agri Food Transport & Energ, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Larue, Bruno] Univ Laval, Canada Res Chair Int Agri Food Trade CREATE, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University; Laval University; Laval University,"Larue, B (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Canada Res Chair Int Agri Food Trade CREATE, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",bruno.larue@eac.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,47,2,2,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper analyses the politicisation of international governance, that is, a process in which institutions' policies and procedures become salient and controversial on the level of mass politics. It uses data on party platforms' content from 26 OECD countries to test a number of explanations for politicisation. Results suggest that scholarly debate tends to overestimate the role of globalisation for driving politicisation, while institutional variables are too often neglected. First, increased scope of international governance has made questions of international governance much more salient topics of party manifestos. Second, recent shifts of political authority to the international level can explain increased contestation of international governance to a remarkable extent. What is more, the contestation of international authority in the realm of electoral politics seems to be substantively shaped by exclusive nationalism, but not by democratic concerns.","Univ Leipzig, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Ecker-Ehrhardt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",,,,,,,,79,27,27,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It is hypothesized that such continuities, dubbed territorial genealogies, are largely rooted in the migration of region-based gubernatorial political machines from one national party to another, which constitutes a major flow of organizational continuity in the development of political parties. Statistical analysis confirms that the main hubs of machine politics in Russia's regions, originating from the intra-elite struggles of the 1990s, provide United Russia with the territorial core of its current support. Other political parties retain electoral salience in those regions where their electoral appeal is not mitigated by the presence of political machines, which underscores the importance of non-machine party organization for their electoral destinies.","European Univ St Petersburg, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, St Petersburg, Russia",European University at Saint Petersburg,"Golosov, GV (通讯作者)，European Univ St Petersburg, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, St Petersburg, Russia.",ggolosov@gmail.com,"Golosov, Grigorii/C-3032-2012","Golosov, Grigorii/0000-0001-9769-9230",,,,,77,25,28,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The Heckit model suggests the presence of a decision process of purchasing that might be more 'instinctive' than is suggested by the findings of other papers for general tourism expenditure. The improvement of the economic effects of a cruise requires the formulation of appropriate marketing strategies according to the nationality of passengers. In addition, several findings indicate that such enhancement is more required in the port of Punta del Este, whose logistics do not facilitate the direct disembarkation of tourists to the port.","[Brida, Juan Gabriel; Scuderi, Raffaele] Free Univ Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Fasone, Vincenzo; Zapata-Aguirre, Sandra] Kore Univ Enna, I-94100 Enna, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; Universita Kore di ENNA,"Scuderi, R (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Piazza Univ 1 Univ Pl 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",juangabriel.brida@unibz.it; vincenzo.fasone@unikore.it; raffaele.scuderi@unibz.it; sandra.zapataaguirre@unikore.it,"Brida, Juan Gabriel/H-3727-2015","Brida, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-2319-5790; Zapata-Aguirre, Sandra/0000-0001-6326-4837; Scuderi, Raffaele/0000-0001-5373-3775",,,,,30,20,20,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The authors consider an asymmetric-information environment, in which consumers are uncertain about service quality, and address the above issues from a signalling perspective. Building on signalling and counter-signalling theory in economics, the authors propose a number of testable hypotheses and conduct an empirical study using data for Taiwanese international tourist hotels. The empirical results support the hypothesis that the advertising-quality relationship is inverted-U shaped, whereas the price-quality relationship is positive and monotonic. Hence, higher prices may signal higher service quality, whereas higher advertising expenditure does not necessarily signal higher service quality.","[Chiu, Hsien-Hung; Chen, Chiang-Ming] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou 545, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University,"Chen, CM (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou 545, Taiwan.",ming@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,36,16,16,2,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Through developing the concept of body accumulation, this article provides a new framework for exploring ageing in an organizational context by demonstrating how masculinity, class and organizational values are mapped onto the traders' bodies over time and in ways that require individuals to continually negotiate their professional value. This not only significantly advances current understanding of how one group of professionals navigate growing older at work, but also highlights the importance of understanding ageing as an accumulation process that takes into account temporal, spatial and cultural dimensions.","[Riach, Kathleen] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Melbourne, Vic 3145, Australia; [Cutcher, Leanne] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Monash University; University of Sydney,"Riach, K (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Management, Melbourne, Vic 3145, Australia.",Kathleen.riach@monash.edu,"Cutcher, Leanne/E-5672-2015","Cutcher, Leanne/0000-0002-4192-6139; RIACH, KATHLEEN/0000-0002-2135-0398",University of Sydney,University of Sydney(University of Sydney),"The authors would like to thank the participants of HFUK who generously agreed to take part in this research, and Neil Kellard, Andrew Wood and the three anonymous reviewers whose significant engagement with the article was invaluable.

This is then applied to the economies of the 27 member states of European Union (EU-27). Finding a clear divide from east to west and south to north in the EU-27, with the more informalized and wage-based informal economies on the eastern/southern side and the less informalized and more own-account informal economies on the western/Nordic side, it is then revealed that formalization and more own-account informal sectors are significantly correlated with wealthier and more equal (as measured by the gini-coefficient) countries in which there is greater labour market intervention, higher levels of social protection and more effective redistribution via social transfers. The article concludes by discussing the implications for theory and practice.","Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Williams, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.",C.C.Williams@sheffield.ac.uk,"Williams, Colin C/B-1198-2016","Williams, Colin C/0000-0002-3610-1933",,,,,92,96,100,0,52,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The analysis is based on all employees subject to social insurance contributions working in eastern Germany in 2004. Using a statistical matching procedure combined with a difference-in-differences estimator, we observe that job-movers achieve an average annual wage increase of 2.68 % between 2004 and 2009, which is significantly higher than the annual wage growth of selected non-movers (1.34 %). The finding is very robust against changes in the matching procedure. The positive wage differential due to changing jobs was found for a variety of subgroups of individuals that were formed on the basis of sociodemographic and firm-specific characteristics. In contrast to the evidence in the 1990's, the positive wage effect is now significantly lower for movers from eastern to western Germany compared to movers within eastern Germany.","[Alm, Bastian] TU Dortmund Univ, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Engel, Dirk] Univ Appl Sci Stralsund, D-18435 Stralsund, Germany; [Engel, Dirk] Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Weyh, Antje] IAB Reg Saxony, Inst Employment Res IAB, D-09114 Chemnitz, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology; RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Alm, B (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund Univ, August Schmidt Str 6, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",Bastian.Alm@bmwi.bund.de; dirk.engel@fh-stralsund.de; antje.weyh@iab.de,"Engel, Dirk/ABD-8170-2021","Engel, Dirk/0000-0002-8203-7530",,,,,67,1,1,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Using the quote slope of Hasbrouck and Seppi (2001), a compound liquidity measure comprising the dimensions of bid-ask spread and log depths, as a proxy for latent liquidity, we assign states of liquidity that the asset instantaneously resides in to allow only extremal liquidity shocks to influence volatility. To forecast the liquidity states, we use the autoregressive conditional multinomial model of Liesenfeld et al. (2006). We test the method on a number of stocks and find that (1) for stocks in financial and technological sectors, only the extremal shocks to liquidity affect volatility significantly and such a liquidity-state adjusted volatility is likely to improve VaR forecasts; (2) the volatility of stock returns in most other sectors are less affected by extremal shocks to liquidity but the continuous liquidity proxy is able to explain some of the dynamics of volatility and (3) the inclusion of liquidity in VaR becomes increasingly important as the quantile under consideration becomes more extreme.","Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78464 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Grossmass, L (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Univ Str 10, D-78464 Constance, Germany.",rachellidan@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The inclusion of multiple products creates a variety of issues for both anti-dumping and other contingent protection measures, issues that have been prominent in national actions and WTO dispute settlements, but have been largely ignored in research. This work focuses on the most important such area, the allocation of costs among products in anti-dumping proceedings. We develop a comprehensive economic analysis for cost allocation issues, and couple it with the accounting tools that must be used for its implementation, to derive the first-best allocation methods for anti-dumping purposes.

This article looks for a proper theoretical starting point to conceptualize and explain European disintegration. Theories about European integration, but also international politics, comparative federalism, optimum currency areas and imperial decline appear to be problematic bases to this end. Some of these theories suffer from a state bias. Other theories are too narrowly focused to explain the complex process of disintegration. Yet others fail to interconnect coherently the manifold disintegrative factors. A theoretical framework on polity formation developed by Bartolini is the most promising basis from which to examine European disintegration as it avoids the problems just mentioned. It shows that Eurosceptic dissatisfaction mainly induces partial exits within the EU due to the EU's weak lock-in power, its problematic voice structuring and the lack of proper full exit options.","[Vollaard, Hans] Leiden Univ, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Vollaard, H (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands.",vollaard@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,,,75,110,114,2,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Building on the perspective of socio-technical transitions, we relate the strategies of stakeholders to their current and future interests, as well as to their expectations with regard to EVs. Our analysis is based on a series of 38 semi-structured interviews with representatives of a variety of stakeholders in the Netherlands. EVs pose both opportunities and threats to various stakeholders. They therefore participate in the development of the emerging EV system, primarily in order to learn about the potential positive and negative impacts of these systems on their interests and, ultimately, to be able to grasp the opportunities and mitigate the threats. In other words, the expectations, interests, and resulting strategies of stakeholders relate to and depend upon the specific configuration of the emerging socio-technical system for electric mobility. We identify six potential conflicts of interest: the division of tasks within a public recharging infrastructure; the allocation of charging spots; the ways in which charging behavior can be influenced; the role of fast-charging, technical standards for charging equipment; and supportive policies for full-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In general, the stakeholders do not seem overly concerned about either short-term returns on investments or long-term negative impacts. In this regard, the early phase of the transition can be understood as a relatively carefree phase. In order to continue the development of the emerging EV system and to keep it on the right track, however, for the foreseeable future, supportive policies will be necessary in order to provide a stable and reliable basis for further market expansion.

This article aims to understand these factors at the aggregate level and to anticipate future total absence that will need to be filled for a large-size transit operator. The aggregate level is defined as the total number of regular driver absences per garage, day of week and time period that need to be covered by the extraboards. This study analyzes absenteeism data obtained from OC Transpo, the transit provider of the city of Ottawa, Canada. A multilevel regression model is generated to investigate regular drivers' absences. The short-unscheduled absence is estimated in relation to temporal factors, drivers' personal characteristics, aspects of assigned work, and service delivery characteristics. Furthermore, using the model's coefficients, sensitivity analyses are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of this technique over traditional ones adopted by various transit agencies. This study provides transit planners and policy makers with a practical methodology that can be used to support extraboard planning practice and help reduce the incidence of missed trips due to absences while having the appropriate size of extraboard drivers.

Committee members have common, state-dependent preferences and receive imprecise private signals about the state of nature prior to the election. We are interested in whether the committee decision is efficient, that is whether the probability with which the committee elects the correct alternative is higher than the probability with which one single individual alone-on behalf of the others-would. It has been shown that there exists a unique efficient equilibrium in elections with two alternatives. We show that this result does not extend to elections with more alternatives. Multiple equilibria may exist for the same committee, and there may be both efficient and inefficient ones. Informative voting may or may not be an equilibrium. Also contrary to two-alternative elections, there exist responsive equilibria in which voters vote 'against' their signal. As a consequence, only two alternatives receive positive expected vote shares and the outcome is inefficient.","[Goertz, J. M.

This paper examines recent changes to pricing patterns in Canadian cities resulting in new equilibrium behavior, and discusses possible reasons for these changes. Using high frequency retail price data obtained from GasBuddy.com, it is demonstrated that volatility changes exhibited in Toronto appear to correspond to an increased frequency of the price cycle, and replacement of the cycle with fixed retail margins. While multiple factors may have contributed to the first pricing change, the second change corresponds closely to a refinery fire in southern Ontario; this temporary event (in conjunction with a rail strike and refinery maintenance) could have triggered a permanent change in equilibrium behavior. This paper also illustrates problems for academic researchers and policymakers when using low frequency price data to analyze pricing in a market characterized by a price cycle.","[Atkinson, Benjamin] Mt Royal Univ, Dept Policy Studies, Calgary, AB T3E 6K6, Canada; [Eckert, Andrew; West, Douglas S.] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",Mount Royal University; University of Alberta,"West, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",batkinson@mtroyal.ca; aeckert@ualberta.ca; douglas.west@ualberta.ca,"west, douglas s/B-3935-2014",,,,,,25,10,10,0,4,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2014,35.0,3,,,,,47,70,,10.5547/01956574.35.3.3,0.0,,,24,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AJ4PC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337657300003,0

S. manufacturing. The share of skilled labor embedded in intermediate inputs correlates strongly with the skill share employed in final production. This finding points toward an intersectoral technology-skill complementarity (ITSC). Together with input-output linkages, the observed complementarity delivers a multiplier that reinforces skill demand along the production chain. Reduced-form estimates suggest that the effect is quantitatively important, explaining about as much skill upgrading as outsourcing. Empirical evidence suggests that one channel through which this complementarity works is product innovation. I also analyze the importance of different drivers of skill upgrading over time. While foreign outsourcing and IT capital are associated with skill demand particularly strongly from the 1980s on (a period of rapidly increasing skill premiums), R&D contributed stably throughout the period 1958 to 2005. The same is true for ITSC, which augmented within-sector skill bias in a stable fashion throughout the past five decades.","[Voigtlaender, Nico] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Voigtlaender, Nico] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Voigtländer, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,,,,,,,63,18,18,0,23,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Export composition also conditions the effects of the real exchange rate and partner income growth.

In application to credit data, previous research incorrectly treats the time to predetermined maturity events as censored stochastic event times. The medical literature has binary parametric 'cure rate' models that deal with populations that never experienced the modelled event. We propose and develop a multinomial parametric incidence and duration model, incorporating such populations. In the class of cure rate models, this is the first fully parametric multinomial model and is the first framework to accommodate an event with predetermined duration. The methodology is applied to unsecured personal loan credit data provided by one of Australia's largest financial services organizations. This framework is shown to be more flexible and predictive through a simulation and empirical study that reveals: simulation results of estimated parameters with a large reduction in bias; superior forecasting of duration; explanatory variables can act in different directions upon incidence and duration; and variables exist that are statistically significant in explaining only incidence or duration.

However, our analysis also suggests that entrepreneurial firms have incentives to sell their business to incumbents. Indeed, we show that born to be sold global firms' can be even more frequent as a result of trade liberalisation and the international deregulation of the market for corporate control.","[Norback, Pehr-Johan; Persson, Lars] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Norbäck, PJ (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,,41,7,8,2,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2014,37.0,5,,,,,672,689,,10.1111/twec.12132,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AG4QQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335405700005,0

Conducting activities whilst traveling may affect the utility of activity episodes in a daily schedule. If evidence to that effect can be established, an elaboration of current activity-based models seems warranted. In this paper, as a first step towards the development of such comprehensive activity-based models, we formulate a random effects regression model to analyze the effects of multi-tasking on respondents' judgments of travel experiences of distinct travel episodes. We extend previous research with a focus on the extent and nature of multi-tasking during a single trip. We analyze repeated judgments of the same individuals for multiple travel episodes, collected over a period of three consecutive months. This longitudinal data analysis allows us to better differentiate between personality traits, temporal effects, multi-tasking and the embedding of travel episodes in the larger activity-travel chains. Results indicate that multi-tasking has a positive impact on travelers' judgments of travel experiences. Significant effects were also found for the kind of activity that was conducted immediately before and after the travel episode. We conclude therefore that it seems beneficial to include multi-tasking in a new generation of activity-based models, and that the suggested conceptualization and model formulation are feasible and valuable building blocks in the development of such more comprehensive activity-based models.

The phenomenon of identification with Europe prior to EU accession provides a window into understanding the identity mechanisms that inform the concept of European identity. The first Eurobarometer surveys measuring European identification in central and eastern accession states reported a puzzling finding: that more people, not less, identified with Europe than in existing EU states. An analysis of the Eurobarometer results provides counter-intuitive comparisons and contrasts between eastern and western Europe and uncovers potential mechanisms illustrating the content of contemporary European identity.","[Schilde, Kaija E.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Schilde, KE (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Int Relat, 156 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",kschilde@bu.edu,,,,,,,44,24,25,6,57,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Our view is that organizational creativity orchestrates continuous interactions between different types of routines, operating at different levels of the organization. More precisely we propose distinguishing three types of routines: First, the routines issued from formal structures or hierarchical working groups in the firm (functional groups, project teams, task force, etc.), for which the context of work and coordination of specialized tasks is defined ex ante by the hierarchy of the firm; Second, the routines emerging from informal structures, the knowing communities which is a generic term that defines different types of autonomous learning groups of individuals (communities of practice, epistemic communities, and other more or less informal learning groups) united by common beliefs and interests who voluntarily share their resources on a long term basis in order to create and diffuse knowledge; Third, the routines that are inherently related to the organizational creativity of the firm, which are essentially corporate routines as expression of patterns of thinking, feeling and acting in the corporate culture. In essence they are the genes of collective identity, and take the shape of project management staging and gating principles and practices, framing collective divergent exploration and convergent production toward a creative goal. The contribution is based on an in-depth analysis of the organizational creativity in the world-leading videogame company, Ubisoft, with a special focus on the studio located in Montreal. To some extent, Ubisoft is one of the flagships of the creative industries, in which the clear imperative is to sustain creativity on a permanent basis. These reasons explain the choice we made to test our approach of organizational creativity and routines in this firm.","[Cohendet, Patrick; Simon, Laurent] HEC Montreal, Mosaic, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Cohendet, Patrick; Llerena, Patrick] Univ Strasbourg, BETA, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Simon, L (通讯作者)，Dept Management, Serv Enseignement Management, 3000 Chemin de la Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",patrick.cohendet@hec.ca; pllerena@unistra.fr; laurent.simon@hec.ca,"SIMON, Laurent/AAW-7587-2020",,,,,,74,3,3,1,50,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

By means of dynamic panel data analysis, this paper examines whether internal and external migrations caused real wage beta convergence across Swedish counties. To account for statistical problems such as endogeneity of migration, time-invariant county characteristics and autocorrelation in the regression model, we adjust our estimates using fixed effects, instrumental variables and GMM. The preferred model shows that both internal and external migrations contributed to wage convergence before the First World War and internal migration mainly during the interwar years.

Both spotlights focus on the special role played by the current deep global crisis. The first line of argument centers on the history of economic ideas and shows how evolutionary economics has emerged as a promising alternative to mainstream neoclassical thought as well as to traditional Keynesian macroeconomics. The failure of standard macroeconomics to inform economic policy in the current situation shows that arguments of evolutionary political economists from Malthus via Schumpeter to contemporary scholars can and should substitute these inadequate models. The second part of the paper takes the argument for evolutionary political economy to a methodological level: The deep crisis of economic theory is necessarily also a crisis of the methodological apparatus used. Though evolutionary economics does not provide a well-defined alternative set of methods yet, it nevertheless seems to be the best foundation to build such a new combination, a methodological innovation, out of some of the most recent advances in formalization.

We also estimate fiscal policy rules and analyze the importance of nonlinearity using a smooth transition (STR) model. Drawing on quarterly data, we find that government spending shocks have strong Keynesian effects for this group of countries while, in the case of government revenue shocks, a tax hike is harmful for output. This suggests that there is no evidence in favor of expansionary fiscal contraction in the context of emerging economies where spending policies are largely pro-cyclical. Our findings also show that considerations about growth (in the case of China), exchange rate and inflation (for Brazil and Russia) and commodity prices (in India) drive the nonlinear response of fiscal policy to the dynamics of the economy.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry Val dEssone, F-91025 Evry, France; [Jawadi, Fredj] France Business Sch, F-91025 Evry, France; [Mallick, Sushanta K.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London E1 4NS, England; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] FMG, London Sch Econ, London WC2 2AE, England; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Dept Econ & Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universite Paris Saclay; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universidade do Minho,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry Val dEssone, Campus Amiens,2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91025 Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,"Sousa, Ricardo/N-9015-2019; Sousa, Ricardo/F-8013-2010","Sousa, Ricardo/0000-0002-8279-5753; JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391; Mallick, Sushanta/0000-0003-3851-3680",,,,,37,15,16,2,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Countries' infant mortality rates are used to measure poverty. The results of the empirical analysis provide cross-country evidence to demonstrate that structural inequalities in the international system have a significant impact on poverty around the world.

The difference-in-differences methodology that is typically used to evaluate tax credit policies compares single mothers with single women without children. However, the characteristics of these groups are very different, and changes over time in relative covariates are likely to violate key identifying assumptions. We find that when we control for differential trends between women with and without children, the employment effect of the policy falls significantly. Moreover, closer inspection shows that while there was an effect on increasing the likelihood to work full-time (30 h or more), there was no effect on reducing the likelihood to be inactive. Looking closely at important covariates before and after the policy introduction, we can see sizeable changes in the relative returns to employment between the treatment and control groups, making it difficult to assess the policy effectiveness.","[Azmat, Ghazala] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England; [Azmat, Ghazala] Ctr Econ Performance LSE, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Azmat, G (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, London, England.",g.azmat@qmul.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,19,5,5,0,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The system boundaries include a nursery, 150 farms and the biggest cannery of the country. The working conditions are clearly in favour of the cannery and the nursery. At farm level, the hard and precarious work, the absence of social protection and the impossibility to constitute or join a trade union, as well as child labour, determine low social performance.

While over three-quarters of the difference in delinquency rates between bank and broker channels can be attributed to observable loan and borrower characteristics, the delinquency difference between full-and low-documentation mortgages is due to unobservable heterogeneity, about half of it potentially due to income falsification.","[Jiang, Wei] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Nelson, Ashlyn Aiko] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Vytlacil, Edward] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Columbia University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; New York University,"Jiang, W (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,"Jiang, Wei/KCX-8643-2024","Jiang, Wei/0000-0003-3256-4938",,,,,17,109,129,0,13,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This study is the first to investigate the interplay between health status of older households, moves of their children and a household's decision to make housing tenure transitions. In doing so, we rely on longitudinal household data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with residential location information at the census tract level. The results demonstrate that after controlling for the financial and demographic characteristics of children, living near children reduces the likelihood of making a housing tenure transition for older households, but that the impact of distance is not monotonic with respect to the degree of geographic distances. The results also demonstrate that if a child enters or moves closer to her or his parents' home, it increases the probability that older households exit homeownership. Finally, we find no evidence that children's moves mitigate the likelihood that their older parents whose health deteriorates become renters.","[Lee, Kwan Ok] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Painter, Gary] Univ So Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Lusk Ctr Real Estate, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",National University of Singapore; University of Southern California,"Lee, KO (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",rstleeko@nus.edu.sg; gpainter@price.usc.edu,"Lee, Kwan Ok/E-2731-2012","Lee, Kwan Ok/0000-0003-2545-2591",,,,,47,9,15,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2014,42.0,1,,,,,109,152,,10.1111/reec.12018,0.0,,,44,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,AB1NC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331557900004,0

Using five-year panel data over the period 1970-2005 with a sample of 80 DC, and after correcting for endogeneity, I find that conditioned on the initial level of constraints on the executive, the effect of FDI inflows on the probability of reforming property rights is positive and significant. The minimum level of constraints on the executive necessary for the catalytic role of FDI inflows in reforming property rights institutions is 3.6. Only 20 out of the 80 DC in the sample have this minimum level of constraints on the executive.

An important yet currently underrepresented theme of IVDR-based studies is the relationship between the risk of accident involvement and exposure variables that differentiate various driving conditions. Using an extensive commercial data set, we develop a methodology for the extraction of exposure metrics from location trajectories and estimate a range of multivariate logistic regression models in a case-control study design. We achieve high model fit (Nagelkerke's R-2 0.646, Hosmer-Lemeshow significance 0.848) and gain insights into the non-linear relationship between mileage and accident risk. We validate our results with official accident statistics and outline further research opportunities.

This article argues that the critical realist ontology has surface appeal for local and specific case study research but is fundamentally at variance with the nature of the capitalist system. Unlike the immediate appearances of a local and specific site such as the workplace, the main features of the capitalist system (commodities, money, capital, profits, wages, etc.) are analytically inseparable - they can only be defined and comprehended together as a unified whole. Consequently, the critical realist ontology of separable structures in interaction hinders comprehension of the capitalist system. In fact, critical realism corrupts an approach termed systematic abstraction' which can aid system-wide theory. Despite claims to the contrary, critical realism thereby obscures the system-wide significance of local and specific cases, blocking progress in social research.","Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Brown, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",andrew@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,19,9,14,0,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The study also assesses the respondents' self-reported response uncertainty. One scenario queries respondents about a hypothetical situation in which they would pay an entrance fee where 80% of the funds are used on-site, and the degree of certainty with which they answered the question. Like prior articles from this 6-year project (2006-2012), results indicate a high WTP for recreation on Colorado Fourteeners. Results reveal that 62% of respondents are willing to incur an additional fee of $20 or less to recreate at the study site. Regardless of whether or not the respondent is willing to pay an additional fee for recreation, approximately 90% of respondents report a high level of certainty in their stated answers to both the WTP and the fee questions, which could be connected to the recreators' sense of place on Fourteeners. Therefore, recreators exhibit clear preferences and low uncertainty in their WTP for general cost increases and localized access fees. Implications could have a complex effect on when, if, and how fees should be applied in New West economies reliant on revenues from recreation.","[Keske, Catherine M.

We pay particular attention to dynamics by including both the lagged migrant flow and the migrant stock to capture partial adjustment and network effects. To correct for the dynamic panel data bias of the fixed effects estimator we use a bootstrap algorithm. Our results indicate that immigrants are primarily attracted by better income opportunities and higher growth rates abroad. Also short-run increases in the host country's employment rate positively affect migration from both advanced and developing countries. High public services, on the other hand, discourage migration from advanced countries but exert a pull on migration from developing sources, in line with the welfare state hypothesis. Finally, we find evidence for both partial adjustment and the presence of strong network effects. This confirms that both should be considered as crucial elements of the migration model and that a correction for their joint inclusion is required.","[Ruyssen, Ilse; Everaert, Gerdie; Rayp, Glenn] Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Ruyssen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Ilse.Ruyssen@Ugent.be,"Rayp, Glenn/AAF-8330-2020","Ruyssen, Ilse/0000-0002-8259-4492",,,,,39,23,24,1,22,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Based on estimation of the gravity equation, dealing with the zero trade flows and endogeneity bias problems, we analyse the impacts of various types of RTAs involving 67 countries for 20 products during the 1980-2006 period. We find that RTAs among developing countries tend to cause trade diversion compared with RTAs among developed countries. Taking the higher external tariff rates of developing countries compared with developed countries into consideration, our results suggest trade diversion is likely to be caused by remaining high tariffs on imports from non-members. In addition, we find the trade creation effect for many products in the cases of Customs Unions and plurilateral RTAs. These results imply that trade creation would be caused by various factors besides the reduction in tariff rates. Based on these results, we draw a policy implication that external tariff rate reduction is an important factor in avoiding trade diversion in the formation of RTAs, in particular for RTAs among developing countries, while a large number of members and the common external tariff appear to be important for generating the trade creation effect.","[Urata, Shujiro] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Okabe, Misa] Wakayama Univ, Fac Econ, Wakayama, Japan",Waseda University; Wakayama University,"Urata, S (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Okabe, Misa/D-1939-2018","Urata, Shujiro/0000-0001-6565-1195",,,,,24,22,26,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2014,37.0,2,,,,,267,289,,10.1111/twec.12099,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AA0OC,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330793500005,0

Based on recent development in such East Asian economies as South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, I examine how, since the 1990s, the embedded relation between one variant of state institutions, known as the developmental state, and national firms, well integrated into global chains and networks spanning different territories and regions, has evolved. Because of the deepening strategic coupling of these national firms with lead firms in global industries, the developmental state's attempt to govern the market and to steer industrial transformation through direct policy interventions has become increasingly difficult and problematic. Through this process of strategic coupling, national firms have been gradually disembedded from state apparatuses and re-embedded in different global production networks that are governed by competitive inter-firm dynamics. While the state in these East Asian economies has actively repositioned its role in this changing governance, it can no longer be conceived as the dominant actor in steering domestic firms and industrial transformation. The developmental trajectory of these national economies becomes equally, if not more, dependent on the successful articulation of their domestic firms in global production networks spearheaded by lead firms. In short, inter-firm dynamics in global production networks tend to trump state-led initiatives as one of the most critical conditions for economic development.

This paper investigates responses to recharging plug-in battery electric vehicles from the perspective of electric vehicle (EV) drivers. Drivers in the UK Ultra Low Carbon Vehicle trial (n = 135,29% female, M = 47 years) completed questionnaires and were interviewed to assess their attitudes and experiences before they obtained their EV and after driving the EV for 3 months. The results demonstrated that drivers were positive about recharging - preferring it to 'refuelling' - and they became more relaxed over time about the frequency of recharging. Drivers managed without using a public charging infrastructure although such an infrastructure may be desirable to promote EV use. Finally, there was an interesting difference in drivers' awareness of the environmental impact of driving and recharging an EV before and after the trial in relation to CO2 emissions and the energy cycle. The results are discussed in relation to the implications for developing the future EV market. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies show a strong positive link between the existence of clusters and productivity, efficiency, innovative capacity, and overall competitiveness of the companies that leads to competitive regions. Considering the benefits of regional clusters, support for cluster initiatives through special programmes and other tools supporting cluster formation, is available in Latvia from 2009. The initial stage of regional cluster development is concentration of the economic activity in certain regions; thereby, the author of this article looks at economic activities at regional level and finds those industries that have potential forming regional clusters. Economic activity, both in general and specific industries, has a tendency to concentrate in certain geographic areas. Findings show that all industries are concentrated in Latvia, with an average Gini coefficient being equal to 0.54. Location Gini calculation allows the author to group industries into local, resource dependent, and traded cluster industries. The main focus of the article is put on traded cluster industries that locate in certain regions owing to regional attractiveness and competitiveness, thus, forming regional business clusters. Seven cluster categories with 47 traded cluster industries are identified of which 49% are manufacturing and 51% are service industries. Twenty-none per cent of all enterprises are engaged in these industries in Latvia but they employ 40% of working population; 40% of net turnover of enterprises is concentrated and 40% of nonfinancial investment are attracted there. Available cluster support is also concentrated in these industries.","[Garanti, Zanete] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,zhanette@gmail.com,"Garanti, Zanete/AAD-7201-2021; Garanti, Zanete/D-7696-2018","Garanti, Zanete/0000-0001-9990-8788;",,,,,37,1,1,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9934-8466-3-2,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,36,,,,,139,146,,,,,,8,Economics; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography; Public Administration,BB8OR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347134600015,0

Short of a convincing explanation, the German currency float seems to be a prime example of states surrendering to financial markets. The article offers an alternative interpretation that focuses on the nexus between state agency and capital accumulation. German authorities were indeed confronted with a destabilising influx of dollars that undermined their available policy options. But as they realised that these inflationary flows emanated from the same export-oriented forces in whose interest they had sought to hold on to an undervalued currency, they chose floating in order to regain command over liquidity and create an anti-inflationary programme that was at the heart of Germany's subsequent ability to better manage the 1970s crisis than its partners. Attention to the particular circumstances and consequences of these `structured choices', I conclude, may offer a more compelling account of financial globalisation as a state- led project than those which generalise from the US context.","Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Germann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",j.germann@sussex.ac.uk,"Germann, Julian/ISB-0649-2023",,,,,,84,6,6,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In recent literature much attention has been given to the ES (expected shortfall) measure, which fulfils the set of coherency axioms and offers an important extension to the VaR model. As the relevant distribution is unknown, statistical evaluation of the ES model cannot use the natural measure of discrepancy between estimated and empirical ES. Instead hypothesis testing uses the regression approach, the saddlepoint technique or the goodness of fit of the truncated return density. The study presents parametric methods of statistical inference connected with ES measure and, through the simulation study, gives the comparison of the size and power of the considered tests. In order to reflect the stylized facts about real financial processes, simulation experiments are based on the GARCH processes. The power evaluation includes both homoscedastic and heteroskedastic models with incorrect variance parameters.","[Malecka, Marta] Univ Lodz, Dept Stat Methods, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Malecka, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Stat Methods, 41-43 Rewolucji 1905 R, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland.",marta.malecka@uni.lodz.pl,"Małecka, Marta/IQS-4345-2023","Malecka, Marta/0000-0003-4465-9811",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-43-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,115,124,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367244900012,0

This paper deals with a study of theoretical and methodological aspects pertaining to formation of clusters in the industrial sector of the region. The methodological approach as devised by the authors of the present paper is based upon determination of localization coefficients, per capita production in the relevant sector, region's specialization in manufacturing of products falling within the scope of a specific industrial sector, and integral index of clusterization potential. As a result of the calculations, several industrial sectors were identified that displayed the highest degree of clusterization reasonability, in particular, chemical, petrochemical and fuel industries. Formation and development of a petrochemical cluster, in opinion of the authors, eventually will result in scoring a number of advantages for the regional economics, including new job formation, manufacturing new product lines, development of region infrastructure, upgrading the research and technology along with increasing the degree of their implementation efficiency etc.","[Melnik, Alexander; Dyrdonova, Alena] Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia",Kazan Federal University,"Melnik, A (通讯作者)，Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia.",,"Dyrdonova, Alena/C-9023-2017; Melnik, Alexander/P-5549-2015","Dyrdonova, Alena/0000-0001-7144-7473;",,,,,14,4,4,0,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,215,222,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800028,0

This assessment examined not only the potential economic impact, but also possible social and environmental impacts. It looked at what might happen as a result of varying degrees of trade liberalisation between the EU and US. In any case, the overall outcome for the EU was positive; but what was clear was that the more liberalisation there was, the better the overall result.

The knowledge spillover is related to the possible output growth gains from the total factor productivity increase in other countries. Analysis of growth accounting was based on the production function of neoclassical growth model. The augmented production function accounted for the labour, physical and human capital, and also captured the other country's total factor productivity growth variable. An empirical investigation was based on the annual data of national accounts of the eighteen European Union countries for the period from 2005 to 2012. The extent, to which variations of productivity can be explained by the production factors of physical and human capital, and the inter-country productivity spillovers, is estimated from the regression analysis. The results reveal, that augmented neo-classical growth model explains considerable part of productivity growth. The regression coefficients of capital labour ratio and human capital inputs are highly significant. The estimated regression coefficient for the variable of total factor productivity growth in Germany was found significant but low in value. The estimate supports the idea, that economic growth of European Union countries can be attributed to the international knowledge spillover, associated to the productivity increase in German economy.","Vilnius State Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Zemguliene, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,677,684,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800084,0

The stated choice method is a well-established method to estimate travel choice models empirically. However, including all relevant elements in a single experiment will not only result in choice tasks that are too complex for respondents but will also lead to choice-sets that include options that are not feasible for a given trip distance. To overcome this problem, this paper develops an approach that involves the use of a series of SP experiments to estimate a single comprehensive multimodal travel choice model. In total, four experiments are designed focusing on particular multimodal (including Park-and-Ride options) and public-transport choices for trips of varying distance. A representative national sample (N = 2746) of individuals from the Netherlands participated in the experiments through an online questionnaire. The data pooled across experiments are used to estimate the model in a scaled error-component-mixed multinomial logit framework. In this way, valuations of time, costs and service-quality attributes could be estimated on a relatively high level of detail concerning modes and trip stages. Comparisons with previous research indicate that the parameter estimates have reasonable values. The estimation results offer rich information on how travelers tradeoff between travel-time, travel-costs and service-quality attributes in travel choice in multimodal networks.

Compared to the Fourier transform, the advantage of the wavelet approach to analyze the behavior of nonstationary time series is that it can localize a process simultaneously in time and scale. We thus develop a Wavelet Exact Local Whittle estimator and a Wavelet Feasible Exact Local Whittle estimator, which extend the estimators of Phillips and Shimotsu (Ann Stat 32(2):656-692, 2004), Shimotsu and Phillips (Ann Stat 33(4):1890-1933, 2005; J Econom 130:209-233, 2006) and Shimotsu (Econom Theory 26(2):501-540, 2010) into the wavelet domain.

This paper shows that import competition can explain a significant portion of the variation in various skill measures across manufacturing industries. Industries that face more intense import competition employ more nonroutine skill sets, including cognitive, interpersonal, and manual skills, and fewer cognitive routine skills. In addition, we find that the impact of import competition on skills is not driven by imports from low-wage countries or from China. A number of robustness checks also suggest that our results are unlikely to be driven by econometric problems.","[Lu, Yi] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Ng, Travis] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Lu, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",,"Lu, Yi/A-4448-2010","Lu, Yi/0000-0002-3544-7131",,,,,41,27,29,0,31,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We demonstrate a method of process manipulation, through which the principal employs psychological tactics for incentivizing agents to announce information in keeping with his/her wishes. We indicate that with a version of incentive compatibility, the principal can implement any alternative that he/she wishes as the unique Nash equilibrium without employing any contractual device.

A higher income and a higher level of education increase the probability of a vacation abroad. In addition, expenditures increase with income, but when two vacations are undertaken the vacation abroad benefits most from this increase.

The article contributes to the discussion on Europeanization and the role of the EU in contested states, which remains a neglected topic in the literature. The argument advanced is that a series of factors that relate to the contested statehood of the Turkish-Cypriot case mediate the occurrence of Europeanization and they often contribute to an exceptional EU impact on domestic civil society. In this regard, the Turkish-Cypriot example has strong comparative value for the study of the international role of the EU, the Europeanization of contested states and the importance that the EU places on contacts with civil society, as an alternative avenue to relations with states.","[Kyris, George] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kyris, G (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Hellen Observ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",G.Kyris@lse.ac.uk,"Kyris, George/ABD-6142-2021","Kyris, George/0000-0003-4396-8532",,,,,52,10,11,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The empirical analyses control for the endogeneity of property prices, mortgage flows, mortgage interest rates, and loan to value ratios, and provide two main findings. First, exogenous increases in mortgage supply, measured with the growth of the CMBS market, significantly reduce property cap rates. Second, volatility of past price changes and the biggest loss in property values in the past significantly affect mortgage supply.

As in the classic cheap talk setup, the informed player sends a message to an uninformed receiver who is to take an action which affects the payoffs of both players. However, in our model, the sender can communicate only through the use of discrete messages which are ordered by the cost incurred by the sender. We characterize the resulting equilibria without refining out-of-equilibrium beliefs. Subsequently, we apply an adapted version of the no incentive to separate (NITS) condition to our model. We show that if the sender and receiver have aligned preferences regarding the action of the receiver, then NITS only admits the equilibrium with the largest possible number of induced actions. When the preferences between players are not aligned, we show that NITS does not guarantee uniqueness, and we provide an example where an increase in communication costs can improve communication. As we show, this improvement can occur to such an extent that the equilibrium outperforms the Goltsman et al.

We first show the existence of a majority voting equilibrium, where the median voter is decisive and most prefers a government's type that is biased in favor of the minority. We propose a measure of the secession risk at equilibrium, which depends upon the comparison of the willingness to secede by the minority and to accommodate by the majority. We show that focusing only on the willingness to secede, as previous literature has done, is misleading when studying the impact on the risk of secession of the size of the minority region, the probability that a secession attempt by the minority is successful, and the cultural heterogeneity in the country.","[Anesi, Vincent] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [De Donder, Philippe] Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [De Donder, Philippe] Univ Munich, CES, Munich, Germany",University of Nottingham; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Munich,"De Donder, P (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",vincent.anesi@nottingham.ac.uk; philippe.dedonder@tse-fr.eu,,"Anesi, Vincent/0000-0003-4424-2581",,,,,21,3,4,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2013,41.0,2,,,,,241,261,,10.1007/s00355-012-0682-2,0.0,,,21,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,155TE,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319770300002,0

Positing that fundamental conservatism seeks to displace interpretations of Western modernity in Russia with a culturally specific Russian version, she then probes more deeply into the methods and tasks of fundamental conservatism, before examining its main theoretical arguments. The fact that such thinking is increasingly prominent in Russia, including within political circles, is noted as a basis for the need to better understand it as a search for new forms of rationality and new forms of citizenship rooted in the Russian sociohistoric context.","Lincoln Univ, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE USA",,"Chebankova, E (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE USA.",echebankova@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,,92,11,11,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

However, current qualitative studies analyze only EU members and cannot dismiss the hypothesis that the relation between policy success and policy convergence is universal and not affected by EU membership. The article analyzes a dyadic data set on privatization policies in the electricity sector to test the interaction hypothesis that joint EU membership not only causes policy convergence, but also increases the effect of policy success on policy convergence. The result is that economic success of privatizations in role-model countries and joint EU membership both increase the probability of policy convergence. However, there is no interaction between policy success and joint EU membership. Thus, contrary to widely held assumptions, joint EU membership does not amplify learning from each other's policy success.","Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Fink, S (通讯作者)，Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",simon.fink@uni-bamberg.de,"Fink, Simon/D-5598-2016","Fink, Simon/0000-0002-3730-5137",,,,,56,8,9,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

These men represent a much wealthier segment of contemporary society than found in most stature samples previously analyzed. The height trend among the wealthy is much more robust in comparison to the average population that experienced a decline in stature. The resulting increase in the 'height gap' by roughly 1 in. between cohorts born around 1820 and 1860 is in congruence with evidence on rising wealth inequality and the notion of dietary change in antebellum America.

Why, in the face of the common challenge of dependence on imported Russian gas, have national reactions to such vulnerability varied so dramatically across the continent? And why have a handful of French, German, and Italian corporations somehow taken responsibility for formulating the energy strategy and thus the Russia policy for essentially all of Europe? The resolutions of these two puzzles are, I show, interlinked; they also demand theoretical innovation. With several case studies of Gazprom's decision-making during the 2006 and 2009 gas crises, and of the response of western and central Europe to their gas dependence I find that: firms are driving these political outcomes; those firms are motivated by profits but employ sociological conventions along their ways; and firms generally seek the necessary inter-firm, cross-border cooperation that will deliver corporate performance. Finally, I conclude that the field will ultimately require a framework that puts firms at its center.","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Abdelal, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",,,,,,,,129,47,49,2,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Moreover, we control for contextual effects, such as variables related to neighbourhood and family background. We find that both the drinking intensity by other household members and a richer social life outside home are positively related to alcohol consumption.

This article seeks to stimulate debate by presenting a framework for a left-radical organic public sociology of work based on Gramsci's concept of the connected organic intellectual rather than Bourdieu's expert committed scholar. The latter, it is argued, is ultimately incompatible with activist partisan scholarship based on democratized relations between researchers and researched. Participatory action research is offered as a methodological orientation that underpins and enables organic scholars of work to engage actively with the marginalized and labour in the co-creation of knowledge that aids their struggles for change.","[Brook, Paul] Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Darlington, Ralph] Univ Salford, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England",University of Leicester; University of Salford,"Brook, P (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Ken Edwards Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",pb222@le.ac.uk,,"Brook, Paul/0000-0002-3007-8728",,,,,42,33,34,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We also demonstrate that the Gini coefficient can be expressed as a simple formula of the parameters of the Pareto-L,vy distribution. We subsequently use income data for Norway and seven other OECD countries to fit the Pareto-L,vy distribution as well as the Generalized Beta type II (GB2) distribution.

These, together with local factors that particularly affect the objective conditions for the valorisation of capital in different productive sectors, explain the specific characteristics of capitalism in both countries. The article claims that capital has accumulated in Brazil and Korea under two different specific forms. In Brazil, capital has accumulated while producing on an internationally small-scale for domestic markets and compensating the resultant high production costs through the appropriation of a portion of the abundant ground-rent. While before the mid-1960s capital accumulated in Korea under that same specific form (though ground-rent was complemented with a portion of small agrarian capital profits and foreign aid), it afterwards began to do so through the production of specific industrial goods for world markets using the relatively cheap and disciplined labour-force available in the country. World-scale technological changes associated with computerisation and electronics-based automation have changed Korea's competitive advantages' as they resulted in sharp advances in the codification of technical knowledge and, thus, in the reduction of the tacit know-how and skills necessary to perform several labour processes. Though resulting in strong growth, these processes have created new contradictions and challenges for Korea which it may be incapable of overcoming.","Univ London, SOAS, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Grinberg, N (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",ng16@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,62,19,20,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Reconsideration based on 2004-2010 data from a similar contest yields findings of a dramatically smaller increase in expected profitability from strategic line making.

Evidence from US state banking markets,EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bank regulation; Banking market concentration; Economic growth; Financial development,FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; DEPOSIT INSURANCE; BRANCH BANKING; COMPETITION; DEPENDENCE; FAILURES,"This paper examines the impacts of banking market structure and regulation on economic growth using new data on banking market concentration and manufacturing industry-level growth rates for U.S. states during 1899-1929-a period when the manufacturing sector was expanding rapidly and restrictive branching laws segmented the U.S. banking system geographically. Unlike studies of developing and developed countries today, we find that banking market concentration generally had a positive impact on manufacturing sector growth in the early twentieth century United States, with a somewhat stronger impact on industries with smaller establishments, lower rates of incorporation, and less reliance on bond markets (and, hence, relatively more reliance on banks). Because regulations affecting bank entry varied considerably across states and the industrial organization of the U.S. banking system differs markedly from those of other countries, we consider the impact of other aspects of banking market structure and policy on growth. Even after controlling for differences in the prevalence of branch banking, deposit insurance, and other aspects of policy and market structure, we find that market concentration boosted industrial growth.

However many such policies have not only often failed to achieve their objective, they also risk jeopardising the retail sector. To help understand why, this study measures the importance shoppers assign to car convenience, their perceptions of shopping malls and shopping strips (also referred to as Main Street or the High Street) in relation to it, and then compares them in their actual provision of it. To achieve these objectives, the study utilised a consumer household survey and a retail audit. The results of the study indicate that consumers regard car convenience as an important determinant of where they choose to shop, and perceive malls as a superior source of it. Moreover, with the sole exception of being able to park close to desired stores, malls offer car-borne shoppers more convenient access and parking. The findings suggest that any strategy designed to deter car usage should be designed to impact equally on both mall shopping and strip shopping, or risk tipping the balance even further in favour of the mall.

This program, called 'Conventions de conversion', was intended to improve re-employment prospects of displaced workers by proposing them retraining and job seeking assistance for a period of 6 months beginning just after the dismissal. Our empirical analysis is based upon non-experimental data collected by the French Ministry of Labour. Matching estimates show that this program succeeded in increasing the employment rate of trainees by approximately 6 points of percentage in the medium-term, namely in the 2nd and 3rd years after the date of entry into the program. This improvement is essentially due to an increase of their re-employment rate in regular jobs, namely jobs under long-term labour contracts.","[Cavaco, Sandra] Univ Pantheon Assas, LEM, F-75270 Paris 06, France; [Cavaco, Sandra] Aahrus Sch Business, CCP, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Fougere, Denis] CNRS, F-92245 Malakoff, France; [Fougere, Denis] CEPR, London EC1V 7RR, England; [Fougere, Denis; Pouget, Julien] IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Pouget, Julien] INSEE, CREST, F-92245 Malakoff, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Fougère, D (通讯作者)，IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 7-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",fougere@ensae.fr,"Cavaco, Sandra/HGP-7568-2022","Cavaco, Sandra/0000-0001-6365-0885",,,,,46,8,8,0,21,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

However, this requires both building hydrogen refueling infrastructure and gaining the acceptance of the citizens living nearby. Knowing what motivates citizens to act in favor of or against hydrogen refueling facilities may help in the development of policies that encourage the use of hydrogen as a fuel. This paper aims to contribute to this by examining whether intention to act in favor of, or against, a local hydrogen refueling facility is more strongly based on moral considerations or on self-interest. To this end, the explanatory value of the Norm Activation Model (NAM) was compared with the explanatory value of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The analyses were carried out on data collected from a group of Dutch participants who received information about hydrogen as a fuel, hydrogen technology, and the opinion of stakeholders. The group consisted of 800 participants, of which 495 were in favor and 92 against a local hydrogen refueling facility. We found that both NAM and TPB variables significantly explained intention to act for supporters and opponents. The NAM variables explained intention to act more strongly than the TPB variables for both groups. These findings suggest that intention to act both in favor of and against hydrogen refueling facilities was more strongly based on moral considerations than on self-interest. If TPB variables were added to a model that included NAM variables, the explained variance increased for the supporters group, whereas this was not the case for the opponents group. These results indicate that for supporters of hydrogen refueling facilities, self-interest is a secondary goal after moral considerations but that this is not the case for opponents. To validate the findings, the analyses were also carried out on data from a group of participants that did not receive information. This control group consisted of 414 participants, of which 184 were in favor of and 45 against a local hydrogen facility. The same results were found for these supporters and opponents, indicating the robustness of our findings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Huijts, N. M. A.; Molin, E. J.

Contrary to conventional presentations, this paper demonstrates that essential issues in the debate with Hume need to be properly situated within the broader philosophical and theological debates of those times. Price's primary application of Bayes's theorem to Hume's argument against miracles is also shown to be distinct from the conventional Bayesian approach to the interpretation of testimony. The rational intuition' used to motivate Price's prior distribution is compared with modern intuitionism and substantive differences are identified.","Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Business Adm, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Poitras, G (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Business Adm, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",poitras@sfu.ca,"Poitras, Geoffrey/HIR-4231-2022",,,,,,77,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

SSP provided a generous 3-year earnings supplement to treatment group members who found a full-time job within a year of the start of the experiment (take-up group). We estimate the treatment on the treated for two sub-groups of the take-up group: the incentivized and non-incentivized groups. Using an econometric model of wage determination, we find evidence of large and significant relative wage progression of approximately 9 percentage points during the 3-year supplement period for the incentivized group. The impact for the non-incentivized group is much smaller (at most 3 percentage points). There is also some limited information that the non-incentivized group in New Brunswick and the incentivized groups in both New Brunswick and British Columbia continued to work more after the 3-year supplement period ended.","[Zabel, Jeffrey] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Schwartz, Saul] Carleton Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Donald, Stephen] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Tufts University; Carleton University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Zabel, J (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",jeff.zabel@tufts.edu,,"Schwartz, Saul/0000-0002-9994-3740",,,,,13,0,0,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In some cases, the officials commenting are merely affirming the market price prevailing at the time. In many cases, however, we document that they explicitly disagree with contemporaneous oil futures prices. A natural question is whether these fair price pronouncements contain information not already reflected in the market price of crude oil. To find the answer, we collect fair price statements made from 2000 through 2010 by officials from OPEC or OPEC member countries. Visually, the fair price series looks like a sampling discretely drawn (with a lag) from the daily futures market price series. Formally, we use two primary methodologies to establish that fair price pronouncements have little influence on the market price of crude oil and provide little or no new news to oil futures market participants.","[Brunetti, Celso] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Div Res & Stat, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Bueyueksahin, Bahattin] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada; [Robe, Michel A.] American Univ, Kogod Sch Business, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Soneson, Kirsten R.] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Bank of Canada; American University; Georgetown University,"Robe, MA (通讯作者)，American Univ, Kogod Sch Business, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",mrobe@american.edu,"Brunetti, Celso/AAC-9092-2020","Brunetti, Celso/0000-0001-8184-2610",,,,,48,2,2,3,34,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,34.0,4,,,,,79,108,,10.5547/01956574.34.4.5,0.0,,,30,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,218QI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324447100005,0

The cross-country growth literature typically estimates an aggregate homogeneous production function or convergence regression model that abstracts from the process of structural change. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which assumptions about aggregation and homogeneity matter for inferences regarding the nature of technology differences across countries. Using a unique World Bank dataset, we estimate production functions for agriculture and manufacturing in a panel of 40 developing and developed countries for the period from 1963 to 1992. We empirically model dimensions of heterogeneity across countries, allowing for different choices of technology within both sectors. We argue that heterogeneity is important within sectors across countries implying that an analysis of aggregate data will not produce useful measures of the nature of the technology or productivity. We show that many of the puzzling elements in aggregate cross-country empirics can be explained by inappropriate aggregation across heterogeneous sectors.","[Eberhardt, Markus] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Eberhardt, Markus] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, CSAE, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Teal, Francis] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Teal, Francis] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Nottingham; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Eberhardt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",markus.eberhardt@nottingham.ac.uk; francis.teal@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Eberhardt, Markus/IQV-0257-2023","Eberhardt, Markus/0000-0002-0945-0759",ESRC [ES/G014469/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G014469/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,89,47,51,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

In order to answer these questions the efficient methods are derived that offer a relatively accurate and satisfactory response (including its economic interpretation) even in terms of uncertainty. The discrete case, when the unit of supply is indivisible, is studied in detail and the results are then extrapolated by the limiting transition to the continuous case, when the unit of inventory is further arbitrarily divisible. In both cases the method relies on the value of the authors own established indicator of the storage efficiency and on the fragment of the probability distribution of the demand during the delivery time, which depends on it.","[Haskova, Simona; Kolar, Pavel] VSE Praha, Fak Managementu JH, Katedra Managementu, Jindrichuv Hrade 37701, Czech Republic",,,hasko-vas@post.cz; lar@fm.vse.cz,"Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019",,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,237,242,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000041,0

Using data from 1970 to 2010, this paper documents both that the three asset classes are in general not substitutes for each other, and that diversification benefits of each asset class change substantially over time. Therefore, all three asset classes ought to be included in investors' portfolios. Furthermore, we show that the observed time variation in diversification benefits can be explained by time-varying return correlations. To see the implications of these findings for asset allocation in practice, we examine the out-of-sample performance of portfolio strategies, based on a variety of correlation structures. We find that the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model (Engle, J Bus Econ Stat 20(3):339-350, 2002) outperforms other correlation structures, such as rolling-window, historical, and constant correlations. Our findings suggest that diversification benefits of the three asset classes should be examined in a dynamic setting, and that investors need to use appropriate correlation estimates to adjust for such time variation.","[Huang, Jing-zhi] Penn State Univ, Dept Finance, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zhong, Zhaodong (Ken)] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Rutgers Business Sch, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Zhong, ZD (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Rutgers Business Sch, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",jxh56@psu.edu; zdzhong@business.rutgers.edu,,"Huang, Jingzhi/0000-0002-6453-5827",,,,,36,29,33,2,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Due to the high rate of unemployment and economic inefficiency of the economy as a whole, the development of entrepreneurship in tourism has huge potential for possible economic growth. A special role is the development of small and medium enterprises as a carrier in economic development. Developing tourism businesses in eastern Croatia means supporting attractive varieties of tourism, quality of tourism services, better tourism infrastructure and employment expression. The aim is to determine the primary tourist characteristics and importance of tourism development in eastern Croatia, examine the basic characteristics of the relevant development programmes as well as the institutions that implement them, analyse instruments that support entrepreneurship and tourism, examine the advantages and disadvantages of existing support and propose concrete measures and forms of aid in the context of better exploitation of tourism potential and development of entrepreneurship in eastern Croatia. For the purposes of research, the results of surveys, scientific and vocational literature, strategic documents, development programmes and reports are analysed. Based on the analysis of development programmes, tourism and business development, synthesis and deduction conclusions are made on the promotion of entrepreneurship development in tourism. Classification and comparison with other regions and counties have made concrete conclusion about aid in eastern Croatia. Our results suggest an insufficient utilization tourism potential of eastern Croatia, and a poor tourism offer in Croatia's mainland. Eastern Croatia has great potential for development businesses primarily in rural tourism, such as the development of tourism on rural farms, hunting and fishing, ecotourism, cultural and gastronomic, culinary and wine tourism. Various development programmes of the relevant institutions, specifically ministries, and development financial institutions are being implemented. Studies indicate poor use at these programmes. The role of bank lending in tourism is emphasized and survey research highlights that compared with other Croatian regions, eastern Croatia has the lowest utilisation of subsidised credit programmes. Commercial banks emphasize that stronger state support would greatly stimulate financing of entrepreneurship in tourism.","[Kovacevic, Branko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Kovacevic, Marina] Stonska 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Kovacevic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",bkovacevic@efzg.hr; kovacevic.marina4@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,11,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,92,100,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400010,0

Using price data for wheat in America and Britain, our findings support both that price differentials were quite small for many years, and that prices adjusted to the law-of-one-price equilibrium. This process was, however, continuously being interrupted by 'exogenous' events, such as trade policy, war and politics.

The weights reflect the reputation of the publishers from the respective category. The following evaluation process then combines expert assessment (peer review) with the less subjective criterion of publishers reputation. In the first stage of the two-stage evaluation process, each book is evaluated by a fuzzy number which corresponds with the reputation of the publisher and is interpreted as an interval of possible evaluations - scores (the support) with a most typical score (default evaluation - the only element in the kernel of the fuzzy number).

Unlike most existing empirical studies, I employ panel data that contain information on the specific purposes for which aid is given. This approach enables me to link aid that is provided for education and health purposes to recipient public spending in these sectors. In addition, I distinguish between aid flows that are recorded on a recipients budget and those that are not recorded, and I illustrate how the previous failure to differentiate between on- and off-budget aid produces biased estimates of fungibility. Sector program aid is the measure of on-budget aid, whereas technical cooperation serves as a proxy for off-budget aid. I show that the appropriate treatment of off-budget aid leads to lower fungibility estimates than those reported in many previous studies. Specifically, I find that in both sectors and across a range of specifications, technical cooperation, which is the largest component of total education and health aid, leads to, at most, a small displacement of recipient public expenditures.","[Van de Sijpe, Nicolas] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Van de Sijpe, Nicolas] Univ Oxford, CSAE, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Van de Sijpe, N (通讯作者)，Queen Elizabeth House, 3 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TB, England.",nicolas.vandesijpe@qeh.ox.ac.uk,"Van de Sijpe, Nicolas/G-6451-2010","Van de Sijpe, Nicolas/0000-0003-0442-7020",,,,,74,41,43,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

It is an important means for a country or a region to realize the sustainable and high-quality development of economy. In recent years, entrepreneurship in China has become the most active one. However, there are still serious defects like low survival rate of new ventures and low level of innovation among start-ups. The quality and quantity of technology entrepreneurship urgent need to be improved. As we all known, entrepreneurship cannot work without the support of capital market, and technology entrepreneurship is more, particularly in the early stages of technology entrepreneurship process. Applied the method of normative research and literature research, this paper drew a conclusion, by analyzing the nature and process of technology entrepreneurship as well as researching the attributes of Angle Investment, that Angle Investment should be the major financing channel for early stage of technology entrepreneurship because of the good match between Angle Investment's inherent financing attributes and the serious need of financing in the early stage of entrepreneurship. However, there are many serious problems such as overall small scale, unreasonable structure and others in China's present angel investment system. So, as an angel of Technology Entrepreneurship, it is insufficient to support the technology venture financing needs.

The paper first analyzes the formation elements and then explores the ways to build core competence of the speciality of international trade at VIHL. Economic globalization results in much closer economic ties and more frequent trade contacts between China and other countries, which leads to higher requirements of import & export-oriented enterprises in China for talents involved in international trade activities. The speciality of international trade at Vocational Institutes of Higher Learning (VIHL), supplying a large number of high-skilled talents to the frontline posts of import & export-oriented enterprises, is in urgent need of thinking over how to improve with the times and cultivate high quality skilled foreign trade talents. Under the background of economic globalization, the most effective and also the most critical point is to enhance core competencies if the speciality of international trade at VIHL wants to remain invincible in the competition of talent cultivation.

Our findings suggest that credible monetary policy contributes to anchoring of expectations about inflation and interest rates. Disagreement for both groups of indicators increases with uncertainty about the actual series.","[Dovern, Jonas] Kiel Econ Res & Forecasting, Kiel, Germany; [Fritsche, Ulrich] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Slacalek, Jiri] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Hamburg; European Central Bank,"Dovern, J (通讯作者)，Kiel Econ Res & Forecasting, Kiel, Germany.",,,,,,,,50,183,193,1,25,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The large price discrepancies for some patented drugs arise from market pricing in the U.S. and a system of administered pricing in Canada. The model assumes that there are two classes of U.S. consumers: one group who cannot reimport drugs at any cost, and a second group with a distribution of reimportation costs. Under the assumption that the group who can reimport drugs has lower willingness to pay, reimportation serves as a mechanism for price discrimination in the U.S. market. The results include the following: 1) a decline in the Canadian price may raise the U.S. price; 2) a shift down in the distribution of reimportation costs may similarly raise the U.S. price; 3) a shift down in the distribution of reimportation costs may raise drug manufacturer profits.

It is based on a combination of several selected economic, social, environmental, and transport-related factors. The modeling approach is implemented in a GIS-based multi-criteria decision support process with fuzzy measures, enabling an assessment at different spatial and temporal scales under different EDV market penetration scenarios for Europe. The decision support system embeds a multi-criteria analysis based on selected expert-weighted market penetration drivers. The spatial scale chosen for the application of the decision support process are NUTS2 regions and cities within EU27 member states. Three scenarios are investigated, a business as usual, a moderate change, and an accelerated innovation scenario. Across the scenario horizon, it is shown how lead regions for EDVs will be changing in time between first early-adopter areas towards other long-term potential lead regions, depending on the evolution of the market drivers. The European regions and cities which will have a higher lead market potential score in 2020 and 2030 are identified. Our model solution suggests that with the business-as-usual scenario there will be a few insular lead market areas in 2020 and a relatively limited number of more connected lead regions in 2030. The other two scenarios explored suggest a more positive picture leading for the case of the 2030 accelerated scenario to a wide distribution of EDVs across most of Germany, the Netherlands. France, the UK. Ireland, and Italy. The cities of London, Madrid, Berlin and Rome would show high EDV sales under this scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Quite a few countries went through a vigorous struggle. But it is in Canada in 1898 that the very first national referendum on prohibition in the world took place. In this article, we focus on this rare and neglected event in Canadian history, in which the government came close but finally did not impose prohibition. In our empirical analysis, we use census district-level data to investigate how the shares of Yes, No and Abstentions vary according to four sets of factors: religious, demographic, social and economic. Our results confirm the literature on temperance and prohibition with religion [Evangelicals against Catholics and Anglicans] as the key explanatory variable, followed by the heterogeneity of the population, measured by the proportion of foreign-born. Urbanization has also the expected (although small) impact. Results for wealth are mixed. The economic interest rationale is not confirmed but that can be explained by the historical context.

The project created a large symmetric international database of regulations and standards, constructed measures of their heterogeneity and evaluated the effects of heterogeneity on trade. Cases studies for selected dairy, meat, and fruit and vegetable products complement the aggregate analysis. The findings suggest that at least for some import standards, the harmonisation of regulations will increase trade. Additional findings address the potential protectionist leaning of some NTMs, their welfare impact, third-country consequences of their imposition, interface of NTMs with tariffs and other border measures, negotiation strategies, NorthSouth dimensions of NTM impacts and the value added from the application of diverse and novel models to the assessment of their effects.","[Orden, David] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Arlington, VA USA; [Orden, David] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Beghin, John] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA; [Henry, Guy] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agronom Dev, Montpellier, France; [Henry, Guy] Ctr Int Agr Trop, Cali, Colombia",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Iowa State University; CIRAD; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Orden, D (通讯作者)，Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Arlington, VA USA.",,"Beghin, John/G-7803-2018; Beghin, John/AAN-2854-2020","Beghin, John/0000-0002-8403-3277; Beghin, John/0000-0002-8403-3277",,,,,0,6,7,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2012,35.0,8,,,SI,,967,972,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01456.x,0.0,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,986IZ,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307336600001,0

The authors hypothesize that this variable was an important factor in regime transition in Russia's regions. The findings have wider implications for area studies and theoretical studies of democratization and regime transition.","[Obydenkova, Anastassia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Minist Innovat & Sci Spain, Barcelona, Spain; [Obydenkova, Anastassia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Barcelona, Spain; [Libman, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Moscow 117901, Russia; [Libman, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Moscow 117901, Russia","Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences","Obydenkova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Minist Innovat & Sci Spain, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Obydenkova, Anastassia/AAD-5418-2019; Obydenkova, Anastassia/M-6916-2015","Obydenkova, Anastassia/0000-0001-5099-5294; Obydenkova, Anastassia/0000-0001-5099-5294; Libman, Alexander/0000-0001-8504-3007",,,,,150,38,42,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Treatment of initial period observations is analyzed when the number of time periods is small. A second issue relates to a restriction implied by the filter specification on the space-time cross-product term that can greatly simplify interpretation of model estimates as well as the estimation procedure. An applied illustration of the method is provided using a Solow growth model. The application shows that the theoretical restriction implied for the cross-product term in our space-time filter specification is consistent with this particular dynamic space-time panel data set.

Recent research suggests tariffs may be welfare enhancing if they are directed at industries with positive externalities; something more likely when institutions are strong. Using disaggregated tariff data for the years 1872, 1880, and 1890, we analyse the relationship between industry characteristics and tariffs, finding little evidence that Victorian industries with positive externalities received tariff protection. Our results throw doubt on good institutions necessarily producing good tariff outcomes and suggest the relationship between tariffs and growth is more complex than current studies assume.","[Wilson, John K.; Shanahan, Martin P.] Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of South Australia,"Wilson, JK (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",,"Shanahan, Martin/N-1500-2019; Shanahan, Martin P/C-9527-2009","Shanahan, Martin/0000-0002-0405-2989; Wilson, John/0000-0002-4649-9121",,,,,27,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

In financial series, long memory is not apparent in levels but strong persistence in higher order moments such as volatility has been proven to be a stylized fact in stock returns. Interest in economic time series has, however, focused on the persistence of levels and little attention has been paid to higher order dependence, which can be important for assessing the stability of the series. We propose a semiparametric analysis of the standard and seasonal persistence of the volatility of a monthly Spanish inflation series. The conclusions can be summarized in three main results. First volatility shows strong persistence implying an unstable trend in prices, but its structure depends on the proxy used, the absolute values, the squares or the logarithms of squares. Second, the structure of the persistence of volatility changed with the first oil crisis in 1973, with a persistent trend in both periods, in contrast with levels. Third, the Taylor effect, which is well documented in financial series, does not apply in this series.","Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Econ Aplicada Econometria & Estadist 3, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Arteche, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Econ Aplicada Econometria & Estadist 3, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",josu.arteche@ehu.es,"Arteche, Josu/HZJ-0572-2023; Arteche, Josu/X-1797-2019; Arteche, Josu/B-7649-2011","Arteche, Josu/0000-0002-6700-3615",,,,,33,4,5,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

By adding a power penalty term the linear complementarity problem arising from pricing American put options is transformed into a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation. Then a finite difference scheme is proposed to solve the penalized nonlinear PDE, which combines a central difference scheme on a piecewise uniform mesh with respect to the spatial variable with an implicit time stepping technique. It is proved that the scheme is stable for arbitrary volatility and arbitrary interest rate without any extra conditions and is second-order convergent with respect to the spatial variable. Furthermore, our method can efficiently treats the singularities of the non-smooth payoff function.

But when rents rise, there may be substantial value associated with the option to redevelop to higher intensity per unit land value. In the presence of option value, we first demonstrate that hedonic linear regressions should include an additive nonnegative term for the value of the option. This term increases in the variance of the underlying stochastic process. If this term is omitted, then estimates of implicit market prices for desirable (undesirable) characteristics will be biased downward (upward). This prediction is supported by recent empirical studies.

It argues in a first step that during this period the French government 'securitized' the Roma, 'extra-ordinarily' casting them as collective threat and thereby justifying their deportation. The European Commission's outspoken response demanded that the French authorities refrain from discriminating against EU citizens on grounds of ethnicity; in so doing, the EU seemed to act as protector of minorities in accordance with its raison d'etre as liberal peace project. However, in a second step, the article draws attention to the deportations perpetrated before these high-profile events, highlighting that conditionality within the law pertaining to EU citizenship allowed for the securitization of Roma. Thus, in a third step, it is argued that the invocation of citizenship may be a useful but limited strategy of political resistance by and with excluded groups such as Europe's Roma. Rather, it is the inherently ambiguous nature of a multi-level EU liberal or cosmopolitan government - and concomitant EU citizenship - which opens an important space for resistance.","Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Parker, O (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",owenparker@hotmail.com,,,,,,,50,50,52,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We estimate a production function where life expectancy depends on health and social spending, lifestyle variables, and medical innovation. Our first set of regressions include a set of observed medical technologies by country. Our second set of regressions proxy technology using a spatial process. This article also tests whether in the long-run countries tend to achieve similar levels of health outcomes. Our results show that health spending has a significant and mild effect on health outcomes, even after controlling for medical innovation. However, its short-run adjustments do not seem to have an impact on health care productivity. Spatial spill overs in life expectancy are significant and point to the existence of interdependence across countries in technology adoption. Furthermore, nations with initial low levels of life expectancy tend to catch up with those with longer-lived populations.","[Moscone, Francesco; Tosetti, Elisa] Brunel Univ, London, England; [Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Syracus, NY USA; [Baltagi, Badi H.] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",Brunel University; Syracuse University; University of Leicester,"Moscone, F (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, London, England.",francesco.moscone@brunel.ac.uk,"tosetti, elisa/ABD-1195-2020","tosetti, elisa/0000-0003-0979-2828; Moscone, Francesco/0000-0001-5378-680X; Baltagi, Badi/0000-0003-0469-4479",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G00160X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G00160X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,23,24,1,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In analogy to these functions budget correspondences are established which relate alternatives x with certain subsets of X, according to the extended ordering.","Karlsruher Inst Technol, Inst Wirtschaftstheorie & Stat, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Fuchs-Seliger, S (通讯作者)，Karlsruher Inst Technol, Inst Wirtschaftstheorie & Stat, Kollegium Schloss Bau 4, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany.",seliger@wior.uni-karlsruhe.de,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2012,72.0,4,,,,,431,444,,10.1007/s11238-011-9278-z,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,892LK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300287500001,0

While most of the recent empirical studies on the EER employ a cross-country analysis, country-specific factors, especially supply-side real factors, are not fully taken into consideration in estimating the EER. To better reflect Chinas processing exports in the context of growing intra-regional trade in Asia, we incorporate in the empirical analysis the source-country breakdown data on import prices and input coefficients of intermediate inputs by constructing an annual new International inputoutput (IIO) table for the period from 1995 to 2009. The results show that the nominal EER of the RMB appreciates sharply from 2006 to 2009, suggesting that the current RMB exchange rate has been substantially undervalued and should be revalued by 74 per cent as of 2008 compared to the year 2004 level. Such sharp appreciation of the nominal EER corresponds to the dramatic increase in Chinas current account surplus from the mid-2000s, especially against the United States, which is ascribed to the significant improvement of Chinas intermediate input coefficients and, to a lesser extent, an increase in US import prices of intermediate inputs.","[Sato, Kiyotaka; Shrestha, Nagendra] Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Econ, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Shimizu, Junko] Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo 171, Japan; [Zhang, Zhaoyong] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Perth, WA, Australia",Yokohama National University; Gakushuin University; Edith Cowan University,"Sato, K (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Econ, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",,"Zhang, Zhaoyong/D-5100-2013; Sato, Kiyotaka/F-6489-2018","Zhang, Zhaoyong/0000-0001-9596-2648; Sato, Kiyotaka/0000-0002-1611-9191; SHIMIZU, JUNKO/0000-0002-6222-8540","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21330074, 20223003, 24530362, 09F09013] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,22,3,3,0,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2012,35.0,4,,,SI,,419,443,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01444.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,923LW,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302621800003,0

In particular, we are concerned about the comparison between committee performance under specialization and non-specialization of the decision makers. Specialization (in the context of project or public policy selection) means that the decision of each committee member is based on a narrow area, which typically results in the acquirement and use of relatively high expertise in that area. When the committee members' expertise is already determined, specialization only means that the decision of each committee member is based solely on his/her relatively high expertise area. This form of specialization is potentially inferior relative to non-specialization under which the decision of each committee member is based on different areas, not just his/her relatively high expertise area. Given that the expertise of the committee members is already determined but unknown, our analysis focuses on non-specializing individuals whose decision is based on a decision rule that does not require information on the decision-making skills. Under these realistic assumptions, non-specialization is shown to be preferable over specialization, depending on the aggregation rule applied by the committee. The significance of our approach is not limited to the specific results that we obtain. Rather, it should be viewed as a first step toward a deeper examination of the role of individual decision makers in enhancing the performance of collective decision making.","[Ben-Yashar, Ruth; Nitzan, Shmuel] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Koh, Winston T.

Recent research documenting this height-achievement slope has primarily focused on rich countries. Using the India Human Development Survey, a representative sample of 40,000 households which matches anthropometric data to learning tests, this paper documents a height-achievement slope among Indian children. The height-achievement slope in India is more than twice as steep as in the U.S. An earlier survey interviewed some IHDS children's households eleven years before. Including matched early-life control variables reduces the apparent effect of height, but does not eliminate it; water, sanitation, and hygiene may be particularly important for children's outcomes. Being one standard deviation taller is associated with being 5 percentage points more likely to be able to write, a slope that falls only to 3.4 percentage points controlling for a long list of contemporary and early-life conditions.

Multivariate Markov chain models are a feasible mathematical tool for modeling the dependence of credit ratings. Here we develop a flexible multivariate Markov chain model for modeling the dependence of credit ratings. The proposed model provides a parsimonious way to capture both the cross-sectional and temporal associations among ratings of individual entities. The number of model parameters is of the magnitude O(sm (2) + s (2) m), where m is the number of ratings categories and s is the number of entities in a credit portfolio. The proposed model is also easy to implement. The estimation method is formulated as a set of s linear programming problems and the estimation algorithm can be implemented easily in a Microsoft EXCEL worksheet, see Ching et al. Int J Math Educ Sci Eng 35:921-932 (2004). We illustrate the practical implementation of the proposed model using real ratings data. We evaluate risk measures, such as Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall, for a credit portfolio using the proposed model and compare the risk measures with those arising from Ching et al.

The tests developed by Varian are for the direct utility function, while researchers estimating demand systems often find it convenient to model consumer behavior with an indirect utility function. Unfortunately structure revealed in the direct utility function does not necessarily follow for the indirect utility function.

The results of the study revealed that although poverty incidences decrease over time, but a considerable portion of Algerian still living in misery. The study findings indicated that no matter how much policy makers allocate budgets for economic development these efforts will bring zero returns; without establishing institutional frameworks that guarantee that the process of economic reforms is going in the right way.

However, many issues of CBA also arise from process related matters, especially when assessing integrated plans. Using an inductive research design, we explored how these process related issues play out in Dutch planning practices. In two applied research techniques, focus group sessions and open in depth interviews, we focused on process related issues as perceived by CBA participants ranging from plan makers to CBA testers. This article presents the different perceptions of issues in CBA processes. Through these collected perspectives, we found that these issues are multi-layered and present a number of fundamental dilemmas. After relating our empirical data to theory, we conclude that the biggest challenge lies in decreasing the level of mistrust and communication deficits revealed between plan owners and CBA calculators and their respective frames of thinking when assessing complex integrated land use and transportation plans.

The quantification of these factors is very complex and it may look as merely an abstract impression. These factors include a student's career aspiration which may be an important force in shaping job supply. This may be one of the causes for the deepening structural problems in the labour market. This research was conducted by the Faculty of Management and Economics at the Thomas Bata University in Zlin (TBU FaME) in 2011. The survey was targeted at Czech secondary schools. The reason for this research is mainly because the Czech labour market in recent years has been more and more confronted with the problems of structural unemployment and a rise in the number of unemployed secondary school graduates. For the purpose of this research we chose Roe's classification of occupations and theoretical conclusions. The collected data was evaluated and compared with the current structure of employment in the country. The research confirmed that the career focus of Czech young people is largely inconsistent with the available employment. There was also was a high degree of ambivalence within the career orientation of students at secondary schools. The consequences of these conclusions are an economic loss in the school sector and a very slow achievement of the potential of a subject in the labour market.,"[Dobes, Kamil] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Dept Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,dobes@fame.utb.cz; jurasek@fame.utb.cz,"Dobeš, Kamil/H-6568-2012","Dobes, Kamil/0000-0003-1448-1936",,,,,17,0,0,0,10,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1190,1201,,,,,,12,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549701003,0

The analysis is set up in a New Keynesian model that allows for optimal monetary policy in presence of model uncertainty and exogenous shocks. The paper shows that for most of the macrovariables targeting the domestic price index instead of the CPI implies considerably more expected economic stability. When policy makers consider model uncertainty in the design of the optimal policy, the difference in the indexes' performance is sharpened allowing more informed decisions on their convenience.","[Flamini, Alessandro] Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Flamini, Alessandro] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Pavia; University of Sheffield,"Flamini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",a.flamini@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The applied factors were selected in compliance with the economics of labour market theory and cover three areas: economic environment (GDP growth in market prices, inflation), tax area (tax wedge), social benefit (net replacement ratio) and labour market flexibility (fixed-term contracts, part-time contracts). The panel model estimation has been implemented through a panel regression analysis for two homogenous groups (EU-15 countries and new countries - EU-12). The period preceding an economic crisis and a period of economic crisis have been investigated. The results show that the labour market flexibility influences the long-term unemployment rate in the strongest negative way, then there is evident a positive impact of the tax wedge followed by the macroeconomic environment impact. The negative impact of economic growth operates in these groups with the same intensity, the tax burden in the EU15 countries is higher and vice versa with an increase in the share of part-time workers long-term unemployment decreases markedly in the EU12. The same positive economic growth will contribute to a deeper decrease of long-term unemployment. In the crisis period the positive impact of tax burden is reduced and we also monitor the increasing impact of the proportion of part-time jobs.","[Hanclova, Jana] VSB Techn Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Syst Engn, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic; [Simek, Milan] VSB Techn Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Natl Econ, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic; [Horak, Jiri] VSB Techn Univ Ostrava, Fac MIning & Geol, Inst Geoinformat, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava,"Hanclová, J (通讯作者)，VSB Techn Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Syst Engn, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",jana.hanclova@vsb.cz; milan.simek@vsb.cz; jiri.horak@vsb.cz,"Hanclova, Jana/AAJ-8363-2020; Horak, Jiri/J-7095-2016; Šimek, Milan/I-6323-2018; Hanclova, Jana/D-7723-2013","Hanclova, Jana/0000-0002-0939-6852; Horak, Jiri/0000-0003-2696-5540; Šimek, Milan/0000-0002-7566-8764;",Student Grant Competition of VSB-TU Ostrava [SP2012/62],Student Grant Competition of VSB-TU Ostrava,The paper was funded by Student Grant Competition of VSB-TU Ostrava within the project SP2012/62.,,17,3,3,1,18,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,249,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900043,0

An increasingly popular view expects the East Asian model of development to be ill-equipped to deal with the challenges involved in the information economy while the institutions of a 'developmental network state' are argued to be of greater utility. This paper tests this view in light of a dramatic shift in the business strategy of Korean firms in the telecommunications sector in the early years of the twenty-first century. I argue that core features of the Korean model have been recombined in creative and unanticipated ways to meet the twin challenges of economic openness and knowledge-based industrialisation. The argument is developed through an examination of the Korean government's promotion of a novel Korean-developed mobile broadcasting standard. I identify and trace the emergence of the institutional conditions which facilitated the rise of new and innovative forms of state-industry collaboration. The findings have implications for two outstanding issues in the developmental state literature: the role of former developmental states after liberalisation and the type of institutions useful beyond the catch-up process.","Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Kim, SY (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,,"Kim, Sung-Young/0000-0002-8245-7156",,,,,77,42,48,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Hobson's conception of over-saving was contained within an evolving historiography of capital accumulation and took on various meanings depending on whether Hobson was discussing a competitive or monopolistic environment.

As the real systems are full of an uncertainty, there are several tools incorporating the uncertainty into the classical models, for example the theory of probability, the theory of fuzzy sets, or the theory of rough sets.

We make this argument from the premise that technological artifacts that get inscribed within organizational culture and design do so through an initial process that involves prioritization, which in itself is theorized as an outcome of organizational discourse. We draw on critical realism's retroductive approach and the practice of 'group think' for grounding crowdsourcing in IT project prioritization. Our choice of crowdsourcing as a remedy for inefficiencies in IT Project prioritization is deliberate: it elevates the notion of group think as a theoretical lens; and is in line with the positioning of organizational decision making as deliberately constitutive and representative of stakeholder interests. However, we remain attentive guard against utopianism, but still make the claim that crowdsourcing provides us with some traction for seeking alternatives that can lead to a re-invigoration in RE research for effective practices in IT projects.

This study compares the estimates from two different approaches to correct for a potential selection bias based on multinomial logit, including Lee's and Bourguignon et al's selection biased correction approaches. This study extends the hours worked specification by analysing the effects of minimum wage on hours worked separately across individuals in different groups of workers in terms of gender (male-female workers). This study found that an increase in the minimum wage increases hours worked of the existing urban paid employees in Indonesia.

Hence, preserving cultural heritage and monuments is a necessity for transferring local identity to future generations. However, the new urban texture of Yazd is forming under the effect of urban development and modernization processes, whose continuation will damage the urban identity of Yazd in the future. The historical texture of Yazd was created many years ago, based on two main factors, namely climate and religion. Therefore, there is a structural coherence between the various spaces of the historical texture of Yazd, which is imperceptible and intangible within the new texture of Yazd. Thus, urban managers should codify urban laws to organize the new texture of Yazd according to the fundamental factors that shaped the urban identity of Yazd previously. In addition, managers should put more effort into promoting Yazd's urban signs and urban furniture; particularly in old texture, because these factors can complete image-ability and legibility features in the city of Yazd and create more beautiful and powerful images in the minds of citizens and tourists.","[Shamsollahi, Behnoosh; Selamat, Nor Hafizah Binti Hj; Jamaludin, Shariffah Suraya Binti Syed] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,,"Selamat, Nor Hafizah/E-2884-2012; Jamaludin, Shariffah Suraya Syed/E-2845-2012",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,515,527,,,,,,13,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600045,0

To address endogeneity, we exploit the adoption of Proposal A in 1994, which resulted in substantial exogenous and differential changes to property tax rates and school spending across all communities. This major state imposed intervention enables us to examine the tax rate-tax base relationship using appropriate instrumental variable techniques. We find that both tax rate and school spending changes have statistically significant effects on tax base growth. We also examine the effects of competitor community policies on own community tax base growth using a unique approach to define competitors. Specifically, competitor communities are determined by migration flows as opposed to the more traditional methods based on contiguity or population. We find significant regional competition effects; changes in tax rates and school spending relative to competitors are also important to tax base growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The model is estimated by maximum simulated likelihood using data on wide-body aircraft owners and prices for transactions occurring 1978-1997. The importance of explicitly modeling dynamics and equilibrium in new and used markets for durable goods is illustrated in two counterfactual experiments. Estimates of the structural model are used to show that implementing an investment tax credit not only increases demand for new wide-body aircraft by the airlines that receive the tax credit, but also increases the number of new wide-body aircraft owned by airlines not directly affected by the policy. Further, the model indicates that a policy which improves the efficiency of secondary markets for used wide-body aircraft will also stimulate demand for new wide-body aircraft.

In order to realize any of the strategies it is necessary to create prerequisites for development of human resources, for support of entrepreneurship, incentives for SME-s and innovation. Instead of limited means available through Instrument of pre-accession assistance (IPA 94), once Croatia reaches full membership a whole new perspective will be open through funding available within Structural and Cohesion Fund. In this light the period of pre-accession and related funds have to be used for the purpose of learning and adjustment but due to lack of infrastructure and necessary knowledge Croatia seems to have questionable success in utilisation of the available funds. Human potentials represent a basis on which strategy of economic development is built upon. All other resources: economic resources, geo-strategic position, level of technological development, in comparison to human resources seem to be less important. One of the reasons for insufficient usage of available EU funds is lack of human resources with specific knowledge and skills for preparation of projects according to EU standards. Implementation of a model for establishment of Development teams within local self-government units, institutions and civil sector will enhance absorption of available funds and influence economic development of the region.

This paper deals with this form of violence. The first issue arising in the process of informal violence research is that there are no adequate or theoretically developed elaborations of this phenomenon. Firstly, the authors define informal violence, and after that they present how they developed the instrument VIF - Violence, informal forms. After factorisation and calibration of the instrument, resulting measurement characteristics of this instrument were very high; for example, internal consistency assessed using the Cronbah's coefficient alpha (alpha = .94) is very high, while the split-half method showed a high correlation (r = .90). The instrument is enclosed in the appendix to this paper. Use of the VIF showed that there are six forms of informal violence: gossip, segregation, media mobbing, humiliation in front of peers, insults via the Internet, and mockery. These are, at the same time, the key components or factors of informal violence, chosen by the authors as a varimex rotation in factor analysis of the principal components of the VIF instrument. These components were established as predictors of school achievement, while multiple regression showed that only segregation had significant influence on pupils' school achievement (beta = .12). This is not a strong predictor, but it shows positive influences on school achievement, which is a curiosity and a phenomenon worth further research. Generally, the authors note that 10% of pupils are exposed to above-average peer violence.

The models in the literature typically assume that each family is endowed with children whose expected schooling outcomes are determined by parental preferences on neighborhood quality. However, empirical studies report that the fertility dimension is also endogenous. Specifically, fertility is documented to be negatively related to neighborhood quality. We extend the model originally developed by Nesheim (2001) to account for endogenous fertility in a framework featuring endogenous contextual effects. Altruistic parents jointly choose how many children to produce and which neighborhood to live. We investigate whether the model can support an equilibrium where fertility is negatively related to neighborhood quality as the data suggest. We find that sorting over parental human capital cannot explain the observed negative relationship between fertility and neighborhood quality except for a restricted set of likely unrealistic parameter values. Sorting in terms of the human capital levels of children, however, can produce such an equilibrium for more reasonable parameter values. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Their use reflects the importance of considering the people's point of view and the multidimensional nature of health. Following the recognition of the individual's own perception as a useful indicator of general health status, self-perceived health has become one of the most significant population health indicators studied today. From a public health perspective, such monitoring aids the identification of population inequalities in health status, potentially reveals unmet needs in the community, and indicates important health-promoting efforts. Numerous studies have shown significant relationship between self-perceived health and objective measures of health (morbidity and mortality). Poorer health is related to higher morbidity and mortality and secondary to lower everyday functionality of those people (population). Since chronic diseases and conditions became part of the everyday life for the large proportion of our population it is considerable to research the subjective quality of life (QoL) of those people. It is known that health is one of the significant factors that influence person's QoL, and someone's own perception of satisfaction with life needs to be recognized as valuable indicator of population health (especially mental health). Furthermore, low socio-economic status was correlated with subjective health and has implications on everyday functioning and working productivity of the individuals. In this study the regional differences in health and quality of life was examined in the sample of 9070 adult participants from all region of Croatia. East Croatia region was compared to other regions. Health was measured by SF-36 health status questionnaire covering eight dimensions of health separated in two area of health: Physical functioning, Role limitation due to physical problems, Bodily pain and General health perception which appertains to concept of physical health and dimensions of Social functioning, Role limitation due to emotional problems, Mental health, Energy and Vitality which appertains to concept of mental health. Results have revealed significant regional difference in health with the significantly poorer health in East Croatian region in comparison with other regions. Health status was significantly correlated with self-assessed socio-economic status where is also the worst situation in East region (low level of both health and economic status). Taking in account that self perceived health has influence on person's everyday functioning, work ability and efficacy this results stress the importance of promoting biological, psychological and economical factors of health. Multidisciplinarity is a key approach in achieving this goal.","[Vuletic, Gorka; Sincek, Daniela] Fac Philosophy, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Kraljik, Nikola] Inst Publ Hlth Osijek Baranja Cty, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Vuger-Kovacic, Daria] Special Hosp Rehabil Varatdinske Toplice, Varatdinske Toplice 42223, Croatia",,"Vuletic, G (通讯作者)，Fac Philosophy, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",gvuletic@ffos.hr; dsincek@ffos.hr; nikola.kraljik@os.t-com.hr; daria.kovacic-vuger@vz.t-com.hr,"Šincek, Daniela/IWM-4331-2023; Šincek, Daniela/I-6145-2018; Vuletic, Gorka/AAT-1414-2020","Šincek, Daniela/0000-0001-8011-3280; Vuletic, Gorka/0000-0002-6804-6860",,,,,7,0,0,0,10,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,318,324,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600036,0

Here we present what we believe to be the first paper that together analyses the explicit impacts on observed route choice of an actual network intervention and compares this with the before-and-after predictions of a network equilibrium model. The analysis is based on the findings of an empirical study of the travel time and route choice impacts of a road capacity reduction. Time-stamped, partial licence plates were recorded across a series of locations, over a period of days both with and without the capacity reduction, and the data were 'matched' between locations using special-purpose statistical methods. Hypothesis tests were used to identify statistically significant changes in travel times and route choice, between the periods of days with and without the capacity reduction. A traffic network equilibrium model was then independently applied to the same scenarios, and its predictions compared with the empirical findings. From a comparison of route choice patterns, a particularly influential spatial effect was revealed of the parameter specifying the relative values of distance and travel time assumed in the generalised cost equations. When this parameter was 'fitted' to the data without the capacity reduction, the network model broadly predicted the route choice impacts of the capacity reduction, but with other values it was seen to perform poorly. The paper concludes by discussing the wider practical and research implications of the study's findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Players who have a history of suspension (non-criminal related) perform worse than other players but having an encounter with law enforcement does not negatively predict performance.","[Weir, Kendall] NetSuite Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Wu, Stephen] Hamilton Coll, Dept Econ, Clinton, NY 13323 USA",Hamilton College,"Wu, S (通讯作者)，Hamilton Coll, Dept Econ, Clinton, NY 13323 USA.",swu@hamilton.edu,,"Wu, Stephen/0000-0003-4640-0221",,,,,18,5,7,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

This paper investigates the occurrence of this paradox when transit authority can have different economic objectives (profit-maximizing or breakeven) and operating schemes (frequency, fare, or both frequency and fare). For various combinations of economic objectives and operating schemes, the interaction between highway expansion and transit service is explored, as well as its impact on travelers' mode choices and travel utilities. Further, for each combination, the conditions for occurrence of the Downs-Thomson Paradox are established. We show that the paradox never occurs when transit authority is profit-maximizing, but it is inevitable when the transit authority is running to maximize travelers' utility while maintaining breakeven. This is because the former transit authority tends to enhance transit service (e.g., raise frequency or reduce fare) when facing an expanded highway; and on the contrary, the latter tends to compromise transit service (e.g., reduce frequency or raise fare). Both analytical and numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Current estimates of the impact of base realignments implicitly assume that military bases have similar economic impacts. But the military is a diverse institution engaged in thousands of distinct activities, each with their own benefits to local economies. Using detailed soldier, civilian, and contracting data from two army bases, this article compares the economic impact of the main activities in which military bases engage. Because military bases source their inputs from national defense procurement networks, the economic benefits of soldier-based activities are smaller than most economic development alternatives. This finding suggests that regions facing defense contracting cuts are significantly more economically vulnerable than regions facing base closures.","Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Doussard, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, 210 Temple Buell Hall,611 Taft Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",mdouss1@illinois.edu,,,,,,,34,2,5,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This article contributes to this discussion both in conceptual and empirical terms. It uses a new multidimensional index of politicization to systematically trace the development of politicization in national election campaigns in five West European countries (Austria, Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland) from the 1970s to 2010. The findings provide clear evidence that Europe has indeed been politicized in the past decades. Moreover, two different paths towards such a politicization are identified. One of these paths is dominated by populist radical parties from the right, while the other path is shaped by the conflict between mainstream parties in government and opposition. On both paths, conflicts over membership play an important role and cultural-identitarian framing strategies are used.","[Hutter, Swen; Grande, Edgar] Univ Munich, D-81377 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Hutter, S (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Geschwister Scholl Inst Polit Sci, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",hutter@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,"Hutter, Swen/0000-0002-1107-1213",,,,,28,150,154,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We outline a methodology for constructing the excess returns to housing at a disaggregated level, essentially that of the individual home. Our approach explicitly takes account of the inherent risk in homeownership with regard to the capital gain or loss component of housing returns. This approach is applied to a rich data set for Sydney, Australia, from 2003Q1 to 2011Q2. Our findings indicate that the returns to housing are on average quite weak though they exhibit significant diversity across dwelling types and regions.

The study looked at workers' two choice behaviors: active activity and active travel. The first choice behavior, active activity, is developed as an ordered-response model based on the number of physically active recreational activities pursued during the workday. The second choice behavior, active travel, is developed as a binary-response model that examines workers' active travel choices whether or not the worker used any active mode of travel during the same workday. The study improves the understanding and knowledge of observed factors influencing workers' physically active activity-travel behavior. The study also provides several observations regarding the role (and constraints) of employment in individuals' active choices. Using a flexible copula modeling methodology, we explore the true correlation (or dependence) between the two behavior choices that could occur due to the presence of unobserved factors, suggesting a simultaneously low or simultaneously high propensity for being physically active across workers. The study findings suggest that transportation and public health policy makers can mutually benefit from encouraging workers to be physically active (from an activity and/or travel perspective). Overall, the study draws attention to the integrated nature of the public health and transportation fields, thereby providing a distinct view of active/inactive choice behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first study exploring a rich variety of components for workers' active activity-travel behavior through a robust copula approach.

In order to efficiently design facilities and policies that will stimulate bicycle use, it is necessary to first understand people's attitudes towards bicycle use, and the factors that may influence their preferences. Such an understanding will enable reliable predictions of bicycle use willingness level, based on which cycling facility construction can be reasonably prioritized. As people often have different perceptions on exercising, green transportation, and traffic conditions, effects of potentially influencing factors on people's willingness of using bicycles tend to be highly heterogeneous. This paper uses a random parameter ordered probit model to analyze how travelers' willingness of using bicycles is influenced by various socio-economic factors in Belo Horizonte City, Brazil, with the consideration of individual heterogeneity. The data was collected through the 2010 bicycle use survey in Belo Horizonte City. Results show that, first, the willingness of using bicycle is favored by middle income class household, and negatively related with commuting time. Second, people who rent apartments tend to be more willing to use bicycles. Third, if a person is currently walking a long time to work, he/she would be most willing to commute with a bicycle in the future. Those currently commuting a relatively short distance by motorcycle and bus follow this group in terms of willingness to commute by bicycle in the future. Car users seem to be difficult to convert to bicycle users. Moreover, the estimation shows clear evidence that significant individual heterogeneity indeed exists, especially for education level, necessitating the consideration of such an effect. With the calibrated model, residents' willingness of using bicycle commuting is then estimated for the entire Belo Horizonte City using the 2010 Census and the 2012 O/D survey data. The results are cross validated using the bicycle path preference information, also obtained from the 2010 bicycle use survey. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that governors moved from a neutral position in 2009 to a clearly pro-Putin position in 2011, and that policy initiatives advocated by Medvedev all but evaporated from the rhetoric of governors in 2012.","[Baturo, Alexander] Dublin City Univ, Sch Law & Govt, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Mikhaylov, Slava] UCL, Dept Polit Sci, London WC1H 9QU, England",Dublin City University; University of London; University College London,"Baturo, A (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Sch Law & Govt, Dublin 9, Ireland.",alex.baturo@dcu.ie; s.mikhaylov@ucl.ac.uk,,"Baturo, Alexander/0000-0002-1108-5287; Jankin, Slava/0000-0001-6915-177X",,,,,76,6,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,AUG,2014,66.0,6,,,,,969,992,,10.1080/09668136.2014.926716,0.0,,,24,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AM9GK,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340188700006,0

The theoretical framework specifies the network assets and the mechanisms through which they can support the two paths to compliance.

We found that freight effects have a significant impact on Amtrak train delays after controlling for other important delay determinants such as the capacity utilization rate. The impact is higher on long-distance routes. We also observed significant differences between the effects of different freight railroads. For example, Amtrak operations on infrastructure controlled by several Class I railroads experienced significantly larger delays than baseline operations, while Amtrak train delays on Burlington Northern and Santa Fe's tracks actually fell below baseline levels.

This study examines how meanings generated in three community organizations, churches, ethnic media and hometown associations were transferred into the organizing process. Findings indicate that collective identities and political selves constructed through experiences in the community can help low-wage immigrant workers overcome the sense of powerlessness that they often experience at work.

A clear understanding of the contributing factors and their effects on incident clearance time is essential for optimal incident management resource allocations. Most previous studies simply considered the average effects of the influential factors. Although the time-varying effects are also important for incident management agencies, they were not sufficiently investigated. To fill up the gap, this study develops a non-proportional hazard-based duration model for analyzing the time-varying effects of influential factors on incident clearance time. This study follows a systematic approach incorporating the following three procedures: proportionality test, model development/estimation, and effectiveness test. Applying the proposed model to the 2009 Washington State Incident Tracking System data, five factors were found to have significant but constant (or time independent) effects on the clearance time, which is similar to the findings from previous studies. However, our model also discovered thirteen variables that have significant time-varying impacts on clearance hazard. These factors cannot be identified through the conventional methods used in most previous studies. The influential factors are investigated from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. The population average effect evaluation provides the macroscopic insight and benefits long-term incident management, and the time-dependent pattern identification offers microscopic and time-sequential insight and benefits the specific incident clearance process.

The analysis of Belarusian strategies demonstrates how the decisions of external actors, such as the European Union and to a certain extent the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, function as bargaining chips for the Belarusian leadership.

The model is applied to the transport market in Northeast Asia using a counter-factual approach, demonstrating the model's capability of evaluating practical policies utilizing market data observed on the routes under investigation. Our modeling results suggest that air transport liberalization will benefit both consumers and the aviation industry in the region albeit not necessarily on an equal basis across or within groups. Much of the welfare gains are derived from higher frequency after liberalization, which increases service quality, hence consumer utility. Open skies policies that include pure cabotage which permit carriers to compete in the domestic markets of a foreign country, will increase competition, frequency and reduce fares below current levels. Airport slot allocation policies play an important role in the realization and distribution of potential welfare gains related to liberalization. Therefore, government agencies should implement liberalization and airport slot allocation policies jointly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite its potential benefits, in urban areas dominated by high-rise developments, urban renewal has an unintended negative impact on nearby properties since it reduces their redevelopment option values. In this study, we develop a number of hypotheses on how an urban renewal project, once made known to the public, affects neighborhood housing prices and test them with data in Hong Kong. Our empirical findings suggest that the degree of positive externalities brought by urban renewal depends on the scale of an urban renewal project, as well as the amount of commercial areas included in the project. Most importantly, through examining changes in the age coefficient, we found that an urban renewal project reduces the value of nearby buildings beyond the boundaries of the project. The negative effect was stronger for older buildings and for those buildings located closer to the project's boundaries. These unintended consequences of urban renewal have not been analyzed or tested in previous studies.","[Chau, K. W.; Wong, S.

The major structural unbalances that had accumulated in Anglo-American economies over the last quarter of the 20th century played a key role in the build up to the financial crisis. Taking advantage of the mobility of capital, business elites promoted a model of shareholder capitalism actively backed up by the state. A process of elite competition took place: financial intermediaries acting on behalf of institutional investors marginalized the alliance between traditional managerial elites and workers that had been at the heart of the Keynesian compromise. This contribution outlines the consequences of the unravelling of the 20th century social pact for workers and their families. It concludes by outlining what is to be done' to forge a 21st century social pact.","[Daguerre, Anne] Middlesex Univ, London NW4 4BT, England",Middlesex University,"Daguerre, A (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London NW4 4BT, England.",a.daguerre@mdx.ac.uk,,"Daguerre, Anne/0000-0003-2089-5238",,,,,71,11,12,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Infeed from wind and solar is modeled explicitly and withdrawn from total demand. The methodology separates the impact of weather and capacity. Efficiency is modeled as a stochastic process. Installed capacity is a deterministic function of time. The residual demand model is applied to the German day-ahead market. Price trajectories show typical features seen in market prices in recent years. The model is able to closely reproduce the structure and magnitude of market prices. Using simulations it is found that renewable infeed increases the volatility of forward prices in times of low demand, but can reduce volatility in peak hours. The merit-order effect of increased wind and solar capacity is calculated. It is found that under current capacity levels in the German market wind has a stronger overall effect than solar, but both are even in peak hours.","Fraunhofer ITWM, Dept Financial Math, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany",,"Wagner, A (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer ITWM, Dept Financial Math, Fraunhofer Pl 1, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",andreas.wagner@itwm.fraunhofer.de,,,Innovation Center Applied System Modeling,Innovation Center Applied System Modeling,The author is grateful for the financial support received from the Innovation Center Applied System Modeling.,,31,19,19,1,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2014,35.0,2,,,,,45,73,,10.5547/01956574.35.2.3,0.0,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AD8WG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333545800003,0

Using panel data for foreign investment between 2000 and 2009, we find that the predictors of subnational variation in investment go beyond simple geographic and economic conditions and include factors such as local political party control, social stability and the perceived effectiveness of state authorities. Moreover, the three types of investment are shaped by distinct social, political and economic dynamics. Insofar as the location and type of foreign investment can affect economic development and inequality within - and not just between - countries, the subnational distribution of investment is of consequence for both academics and policy makers.","[Samford, Steven] Univ Notre Dame, Kellogg Inst Int Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Ortega Gomez, Priscila] Univ Michoacana, Dept Accounting & Adm Sci, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico",University of Notre Dame; Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo,"Samford, S (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Kellogg Inst Int Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",,"Ortega Gómez, Priscila/GVT-2670-2022","Ortega Gómez, Priscila/0000-0002-3178-574X; Samford, Steven/0000-0002-8887-3652",,,,,49,13,16,2,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This research provides further evidence in this debate by examining the existence of hypothetical bias in a transport-related SC experiment. Data for this research were sourced from a University of Sydney study exploring the effect of exposure-based charging on motorist behaviour. The sample included 148 Sydney motorists who were recruited to take part in the 10-week GPS driving field study (Revealed Preference/RP data). In addition, participants were also required to complete an SC survey which was designed to mimic the RP decision context in order to capture what participants indicated they would do as opposed to what participants actually did in reaction to the charging regime. The current state of practice for measuring hypothetical bias in the literature is to compare aggregate differences in model outcomes using SC and RP data sources. Aggregate analysis is limited in its scope and does not allow for the calculation of the prevalence of hypothetical bias (i.e., how many participants are affected by hypothetical bias). This research is uniquely structured to allow for individual categorisation of hypothetical bias by comparing SC and RP data from the same sample for the direct purpose of investigating the prevalence of hypothetical bias. Furthermore, the extent to which mitigation techniques (cheap talk and certainty scales) influence hypothetical bias is also explored. The findings from this research show that the SC model estimates are prone to hypothetical bias and that the mitigation techniques have potential to compensate for this inherent bias.

Although there is a widespread expectation that liberalization and firms' needs for flexibility brings convergence to the liberal market model of decentralized industrial relations, recent literature suggests that diversity persists and that there are a range of different responses. This article contributes to the debate by applying a coalitional perspective to highlight the factors that influence divergent trajectories of change in wage bargaining. The case studies of Italian and Greek banking suggest that the existence of employer associability' may moderate decentralizing tendencies and facilitate the reform of industrial relations institutions, while labour-state coalitions' are critical for the survival of institutions. Finally, the article discusses the findings in relation to wider debates in the comparative political economy of work.","[Kornelakis, Andreas] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Kornelakis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Business & Management, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",a.kornelakis@sussex.ac.uk,"Kornelakis, Andreas/L-2607-2019","Kornelakis, Andreas/0000-0003-1569-3367",,,,,77,12,12,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper uses numerical simulation methods to assess the potential effects of a TPP agreement on China and also China's inclusion or exclusion on other countries. We use a numerical 11-country global general equilibrium model with trade costs and inside money. Trade costs are calculated using a method based on gravity equations. TPP barriers potentially removable are trade costs less tariffs. Simulation results reveal that China will be slightly hurt by TPP initiatives in welfare when China is out, but the total production and export will be increased. Other non-TPP countries will be mostly hurt in welfare, but member countries will mostly gain. If China takes part in TPP, she will significantly gain and increase other TPP countries' gain as well. The comparison of TPP effects and global free trade effects show that the positive effects of global free trade are stronger than TPP effects. Japan's joining TPP would be beneficial to both herself and most of other TPP countries, but which negative effects on China's welfare when out of TPP will increase further.","[Li, Chunding] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunding] CUFE, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada; [Whalley, John] CIGI, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Whalley, John] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Whalley, John] UIBE, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Central University of Finance & Economics; Western University (University of Western Ontario); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of International Business & Economics,"Li, CD (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,29,26,29,1,336,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2014,37.0,2,,,,,169,192,,10.1111/twec.12123,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AA0OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330793500001,0

The analysis of 50,520 cases of candidate nomination and 9553 cases of electoral success, supported by a cross-regional statistical study of the factors of women's nomination and success, empirically confirms an explanatory model that incorporates three working hypotheses derived from the mainstream literature on women's representation. According to this model, the 2002-2003 electoral reform, by introducing proportional representation into regional electoral systems, strongly facilitated women's representation. After the advent of electoral authoritarianism, proportional rules, in combination with the increased party magnitude' of the pro-government party, continued to exert expectedly positive effects; yet these effects were offset by the decreased competitiveness in majority districts. As a result, political regime transformation did not lead to a significant increase in the number of female deputies.","European Univ St Petersburg, Polit Sci & Sociol Dept, St Petersburg, Russia",European University at Saint Petersburg,"Golosov, GV (通讯作者)，European Univ St Petersburg, Polit Sci & Sociol Dept, St Petersburg, Russia.",ggolosov@gmail.com,"Golosov, Grigorii/C-3032-2012","Golosov, Grigorii/0000-0001-9769-9230",,,,,69,5,5,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The article identifies ambiguities around Burnham's depiction of New Labour in power as committed to depoliticisation. It addresses these by drawing a distinction between regime of accumulation and mode of regulation, characterising New Labour's political economy in terms of the latter as a form of depoliticised Keynesianism framed by 'discretionary constraint'. Contra-Burnham, the article points to the continued efficacy of Keynesian and social democratic political agency in the context of a dialectic of depoliticisation and repoliticisation focused on the role and power of the state. This dialectic is symptomatic of the contested regulation of capitalism around the defence of the value of money, on the one hand, and its broader management and redistribution, on the other.","Lincoln Univ, Sch Social Sci, Brayford Pool LN6 7TS, Lincoln, England",University of Lincoln,"Strange, G (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Sch Social Sci, Brayford Pool LN6 7TS, Lincoln, England.",gstrange@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,8,9,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This article explores the notion of 'welfare' from both social and organizational angles. Overall, it shows the increasing tendency to leave aside the concept of labour welfare as human resources management waxes while industrial relations wane in the context of the emergence of Business Schools in Britain. Initially apprehended as a purely social object, it is argued that Philip Sargant Florence (1924) applied it in the theoretical context of industrial organization before this was appropriated by the field of industrial relations, which later declined to be transformed by human resources management.","Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Arena, L (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France.",lise.arena@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,"Arena, Lise/0000-0002-2163-5887",,,,,54,1,1,0,9,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Direct costs were estimated using information on healthcare utilisation given by parents in the 10-year follow-up. To meet this aim, we (i) estimate BMI-standard deviation score (BMIZ) trajectories using latent growth mixture models and (ii) examine the correlation between these trajectories and utilisation of healthcare services and resulting costs at the 10-year follow-up. We identified three BMI-trajectories: a normative BMIZ growth class (BMI development almost as in the WHO growth standards), a rapid BMIZ growth up to age 2 years class (with a higher BMI in the first two years of life as proposed by the WHO growth standards) and a persistent rapid BMIZ growth up to age 5 years class (with a higher BMI in the first five years of life as proposed by the WHO growth standards). Annual total direct medical costs of healthcare use are estimated to be on average 368 per child. These costs are doubled, i.e. on average 722 per child, in the group with the most pronounced growth (persistent rapid BMIZ growth up to age 5 years class). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These will depend also on the approach both sides adopt in respect to the new challenges arising in their common neighborhood.","[Drienikova, Kristina] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Int Trade, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Drieniková, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Int Trade, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",kristina.drienikova@euba.sk,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3995-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,69,77,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BF6XQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383767900008,0

As cities expand, so do the food needs of urban populations, especially families. The urbanization process in many developing countries goes hand-in-hand with increasing urban poverty and growing food insecurity and malnutrition, especially for the urban poor. Changes in climate add to the challenges faced by cities and the urban poor. Many cities are at risk of becoming disaster traps, either through the direct effects of floods, hurricanes, or rising sea levels, or through severe food supply problems due to droughts, hailstorms or frosts that affect agricultural production in their hinterlands - and thus the urban food markets. These are urgent and pressing challenges demanding an equally urgent and adequate response from city and national authorities as well as international support organizations. Urban policies, planning and design must incorporate food security considerations and focus on building cities that are more resilient to crises. Urban and periurban agriculture will have to feature prominently in urban food security, economic development, land use and climate change strategies and action plans. Several countries and local governments have already taken such initiatives, but in many other countries and cities, new initiatives are needed. This paper will provide a state-of-the-art overview of current national and local policies and experiences in integrating urban and peri-urban agriculture in policy making, planning and design. It will also highlight prospects and challenges that will require attention in future efforts to improve on or upscale these experiences to other cities and countries.","ETC Urban Agr RUAF Fdn, NL-3830 AB Leusden, Netherlands",,"Dubbeling, M (通讯作者)，ETC Urban Agr RUAF Fdn, Kastanjelaan 5, NL-3830 AB Leusden, Netherlands.",m.dubbeling@etcnl.nl,,,,,,,6,3,3,2,32,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-08-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1021.0,,,,,,121,132,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1021.10,0.0,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB5GQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343861400010,0

It first deals with the EU's role in promoting the economic boom that marked the region up to 2007, emphasizing the role of the single market and of the EU in anchoring and encouraging economic policy liberalization. The second section investigates the EU role in buffering the bust that occurred after 2007, looking at structural fund spending and financial sector instruments to enhance liquidity. I argue the EU had a (mostly unintentional) pro-cyclical effect that fuelled the boom and contributed to setting up the region for a very hard fall during the bust. I also show the EU efforts to buffer the hard times were far quicker in the area of structural fund spending compared to very slow and limited innovation in liquidity provision, especially for non-eurozone states.","Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"Jacoby, W (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, 742 SWKT, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",Wade_Jacoby@byu.edu,,,,,,,42,31,33,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The first regional tourism organization was founded in 1864th in St. Moritz. After that a greater role of regional organizations have not come to the fore until the seventies and eighties of the 20th century. The England Tourist Board (ETB) was established in 1969 by 12 regional tourism organizations, with the support of local authorities and the private sector. In other European countries, regional tourism organizations have been established starting from the eighties of the 20th century. Models of regional networking of tourism organizations may be different. In some countries, the system is dictated by the state, as it is the case in England or in Queensland, in Australia. In Sweden and New Zealand, there is freedom of the regional networking, each establishment of a regional structure is preferred. The Croatian practice at the national level still do not know the formal model of regionalization. Tourist board networking in the tourist undeveloped continental part of Croatia, particularly of those that operate in Slavonia as the most underdeveloped tourist region in Croatia, is a prerequisite for effective marketing and management of tourist destinations in this area. The same is corroborated by the results of primary research that was conducted in September and October 2013 among directors of the Tourist Boards in the region of Slavonia. The primary research objective was to determine if the region of Slavonia may become more recognizable in tourist markets only if its tourism development is managed unified, from the regional level. At this level, there is a need to constitute the Tourist Organization of Slavonia. Main functions of this organization will be, beside marketing, strategic planning and development; tourism system management, and research and information gathering.","[Loncaric, Biljana] Tourist Board Slavonski Brod, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia; [Bolfek, Berislav] Univ Appl Sci Slavonski Brod, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia; [Jakicic, Darija] Slavonski Brod Televis, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,"Loncaric, B (通讯作者)，Tourist Board Slavonski Brod, Trg Pobjede 28-1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia.",info@tzgsb.hr; berislav.bolfek@gmail.com; darija.jakicic@gmail.com,"Bolfek, Berislav/AAZ-1763-2021; BOLFEK, BERISLAV/GQA-4074-2022","Bolfek, Berislav/0000-0001-6968-2319;",,,,,29,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,389,398,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600037,0

Moreover, their price does not necessarily follow the law of supply and demand. Because of external factors, farmers do not master the marketing process. It seems difficult for them to produce a significant added value which may ensure the sustainability of their livelihoods. This study aimed to help producers to choose a more beneficial method of marketing. Instead of proposing solutions, we decided to lead a squash (Cucurbita moshata D.) cropping campaign in Ambohimangakely, a village located 10 km to the east of Antananarivo, and to sell the harvested products and assess the economical results taking into consideration the chosen marketing channel. A sector analysis was previously conducted through an informal survey in the markets of the capital of Madagascar, in order to balance supply to demand. Market analysis of squash has shown an opportunity of about 2,300 t of demand gap. The most interesting marketing channel for better agricultural income is the shortest one, which includes the producer, the wholesaler/retailer and the consumer. In that case, the carrier function may be supported by the producer or the seller. However, marketing opportunity depends not only on the choice of differences between supply and demand. With vegetables, our experience also revealed the high resiliency of the squash with respect to hail, and its capacity to be conserved for more than a year in appropriate conditions.","[Razanakoto, O.

Moreover, the nonparametric analysis shows that most of the growth differential is driven by the cities' first decade of existence.

The paper presents research findings on the technologies used on the farm as well as describes the key indicators of economic gains, determining the gains after a group of technologies was changed. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the present research. Data were obtained from the farm's accounting system. Presently, the farm uses all the three technologies for field works in its sown area in equal proportions, and the choice of technologies is mainly determined by weather conditions, as well as the crop in crop rotation. The expenses on equipment and tractors are very different if the farm changes its crop rotation and applies another combination of technologies. The results show that changes in the soil after the rotation of crops will be mainly taken into account in direct sowing and in low-till technology; the cost difference is significant. Comparing the new tillage technology group with the currently used one, the largest cost for the farm is generated by ploughing technology; thereby ploughing technology is no longer viable. Compared with the cost of the new technology, which makes up EUR 214854, the cost gap is EUR 230 045.","[Silina, Linda; Zvirbule-Berzina, A.] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,,"Zvirbule, Andra/AAF-5649-2019; Zvirbule, Andra/AAN-8223-2020","Zvirbule, Andra/0000-0001-7206-7608;",,,,,12,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,161,168,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800021,0

This paper examines the influence of individual family members (husband, wife, and child/children) over the stages of purchase decision process. On the basis of the survey data, an investigation directed at identifying the role of each family member in decision making for buying a number of goods (household appliances, toys, family vacation) has been conducted. The estimates of family members influence are calculated with the help of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) developed by T. L. Saaty. Comparative analysis of these estimates in terms of various indicators characterizing the process of consumer decision making is carried out. On the results of the analysis performed conclusions concerning irregularity of individual family member influence on making a decision about buying certain goods and services and the stage of the decision process are derived. Data of this sort may be helpful for any company aimed to construct effective strategies of product positioning and to establish communications with family members making purchase decisions, as well as for obtaining information about tastes, preferences, and behavior of a family as a consumer in whole.","[Tsoi, M.

Using anthropometric panel data on 101 countries during the 19th and 20th centuries, we determine that there is a systematic negative and concave relationship between height inequality and average height. The robustness of this relationship is tested by means of several robustness checks, including two instrument variable regressions.

As such it blends insights from two important literatures in comparative political economy. One is exemplified by the work of Peter Katzenstein, who wrote the classic treatise on the relationship between nation-state size and economic performance. Another is illustrated by the work of Ernest Gellner, whose work suggested that economic performance depends on the ethnic composition of the nation-state. The argument is tested on pooled data from 30 advanced capitalist countries for the 1985 through 2007 period. Regression analysis confirms that ethnically homogenous countries tend to have stronger rates of economic growth during this period than ethnically heterogeneous countries but that neither the size of countries nor the interaction of size and ethnic composition have significant effects. This points to the need for further exploration of these issues either with data covering a longer time frame or historical case studies.","[Patsiurko, Natalka] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Sociol, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland; [Campbell, John L.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Sociol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Hall, John A.] McGill Univ, Dept Sociol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",University of Aberdeen; Dartmouth College; McGill University,"Patsiurko, N (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Dept Sociol, Edward Wright Bldg,Dunbar St, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.",natalka.patsiurko@abdn.ac.uk; john.l.campbell@dartmouth.edu; john.a.hall@mcgill.ca,"Campbell, John L/HNR-2256-2023",,,,,,48,8,8,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In the period 2009-11, the EU was debating but could not reach an agreement on stepping up to a 30 per cent reduction target. This raises the question: why did the EU go from being capable of adopting high targets independently of others to being incapable of agreeing whether it should increase its mitigation effort? It is argued that whereas actors sceptical of a high target could be rhetorically entrapped in 2007, such entrapment was impossible in the 2009-11 period. The lack of entrapment can be explained in terms of changes in the international and socio-economic contexts, which led to changes in the policy processes and the normative environment, which again made effective entrapment impossible.","[Skovgaard, Jakob] Lund Univ, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Skovgaard, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Paradisgatan 5H, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Jakob.skovgaard@svet.lu.se,,,,,,,40,18,18,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Although economic theory predicts that incomplete pass-through may also be linked to the presence of non-tariff barriers to trade, variables reflecting such a link is rarely included in empirical models. In this paper, we estimate a pricing-to-market model for Norwegian import prices on textiles and wearing apparels, controlling for non-tariff barriers to trade and shift in imports from high- to low-cost countries. We apply the cointegrated VAR approach and develop measures of foreign prices based on superlative price indices (including the Tornqvist and Fischer price indices) and a data calibration method necessary to approximate relative price levels across countries. Our measures of foreign prices thereby account for inflationary differences and varying import shares and price level differences (known as the China effect) among trading partners. We show that these measures of foreign prices, unlike standard measures used in the pricing-to-market literature, are likely to produce unbiased estimates of pass-through.

Approximately one-quarter of all individuals had some form of insurance, which helped surviving household members defray some fraction of funeral expenses. However, an equal fraction of households borrowed money to pay for the funeral. We develop a model, consistent with ethnographic work in this area, in which households respond to social pressure to bury their dead in a style consistent with the observed social status of the household and that of the deceased. Households that cannot afford a funeral commensurate with social expectations must borrow money to pay for the funeral.

It contributes to the literature by developing an analytical framework that sets out the role of evaluation in regional policy learning and identifies key factors and mechanisms that determine the development of an effective evaluation system for regional policy. The analysis draws on all Polish evaluation studies conducted between 1999 and 2010, interviews with civil servants and experts involved in the implementation of cohesion policy programmes, as well as secondary data from earlier studies. The essay identifies key mechanisms and factors that determine the main function of evaluation as a learning tool that produces and utilises knowledge in the decision-making process.

In almost all policy contexts, however, heterogeneity among individuals matters not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. For example, providing both tolled and untolled alternatives allows those with high values of time to pay largely with money and those with low values of time to pay only with time. This paper extends the authors' (2009) integrated model of parking and traffic congestion in an isotropic downtown in steady state to treat heterogeneity in the value of time and parking duration. It develops the theory, and then presents an extended numerical example that applies the theory to several policy scenarios. With homogeneous individuals, underpricing curbside parking leads to wasteful cruising for parking. With heterogeneous individuals, however, curbside time limits can be used to ration out those with longer parking durations, so that cruising for parking is eliminated. With curbside parking time limits, underpricing curbside parking downtown may be a sound policy response to the free parking provided by suburban shopping centers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrasting different strategies for estimating TFP from plant-level production functions reveals that unobserved output prices bias true productivity and lead to underestimated agglomeration economies. With the corrected TFP measure, the largest impact is found for labor market pooling, which is captured by the correlation of the occupational composition between one county-industry and the rest of the county. This main result is robust, even when the spatial units are resized from counties to larger labor market regions. Input linkages appear to be relevant only at this larger regional scale. Overall, agglomeration economies differ substantially across industries. Only for a subset of industries, some positive evidence is detected for knowledge spillovers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We derive expressions of the marginal likelihood of the three models, which greatly simplify the model selection procedure. Simulation results suggest that the Bayesian estimates of high order spatial distributed lag coefficients are more precise than the maximum likelihood estimates. When the data is generated with a general declining pattern or a unimodal pattern for lag coefficients, the spatial Durbin error model can better capture the pattern than the SAR and the MESS models in most cases.

Hybrid DSGE models have become popular for dealing with some of the DSGE misspecifications as they are able to solve the trade-off between theoretical coherence and empirical fit. However, these models are still linear and they do not consider time variation for parameters. The time-varying properties in VAR or DSGE models capture the inherent nonlinearities and the adaptive underlying structure of the economy in a robust manner. In this article, we present a state-space time-varying parameter VAR model. Moreover, we focus on the DSGE-VAR that combines a microfounded DSGE model with the flexibility of a VAR framework. All the aforementioned models as well simple DSGEs and Bayesian VARs are used in a comparative investigation of their out-of-sample predictive performance regarding the US economy. The results indicate that while in general the classical VAR and BVARs provide with good forecasting results, in many cases the TVP-VAR and the DSGE-VAR outperform the other models.","[Bekiros, Stelios] EUI, Dept Econ, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [Paccagnini, Alessia] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Paccagnini, Alessia] EUI, Max Weber Programme, I-50014 Florence, Italy",European University Institute; University of Milano-Bicocca; European University Institute,"Bekiros, S (通讯作者)，EUI, Dept Econ, Via Piazzuola 43, I-50133 Florence, Italy.",stelios.bekiros@eui.eu; alessia.paccagnini@unimib.it,"Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726; Paccagnini, Alessia/0000-0002-2421-7242",,,,,77,13,13,1,32,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

A five-equation sequential structure in land use, financial contracts, house prices, rents and vacancy for 17 United States cities confirms geographical concentration. Coastal California and South Florida are fundamentally risky markets. Discount rates there are three percentage points higher than the sample median. Two percentage points are attributable to land use and the other to unconventional finance. National and international financial crises are highly concentrated regionally.","[Chinloy, Peter] American Univ, Kogod Sch Business 229, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Wiley, Jonathan A.] Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Dept Real Estate, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",American University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Wiley, JA (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Dept Real Estate, 35 Broad St,Ste 1408, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",chinloy@american.edu; jwiley@gsu.edu,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The key parameter comes from theconditional demand function for children's future earning capacity. Its identification rests on having data on siblings and assumptions about the timing of parents' knowledge of their children's endowments. In addition to sibling differences, the useof a fixed-effects instrumental-variables estimator identifies the parameter under weaker conditions. Empirical analysis informed by the model reveals a negative and significant effect on the child's educational attainment of the months of the mother's full-time employment when the child was aged 0-5. The effect of the mother's part-time employment is smaller and less well determined, but again negative. These results suggest that the substitution effect of the mother's employment dominates the income effects. Stronger adverse effects are found for children of less-educated mothers.

Due to the burgeoning trend of free trade agreements around the world, tariffication has also been popular among Asian economies. By utilising a duopoly model with heterogeneous products, this paper compares the efficiency of three tariffication schemes: a quota is converted into an import-volume-equivalent tariff, import-price-equivalent tariff or profit-equivalent tariff. It is found that tariffication always increases the world welfare no matter which equivalent tariff is adopted by the domestic government. This result echoes the spirit of tariffication proposed by the WTO and explains why more and more countries are using tariffs instead of nontariff barriers. If we further assume that the quota rent equals the tariff revenue, the domestic welfare will also increase after tariffication. By contrast, the domestic firm's profit can be higher or lower after tariffication, depending on the tariffication schemes. Finally, the foreign firm is always worse off.","[Hwang, Hong] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hwang, Hong] Acad Sinica, RCHSS, Taipei, Taiwan; [Peng, Cheng-Hau] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchuang, Taiwan; [Wu, Hsiu-Ling] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Fu Jen Catholic University; Soochow University,"Hwang, H (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,"Hwang, Hong/0000-0001-5103-8947; Peng, Cheng-Hau/0000-0002-7522-7002",,,,,17,3,3,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2013,36.0,7,,,SI,,899,911,,10.1111/twec.12048,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,182NN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321750400005,0

The contribution of different sub-groups is further decomposed to show the role of continuing plants vis-a-vis reallocations in output shares. TFP is calculated using system GMM estimation. Taking into account the smaller initial size of the foreign-owned sector in 1997, foreign-owned plants contributed relatively more to aggregate productivity growth than UK-owned plants over the period. This strong performance is mostly the result of reallocations of output shares towards high productivity continuing plants and the opening of high productivity plants.","[Harris, Richard] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England; [Moffat, John] Swansea Univ, Dept Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Durham University; Swansea University,"Harris, R (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England.",,,"Harris, Richard/0000-0001-8066-3629; Moffat, John/0000-0002-9529-1749",,,,,46,9,9,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2013,36.0,6,,,,,713,736,,10.1111/twec.12059,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,168LP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320707600003,0

These models generally estimate the mean or 85th-percentile speed of free-flow vehicles as a function of the geometric design elements, traffic control, or other features present along the roadway. Models for measures of speed dispersion (e.g., standard deviation of speed) have been considered in more recent research. There are differing viewpoints concerning the inclusion of the posted speed limit as an independent variable in operating speed models. Some have excluded posted speed limit from operating speed prediction models, indicating that it was highly correlated with the geometric design elements also included as independent variables in the model. The other viewpoint is that the posted speed limit logically influences operating speeds, and should therefore be included in speed prediction models. This paper explores this issue using an econometric modeling approach, considering irrelevant variables, multicollinearity, omitted variable bias, and endogeneity bias. The results suggest that the posted speed limit should be treated as an exogenous variable in models of operating speed, including models of speed magnitude and speed dispersion.

This study explains why negotiations to harmonize migration policies are taking place, why now, and how this is happening in a way that contradicts previous assumptions. It highlights a number of facts and explanatory factors largely neglected by the existing literature, such as: (1) instable political contexts in which social inequality, marginalization, and discontent call attention to socio-political issues and prompt state attempts to regulate human mobility cooperatively; (2) regional leadership that is not simply based on relative power and economic interests but on ideologically-loaded political projects and key actors who forge and legitimize a post-neoliberal consensus linking domestic and foreign policy strategies; (3) policy networks of private and public actors whose ideas inform top policy-makers discourses and contribute to the processes of socialization of policy elites, construction of shared understandings, and cultivation of cooperative practices that feed regional integration. The findings and conclusions shed light on the interplay between domestic politics and foreign policy, as well as the processes of coalition- and identity-building that are allowing South American governments to expand cooperation in a piecemeal and somewhat inconsistent fashion.","Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Margheritis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",,,"Margheritis, Ana/0000-0001-8126-4478",,,,,58,25,28,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The specific goals are to (a) document certain pre- and postcrisis trends in the nation's economic landscape, (b) estimate a series of simple income capitalization models aimed at weighing the relative importance of household income versus amenities in the aftermath of the recession, (c) examine the present state of the plane of living that households navigate when choosing where to live, and (d) posit an observation for public and private policy. The analysis considers the role of both natural and human amenities and, holding those factors constant, evaluates the extent to which the influence of income has waxed and waned over the course of the 2000 to 2010 decade. A key finding is that through the crisis the value of the contemporary plane of living, measured as the difference between 2007 and 2010, fell dramatically in major parts of the country.","[Carruthers, John I.] George Washington Univ, Sustainable Urban Planning Program, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Mulligan, Gordon F.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ USA",George Washington University; University of Arizona,"Carruthers, JI (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Sustainable Urban Planning Program, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",jic@gwu.edu,,"Mulligan, Gordon/0000-0003-0485-0144",,,,,64,2,2,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Participation in markets for real estate, capital, and ships was considerable, not only among middling and elite groups but also among the poor. Large households were most active in markets, incurring significantly greater debt. Poor households with a low supply of labour were relatively active, purchasing houses and ships, and incurring debts, possibly in order to cope with a lack of parental support. Middling-group households with a low supply of labour primarily sold houses and invested in the capital market, adjusting capital assets to declining labour supply at the end of their life cycle, thus creating cash rents to be able to survive old age.","[De Moor, Tine; Zuijderduijn, Jaco] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"De Moor, T (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",t.demoor@uu.nl,"Zuijderduijn, Jaco/HPD-8142-2023","Zuijderduijn, Jaco/0000-0002-1296-008X; De Moor, Tine/0000-0002-9462-6404",,,,,44,7,7,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The financial crisis of 20082009 therefore sparked fears that foreign banks would remove their operations from their Central and East European markets because of a home bias' in lending. Such fears were predicated on the widely held beliefs that banks' loyalties lie with their home markets and that it is therefore desirable to protect domestic bank ownership to help combat an economic downturn. This essay casts doubt on the value of banking sector protectionism by comparing foreign and domestic bank behaviour in Central and Eastern Europe during the crisis. The essay finds no consistent relationship between domestic control and either limited economic vulnerability or countercyclical lending.","Univ Denver, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Epstein, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",,,,,,,,60,15,15,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,MAY 1,2013,65.0,3,,,SI,,528,547,,10.1080/09668136.2013.779453,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,121UN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317270000009,0

Fertility naturally plays an important role in population economics. However, the level of German fertility has decreased significantly from the 1900s. The paper documents and analyzes the long-term development trends. We identify three different explanatory approaches for the decline in fertility according to which the various articles of the Journal related to this area are categorized. The paper also investigates fertility studies published by the Journal since the beginning. It points out that several articles anticipated subsequent research directions in the area of population economics at an early stage. In addition, significant contributions were made to improve and develop existing knowledge and understanding.

Servants, remittances, and family welfare in eighteenth-century rural Europe",EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HOUSEHOLD FORMATION; SUBSISTENCE; MIGRATION; EXCHANGE; ECONOMY,"Life-cycle service was one of the characteristic aspects of the European marriage pattern. The majority of the children of labourers and peasants left the households of their parents during adolescence to acquire material resources and skills in preparation for marriage. While in service, adolescents could save part of their wages. As most of them worked in close geographical proximity to their family, children in service were also a potential source of income for their parents. This article studies the nature, frequency, and value of remittances from farm servants to their parents in three countries during the eighteenth century. Important differences emerge from this comparative study. Farm servants in Belgium and France frequently supported their parents from their earnings. In contrast, English labouring households could in most cases not rely on structural assistance from their unmarried adolescent children. I argue that ownership of land is instrumental in explaining these differences. The absence of land that could be passed on by inheritance operated as a check to intergenerational solidarity.","[Lambrecht, Thijs] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,,,,,,,,,94,4,5,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

It asks whether the EU is an appropriate template for ASEAN or whether, given the apparently unique circumstances of European integration and Southeast Asian regionalism, analogies between the two are counterproductive. Attempts, for example, to model ASEAN's Committee of Permanent Representatives (CPR) on the EU's Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper) throw into relief the latter's uniquely consensual modus operandi. Can this consensus be replicated by ASEAN simply by institutional mimesis? First, the EU's evolution is briefly outlined; second, ASEAN's institutional architecture is set in the context of the ASEAN Charter's innovations that most invite comparison with the EU; and third, the two organizations are compared by assessing a zone of discretion' between setting ambitious, but realistic, goals for ASEAN's greater integration and adopting structures that might be inappropriate to ASEAN.","[Murray, Philomena] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 2010, Australia; [Moxon-Browne, Edward] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",University of Melbourne; University of Limerick,"Murray, P (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, John Medley Bldg,Grattan St, Parkville, Vic 2010, Australia.",pbmurray@unimelb.edu.au,,"Murray, Philomena/0000-0003-1787-9456",,,,,44,16,17,2,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The practical difficulties in applying spatial econometric models include the specification of the spatial weight matrix (SWM), which affects the final analysis results. Some simulation studies suggest that information criteria such as AIC are useful for the SWM's selection, but if many model candidates exist (e.g., when the selections of explanatory variables are performed simultaneously), then the computational burden of calculating such criteria for each model is large. The present study develops an automatic model selection algorithm using the technique of reversible jump MCMC combined with simulated annealing; termed trans-dimensional simulated annealing (TDSA). The performance of the TDSA algorithm is verified using the well-known Boston housing dataset, and it is applied empirically to a Japanese real estate dataset The obtained results suggest a two-step strategy for model selection, with SWM (W) first, followed by the explanatory variables (X and WX), will result in local optima, and therefore these variables should be selected simultaneously. The TDSA algorithm can find the significant variables that are hidden because of multicollinearity in the unrestricted model, and can attain the minimum AIC automatically. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The first phase corresponded largely to the period between 1897 and 1911, when they proposed different explanations of the interaction between interest and prices, and incorporated aspects of each other's approaches into their own respective frameworks. This was followed by Wicksell's extended criticism of Fisher's compensated dollar plan and his bewilderment at its apparent lack of relation with the quantity theory of money (19121919). Finally, especially after Wicksell's death, Fisher came to support a significant part of Wicksell's monetary policy proposals, particularly in connection with the Swedish stabilisation experiment in the early 1930s. Fisher and Wicksell were both heirs of Bohm-Bawerk's interest theory, but interpreted and criticised the Austrian from different perspectives, which helps to explain the differences in their approaches to monetary dynamics.","Univ Brasilia, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Boianovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",mboianovsky@gmail.com,,,,,,,74,9,10,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

In practice, nowcasting a low-frequency variable with a large number of high-frequency indicators should account for at least two data irregularities: (i) unbalanced data with missing observations at the end of the sample due to publication delays; and (ii) different sampling frequencies of the data. Two model classes suited in this context are factor models based on large datasets and mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) regressions with few predictors. The specification of these models requires several choices related to, amongst other things, the factor estimation method and the number of factors, lag length and indicator selection. Thus there are many sources of misspecification when selecting a particular model, and an alternative would be pooling over a large set of different model specifications. We evaluate the relative performance of pooling and model selection for nowcasting quarterly GDP for six large industrialized countries. We find that the nowcast performance of single models varies considerably over time, in line with the forecasting literature. Model selection based on sequential application of information criteria can outperform benchmarks. However, the results highly depend on the selection method chosen. In contrast, pooling of nowcast models provides an overall very stable nowcast performance over time.

We develop a new test of localization considering space as continuous. Our test relies on a measure of divergence in the space of density distributions that allows us to assess whether or not the density distribution of bilateral distances between all pairs of plants within an industry significantly departs from randomness. We improve the test proposed by Duranton and Overman (2005), which proves to be biased with respect to the number of plants in the industry under scrutiny. Our test does not suffer from such a bias. This property is crucial for the French case where industrial concentrations of service and manufacturing industries drastically differ. With this distance-based method, we highlight some distinctive locational features of service industries that have not been mentioned in the literature so far. We show that: 1/service industries diverge more often from randomness than manufacturing industries, 2/a majority of diverging service industries are localized at very short distances (less than 4 km) whereas a majority of manufacturing industries are localized at longer distances or even dispersed, 3/within a majority of service industries, the largest plants appear localized at shorter distances than other plants, 4/within most service industries, incoming plants reduce localization whereas exiting plants reinforce it over the period 1996-2005.

Our proof is non-constructive and uses the probabilistic method.","[Brandt, Felix] Tech Univ Munich, D-80290 Munich, Germany; [Chudnovsky, Maria] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Kim, Ilhee; Liu, Gaku; Seymour, Paul] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Norin, Sergey] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Scott, Alex] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Thomasse, Stephan] Univ Montpelier 2, Montpellier, France",Technical University of Munich; Columbia University; Princeton University; McGill University; University of Oxford; Universite de Montpellier,"Seymour, P (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",pds@math.princeton.edu,"Scott, Alex/JWO-7815-2024; Brandt, Felix/JQJ-3604-2023","Seymour, Paul/0000-0003-0067-4534; Chudnovsky, Maria/0000-0002-8920-4944","Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [0901075, 1001091] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),,,12,13,14,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2013,40.0,3,,,,,739,743,,10.1007/s00355-011-0638-y,0.0,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,072HX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313662000006,0

A generalized linear mixed modeling framework is used to evaluate height and body mass index (BMI) as both levels and annualized growth in a pooled sample. Contemporary US schoolchildren show income variation in height that is significant but modest at around .1 cm (in kindergarten) to A cm (eighth grade) increases per doubling of income. An exception is found for Hispanic children who show faster height velocity associated with higher income through childhood yielding a 1.0 cm increase per doubling of income by the eighth grade. All groups except black males show a negative relationship between income and BMI that becomes stronger with age with an average .8 kg/m(2) lower BMI per doubling of income by the eighth grade. These results are robust to the inclusion of baseline anthropometric controls. The analysis suggests that higher-income US schoolchildren enter mid-adolescence as taller but with lower proportional body mass relative to their lower-income counterparts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Two related processes contribute to this specialization: globalization and fragmentation of production. Hence, this article asks the following question: Can an industry centered on one part of the production cycle become sustainable? This article examines an innovation-based cluster: the life sciences industry in Israel. This industry is based on innovative companies, with strong ties to university research. A majority of companies in Israel are small and focus on R&D. Following a series of in-depth interviews, site visits, and a survey, this article strengthens the perception that innovation can be the basis of an industry, but it may not be sufficient for sustainability. To achieve further development and regional growth, companies require additional factors in the form of other companies at different stages of production, which are supported by policy, funding, and expertise.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Breznitz, SM (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, 685 Cherry St, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",shiri.breznitz@pubpolicy.gatech.edu,,,,,,,98,8,10,2,59,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

So the crisis had an enormous potential for deteriorating further the global image of the United States, already at an all-time high during the George W. Bush era. Yet anti-American sentiments did not surge worldwide as a result of the crisis, neither at the level of public opinion, nor at the level of actions and policy responses by foreign policy-makers. This article explains why the dog did not bark and reawaken anti-Americanism in the process. The central argument is that this potential anti-Americanism has been mitigated by several factors, including the election of Obama, the new face of globalization, and the perception of the relative decline of US power coupled with the rise of China, which suggests that the post-American world may be accompanied by a post anti-American world, at least in Europe.","[Meunier, Sophie] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Meunier, Sophie] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University,"Meunier, S (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,"Meunier, Sophie/0000-0003-1866-7308",,,,,86,10,10,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The empirical evidence highlights the nature of causal relationships, if any, between domestic travel and tourism spending, internal travel and tourism consumption, the gross domestic product annual growth rate and the real exchange rate. The paper uses the cointegration method and Granger causality analysis based on the vector error correction model (VECM) and impulse functions. The findings suggest that there are Granger causality relationships running from tourism expansion to economic growth, which sustains the tourism-led growth hypothesis (TLGH). These results emphasize the need for more consistent tourism development plans and strategies to be implemented at national and regional levels by the governmental authorities.","[Surugiu, Camelia] Natl Inst Res & Dev Tourism, Bucharest 050741, Romania; [Surugiu, Camelia] Univ Bucharest, Fac Adm & Business, Bucharest, Romania; [Surugiu, Marius Razvan] Romanian Acad, Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest; Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Surugiu, C (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Res & Dev Tourism, 17 Apolodor St,Sect 5, Bucharest 050741, Romania.",cameliasurugiu@gmail.com; mariussurigu@yahoo.com,"Surugiu, Marius-Razvan/F-7771-2010; Surugiu, Camelia/C-6641-2015","Surugiu, Marius-Razvan/0000-0002-9599-4540; Surugiu, Camelia/0000-0002-0393-4015",,,,,93,58,58,1,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

It is supposed that there are several objects of the same type (containers, persons etc.) to be transported on the graph from their origins to their destinations at the same time. Any object can pass its route alone or can join some other(s) for passing some segments of the graph together. The cost of joint passing a segment is smaller than the sum of individual passing. In an extreme case, the cost of the joint passing equals to the cost of the individual one. Moreover, the limit of joined objects for transportation together is given. The goal is to find such routes for all objects that minimize the total cost. In the paper, several particular cases are studied where all objects have the same destination or the same origin. Two main approaches to the solution are analyzed. First, several models based on flows on graphs with costs are discussed and afterwards linear programming models are presented. These problems can be met in practice e. g. in travelling of pupils to schools, of employees to work or of football referees to matches.","[Cerny, Jan; Pribyl, Vladimir] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Management, Dept Exact Methods, Jindrichuv Hradec 37701, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,cerny@fm.vse.cz; pribyl@fm.vse.cz,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,0,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,113,116,,,,,,4,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000020,0

To address this question, we develop a new approach to determine to which extent price differences stem from limited participation in cross-border trade. We derive a theoretical integration benchmark, using Grossman's (1976) notion of a rational expectations equilibrium. We compare the benchmark to data from European electricity markets.

A group of consumers of publishing goods, who at the same time, consume and produce, are referred to as readers. In the process of reading, reading comprehension strategies are in the hands of a reader, his or hers cultural, educational and intellectual development and socially responsible book publishing is built upon knowledge of reading comprehension strategies. Besides automatic processes of word recognition, successful reading also requires continuous supervision of the degree of understanding of what was read as well as regulation of the process of reading in the direction of set goals and through usage of reading comprehension strategies. Reading comprehension strategies are processes the reader uses in order to deeply understand the text. The main characteristic of reading strategies is that they are used deliberately and consciously and that they are under reader's control. This paper will introduce the 4-Pronged Comprehension Strategy Framework (McNamara, 2007.), which will help represent main characteristics of main reading strategies, their interaction and dynamic. The 4-Pronged Comprehension Strategy Framework consists of Monitoring Comprehension and Reading strategies in the center of the framework and four categories of strategies that comprise the prongs of the framework, including: a) Preparing to read, b) Interpreting Words, Sentences and Ideas in Text, c) Going beyond the Text and d) Organizing, Restructuring, and Synthesizing Information in the Text. This paper provides guidelines for socially responsible book publishing, which are based on knowledge about reading comprehension strategies. The book publisher who aids the reader to develop and self-actualize through usage of known elements of reading comprehension strategies when producing a book, is considered to be socially responsible book publisher.","[Horvat, Jasna; Mijoc, Josipa] Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Ljevak, Petra] Naklada Ljevak Doo, CRO-10000 Zagreb, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Horvat, J (通讯作者)，Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",jasna@efos.hr; petra.ljevak@naklada-ljevak.hr; jmijoc@efos.hr,"Horvat, Jasna/AAC-5827-2022; Mijoč, Josipa/J-9969-2018","Horvat, Jasna/0000-0001-9665-1470;",,,,,12,1,1,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,390,397,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400045,0

Surprisingly, decreasing relative risk aversion of any order up to N in the sense of Pratt (Econometrica 32:122-136, 1964) coupled with decreasing relative risk aversion in the sense of Ross (Econometrica 49:631-638, 1981) are sufficient to guarantee an increase in local risk aversion after any deterioration of the multiplicative background risk thanks to the Nth-degree stochastic dominance.

Previous studies have shown that popular VaR independence testing procedure by Christoffersen, Markov tests, exhibits low power, which constitutes a particularly serious problem in case of finite-sample settings. In the paper, as an alternative to the popular Markov test, we presented the overview of the group of duration-based VaR backtesting procedures. We calculated p-values and explored statistical properties of the tests rejecting a non-realistic assumption of infinite sample size. Specifically Monte Carlo test technique was adopted to provide exact tests, in which we replaced asymptotic distributions with simulated finite sample distributions. Monte Carlo study based on GARCH model was also designed to investigate power of the tests. Through the comparative analysis we found that, in the context of power property, the duration-based approach was superior to Markov test.","[Malecka, Marta] Univ Lodz, Dept Stat Methods, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Malecka, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Stat Methods, Rewolucji 1905 R 41-43, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland.",marta.malecka@uni.lodz.pl,"Małecka, Marta/IQS-4345-2023",,,,,,14,1,1,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-52-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,91,98,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367243900011,0

Problems in the financial (banking) system may occur if systemic risks, especially credit risk, are not properly managed. In this situation, the financial instability/crisis has a large negative impact on economic activity. Non-performing loans (NPLs) are one of the commonly used indicators of credit risk which, at the system level, show cyclical behavior. The aim of this paper is to identify the structure of time lags of the most important macroeconomic determinants of non-performing loans in the Czech Republic using a linear regression model. The main determinants of NPLs used in the model are its lagged value, real economic growth, inflation, exchange rate and lending rates. Estimation results suggest that non-performing loans are medium persistent and that the lag length of its main determinants ranges from two to seven quarters.","[Melecky, Ales; Sulganova, Monika] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Econ Fac, Dept Econ, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,ales.melecky@vsb.cz; monika.sulganova@vsb.cz,"Melecky, Ales/HNP-2751-2023; Melecky, Ales/AAZ-1918-2020","Melecky, Ales/0000-0002-4495-6296",,,,,12,0,0,0,7,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,612,617,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000104,0

We find that oil market supply side, speculative, preferences, and volatility shocks exercised recessionary effects during the first and second Persian Gulf War and 2008 oil price episodes. As long as oil supply will keep expanding at a slower pace than required by demand conditions, and in so far as the recently passed regulatory provisions aimed at controlling financial speculation in the oil (and other commodities) futures market will prove unsuccessful, a recessionary bias, determined by higher and more uncertain real oil prices, may then be expected to persist also in the near future.","[Morana, Claudio] Univ Milano Bicocca, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Morana, Claudio] CeRP Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy; [Morana, Claudio] FEEM, Milan, Italy; [Morana, Claudio] ICER, Turin, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; Fondazione Mattei,"Morana, C (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",claudio.morana@unimib.it,"Morana, Claudio/F-1680-2013","MORANA, CLAUDIO/0000-0001-8624-3158",Fondazione ENI Enrico Mattei (Financial Speculation in the Oil Market project); MIUR (PRIN project),"Fondazione ENI Enrico Mattei (Financial Speculation in the Oil Market project); MIUR (PRIN project)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Italy, 20126; (+39) 0264483091; CeRP-Collegio Carlo Alberto (Moncalieri, Italy); Fondazione ENI Enrico Mattei (FEEM, Milano); International Centre for Economic Research (ICER, Torino).

These countries have similar historical destiny but the economic transition led to new labour market institutions. Labour market outcomes are thus quite different in the last decades. Using a small closed DSGE model with search and matching frictions, the main structural labour market differences among these countries are revealed. These differences are related to the changes in separation rates, matching efficiency, match elasticity of unemployed and the bargaining power of the workers. The models are identified using Bayesian techniques. Comparing the moments of simulated data, we can conclude that the estimated models are able to replicate the main statistical properties of the observed data. The labour market in Hungary seems to be the most flexible regarding the labour market dynamics in the light of the nascent economic recovery. On the other hand, all examined economies are similar to the extent of the low wage bargaining power of the workers.","[Nemec, Daniel] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,nemecd@econ.muni.cz,"Němec, Daniel/H-2909-2013","Němec, Daniel/0000-0003-3065-8287",,,,,7,5,5,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,661,666,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000112,0

An important example of a problem in this class is quadratic maximization with a positive semidefinite matrix. The benefit of this special case is that if the projection of the hypercube is singular, then the number of examined extremal points (vertices) of the hypercube is reduced. The projection of the hypercube is actually a well-known geometric structure a - zonotope - and the presented case of convex maximization is reduced to the vertex enumeration problem for the zonotope. The main result of this paper is an implementation of a recent compact output-polynomial algorithm for vertex enumeration problem for zonotopes and its comparison with the well-known Reverse search algorithm. Both algorithms share the same theoretical properties: output-polynomiality ensures that every vertex will be examined in time polynomial in the output size, and compactness allows us to solve the problem without the necessity to store already examined vertices. The experiments show that the recent method outperforms the Reverse Search algorithm.","[Rada, Miroslav; Cerny, Michal] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 13068 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,miroslav.rada@vse.cz; cernym@vse.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,761,766,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000129,0

Due to data limitations, some recent studies of the market impact of index investment in the WTI crude oil futures market impute index positions. We investigate the accuracy of the algorithm popularized by Masters (2008) to estimate index positions. The estimates generated by the Masters algorithm deviate substantially from the positions reported in the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Index Investment Data (IID) report-the agency's best data on index positions. The Masters algorithm over-estimates the gross WTI crude oil position by an average of 142,000 contracts. Importantly, the deviation in the first half of 2008, the period of greatest concern about the market impact of index investment, is directionally wrong.

It was also approved as a coincident indicator within the context of The Rational Expectation Permanent Income Hypothesis (REPIH) because of its ability to predict future income. Although the conception of REPIH was already rejected on UK data, the significance of confidence indicator for explanation of GDP or consumer expenditures variability was accepted. For the analyses of significance of confidence indicator for prediction consumption spending in European territory EU harmonized consumer confidence indicator is used. The estimation are made with panel data from selected EU member countries: Czech Republic, Slovakia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Belgium. According to the common harmonized system of consumer tendency survey managed by the European Commission the time series of indicators are fully comparable across the countries. The wide range of countries was selected to show the sensitivity of the effect of consumer confidence indicator on consumption expenditures in different economic environment.

This paper explores possible mechanisms for that correlation in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). We find that maternal employment is associated with working mothers spending, per day, 4 fewer minutes grocery shopping, 17 fewer minutes cooking, 10 fewer minutes eating with children, 12 fewer minutes playing with children, 4 fewer minutes supervising children, and 37 fewer minutes caring for children. The differences tend to be greatest for mothers with young children (age 0-5 years). We explore the extent to which these findings differ by day of the week, whether a partner or spouse is present in the household, whether the mother works non-standard hours, and socioeconomic status. Only a small percentage (about 15%) of the fewer minutes spent in these activities by working mothers appears to be offset by increases in time by husbands and partners. These findings suggest plausible mechanisms for the association between maternal employment and childhood obesity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Under these circumstances, operators must find innovative ways to make public transportation attractive to broader segments of the public, while simultaneously trying to raise revenue to reduce reliance on public subsidies. Development of commercial partnerships is seen as a promising way to achieve these goals. Previous research has examined the potential of using geodemographics to assist transit agencies in the task of identifying potential partners for developing mutually beneficial commercial agreements. In this paper we describe an approach to model isoexposure to transit users as a tool to assess market potential. The approach is based on the analysis of walking behavior of transit users, and specifically distance walked at the end of their transit trip. Spatial modeling is used to geographically project estimates of walking distance for a desired demographic profile at a specific transit facility. After expanding the estimates using sample weights, overlays of these estimates can be used to generate variations in exposure to transit travelers at different locations in space. The approach is demonstrated using the case of Metro users in Montreal, Canada. The case study demonstrates the use of isoexposure profiles as a novel approach to generate marketing intelligence. This should be of interest to transit agencies and businesses interested in developing partnerships. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A stated preference experiment is designed to capture the data of sub-urban train mode choice behavior. The behavioral data are analyzed using different modeling techniques such as multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit (ML). In ML model, the random parameters are assumed to follow constrained triangular distribution, where mean equals its spread. The decomposition of preference heterogeneity around the mean estimate of random parameter is also investigated using ML model. The study shows the influence of headway time and train ride time associated with a particular crowding level (expressed in density of standing passengers/m(2)) in choosing the sub-urban train mode by calculating their willingness-to-pay (WTP) values and highlights the importance of WTP for addressing policy issues in the reduction of in-vehicle crowding level. The present study documents new findings of the effect of crowding level on train ride time in the context of a developing country and suggests some important directions for future suburban train transport crowding valuation research.

If requiring comprehensive reforms, EU accession negotiations offer domestic actors a legitimacy standard, external constraints and a focal point for electoral coalitions as resources in the domestic political arena. The Turkish case serves as a hypothesis-generating case study suggesting that domestic actors who are disadvantaged in domestic resources in these dimensions embrace EU accession, whereas domestic actors who feel threatened in their domestic resources adopt an opposite strategy. It will be demonstrated that the two major Turkish political parties adopted a costbenefit calculus in their position towards EU accession. The Turkish case is particularly intriguing because the positions adopted by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP), respectively, have been counter-intuitive, and in fact both parties have drastically reversed earlier positions towards EU accession and done so in disregard of the preferences of their core electorate.","Bogazici Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Baudner, J (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",j_baudner@hotmail.com,,,,,,,33,7,8,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The crisis from August 2007 to date can be divided into three main phases: the financial turmoil from August 2007 to the collapse of Lehman Brothers; the global financial crisis from September 2008 until spring 2010; and the eurozone sovereign debt crisis from spring 2010 to the current period. While each phase has brought significant challenges, the current sovereign debt crisis has been the most critical stage for the eurozone. It has brought unprecedented challenges for the monetary union and triggered extraordinary adjustments in both monetary policy and institutional arrangements at the eurozone level. The purpose of this article is to outline the features of each crisis phase, to describe the actions taken by the European Central Bank (ECB) during each phase and to explain the rationale for such measures. It also discusses the need to strengthen further the economic union in order to guarantee the sustainability of the monetary union of the eurozone. In this respect, it is argued that the recent institutional adjustments made at the European Union level would have been necessary independently of the financial crisis.","[Durre, Alain; Mongelli, Francesco Paolo] European Cent Bank, IESEG Sch Management, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Durre, Alain] CNRS, LEM, F-75700 Paris, France; [Mongelli, Francesco Paolo] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-6000 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; IESEG School of Management; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Mongelli, FP (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, IESEG Sch Management, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",francesco.drudi@ecb.europa.eu; alain.durre@ecb.europa.eu; francesco.mongelli@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,29,47,49,0,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of diverse factors on drivers' guidance compliance behaviors under road condition information shown on graphic variable message sign (VMS), and based on this to find out a better information release mode. The involved data were obtained from questionnaire survey, and ordinal regression was used to analyze the casual relation between guidance compliance behavior and its influencing factors. Based on an overall analysis of conditions in driver's route choice, an accurate method was proposed to calculate the compliance rate. The model testing information indicated that ordinal regression model with complementary log-log being the link function was appropriate to quantify the relation between the compliance rate and the factors. The estimation results showed that age, driving years, average annual mileage, monthly income, driving style, occupation, the degree of trust in VMS, the familiarity with road network and the route choice style were significant determinants of guidance compliance behavior. This paper also compared two different guidance modes which were ordinary guidance mode (M1) and predicted guidance mode (M2) through simulation. The average speed fluctuations and average travel time supported that M2 had better effect in improving traffic flow and balancing traffic load and resource. Some detailed suggestions of releasing guidance information were proposed with the explanation by flow-density curve and variation of traffic flows. These findings are the foundation to design and improve guidance systems by assessing guidance effect and modifying guidance algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Multinomial logit results indicate that REITs with higher market leverage or lower market-to-book ratios are more likely to cut dividends, suspend dividends or pay elective stock dividends. These results imply that mitigating going-concern risk is an important motive for REITs adjusting dividend policies during the crisis and support dividend catering theory where investor demand for dividends impacts corporate dividend policies. Moreover, REITs that cut or suspend dividends experience positive cumulative abnormal returns during the post-announcement period after controlling for the potential influence from simultaneous funds from operation announcements. The positive market response over the post-announcement period supports the notion that dividend decisions convey information to investors and is also consistent with the broad catering theory of dividend policy.","[Case, Brad] NAREIT, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Hardin, William G., III; Wu, Zhonghua] Florida Int Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Case, B (通讯作者)，NAREIT, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",bcase@nareit.com; hardinw@fiu.edu; wuz@fiu.edu,,,,,,,33,19,24,2,43,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2012,40.0,3,,,,,387,421,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2011.00324.x,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,996KV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308086900001,0

Although this is a well-known principle of orthodox decision theory and central to conventional economic modelling, it has been questioned on grounds suggested by non-expected utility models of choice under risk and by the psychology of affective influences on risk-taking. Our experimental design, which provides between-subjects tests of separability using three treatments in which the history preceding a decision is manipulated, is inspired by these concerns. We expose separability to a clean and harsh test, but find no evidence that it is violated.","[Cubitt, Robin; Starmer, Chris] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Ruiz-Martos, Maria] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Nottingham; University of Warwick,"Cubitt, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Sir Clive Granger Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",Robin.Cubitt@nottingham.ac.uk,"Starmer, Chris/K-8891-2018; Ruiz Martos, Maria J./R-9841-2018","Ruiz Martos, Maria J./0000-0002-2339-9654",,,,,30,2,2,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2012,73.0,2,,,,,185,202,,10.1007/s11238-010-9233-4,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,969RI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306073300001,0

The model is estimated by maximum likelihood using cohort data where individuals are observed from birth to the middle of their working life. These data are unique in that they include cognitive skills test scores collected as early as age 7. We then investigate how alternative policies foster educational enrolment. In particular, we simulate the effect of two subsidies different in the timing of disbursement. The first consists of grants assigned directly to individuals aged between 16 and 18. The second is assigned to the parents earlier on, when the cohort is still in its childhood. The latter subsidy affects cognitive skills accumulation and in turn educational choices. Our results suggest that a grant fosters enrolment at the lowest cost but the parental income subsidy generates more welfare as measured by a class of social welfare functions. Nevertheless, these differences in costs and welfare are small. Overall, the results reinforce the view that government investments in cognitive skill accumulation during childhood are worthwhile. However, the results also indicate that such investments should be well structured to ensure a high return.

The growth accounting exercise is based on a multivariate structural time series model which combines the decomposition of total output according to the production function approach with price and wage equations that embody Phillips-type relationships linking inflation and nominal wage dynamics to the output gap and cyclical unemployment, respectively. Assuming a Cobb-Douglas technology with constant returns to scale, potential output results from the combination of the trend levels of total factor productivity (TFP) and factor inputs, capital and labour (hours worked), which is decomposed into labour intensity (average hours worked), the employment rate, the participation rate and population of working age. The nominal variables (prices and wages) play an essential role in defining the trend levels of the components of potential output, as the latter should pose no inflationary pressures on prices and wages. The structural model is further extended to allow for the estimation of potential output growth and the decomposition according to the sources of growth at different horizons (long run, medium run and short run); in particular, we propose and evaluate a model-based approach to the extraction of the low-pass component of potential output growth at different cut-off frequencies. The approach has two important advantages: the signal extraction filters have an automatic adaptation property at the boundaries of the sample period, so that the real-time estimates do not suffer from what is often referred to as the 'end-of-sample bias'. Secondly, it is possible to assess the uncertainty of potential output growth estimates with different degrees of smoothness.","[Musso, Alberto] European Cent Bank, Directorate Gen Econ, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Proietti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, SEF & ME Q, I-00133 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Musso, A (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Directorate Gen Econ, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",tommasoproietti@uniroma2.it; alberto.musso@ecb.int,,"Proietti, Tommaso/0000-0001-5285-7522",,,,,27,3,3,0,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper develops a framework for analyzing instruments that encourage drivers to internalize the full consequences of their behavior with respect to choice of speed using Pay-As-You-Speed (PAYS) insurance, possibly as an extension of Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) insurance. We demonstrate how the combination of a Pigovian taxation scheme and PAYS can be designed in a setting involving two principals (the state and an insurance company) that affect the incentives of commuters to choose between driving and other modes of transport and for those that use the car mode to drive carefully. While the government is assumed to maximize overall social efficiency and therefore wants to implement marginal cost pricing, insurance companies do actuarial pricing, i.e. average cost pricing within risk classes that are homogeneous to the degree that the insurers have information about actual behavior. PAYS insurance improves the insurance industry's possibility to differentiate premiums according to behavior and therefore to target risk classes in a better way than today. Moreover, since our framework is designed to accomplish differentiation by self-selection, compulsory regulation is not necessary, although there may be reason for the government to facilitate the implementation of the new technology.

The importance of the present work is to show the causes and effects of unemployment experienced in rural areas, and to give suggestions for its solution. An evaluation was made of the reasons for rural unemployment by means of empirical analysis at micro- and macro-level. The macro-level analysis was based on data from the Turkish Statistical Institute for the period 1989-2006. In this analysis, the causal relationship between rural unemployment and national and urban unemployment levels, GNP, and rates of growth in the agricultural, industrial and service sectors is investigated by time series analysis. The results showed a uni-directional causal relationship towards rural unemployment between urban and rural unemployment, and between national and rural unemployment. The micro-level analysis was performed with data obtained from a survey carried out in 2007. In micro-analysis, the factors influencing rural unemployment were estimated by the probit analysis model. According to the results obtained, the reasons for increasing rural unemployment were found in the size of households, longer distance between villages and the provincial capital, and poor income and social security. It is thought that this study taking Turkey as an example for the problems and suggested solutions of rural unemployment, can serve as a guide for similar studies in other countries.","[Adanacioglu, Hakan; Gumus, Sevtap Guler; Olgun, F.

Over the past quarter of a century, however, articles published in Work, Employment and Society have been at the forefront of re-reading the informal sector. This article reveals how this body of literature has shown informal economic activities to be a persistent and ubiquitous feature of the economic landscape, mapped the complex and variable dynamics of formal and informal work in different populations, transcended simplistic universal structure/agency explanations for the persistence of informal work by developing context-bound understandings, and challenged the formal/informal dichotomy which represents the formal and informal sectors as separate hostile worlds.

Depending on their motive for giving-e.g., warm glow, altruism, or guilt-the benefactors' response functions are either constant, decreasing, or increasing. If motives interact, or if envy is a concern, then more complex (unimodal) shapes may emerge. Controlling for random utility perturbations, we determine which and how many motives affect individual decision making. The main findings are that the motives of about 75% of the subjects can be identified fairly sharply, that all of the motives discussed in the literature co-exist in the population, and that for any given individual no more than two motives (out of six motives considered overall) are identified. We conclude that a unifying motive for solidarity cannot be derived even when we allow for individually heterogeneous parameterization: different subjects give for different reasons and all existing social preference theories are partially correct.","[Bolle, Friedel; Breitmoser, Yves] Europa Univ Viadrina, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany; [Heimel, Jana] IPR Inst, Stuttgart, Germany; [Vogel, Claudia] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland",European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder; University of Bern,"Bolle, F (通讯作者)，Europa Univ Viadrina, Postfach 1786, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany.",bolle@euv-frankfurt-o.de,,"Breitmoser, Yves/0000-0003-4993-6988",,,,,48,11,13,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2012,72.0,3,,,,,303,321,,10.1007/s11238-011-9285-0,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,885IJ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299772100002,0

On the other hand, we can notice a competitive disadvantage with the traditional markets supplying bluefin tuna, and with Spain in particular The same is reckoned with the Southern Mediterranean countries which, in the last years, have contributed to increasing the world supply thanks to the spread of mariculture systems.

This requires knowing how the value of time (VTT) will develop over time as incomes grow. This paper investigates if the cross-sectional income elasticity of the VTT is equal to inter-temporal income elasticity. The study is based on two identical stated choice experiments conducted with a 13 year interval. Results indicate that the relationship between income and the VTT in the cross-section has remained unchanged over time. As a consequence, the inter-temporal income elasticity of the VTT can be predicted based on cross-sectional income elasticity. However, the income elasticity of the VTT is not a constant but increases with income. For this reason, the average income elasticity of the VTT in the cross-sections has increased between the two survey years and can be expected to increase further over time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper develops an economic evolution model by examining the coupled dynamics of industry growth and interindustry structure. For each industry, its economic properties (mainly characterized by price and quantity) are incorporated into the model. The input-output relationships among different industries are described as input-output networks, in which nodes represent industries, and weights represent technological and economic constraints between pairing industries. By measuring the dynamic importance of each node, we find that all the nodes in the input-output networks have the same dynamic importance. On the basis of this empirical regularity and the rational expectation assumption, we show that the coupled dynamics of the economic properties of nodes and input-output networks can explain the evolutionary dynamics of national economies.","Zhejiang Normal Univ, Sch Business Adm, Jinhua 321004, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Normal University,"Duan, WQ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Normal Univ, Sch Business Adm, Jinhua 321004, Peoples R China.",wenqiduan@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [70701030],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author is very grateful to the anonymous referees for their helpful comments and constructive suggestions.

To this end, a tourism tax model (TTM), a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Australian economy, is developed explicitly incorporating two tourism sectors. This is an important improvement in modelling tourism in a CGE context. The tourism sectors are incorporated using the 'tourism dummy sector approach', in which both the demand and supply sides of tourism sectors are modelled adequately to reflect the true nature of tourism. This model is used to carry out simulations of abolishing tourism taxes which are financed by an increase in the GST (goods and services tax). The simulation results suggest that the tourism sector expands as a result of tax abolition, while the other sectors contract. The increase in the GST, on the other hand, leads to an increase in commodity prices and thus the economy suffers, as reflected in a reduction in GDP. Overall, the results show that these tax changes are contractionary, as reflected in real consumption and GDP.","[Ihalanayake, Ranjith] Victoria Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Fac Business & Law, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Ihalanayake, Ranjith] Victoria Univ, Ctr Strateg Econ Studies, Fac Business & Law, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",Victoria University; Victoria University,"Ihalanayake, R (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Fac Business & Law, Footscray Pk Campus,POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",Ranjith.lhalanayake@vu.edu.au,,,,,,,39,14,16,2,29,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Moreover, evaluations of forecast accuracy show that these inflation expectations are worse predictors of inflation than those of a professional forecasting institution and also typically outperformed by a simple autoregressive model.

This article develops a repeated game model that allows us to systematically investigate turn-taking behavior in many 2 x 2 games, including the battle of the sexes, the game of chicken, the game of common-pool-resources assignment, and a particular version of the prisoners' dilemma. We consider the turn taking with independent randomizations (TTIR) strategy that achieves three objectives: (a) helping the players reach the turn-taking path, (b) resolving the question of who takes the good turn first, and (c) deterring defection. We determine conditions under which there exists a unique TTIR strategy profile that can be supported as a subgame-perfect equilibrium. We also show that there exist conditions under which an increase in the degree of conflict of the stage game leads to a decrease in the expected number of periods in reaching the turn-taking path.","[Lau, Sau-Him Paul] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Mui, Vai-Lam] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of Hong Kong; Monash University,"Lau, SHP (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",laushp@hku.hk; Vai-Lam.Mui@BusEco.Monash.edu.au,,"Mui, Vai-Lam/0000-0001-7079-5142",,,,,17,19,20,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2012,72.0,2,,,,,167,188,,10.1007/s11238-011-9249-4,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,885JC,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299774200002,0

We argue that in the absence of banks and state agencies involved in the supply of credit, entrepreneurs' access to credit was determined by two interrelated factors. The first was the quality of property rights protection and the extent to which properties could be used as collateral. The second was the level of interest in borrowing money at the time as well as such borrowing compared with the interest rates on risk-free investments. For our case study, the small town of Edam and its hinterland, De Zeevang, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, we demonstrate that properties were used as collateral on a large scale and that interest rates on both small and large loans were relatively low (about 6 percent). As a result, many households (whether headed by men or women) owned financial assets and/or debts, and the degree of financial sophistication was relatively high.","[Van Zanden, Jan Luiten; Zuijderduijn, Jaco; De Moor, Tine] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Van Zanden, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.l.vanzanden@uu.nl; c.j.zuijderduijn@uu.nl; t.demoor@uu.nl,"Zuijderduijn, Jaco/HPD-8142-2023","Zuijderduijn, Jaco/0000-0002-1296-008X; De Moor, Tine/0000-0002-9462-6404",,,,,46,31,33,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Challenging this popular view, this study shows that Ordoliberalism also had considerable impact on Spanish economics during the 19405 and 1950s, despite the fact that Spain's policy establishment favoured a State-led and predominantly antiliberal development model. This puzzling outcome was the result of the exceptional ideational entrepreneurship of Ordoliberal economist Heinrich von Stackelberg, who was a visiting professor in Madrid from 1943 until his death in 1946. His intellectual entrepreneurship in the Spanish economic profession proved to have lasting consequences, as the policy-oriented intellectuals he influenced came to occupy leading positions in academia and economic policy institutions. This paper also contributes to the empirical literature on the diffusion of economic ideas across national epistemic boundaries by highlighting the role of exceptional economists acting as carriers of new economic ideas. Finally, the study helps illuminate a critical juncture in the intellectual history of Spanish economics during the Francoist regime.","Boston Univ, Dept Int Relat, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Ban, C (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Int Relat, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ban@bu.edu,"Ban, Cornel/P-4757-2019",,,,,,71,10,10,0,6,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Using a simple two-period game theoretical model, we derive a closed-form pricing equation for a presale contract that explicitly accounts for a developer's abandonment option and a buyer's default option. Although a developer has an abandonment option under either a spot sale or a presale method, the option is more valuable under a presale contract because of an additional cash inflow from the presale downpayment. A presale also provides a buyer a default option, which is valuable in a real estate market with uncertain demand and price risk. We analyze the implications of the abandonment option on a developer's construction decision and choice of selling method, as well as the implications of the default option on a buyer's purchase decision.

Our analysis generalizes the standard hedonic model to account for the option value of reconfiguring hedonic characteristics. We test this model with over 162,000 real estate transactions in 53 towns in Connecticut between 1994 and 2007 by adding a non-linear intensity variable, which increases with the aggregate value of structure and decreases with land value. A conservative estimate is that about 20% of towns have significantly positive option value, with a mean value of 29-34% for properties most similar to vacant land. Multiple tests across towns support predictions of real options theory. Positive option value towns have higher house price volatility and estimated option value varies positively with price volatility, a finding inconsistent with NPV theory. We also find positive association between option value and drift in house prices and a U-shape relation with house price adjusted for structural characteristics.

Valpovo is a town in eastern Croatia which is located in Osijek-Baranja County. This town is still facing with such problems as lack of job opportunities, concentration of low-income families, inadequate public infrastructure and depopulation, which is becoming an increasing problem in Valpovo. One of the attempts to improve the economical circumstances in the town was the establishment of the entrepreneurial zones in Valpovo. These zones are comprised of a small enterprise zone, a business and an industrial zone. Statistical methods are used in order to investigate the influence of entrepreneurial zones of town of Valpovo on its urban competitiveness. Urban competitiveness is the ability of an urban area to use the factors of competitiveness in order to make a competitive position and maintain it among other urban areas. Urban competitiveness is often closely related to a town or city's economic performance, which is the viewpoint applied by the authors. Thus measurement of competitiveness is accomplished by measuring its economic competitiveness, which is being determined through variables of town's overall revenues, its revenues from taxes and the number of the unemployed. The analyzed data refer to the data collected before and after the establishment of the entrepreneurial zones. The analysis indicates that the influence of the entrepreneurial zones proves to be beneficial to some of the observed indicators. The entrepreneurial zones, however, do not provide an adequate boost to the urban competitiveness of Valpovo, since economical problems it is faced with are still not being solved. In order to support the development and influence of the entrepreneurial zones on urban competitiveness of Valpovo, the local government must develop links among the key institutions, an entrepreneurial spirit and a commitment to risk taking and risk sharing by its inhabitants.",,,,kdevcic@velegs-nikolatesla.hr; itonkovic-prazic@velegs-nikolatesla.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,43,48,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600004,0

This recurrent statistical finding is problematic for extant analytical models used to explain and interpret people's positions on free trade. This article proposes an analytical framework that challenges the dominant full-information factor-endowment approach to public opinion on free trade. The dominant approach assumes informed individuals who relate expectations about how free trade will affect them to their work skills. We propose that most individuals lack information and that their positions reflect the influence of information, frames, economic vulnerability, and political endorsements. We test this alternative approach with a Spanish survey conducted in May 2009 and the ISSP survey conducted in 2003 in a large number of less developed and more developed countries. The Spanish data demonstrate that the population is largely uninformed and that their ideas about the consequences of free trade do not explain contrasts among different socio-demographic groups. Meanwhile, the ISSP data contradict important aspects of the traditional approach and are consistent our alternative approach.","[Diez Medrano, Juan] IBEI, Barcelona, Spain; [Braun, Michael] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Mannheim, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS),"Medrano, JD (通讯作者)，IBEI, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Díez Medrano, Juan/GZK-5974-2022; Braun, Michael/JEN-1933-2023","DIEZ, JUAN/0000-0002-5962-5967",,,,,48,25,29,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

According to the first view (Jevons, Walras, Marshall), competition is characterised, independently of market structure, by the peaceful price taking conduct of consumers and producers. Rivalry is not completely absent, but it concerns the interaction of mediating professional dealers. According to the second view (Bertrand, Launhardt), competition appears as an aggressive strategic interaction between producers.","Univ Strasbourg, BETA, Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Ferreira, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, BETA, 61 Ave Foret Noire, Strasbourg, France.",rdsf@unistra.fr,"Dos Santos Ferreira, Rodolphe/JZD-1090-2024","Dos Santos Ferreira, Rodolphe/0000-0001-6966-281X",,,,,30,0,0,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

However, for many potential users and organizations security concerns, and in particular confidentiality of data and access control issues, outweigh such benefits. Some of these concerns relate to traditional network security issues, like confidentiality of data in transit to the cloud server. Some other cases are more relevant to the nature of cloud itself. An example of such a case is when the user desires that data access authorizations remain under their control, without revealing them to the cloud server. In both situations, the challenge is to provide the required solutions with minimal computational and storage overheads. This paper takes up that challenge to provide some solutions that have such characteristics. Our reported solutions are based on the Chines Remainder Theorem and allow for tailored enforcement and updating of access control parameters by the data owner with minimal overheads. In our approach, the data owner can provide each authorized user with the unique symmetric keys, used to encrypt a particular set of data to be shared by them. Furthermore, the security parameters are attached to the data and remain hidden. Consequently, they are not revealed to the cloud provider and unauthorized users at any time.","[Giweli, Nabil; Shahrestani, Seyed; Cheung, Hon] Univ Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",Western Sydney University,,ngiweli@scem.uws.edu.au; s.shahrestani@uws.edu.au; h.cheung@uws.edu.au,"Shahrestani, Seyed/L-3911-2017","Shahrestani, Seyed/0000-0002-8786-9213",,,,,11,1,1,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1742,1748,,,,,,7,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549701055,0

There are many forms of eating out, and many locations where food can be consume away from our residence. This paper will be focusing on eating out during a vacation, when people are on holiday away from their home, and their residential city. The goal will be to stress the differences that exist between eating out at our hometown and eating out when in another city (or even more important abroad) on a vacation. To do so, we are going to introduce the reader to the meaning of eating out and the locations where people can dine outside their home, focusing on the locations that are relevant for eating out on holidays. Then we are going to explain the basic behavior of people when consuming food during a vacation, focusing on the choices they make, the time when the food is consumed and so on. At the end we are going to make the difference between eating out on vacation and eating out in our hometown, so we can give some basic instructions to hospitality facilities owners on how to attract more people to dine at their facility.

Yet we consider globalization as an important component in the politics of institutional reforms, by serving as a resource mobilized by political actors striving to improve their position in the local political field. We show how the central bank in Israel appealed to the normative power of worldwide accepted institutional models, to the authority of international financial organizations, and to the disciplinary power of global financial markets, claiming that the adoption of central bank independence is imposed by the imperatives of globalization. We claim that the ability of central banks to conduct a credible politics of inevitability is based on their privileged location as nexus between the global and local fields.","[Maman, Daniel] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Rosenhek, Zeev] Open Univ Israel, Dept Sociol Polit Sci & Commun, Raanana, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Open University Israel,"Maman, D (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",,"Rosenhek, Zeev/J-3187-2019; Maman, Daniel/B-1200-2008","Rosenhek, Zeev/0000-0001-8739-7378; Maman, Daniel/0000-0002-7656-8722",,,,,41,5,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This article finds that the BIS's approach to bank supervision relies on private banks to be self-regulating entities and favours the interests of the largest global banks and financial centres. The BIS's private, club-like design and culture insulate private-sector participation in global financial policy-making from governmental control and oversight, blur the line between the public and private spheres of policy-making and allow private norms to shape public norms in global financial governance. Moreover, the BIS's normative framework concerning financial-market governance, in general, and bank supervision, in particular, is shaped by the bank's long-standing belief that state intervention into financial markets in the form of regulations and controls produces suboptimal economic outcomes. Rather than resulting from external factors such as great power dominance, regulatory capture or the search for 'best practices', the BIS's bias towards the policy preferences and market interests of the largest banks and financial centres is explained through a detailed examination of its institutional design and history as a bank founded by and for the world's largest banks - central as well as private.","SUNY Coll Old Westbury, Old Westbury, NY 11568 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Old Westbury,"Ozgercin, K (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Old Westbury, Old Westbury, NY 11568 USA.",OzgercinK@oldwestbury.edu,,,,,,,59,7,8,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

A key source of identification is to draw upon variation in the timing of adoption of state-wide Truth-in-Sentencing (TIS) legislation during the 1990s. To estimate the effect of the policy, I compare activity in adjacent counties on opposite sides of state boundaries in the 59 urban areas that cross state lines. There are three key results. First, adoption of TIS lowers the level of criminal activity in the adopting state. Second, adoption of the stiffer sentencing policy prompts migration of criminal activity into adjacent counties in the neighboring state, especially in the most populated urban areas. Finally, after the imposition of TIS by the state government, local governments reduce the level of police protection. This suggests that some of the deterrent effect of higher-level government anti-crime policy is offset by a scaling back on anti-crime efforts at the local level. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Along with conscription, extracting tax was the primary motivation behind this transformation. With the growth in cross-border economic relations, the current challenge for tax collectors is to make finance and banking legible at the global scale, moving from idiosyncratic and particularistic national arrangements towards a world-wide uniform bureaucratic grid. This is believed to be necessary to defeat would-be tax evaders looking to profit from the gaps and incompatibilities between different national tax systems. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is the main agent in homogenising tax data and procedures, and facilitating the exchange of tax information between states. As such, 'seeing like a state' on tax gives way to 'seeing like the OECD'.","Griffith Univ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Sharman, JC (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",j.sharman@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,46,21,25,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It is well known that the financial returns are not normally distributed, extremal events occur more often than the Gaussian distribution suggests. Already in the sixties Benoit Mandelbrot suggested a hypothesis that returns follow a stable Paretian law. Inspired by the discrete nature of prices appearing on the markets we model the financial returns by discrete analogues of absolutely continuous stable distributions. The known discrete stability of random variables on N is generalized to the case of random variables on Z. We give brief introduction to the theory of discrete stability on Z, show connection of discrete stable random variables to their absolutely continuous counterparts and focus mainly on methods of estimation of parameters of these distributions from the real data of financial returns.","[Slamova, Lenka; Klebanov, Lev B.] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,,slamova.lenka@gmail.com; klebanov@chello.cz,"Klebanov, Lev/F-3373-2014; Klebanov, Lev/AES-2752-2022",,,,,,6,2,2,0,4,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,805,810,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900138,0

We exploit a unique data set of condominium transactions in a residential real estate market where transaction traits associated with short-term speculation can be identified. In the cross-section of housing projects, a 10-percentage-point increase in trading activity following a strong short-run market price rise predicts a negative subsequent monthly price change of 0.5% at the project level. Moreover, the price reversal effect associated with the momentum trading by short-term speculators is two to three times stronger, and holding such trading constant, momentum trading in general has little additional impact. Our findings further suggest that momentum trading by short-term speculators contributes to price overreaction largely in submarkets with lower information efficiency.","[Fu, Yuming] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Qian, Wenlan] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Dept Finance, Singapore 119245, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Fu, YM (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",yuming.fu@nus.edu.sg; wenlan.qian@nus.edu.sg,"Qian, Wenlan/D-8110-2015; Fu, Yuming/C-1093-2008","Fu, Yuming/0000-0002-7219-3652",,,,,32,19,22,3,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2014,42.0,4,,,,,977,1007,,10.1111/1540-6229.12071,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,AU5FK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345632400006,0

Government action on behalf of gender equality is well institutionalized but private corporations appear as a new actor in this cause. This article asks: What do businesses and their public partners do in order to advance gender equality? What motivates their engagement now and how does it fit into existing public and private relationships of power? What do they mean for feminist agendas? How legitimate are they? And how effective are they? To address these questions the article examines four exemplary initiatives involving businesses in advancing gender equality and women's empowerment: the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women Global Initiative, the World Economic Forum's Women Leaders and Gender Parity Program, the European Union's Programme on Gender Balance in Decision-Making Positions, and the UN Global Compact-UNIFEM Women's Empowerment Principles for Business. Our purpose is to conceptually locate these initiatives as new private forms of governance involving partnerships with governments. We assess these initiatives employing criteria of feminist evaluation and find decidedly ambiguous results. We argue that the new attention to gender equality in business and global economic governance is both an expression of and a key process in the transformation of states and corporations in the context of global competition and restructuring.","[Pruegl, Elisabeth] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland; [True, Jacqui] Monash Univ, Fac Arts, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",Monash University,"Prügl, E (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.",,"Prügl, Elisabeth/I-5284-2019","Prügl, Elisabeth/0000-0002-4363-3540; True, Jacqui/0000-0002-5412-8929",,,,,95,71,76,4,88,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Data were collected from 1118 respondents in Japan, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The dependent variable was the intention to use one of three modes for work travel after getting a job: car, public transit, or other modes. The explanatory variables were three attitude factors taken from a previous study, including: 1/symbolic affective, reflecting affective motives of travel mode use; 2/instrumental, referring to functional attributes of travel modes; and 3/social orderliness which represents for environmental friendliness, safety, altruism, quietness et cetera. Several logit model estimates were made using the samples from the six countries separately and together. We obtained three main findings. First, attitude variables about the car were all significant determinants for the entire sample from Asian countries. Second, the social orderliness aspect of public transit was a common concern of respondents from developing countries in selecting this mode for work trips. Third, in countries in which the intent to use a car was not very high, attitude factors about the car were found to be significant determinants of the behavioral intention to commute by car but were less significant in countries in which the desire to use a car was high.

Deep habit formation constitutes a possible source of price stickiness and helps to mimic procyclical labour and real wage dynamics that are present in macrodata. To gauge the existence and the extent of deep habits in consumption, we estimate a dynamic time-space simultaneous model for consumption expenditure at different levels of product aggregation. This spatial panel model enables us to test for both internal and external deep habit formation at the same time. The former captures inertia or persistence in consumption and is included in the empirical specification as a time lag. The latter captures preference interdependence across households and is captured by a spatial lag. Our results show mixed evidence with respect to internal habit formation, whereas the external habit effect is almost always positive and significant.","[Verhelst, Benjamin] Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Verhelst, Benjamin] Univ Ghent, Dept Social Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van den Poel, Dirk] Univ Ghent, Dept Mkt, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University,"Verhelst, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",benjamin.verhelst@ugent.be; dirk.vandenpoel@ugent.be,"Van den Poel, Dirk/AAN-1891-2021","Van den Poel, Dirk/0000-0002-8676-8103",,,,,35,6,8,0,21,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Specifically, in the field of regional economics, several attempts have been made in order to quantify the contribution of R&D to labor productivity growth at a regional scale, considering both the internal R&D and the effects obtained by geographical spillovers. The results obtained, however, are characterized by a huge variability and in many cases there is no empirical evidence of positive contributions of R&D activities to productivity growth. Our argument is that this can be a consequence of dealing with samples' affect by a high level of collinearity. This paper proposes the use of the data-weighted prior (DWP) estimator suggested by Golan (J Econom 101:165-193, 2001). The main advantage of this estimator is that it discriminates between relevant and irrelevant regressors better than other estimators when dealing with highly collinear samples. We evaluate the performance of the DWP estimator by Monte Carlo simulations and illustrate how it works by means of a real-world example.","Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, REGIOlab, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Fernández-Vázquez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, REGIOlab, Oviedo, Spain.",evazquez@uniovi.es,"Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/L-8372-2019","Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/0000-0001-9192-8901",,,,,30,2,2,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Changes in characteristics of urban areas are likely to lead to changes in preferences for alternative modes of transport over time; as a consequence, statistical models to forecast mode choice need to be sensitive to both purposeful changes to urban systems as well as exogenous shocks. We make use of the 1996, 2001 and 2006 household surveys conducted in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area to study mode preference evolution and model forecasting performance. These repeated cross-sectional household surveys provide an opportunity to investigate aggregate structural changes in commuting mode preferences over time, in a manner sensitive to changes in the urban area. We focus on commuting mode choices because these trips are prime determinants of peak period congestion and peak spreading. We then address how to combine the three cross-sections econometrically in a robust way that allows for use of a single mode choice model across the entire period. Using independent data from 2012, we are able to compare the individual year and combined models in terms of forecasting performance to demonstrate the combined model's more robust forecasting performance into the future.

The results are generally intuitive, and show that the cross-sectional income elasticity of road traffic is not homogeneous as is typically specified in transport planning models. We show that in a number of circumstances the cross-sectional elasticity with respect to aggregate household income is of the opposite sign in comparison to more refined estimates of elasticity disaggregated by income source. If further research confirms that the elasticities we report here are causal in nature, neglecting the elemental effects could result in misleading results affecting practical infrastructure-investment and policy decisions, particularly as the mix of income sources shifts (e.g. if, as society ages, pension income increases as a share of all income). These results are of interest to both researchers and forecasters of travel demand, as well as designers of future travel survey instruments; the latter group must decide how to generate data about respondents' income. Current expert guidance is to collect a single estimate of aggregate income at the household level. Future travel survey design choices will bound the analyses that can be supported by the resulting survey data, and therefore methodological research to re-visit the trade-offs associated with such choices is warranted.

The answer appears to be yes when it comes to the use of traditional barriers to trade, such as tariffs. Yet, while many governments have cut tariffs to comply with international agreements, they have often raised non-tariff barriers in their place. One increasingly prominent non-tariff barrier is discrimination in public procurement. Governments frequently discriminate against foreign suppliers in favor of domestic ones when buying goods and services. In an attempt to reduce procurement discrimination, international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization, have devoted ever more attention to members' procurement practices. Additionally, a growing number of preferential trade agreements seek to regulate public procurement. It remains unclear, however, whether international rules are effective in changing governments' purchasing behavior. Using original data, we find that neither multilateral nor preferential procurement agreements substantially reduce governments' propensity to buy national. These results illustrate the difficulty of regulating non-transparent policy areas via international treaties.","[Rickard, Stephanie J.] London Sch Econ, Dept Govt, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kono, Daniel Y.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Rickard, SJ (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Govt, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.rickard@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,32,40,1,60,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The relationship between return to experience and unobservable individual ability is negative when conditioning on educational attainment, while the relationship between return to experience and educational attainment is positive. We link our findings to three main theories of wage growth, namely search, unobserved productivity and learning, and human capital. We devise several empirical tests in order to separate the theories. We find evidence in favor of the unobserved productivity and learning model and mixed evidence regarding the search model.

This study focuses on the transport terminals at major cities where a number of transport services connecting local and inter-city traffic convert. It is rather arduous to evaluate the overall performance of passenger transfer when the performance is attributed by both quantifiable factors and subjective perceptions which are on different scales and bounds of evaluation. In this paper, multi-criteria evaluation on transfer alternatives is developed by formulation of criteria systems and integration of performance factors. Multilevel grey evaluation (MGE) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are employed to devise the overall evaluation results and produce ranking for alternatives. The merits of the proposed methodology are illustrated through a case study on the Beijing South Railway Station in China. This study is particularly useful for the designers and operators to assess transfer performance and level of service in large transport terminals amid the increasing demands of the modern transportation.

In this paper, I suggest that the perceived creditworthiness of many transition countries' governments rests on a 'transfer' of good reputation from prestigious multinational banks, as foreign direct investors. The entry of reputable foreign banks into a transition country signals to international financial markets about the financial strength of that host economy. It also involves the transfer of the status of lender of last resort to the foreign parent bank. Foreign bank penetration can thus create optimistic expectations about a host country's capacity to service its sovereign debt. Using panel data for 23 transition economies during the period of 1996-2009, my empirical results provide support for the argument stressing the exogenous role of foreign financiers as enhancers of the credibility of host country governments. The results are robust to instrumental variable analysis and the inclusion of number of controls for alternative determinants of investors' perceptions of country risk. This proposition is further backed by evidence from three transition countries: Hungary, Estonia and Ukraine.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Polit Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Grittersová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Polit Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",jana.grittersova@ucr.edu,,,,,,,81,12,13,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We use an extended dataset and implement several empirical specifications in the analysis.

Recently, some authors have questioned this assumption of the theory, proposing new paradoxes where the Gain-Loss Separability is violated. We present a generalization of Cumulative Prospect Theory which does not imply Gain-Loss Separability and is able to explain the cited paradoxes. On the other hand, the new model, which we call the bipolar Cumulative Prospect Theory, genuinely generalizes the original Prospect Theory of Kahneman and Tversky, preserving the main features of the theory. We present also a characterization of the bipolar Choquet Integral with respect to a bi-capacity in a discrete setting.","[Greco, Salvatore; Rindone, Fabio] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, I-95129 Catania, Italy; [Greco, Salvatore] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England",University of Catania; University of Portsmouth,"Rindone, F (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy.",salgreco@unict.it; frindone@unict.it,,"Greco, Salvatore/0000-0001-8293-8227",,,,,39,8,8,4,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUN,2014,77.0,1,,,,,1,29,,10.1007/s11238-013-9390-3,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AI9FO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337237000001,0

Formal welfarism is a social evaluation in which any information other than the well-being of individuals is excluded, where the notion of individual well-being can be conceived in various ways. We propose a notion of individual well-being defined over pairs of outcomes and opportunity sets from which they are chosen. The concept of consequentialism and non-consequentialism is naturally introduced by restricting individual evaluation functions over the pairs of outcomes and opportunity sets. The two formal welfarism theorems provide axiomatic characterizations of formal welfarism in the extended framework. We show that the presence of a consequentialist or a non-consequentialist affects the validity of the two formal welfarism theorems in the extended framework.","Nishogakusha Univ, Fac Int Polit & Econ, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1028336, Japan",,"Iwata, Y (通讯作者)，Nishogakusha Univ, Fac Int Polit & Econ, Chiyoda Ku, 6-16 Sanbancho, Tokyo 1028336, Japan.",y-iwata@nishogakusha-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26780125] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,24,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2014,43.0,1,,,,,153,172,,10.1007/s00355-013-0764-9,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AI7RS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337094300009,0

On the one hand, it takes place against the backdrop of the failure of neoliberal policies to achieve stable economic growth in Latin America. On the other hand, Left-of-centre governments, which have now been in power for over a decade, are designing new strategies to manage the increase in export earnings accrued from sustained international demand for commodities. In particular, Brazil and Chile have undergone significant market opening reforms in their resource sectors, yet persistent state ownership and the dominant role of state enterprises in key extractive industries continue to characterise their growth models. This article explains this puzzle through the application of Mahoney and Thelen's (2010) historical institutionalist framework on incremental change. In so doing, it offers a process-oriented approach in exploring how resource wealth under certain economic and political conditions provides leverage for states to promote economic development. In sum, the article hopes to contribute to the literature on neoliberal and post-neoliberal political economies in Latin America.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Singh, JTN (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Winter St, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",j.nemsingh@sheffield.ac.uk,"Singh, Jewellord Nem/J-4003-2019","Nem Singh, Jewellord/0000-0002-5216-4408",,,,,154,25,27,0,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The fairness principles we consider propose, on one side, to reduce inequalities deriving from factors that do not depend on individuals' responsibility. On the other side, redistribution should be precluded at least when all agents in the economy have equal physical characteristics. We construct, on the basis of such principles, a particular social welfare function. Then we give the explicit formula for the comparison of tax policies: we prove that a tax reform should always benefit agents with the worst earning ability and the worst health disposition first. Finally, in some cases, at the bottom of the income distribution the optimal tax scheme should exhibit non-uniform tax rates over health expenditure and non-positive average marginal tax rates over income.","Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Valletta, G (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",g.valletta@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,,,,,,41,7,8,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2014,43.0,1,,,,,101,140,,10.1007/s00355-013-0768-5,0.0,,,40,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AI7RS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337094300007,0

As microeconomic factors cannot completely explain such a widespread phenomenon, a macroeconomic explanation linked to the inflationary environment-that a low and more stable inflation rate leads to a decrease in the pass-through-has gained popularity. Using a structural VAR framework, this paper presents evidence of a similar decline in the pass-through in Peru, a small open economy that gradually reduced inflation to international levels in order to adopt a fully fledged inflation targeting scheme in 2002.

Studies suggest that the emergence of democracy in developing states played a critical role in facilitating the reduction of controls on foreign investment in domestic equities. Yet, the data reveals that although some developing country democracies have curtailed equity market restrictions, a significant share of developing democracies have increased barriers on foreign ownership of domestic equities. This raises an important question: when do democratic governments in the developing world raise restrictions on foreign ownership of the equities of domestic firms? We suggest that policymakers in candidate-centred developing democracies will increase equity market restrictions in response to pressure from market concentrated public sector banks. Specifically, we claim that highly market concentrated public banks have incentives and the capacity to lobby policymakers to keep the domestic equity market closed to foreign investors. We then argue that policymakers from candidate-centred-but not party-centred-developing democracies have political incentives to be responsive to such pressure, which will induce them to raise barriers on foreign ownership of domestic equities. Statistical results obtained from a comprehensive sample of developing country democracies support our hypothesis.","[Mukherjee, Bumba; Yadav, Vineeta] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Bejar, Sergio] Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Polit Sci, Edinburg, TX 78541 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Mukherjee, B (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,,93,2,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Using Monte Carlo experiments and empirical examples, it is shown that the power of these tests critically depends on the type of bootstrap employed. Specifically, while tests based on the stationary bootstrap have power functions that are increasing with respect to sample size, those based on the sieve bootstrap have non-monotonic power functions. We argue that this difference arises from the fact that the latter procedure does not impose the null hypothesis when generating the bootstrap samples while the former ensures that the bootstrap samples are stationary, conditional on the original data. Our results therefore suggest that while both forms of bootstrap are effective at providing improved distributional approximations under the null hypothesis, it is important to pay careful attention to the particular type of bootstrap being employed when attempting to distinguish between the unit root and stationarity hypotheses as the choice of bootstrap can have crucial implications for the power of the resulting tests.","[Gulesserian, Sevan G.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Kejriwal, Mohitosh] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Kejriwal, M (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sgulesse@uci.edu; mkejriwa@purdue.edu,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Of all direct payments transactions in 2008, cash accounted for an astounding 82 % in terms of number and for 58 % in terms of value. With a dataset that combines transaction information with survey data on payment behaviour of German consumers, we shed light on how individuals decide on their cash usage. We employ a two-stage empirical framework which jointly explains payment card ownership and the use of cash. Our results indicate that cash usage is compatible with systematic economic decision making. Consumers decide on the adoption of payment cards and then use available payment media according to transaction characteristics, the relative costs of cash and card usage, socio-demographic characteristics and their assessment of payment instruments' characteristics. Importantly, older consumers use significantly more cash than younger consumers. We show that this difference in payment behaviour is not attributable to age as such but largely to differences in the characteristics of older and younger consumers. This suggests that the high cash intensity of older consumers cannot fully be attributed to the role of habit or to their slow adoption to new payment technologies.","[von Kalckreuth, Ulf; Schmidt, Tobias] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Stix, Helmut] Oesterreich Natl Bank, Econ Studies Div, A-1011 Vienna, Austria",Deutsche Bank,"Stix, H (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Natl Bank, Econ Studies Div, POB 61, A-1011 Vienna, Austria.",ulf.von-kalckreuth@bundesbank.de; tobias.schmidt@bundesbank.de; helmut.stix@oenb.at,,,,,,,30,23,26,0,20,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This literature raises the question as to what extent cross-sectional patterns of household expenditure can be used to make inferences about how the demand for goods and services will grow over time. Moreover, if indeed satiation does take place, then firms and entrepreneurs could react to this situation by innovating goods and services in order to overcome stagnation in demand growth (Witt 2001). We empirically investigate this 'satiation-escape' hypothesis by examining the inter-temporal dynamics of Engel curves and their derivatives, which reflect how household spending on a good changes with income. Taking into account changes in the price level, we investigate whether Engel curves that exhibit cross-section satiation tend to exhibit over time an upwards shift in the satiation level jointly with a shift in position and shape. Evidence suggests that this is actually the case.","[Chai, Andreas] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia; [Moneta, Alessio] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Griffith University; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Chai, A (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast Campus,Business 3 Bldg G06,Room 3-37, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia.",a.chai@griffith.edu.au; amoneta@sssup.it,,"MONETA, Alessio/0000-0003-4786-9507",,,,,59,1,1,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

As part of the analysis, the paper provides a conceptual framework for selecting indicators of trade performance and its policy determinants that the WTO and its partners might monitor closely as part of the aid for trade initiative.","[Gamberoni, Elisa] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Newfarmer, Richard] LSE, Int Growth Ctr, London, England",The World Bank; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gamberoni, E (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,9,4,4,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2014,37.0,4,,,SI,,542,554,,10.1111/twec.12139,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AE7RT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000334197100004,0

However, a switch from flat-rates to real-time rates means that many consumers will lose the cross-subsidy they are receiving under the flat rate, and may see an increase in their bills even if they have elastic demand. We use hourly load data from 1260 Commonwealth Edison residential customers on a standard flat rate electricity tariff from 2007 and 2008. We calculate which customers would have been better off and which customers would not Under real time pricing with both elastic and inelastic demand and look at the general characteristics of these customers. We find that if customers do not respond to prices under RTP, then only 35% of customers save money, while the remainder loses.

This paper analyses the cost efficiency of 35 Italian and 46 Norwegian airports over time. We apply a two-stage DEA approach, with truncated regression models in the second stage to evaluate the role of competition as a key determinant of the first stage efficiency scores. For that reason we initially use a separate model to measure the level of competition at the relevant airports both from other airports and from surface transport. We show that particularly for regional and small airports, it is the level of competition that impacts on the airport's efficiency. Military use/ownership and size of airports also have a positive impact on efficiency although diseconomies of scale matter when infrastructure is taken into account. Finally, when regressed separately, we find that Italian airports that are managed through a concession have higher efficiency scores than those with partial and temporary partial concessions.

We develop a spatial equilibrium model that shows how the effect of an immigrant inflow in a district affects local housing prices through changes in how natives perceive the quality of their local amenities and how this influences their mobility. Predictions of the model are tested by using a novel dataset on housing prices and population variables at the district level for a sample of 20 large Italian cities. To address endogeneity problems, we adopt an instrumental variable strategy which uses historical enclaves of immigrants across districts to predict current settlements. We find that immigration raises average house prices at the city level, while it reduces price growth in the district affected by the inflow vis-a-vis the rest of the city. We provide evidence that this pattern is driven by native-flight from immigrant-dense districts towards other areas of the same city. These findings are consistent with a negative effect of immigrants on native's perceived local amenities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This modal shift has been encouraged by pro-cycling policies to increase the attractiveness of cycling and the construction of new cycling infrastructure. In Dublin, several policies have been applied such as a bike rental scheme, bicycle-purchasing schemes, reducing speed limits and the construction of segregated cycle lanes to promote cycling. This paper seeks to examine what, if any, impact these policies have had on cycling rates in Dublin. This paper compares census data from 2006 and 2011 to determine how cycling rates have changed and if the demographics of cyclists have changed in the city. The results presented in the paper show that cycling rates have increased in Dublin and that a greater percentage of females, those in higher age and socio-economic groups are cycling to work on a regular basis. The analysis presented in this paper identifies groups of individuals that have recently shifted to cycling to work, by identifying who these people are, policymakers can tailor strategies to target these groups to encourage others in these groups to take up cycling.

Based on the new approach two different rules to distribute the associated interest gains are analyzed. Within the ABS structure a special purpose vehicle buys a portfolio of eurozone sovereign bonds (pooling) and issues a set of subordinated eurobonds with varying risk and rating (tranching). A large share of less risky securities is created as structuring concentrates the default risk in one part of the capital structure. A trust fund covers first losses in case of a country default. This approach has three major advantages. First, all eurozone countries can gain from eurobonds. These benefits are driven by partial liability, which also limits moral hazard, and the distribution of interest gains to all participating countries. Second, the approach is very flexible and quickly implementable. Finally, it is in line with European Union law.","[Hild, Alexandra M.

Many observers attribute this resilience to the industry's focus on quality. Here, we take note of that view but also examine production and cost relationships to explore the existence of returns to scale and the interrelationships among inputs to gain additional insights about the future prospects for this industry. The findings are consistent with constant returns to scale and a substitute relationship between all input pairs except for domestic capital and foreign intermediate goods. The results also suggest some increasing flexibility in the labor market, perhaps including informal sector arrangements, greater responsiveness of labor demand to the price of capital, and more international production sharing arrangements. An increasing elasticity over time of the demands for domestic capital and domestic intermediate goods with respect to the price of foreign substitutes was also observed. Since further economies of scale do not exist, maintaining the Italian textile industry's reputation for outstanding quality will likely be an important survival strategy for some products. For others, production sharing may be necessary to maintain international competitiveness.","[Truett, Lila J.; Truett, Dale B.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Truett, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",lila.truett@utsa.edu; dale.truett@utsa.edu,,"Truett, Lila/0000-0002-6976-2324",,,,,38,5,5,0,40,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Specifically, the study examines the impacts of cluster residential development on home value using data on Lower Gwynedd Township (Pennsylvania, USA). Other factors remaining constant, the study finds that properties located within cluster developments (CLUS) attract premium prices of roughly 3.9 %, on average, relative to properties in conventional developments. However, part of the 3.9 % price premium is attributable to the permanent open spaces which are parts and parcels of clusters. When the variable for open space (OPEN) is introduced, the cluster (CLUS) premium reduces to 2.02 % suggesting the relative importance the permanent open spaces. The open space variable (OPEN) is associated with a premium of as much as 5.2 %, on average. The density of development variable (DENSITY) is significantly negative at conventional levels. The normative implication of the density finding is that raising permitted densities, per se, in a sub-urban setting where market densities are lower than permitted densities, will have adverse impacts on home value.

Using a sample of 168 firms, we find robust evidence that firms strategically evaluate and compare the increased agency costs associated with external advisement against the potential benefits associated with collocating decision rights with location specific soft information. Our empirical results reveal real estate companies tend to hire external advisors when they invest in countries: 1) that are more economically and politically unstable, 2) whose legal system is based on civil law, 3) where the level of corruption is perceived to be high, and 4) when disclosure is relatively poor. Additionally, we find the probability of retaining an external advisor is directly related to the expected agency costs. Lastly, we find evidence of return premiums in excess of 13 % for firms whose organizational structure matches their investment profile. As such, we conclude that the decision to hire an external advisor represents a value relevant trade-off between the costs and benefits of this organizational arrangement.","[Cashman, George D.; Harrison, David M.] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Seiler, Michael J.] Old Dominion Univ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Norfolk, VA USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Old Dominion University,"Harrison, DM (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",george.cashman@ttu.edu; david.m.harrison@ttu.edu; mseiler@odu.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,43,4,4,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The findings are expressed in the words of the lecturers themselves and reveal the everyday pathology of ever more oppressive workplace labour management in the context of a particular organizational political economy.,"[Mather, Kim] Keele Univ, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England; [Seifert, Roger] Wolverhampton Univ, Wolverhampton, England",Keele University; University of Wolverhampton,"Mather, K (通讯作者)，Keele Univ, Dept HRM & IR, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England.",k.mather@keele.ac.uk,,"Seifert, Roger/0000-0002-4091-0784",,,,,56,20,20,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In response to vote trading scandals in the 1998 and 2002 Olympics, the International Skating Union (ISU) introduced a number of changes to its judging system, including obscuring which judge issued which mark. The stated intent was to disrupt collusion by groups of judges, but this change also frustrates most attempts by outsiders to monitor judge behavior. The author finds that the compatriot-judge effect, which aggregates favoritism (nationalistic bias from own-country judges) and corruption (vote trading), actually increased slightly after the reforms.","[Zitzewitz, Eric] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Zitzewitz, Eric] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Zitzewitz, E (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, 6016 Rockefeller Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",ericz@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,33,22,27,4,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Green Libraries of Energetic Efficiency have been founded as a result of a project Removing Barriers to Energy Efficiency in Croatia (EE project) with a goal to disseminate and make visible the information and publications created within the Project to wider Croatian public. The EE project, initiated in 2005, aims at removing barriers for the implementation of economically feasible, energy efficient technologies and measures in residential and public sectors in Croatia while implementing the principles of systematic energy management in the public sector. An important facet of the project is its focus on citizens, which is evident from media campaigns, multi-media publications, brochures, various lectures and the network of Info points for energy efficiency. Among those Info points are currently ten Green Libraries situated at public and academic libraries in nine Croatian cities (Zagreb, Pula, Osijek, Krizevci, Prelog, Sisak, Rijeka, Split, and Zadar). This paper focuses on the everyday education activities, types of customers, their expectations and needs of those Green EE Libraries. The paper also gives the findings of the survey conducted among ten Green EE Libraries in Croatia about their experience in the project as well as the expected impact of the Green EE Library materials on their customers.","[Balog, Kornelija Petr] Univ Osijek, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Osijek, Croatia; [Siber, Ljiljana] Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Balog, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Osijek, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, L Jaegera 9, Osijek, Croatia.",kpetr@ffos.hr; ljsiber@pravos.hr,"Balog, Kornelija Petr/Y-3714-2019; Balog, Kornelija Petr/C-1749-2013","Balog, Kornelija Petr/0000-0002-4970-9446;",,,,,13,2,2,0,7,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,478,487,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600047,0

This is done by assessing Ogburn's contribution in the light of the methodological debates that animated academia during the 1920s and the early 1930s - the years that marked the peak of the Institutionalists influence in American economics - and by comparing his work with that of some of the more 'sociologically oriented' figures of the movement. The present paper is organized as follows. The first two sections deal with Ogburn's epistemic commitments with respect to the main methodological debates of the period. The second section reviews Ogburn's 1922 Social Change and his theory of social evolution. The third section is devoted to a scrutiny of the parallels between Veblen and Ogburn. The fourth and fifth section discuss the affinities between Ogburn and the contributions of the Institutionalists, with a focus on the work of Albert B. Wolfe, Rexford G. Tugwell, Lawrence K. Frank, and Clarence E. Ayres. The final section presents some conclusions.

Recently, it has been proposed to tackle this problem by computing individual p-values and combining them to an overall joint significance. We adopt and illustrate this fairly general approach allowing for competing means to account for cross-correlation when analyzing samples of N = 10 international interest rate differentials of different maturities. Alternatively, we investigate the approach of multiple testing or multiple comparison that has rarely been employed in econometrics. The advantages are that the computation of p-values is not necessarily required, and that one may identify for which specific unit a null hypothesis of interest may be considered as violated while controlling the overall significance level of the multiple testing problem. This comes at the price of an increased computational burden.","[Hassler, Uwe; Werkmann, Verena] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, RuW Gebaude, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Werkmann, V (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, RuW Gebaude, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",hassler@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de; werkmann@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

However, from the point of view of sustainable development, social area is as much important as economic one. In this paper social convergence refers to a reduction in the dispersion of the standard of living across countries. Due to the fact that the standard of living is a multidimensional category the synthetic variable was used as its approximation. In order to verify that the social convergence process has place in the European Union the occurrence of sigma-, beta- and gamma-convergence was tested. The existence of convergence was tested for the global aggregated measure of the standard of living, and as well for 10 groups of factors affecting this phenomenon.","[Kuc, Marta] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Econometr & Stat, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Kuc, M (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Econometr & Stat, Gagarina 11, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",martakuc@doktorant.umk.pl,"Kuc-Czarnecka, Marta/S-1744-2019; Kuc-Czarnecka, Marta/J-9307-2016","Kuc-Czarnecka, Marta/0000-0003-2970-9980; Kuc-Czarnecka, Marta/0000-0003-2970-9980",,,,,17,2,2,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-43-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,105,114,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367244900011,0

They note that in this type of an economic arrangement, private sector co-exists along with the private sector, and economic activities are being carried out via market mechanisms as well as public institutions. The aim of the paper is to identify and define the nature and structure of the public sector, because in our opinion the existing defmitions no longer correspond to recent circumstances. On this basis, then determine whether the scope of the public sector is adequate to its importance. The task is to analyse how broadly the public sector should be conceived, whether it should or should not include along with pure public goods a large scale of mixed goods. Exclusion of mixed goods from public sector domain would mean a gradual reduction in the scope of public goods in the direction towards pure public goods and re-examination of the question of what the relationship between public administration and public policy is. The paper employs several methods, including economic analysis as a scientific approach that deduces, respectively predicts certain phenomena and forms of economic behaviour of the entities in the private and public sector, disaggregation and statistical analysis to measure the size of the public sector domain in the EU countries.

It has been given little formal support or recognition by city authorities in the development plans. Recent development programmes have continued to raise awareness about this phenomenon, and local authorities have begun to understand the role UPA can play in improving urban food supply and reducing poverty. Constraints to UPA such as limited access to land and good quality water, poor farmer organization, participation in policy development, and poor policy support, imply that UPA needs to be productive and profitable through diverse innovations. In Accra, Ghana and Ibadan, Nigeria, 200 urban farmers were organized into 8 producer groups and trained using technical and organizational innovations in vegetable production so as to improve yield and income. The Ibadan groups were predominantly female farmers, while Accra groups were mainly male. Training was delivered through the Urban Producer Field Schools (UPFS) on topics ranging from integrated plant production and protection principles, food safety and risk-minimization in wastewater use for irrigation to value-addition for marketing. Farmers dealt with organized marketing, targeting niche markets. The farmer groups in Accra progressed significantly over a one-year period of group strengthening as became evident in their organized structure and participation in group processes. The Ibadan group lagged behind at the group formation stage, apparently because of the hierarchical nature of the group and personal conflicts. In addition, external factors such as disease infestation affected the group processes in Ibadan. Adoption of innovations was higher among the farmers in Accra, where farmers applied at least 3 out of 6 different innovations, while adoption of innovations among female farmers in Ibadan was low: as less than 30% adopted 2 out of 5 different innovations. In both Accra and Ibadan, considerable improvement in crop performance was recorded.","[Larbi, T.

However, there are significant disproportions between level differences of a specific country. Many European Union Member States are concerned with significant regional differences as well as differences at their national levels. Determination of regional differences is usually performed according to economic criteria (e.g., GDP, unemployment rate of working-age population, revenues within local government, investments, extraction for education in GDP, foreign direct investments, etc.). However, taking into consideration just the economic indicators most of the time does not give a unique response when considering causes of the differences created. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to determine the institutional impact as a noneconomic indicator in growth and development differences - within-country and between-country differences. In this paper, institutions are considered to be comprised by North's definition (2003, 13), according to which institutions are the rules of behaviour in a society, or more formally speaking, the restrictions on which man has figured out how to shape human interaction. Focus on economic criteria of monitoring the differences is usually expressed by economic growth. But, development comprises a wide variety of indicators reflecting the welfare of a specific country. Examples of differences within and between a certain country (countries) are going to be the frame for displaying a de facto situation. Besides, as growth and development are cine qua non components of every country, research and contribution of institutions are a necessity. Institutional performance of formal and informal institutions differs significantly. According to the predominance of a specific institutional form, it is possible to outline different guidelines of institutional impact. The purpose of this paper, according to the institutional activity framework in a specific country, is to record the influence on economic development of a specific territory (region) or economy as a whole.","[Marosevic, Katarina] Fac Law Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Udovicic, Ana] Polytech Sibenik, Shibenik 22000, Croatia; [Nukic, Ivana Sandrk] Fac Civil Engn, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Marosevic, K (通讯作者)，Fac Law Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",katarina.marosevic@pravos.hr; ana_u@vus.hr; isandrknukic@gfos.hr,"Sandrk Nukic, Ivana/IUO-7824-2023",,,,,,26,0,0,0,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,647,659,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600064,0

Taking into account that unpublished data of Rural Support Service were analyzed, the original results of subsidies' impact on rural development on region level were obtained. Latvia is among the EU countries with the largest share of forest area and with growing increment in forests available for wood supply each year. The subsidies for encouraging entrepreneurship and diversification into non-agricultural activities have been granted for existing microenterprises, agricultural farms and for founding and development of new microenterprises. The highest number of the supported fuelwood projects has been implemented in the least developed region of Latvia - Latgale region. Despite the support to the bioenergy projects, particularly fuelwood, having stimulated the creation of new jobs and helping to retain the existing ones in Latvian rural area, the cost of a created job is higher than predicted by rules for projects oriented on job creation in Latvia. When it comes to the public costs per working place created or retained, employment opportunities have been costly. The rapid growth of fuelwood export is a result of faster growing supply compared to the domestic use, which could be developed in Latvia.","[Melece, Ligita; Krievina, Agnese] Latvian State Inst Agr Econ, Riga, Latvia; [Sproge, Ilze] Transport & Telecommun Inst, Riga, Latvia",Transport & Telecommunication Institute - Latvia,"Melece, L (通讯作者)，Latvian State Inst Agr Econ, Riga, Latvia.",,"Melece, Ligita/AAZ-6705-2020; Sproģe, Ilze/AAB-1113-2019","Melece, Ligita/0000-0002-3120-3711; Sproģe, Ilze/0000-0002-4588-5645",,,,,11,2,2,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,231,238,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800030,0

The main feature of the interpretative power of these theories is that they have managed to innovate by using tools adopted from other social sciences while maintaining the basic methodology of economics. Accordingly, the key factors identified by modem theories in shaping tax morality and tax compliance are: social norms; reciprocity and justice; self-control and intrinsic motivation; other factors influencing the tax behavior (e.g. political institutions, or the extent of democratic participation). All the aforementioned factors are critically reviewed and analyzed in this article.","[Mitrakos, Panagiotis; Bitzenis, Aristidis; Kontakos, Panagiotis] Univ Macedonia, Dept Int & European Studies, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Mitrakos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Int & European Studies, Thessaloniki, Greece.",,"Bitzenis, Aristidis/AAM-1294-2021",,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,3,10,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900001,0

New public management involves the introduction of values and principles of the private sector to the public sector in order to improve the competitiveness of the economy as a whole. Accordingly, efficiency, economy and effectiveness should be the basis of the functioning of the public sector. Effective management of state property is certainly the assumption of an efficient public sector and the assumption of rapid economic development. In Croatia, in spite of privatization, the state still owns the assets of great value in the form of stocks and shares in companies and real estate. State property management of the Republic of Croatia has so far been characterized by non-transparency and inefficiency with the constant changes of the legal framework and institutional forms of state property management.

Specifically, some parameterizations of evolutionary algorithms promote genetic drift. Such drift can lead the system to transition among the game's various Nash Equilibria.

To establish this point, I develop a transaction cost account of corruption and rent-seeking in mining-sector licensing systems, showing that due to transaction costs different allocations of institutionalmandates give rise to differential incentives for corruption and rent-seeking. By critically assessing and elaborating the World Bank's thinking on mining-sector reform, I generate normative prescriptions to optimise the separation of powers in licensing regimes. I also treat this model of corruption and rent-seeking positively and I test it through an empirical case study of Kosovo. In the newly independent Balkan country, recent legal reforms have introduced a sub-optimal allocation of regulatory competences. The structure of transaction costs that resulted explains the growing emergence of rentierism. Crucially, these regressive reforms are shown to have retarded the growth of the country's mining sector.","[Uberti, Luca J.] Amer Univ Kosovo, Ctr Energy & Nat Resources, Pristina, Kosovo; [Uberti, Luca J.] Rochester Inst Technol, Pristina, Kosovo",,"Uberti, LJ (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Kosovo, Ctr Energy & Nat Resources, Pristina, Kosovo.",luca.jacopo.uberti@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,9,9,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We answer the research question What factors influence citizens' willingness-to-pay tolls by empirically estimating a four factor model of willingness-to-pay: (a) direct benefit to the respondent; (b) relative cost over time; (c) community concern; and (d) political and environmental liberalism. We use data about citizen perceptions from the Life in Hampton Roads Survey, a survey of residents of Hampton Roads, Virginia. We find that willingness-to-pay is primarily driven and motivated by self-interest, through a balancing of benefit to cost relative to individual income and frequency of use. In addition, concern for the community also contributes to willingness-to-pay tolls. The individual's perception of government's trustworthiness, a reflection of political and environmental beliefs, also influences the extent to which an individual is willing to pay tolls.

The case of Alfred Marshall is used to illustrate how facing the idea of race in past thinkers can generate valuable insights in the history of economics. The main body of the paper traces the development of Marshall's idea of race. It further points to a gap between this idea and some of his written statements, which it explains as following from Marshall's anxiety that his historical introduction to his Principles of Economics (1890) not appear out-of-date. The derivation of Marshall's idea of race is connected to the derivation of his idea of nationality. Where ties of blood and common descent provided the social bond in primitive and ancient societies, an internal principle of nationality provides the equivalent for modern nations. But this principle of nationality is seen to be a general principle of social identity of profound relevance for understanding our early twenty-first-century societies and standing at the heart of the recent Marshallian revival'.

Previous studies in Latin America have examined the transition from Keynesian water utilities to the neoliberal provisions of water services, but paid less attention to the adaptability of the state apparatus and the systematic adjustments required to sustain neoliberalising strategies. Addressing this gap in the literature, this paper examines two decades of change in the public water services of Lima, Peru, as one of the Latin American countries where neoliberal reforms have been more comprehensive and resilient. The analysis focuses on the water policies advanced by the national state and with the reconfiguration of the state apparatus as a result of extra-economic factors. The neoliberalisation of water may have improved the situation at the aggregate level, but inequalities, scarcities and vulnerabilities have been maintained and even reinforced. The achievements and failures of the neoliberalisation of water have ultimately depended on a range of politico-economic and socioecological interactions creatively mediated by the state apparatus. In the end, however, the neoliberal adjustments in the structure and operation of the state have replicated the double exploitation of nature and society that has long shaped Peruvian economic history.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Inst Geog, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Ioris, AAR (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Inst Geog, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland.",a.ioris@ed.ac.uk,"Ioris, Antonio/B-3059-2014","Ioris, Antonio/0000-0003-0156-2737",,,,,86,19,20,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It jointly considers many different aspects of the agglomeration labour market relationship, including turnover, learning, matching, and hold up. It also considers - labour market pooling from the perspective of both workers and firms and across a range of industries. Overall, the paper finds some support for theories of labour market pooling, but the support is weak. Specifically, there is a general positive relationship of turnover to local population density, which is consistent with theories of agglomeration and uncertainty. There is also evidence of on-the-job learning that is consistent with theories of labour pooling, labour poaching, and hold up. In addition, the paper provides evidence consistent with agglomeration improving job matches. However, the labour market pooling gains that we measure are small in magnitude and seem unlikely to account for a substantial share of the agglomeration benefits accruing to Italian workers and firms.

Despite the potential of free-ridership to seriously undermine the economic efficiency of a program intervention, for instance to foster energy efficiency, the issue remains largely absent from contemporary environmental and energy policy discussions in Europe. One reason for this neglect is the inherent difficulty of assessing which households would have undertaken the energy-conservation activity even without the program. This paper proposes a procedure to calculate the free-rider share using revealed preference data on home renovations from Germany's residential sector. We employ a discrete-choice model to analyze the effect of grants on renovation choices, the output from which is used to assess the extent of free-ridership under a subsidy program very akin to an implemented grants program in Germany. Our empirical results suggest only very moderate energy savings induced by the program, making free-riding a problem of outstanding importance.","[Groesche, Peter] Hsch Anhalt, Fachbereich Wirtschaft, D-06406 Bernburg, Germany; [Schmidt, Christoph M.; Vance, Colin] Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Schmidt, Christoph M.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Vance, Colin] Jacobs Univ Bremen, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ruhr University Bochum; Jacobs University,"Grösche, P (通讯作者)，Hsch Anhalt, Fachbereich Wirtschaft, Strenzfelder Allee 28, D-06406 Bernburg, Germany.",p.groesche@wi.hs-anhalt.de; schmidt@rwi-essen.de; vance@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,21,10,10,0,13,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

It is the rule that selects, for each preference profile, the medians of the peaks and the parameters belonging to each set in the pair.

This second part completes my critical historiography by revealing how Open Economy Politics, which dominates the latest phase of American IPE, is Eurocentric. However, some readers will, quite rightly, want to know why Eurocentrism poses a problem for IPE and what an alternative non-Eurocentric approach might look like. Accordingly, this article lays out some of the basic properties of what I call inter-civilizational political economy'. To this end, deconstructing OEP is undertaken in tandem with reconstructing a non-Eurocentric inter-civilizational account of trade regime change in the last few centuries. From there, I proceed to specify some key empirical areas that an inter-civilizational research agenda would examine, focussing on three types of politico-economic systems change: the rise of capitalism, the rise and development of globalization, and changes in the distribution of structural power within the world economy. I close that section by pointing to various smaller-scale areas of research that derive from what I call everyday inter-civilizational political economy.

The fund manager can dynamically update his belief about the true value of the expected return based on the realization of the net asset value of the hedge fund. Our main purpose is to study the impact of the uncertainty of the expected return on the pricing of the fund manager's various fees and the investor's claim. The results show that partial information has significant impact on the values of the fees and the claim. Specifically, a non-updating fund manager always underestimate the values, and more often than not, the amount underestimated is very significant. The closer the net asset value gets to the high-water mark or the larger the uncertainty of the expected return is, the bigger the amount underestimated will become.","[Song, Dandan; Yang, Zhaojun] Hunan Univ, Sch Finance & Stat, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jinqiang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Yang, ZJ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Finance & Stat, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",songdan000@126.com; yang.jinqiang@mail.sufe.edu.cn; zjyang@hnu.edu.cn,"zhang, xueying/JMB-7808-2023; Yang, Zhaojun/B-2546-2013; Yang, Zhaojun/P-5318-2019","Yang, Zhaojun/0000-0002-2591-7283; Yang, Zhaojun/0000-0002-2591-7283","National Natural Science Foundation of China [70971037, 71171078, 71202007]; Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China [20100161110022]; Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [13ZS050]; Scientific Research Innovation Project of Graduate student in Hunan Province [CX2011B142]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission); Scientific Research Innovation Project of Graduate student in Hunan Province","The research for this paper was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (project Nos. 70971037, 71171078 and 71202007), Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China (project No. 20100161110022), Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (project No. 13ZS050) and Scientific Research Innovation Project of Graduate student in Hunan Province (project No. CX2011B142).

The house price risk in each neighborhood is measured with the temporal variation of quarterly appreciation rates of the neighborhood house price index over the 2002-2007 period. Cross-sectional regressions of neighborhood house price risk on the median household income and the percentage of population in poverty from the 2000 census data for the same neighborhoods provide strong evidence that the house price risk is significantly higher in low-income/poor neighborhoods. Subperiod analyses further indicate that the risk segmentation exists in both a booming period (pre 2005:2) and a busting period (post 2005:3).

It has been argued, however, that preferential trade agreements (PTAs) including 'hard' human rights standards can withhold economic benefits and, thus, can have a real potential to substantially reduce human rights violations. The following article questions this as existent work on the effects of PTAs on human rights standards neglects a selection process underlying the implementation of these treaties. Countries being aware of the 'shadow of the future' already take into account what may happen at the succeeding enforcement stage when establishing a particular PTA. This implies that states agree on 'hard' human rights standards in PTAs only if they have a general propensity to abide by human rights in the first place. For testing the empirical implications of their argument, the authors collected new data on PTAs in 1976/77-2009, and employ genetic matching techniques. The results support the theoretical argument that PTAs are unlikely to affect human rights compliance when controlling for the outlined selection problem.","[Spilker, Gabriele; Boehmelt, Tobias] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, IFW C 43 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Spilker, Gabriele] Harvard Univ, Weatherhead Ctr Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Harvard University,"Spilker, G (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, IFW C 43 2, Haldeneggsteig 4, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",gabriele.spilker@ir.gess.ethz.ch,"Spilker, Gabriele/GWU-7329-2022; Böhmelt, Tobias/N-5347-2014","Bohmelt, Tobias/0000-0002-7661-8670",,,,,55,34,38,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Applying panel cointegration techniques to a production function with non-export GDP as the dependent variable, we find for a sample of 45 developing countries that: (i) exports have a positive short-run effect on non-export GDP and vice versa (short-run bidirectional causality), (ii) the long-run effect of exports on non-export output, however, is negative on average, but (iii) there are large differences in the long-run effect of exports on non-export GDP across countries. Cross-sectional regressions indicate that these cross-country differences in the long-run effect of exports on non-export GDP are significantly negatively related to cross-country differences in primary export dependence and business and labor market regulation.

The paper argues that the dominant view on the international position of the dollar has been based on a Metallist view of money. In the alternative Cartalist view of money, the hegemon is not required to maintain credible macroeconomic policies (i.e., fiscally contractionary policies to maintain the value of the currency), but to provide an asset free of the risk of default. Further, it is argued that the current crisis in Europe shows why the euro is not a real contender for hegemony in the near future.","[Fields, David] Univ Utah, Dept Sociol, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Vernengo, Matias] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Vernengo, Matias] Cent Bank Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Fields, D (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Sociol, Salt Lake City, UT USA.",,,,,,,,61,31,34,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

British Columbia has a developed forestry sector and still maintains a LEB. This trade restriction continually creates conflicts with Canada's international trade partners, including the United States. This paper examines the efficiency implications of a hypothetical removal of roundwood export restrictions in British Columbia using roundwood price and quantity data from 1995 to 2008. A time-series econometric approach is utilised to determine supply and demand elasticities for British Columbia's roundwood. Empirical results from a vector error correction model suggest that a removal of export restrictions will generate an overall increase of approximately $347.91 million US dollars per year to British Columbia's forest economy.","[Fooks, Jacob R.; Awokuse, Titus O.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Dundas, Steven J.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",University of Delaware; North Carolina State University,"Fooks, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",,"Dundas, Steven/AAV-9779-2020; Awokuse, Titus/AAQ-5902-2020","Dundas, Steven/0000-0003-3000-3395; Awokuse, Titus/0000-0002-3245-1055",,,,,51,9,9,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2013,36.0,8,,,,,1098,1114,,10.1111/twec.12041,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,198JJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322918500007,0

First, the volatility transmissions across markets are examined using an asymmetric t-BEKK (Baba-Engle-Kraft-Kroner) specification of their covariance matrix. Second, correlations from that model and tail dependences estimated using a time-varying copula framework are analyzed to assess whether different dynamics underlie the comovements in the whole distribution and those in the tails. Third, we investigate market contagion by testing for structural changes in the tail dependences. We use data for the U.S., the U.K. and Australia for the period 1990-2010 as a basis for our analyses. Spillover effects are found to be the largest in the U.S., both domestically and internationally. Further, comovements in tail distributions between markets appear to be quite important. We also document different dynamics between the conditional tail dependences and correlations. Finally, we find evidence of market contagion between the U.S. and the U.K. markets following the subprime crisis.","[Hoesli, Martin; Reka, Kustrim] Univ Geneva, HEC, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Hoesli, Martin] Univ Geneva, SFI, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Hoesli, Martin] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland; [Hoesli, Martin] Bordeaux Ecole Management, F-33405 Bordeaux, France",University of Geneva; University of Geneva; University of Aberdeen,"Hoesli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, HEC, 40 Blvd Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",martin.hoesli@unige.ch; kustrim.reka@unige.ch,,,,,,,76,69,73,0,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

A case study for the Netherlands,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Competitive tendering in public transport; Satisfaction; Service attributes,SERVICE QUALITY; TRANSIT SERVICE; PERFORMANCE,"During 10 years experience with competitive tendering of regional and local public transport in the Netherlands, national average trip satisfaction of passengers increased from 6.84 to 7.25 (+0.41). This is a remarkable improvement, but a closer look at the data reveals that also in regions without competitive tendering the improvement in satisfaction was substantial. The difference in the improvement for regions with and without tendering is only +0.06. Tendering led in the majority of concession areas to an improvement of average trip satisfaction, but in some 40% of the cases a deterioration was observed. A change of operator in general has a negative impact on satisfaction. We also find that the effect on satisfaction of early tendering is larger than of later tendering. This may well be the consequence of a shift in emphasis of authorities and operators from quality improvement to efficiency improvements. The model building and analysis is based on the comparison per year-pair of regions tendered versus regions non-tendered (in that specific year-pair). So we compare the effects on satisfaction of tendered regions relative to non-tendered regions. An analysis concerning the weighted satisfaction judgments of 15 underlying service attributes revealed that 'service frequency, on-time performance, travel speed, and vehicle tidiness' contribute the most to the effect on satisfaction in the tendered regions. We found that new vehicles impact highly on satisfaction with travel speed and vehicle tidiness. The emphasis in the tenders with increasing service frequency, led to an increase in satisfaction but, may have a deteriorating effect on (the satisfaction with) on-time performance.

After winning the 2011 parliamentary elections, Citizens' Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) became the first party in Poland's democratic history to win two consecutive elections. Despite its liberal ideological background, Platforma Obywatelska took a more pragmatic and cautious approach to economic policy, avoiding the introduction of strong austerity economic policies. This paper considers the debate within the liberal camp about Platforma Obywatelska's economic policies, with particular reference to the reform of pensions. It also looks at the plans of the government for more strident liberal economic reforms in its second term, at what impact these will have on the popularity of Platforma Obywatelska and at how this reflects a tension between the party's pragmatic concerns of government and commitment to liberal ideology.","Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Rae, G (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Rae, Gavin/O-9965-2016","Rae, Gavin/0000-0003-2667-5180",,,,,23,4,5,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,MAY 1,2013,65.0,3,,,SI,,411,425,,10.1080/09668136.2013.779461,0.0,,,15,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,121UN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317270000003,0

For monotonicity to be fulfilled, any increase in individual health-other things equal-should result in an increase in social welfare. We elicit public preferences concerning trade-offs between the total level of health (concern for efficiency) and its distribution (concern for equality), under different hypothetical scenarios through face-to-face interviews. Of key interests are: the distinction between non-monotonic preferences and Rawlsian preferences; symmetry of HRSWF; and the extent of inequality neutral preferences. The results indicate strong support for non-monotonic preferences, over Rawlsian preferences.

The sector is responsible for 39% of the total final energy consumption in Jordan, and is nearly totally dependent on oil consumption. The structure of this sector is analyzed with focus on passenger cars which represent 65% of total vehicles, and are responsible for nearly all of the national gasoline fuel demand. To achieve these objectives, the study develops a multi linear regression model using different independent variables based on 22-year historical data between years 1988 and 2009 refined from scattered data sources. The final model includes only the number of registered vehicles, income level, and gasoline price variables. A number of policy gaps are identified as contributors to the low efficiency composition of the fleet in terms of engine size, composition, availability of public transport, fuel prices, vehicle age, and type of ignition. To illustrate the importance of integrating energy policies within national energy plans, the impact of ending subsidies of gasoline was investigated and found to be significant. Without such policies, gasoline consumptions are predicted to rise by 1.81%/year. However, if such policies are implemented, over the same period, gasoline consumptions are forecasted to ascend at a lower rate of 0.53%/year. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis differs from existing studies in two respects. First, we do not exclude the households with negative saving that are about 18.9% of the entire sample. Second, we conduct a more complete treatment effect analysis. We estimate both average treatment effect (ATE) and quantile treatment effect (QTE) using the difference-in-differences method. We also partition some covariates (household income and the age of household head) into different groups and estimate the group-wise ATEs and QTEs. While supporting the existing finding that the NHI has negative impact on households saving, our empirical result shows that the QTEs are heterogeneous across saving quantiles, such that higher savers tend to have greater reduction in saving after the NHI is enforced. It is also found that the NHI has greater impact on the households with higher income and those with retiring heads, especially on high savers in these groups.","[Kuan, Chung-Ming] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Chen, Chien-Liang] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Puli 545, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Chi Nan University,"Kuan, CM (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",ckuan@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,22,10,10,1,42,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

With the advancement of Geographic Information System (GIS) analysts are able to analyze crashes for various geographical units. However, a clear guideline on which geographic entity should be chosen is not present. Macro level safety analysis is at the core of transportation safety planning (TSP) which in turn is a key in many aspects of policy and decision making of safety investments. The preference of spatial unit can vary with the dependent variable of the model. Or, for a specific dependent variable, models may be invariant to multiple spatial units by producing a similar goodness-of-fits. In this study three different crash models were investigated for traffic analysis zones (TAZs), block groups (BGs) and census tracts (CTs) of two counties in Florida. The models were developed for the total crashes, severe crashes and pedestrian crashes in this region. The primary objective of the study was to explore and investigate the effect of zonal variation (scale and zoning) on these specific types of crash models. These models were developed based on various roadway characteristics and census variables (e.g., land use, socio-economic, etc.). It was found that the significance of explanatory variables is not consistent among models based on different zoning systems. Although the difference in variable significance across geographic units was found, the results also show that the sign of the coefficients are reasonable and explainable in all models. Key findings of this study are, first, signs of coefficients are consistent if these variables are significant in models with same response variables, even if geographic units are different. Second, the number of significant variables is affected by response variables and also geographic units. Admittedly, TAZs are now the only traffic related zone system, thus TAZs are being widely used by transportation planners and frequently utilized in research related to macroscopic crash analysis. Nevertheless, considering that TAZs are not delineated for traffic crash analysis but they were designed for the long range transportation plans, TAZs might not be the optimal zone system for traffic crash modeling at the macroscopic level. Therefore, it recommended that other zone systems be explored for crash analysis as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Common oil price shocks lead during the adjustment process to temporary divergences in output and inflation and also to reversals in the relative cyclical position across the monetary union. We distinguish between three types of oil price shocks: (1) an unanticipated permanent shock, (2) an unanticipated temporary shock and (3) an anticipated permanent shock. We illustrate the macroeconomic effects of these shocks by means of dynamic simulations and examine the respective stabilization role of monetary policy. While permanent oil price hikes always lead to stagflation, temporary shocks are associated with deflation in the very short run as the reduction of real income lowers the demand for the domestically produced good. The implications for monetary policy are also shock-specific. Monetary policy faces a signal extraction problem as it needs to determine whether oil price shocks are transitory or permanent in order to make appropriate decisions not only about the strength, but also the direction of monetary policy.","[Clausen, Volker] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Wohltmann, Hans-Werner] Univ Kiel, Inst Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; University of Kiel,"Clausen, V (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",vclausen@vwl.uni-due.de; wohltmann@economics.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,13,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The procedure we propose is based on the monocentric model, but we illustrate how it can be used in the case of more than one business center. As a case study we focus on the region of Paris and discuss the impacts of road pricing on urban form. Among road pricing schemes, we consider the linear toll (proportional to traveled distance) and cordon toll (a toll paid once the driver crosses a given border). Both schemes are compared to the no toll case (actual situation) and to the first-best (where total costs in the city are minimized). The linear toll is equivalent to an increase in the vehicle operating cost. It performs well with respect to the first-best solution but, since it applies identically to all trips, it is not likely to be relevant in practice. By comparison to the no-toll situation, optimal congestion pricing reduces the radius of the city and the average travel distance by 34% and 15%, respectively.

An increase in the rate of sexual maturation was observed over the 20-year period of this study. Menarcheal age in girls decreased by 0.59 years. The length of sexual maturation decreased: from 6.58 years to 3.85 years in girls and from 5.84 years to 3.65 years in boys. A significantly faster rate of sexual maturation was observed between 1990 and 2000.

This article considers what happens when the without-intervention portion of the sample begins to be treated with the intervention part way through the follow-up period. The authors focus on randomized control trials, whose sponsors increasingly guarantee all participants in the study the intervention-the control members with a lag-while noting that the problem and their proposed solution apply to non-experimental impact evaluations as well. Once the control group (or other counterfactual group) receives the intervention, the treatment-control comparison becomes a measure of the difference in impacts between interventions of different durations-longer in the treatment group than the control group-rather than a measure of the total impact of the longer duration compared to no intervention. To measure this total impact-which tends to matter more to policy than differential or short-term impacts-the authors propose to sum the available experimental impact estimates from consecutive time periods, thus combining an experimental measure of the impact of the short duration intervention with an incremental measure of the added impact of the longer duration. The statistical properties of this estimator are explored, as are the conditions under which it provides an unbiased estimate of the total long-term effects of treatment.","[Bell, Stephen H.] ABT Associates Inc, Bethesda, MD USA; [Bradley, M.

We find that the test has very appealing properties as far as the forecast errors of the two models are highly correlated.

Therefore, the purpose of this research is to point out advantages of using appropriate development strategies. Desk research method will be used for gathering information on business performance for hotels in Osijek-Baranja County and possibilities of strategic planning, case study method for hotel Waldinger and in-depth interview method for its employees. Also SWOT method and Porter's competitiveness model are used for the analysis of business environment. Results should provide an insight into possibilities and limitations of small hotel companies's market expansion, and the need for differentiated products and optimal market positioning. Hotel Waldinger is used as an example of good practice where a company successfully identified its strategic factors and focused business on profitable strategic units, applying social responsibility. Given that hotel companies represent an important component of tourism in eastern Croatia, the object of research is improving and increasing their competitiveness. This paper's focus is their organization and development strategies, and the contribution will be reflected in guidelines for appropriate strategies, implementation and controlling. While gathering information, restrictions were manifested in dividing small, medium and large hotel's performances data. Regarding hotel Waldinger and the questionnaire for its employees, there is a possibility of recent data absence because they were collected a year ago. The hotel industry represents an important determinant of tourism in Osijek-Baranja County and companies have recognized the need for business specialization. Stated is achievable with implementation of correct developmental strategies, generating increased business efficiency.

Mean stature for both groups is well above those found by Floud for British troops born in the 1880s and greater than that of Scottish convicts from the 1830s.

One of the most challenging econometric problems is to understand and model the behavior of the volatility through time. This paper deals with an impact of structural breaks on long memory of volatility using iterated cumulative sum of squares (ICSS) algorithm. Using this algorithm one can identify sudden changes in volatility of stock markets corresponding to major economic and political events that have been affecting stock markets worldwide. In this paper we considered daily data of PX and BUX indexes in period from 2004 till 2012 which includes recent global financial crisis of 2008-2009 years. For a comprehensive analysis, several sophisticated models of quantitative analysis have been adopted. We especially worked with GARCH and FIGARCH models with multiple sudden change dummies. When incorporating these sudden changes into conditional volatility models, volatility persistence or long memory property has significantly disappear. This finding means that ignoring an influence of sudden changes leads to overestimation of volatility persistence and potential errors by risk managers when interpreting Value-at-Risk. Therefore, inclusion of information on sudden shocks in conditional variance may improve the precision of volatility dynamics and forecasting.","[Sed'a, Petr] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,petr.seda@vsb.cz,"Seďa, Petr/X-1866-2018","Seďa, Petr/0000-0002-2205-6377",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,796,801,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000135,0

Organ is not only an instrument or a tool used during the church service, but it can certainly be claimed to be an inevitable part of cultural heritage. It is one of the most ancient types of musical instruments that is passed on from generation to generation for centuries. For this reason, its cultural value is practically invaluable. This paper provides main information on the organ, its main constituent parts and the building systems used from the very beginning of the organ building until the present day. More than eight hundred organs are registered altogether in the Republic of Croatia. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the most important organs that can be found in five counties in the eastern Croatia that represent an important and valuable part both of the Croatian and the European cultural heritage. By the number of registers (but not their cultural value) the largest organs can be found in the cathedrals of Osijek, Dakovo and Pozega. Beside the organs, the most important organ builders are also discussed in this paper. Some of the organs belong to the category of cultural monuments that have to be taken care of and maintained regularly. Therefore, they are under the protection of the Ministry of Culture, which is in charge of the development of mechanisms and the establishment of cultural heritage protection measures with the aim to provide their sustainability. The protection and preservation of cultural heritage ensure the persistence of cultural values and provide a potential for further development of the Republic of Croatia, its reputation, the stimulation of economic competitiveness as well as a better quality life in the European environment. This is very important having in mind the fact that many organs in the eastern Croatia were severely damaged or even completely destroyed during the Homeland war.","[Sercer, Mario; Kavic, Zlatica] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,,bioplam@ck.t-com.hr; zlatica.kavic@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,266,273,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400031,0

Based on the quarterly data for the 1998-2012 period, it is found that for all countries an increase in the money supply, domestic output slowdown or stronger growth abroad are factors behind a nominal exchange rate depreciation, just as predicted by the monetary model of exchange rate. However, the effects of domestic-foreign interest rate differential are quite heterogeneous, being in line with theoretical predictions of a standard monetary model for Poland only. According to the decomposition of variance, money supply and interest rates account for 30% to 46% of the exchange rate variation in the Czech Republic, from 10% to 14% in Hungary, and from 23% to 42% in Poland.","[Shevchuk, Victor] Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Econ Sociol & Philosophy, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Technology,"Shevchuk, V (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Econ Sociol & Philosophy, 24 Warszawska St, Krakow, Poland.",victorshevchuk@netscape.net,"Shevchuk, Victor Oleksiy/F-9951-2019",,,,,,14,0,0,3,7,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-52-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,149,156,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367243900018,0

This study estimates the costs associated with general aviation accidents in the United States. The direct costs are estimated and the indirect costs are estimated via the human capital approach in addition to the willingness-to-pay approach. The average annual accident costs attributed to general aviation are found to be $1.64 billion and $4.64 billion (2011 US$) utilizing the human capital approach and willingness-to-pay approach, respectively.

Food crises have deeply affected the behaviour of consumers towards the quality of products. The present work aims at analyzing the Tunisian consumers' perception of meat quality. Four dimensions of quality, i.e. appearance and experience, control and guarantee, healthiness and diseases, professional salesman and purchase place and four specific consumer types based on their socio-demographic and economic profiles were identified by means of factor and cluster analysis. One third of consumers (30%) are indifferent towards all quality attributes and belong to the underprivileged households situated in the south of the country. A low number of reasonable consumers are only attached to visual or experienced quality attributes but a more significant share of consumers (40%) seeks attributes related to control and guarantee attributes (brand, origin, controlled product). This type of consumers has higher education and income level. Moreover, a fifth group of consumers is more concerned with healthiness attributes and is represented by older consumers who live especially in the coastal areas of the country. The development of retail will undoubtedly contribute to modifying meat quality perception in Tunisia.","[Dhraief, Mohamed Zied; Khaldi, Raoudha] Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"Dhraief, MZ (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,26,6,6,0,5,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2012,11.0,4,,,,,33,40,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,V31XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000208915200005,0

Using mathematical properties of wavelets, we develop a statistical measure of traffic demand sensitivity with respect to GDP. This measure can be adapted in a flexible way to capture risk levels relevant for different investment horizons. We demonstrate the timescale decomposition of risk with Swedish traffic demand data for 1950-2005. In general, rail transport shows a stronger co-movement with GDP than road transport. Moreover, we examine the volatility exhibited by traffic demand. Our findings suggest that rail investments are more risky than road investments. Since the findings can be used for optimal investment timing and for choice between public investment alternatives, they are deemed important for public policy in general. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors first describe the methods used to account for potential reverse causality of WalMart's store location decisions, and then they discuss the literature assessing the company's effect on three aspects of community life: (a) retail (and nonretail) businesses, across large- and small-sized stores and in different business environments; (b) retail workers, wages, and types of jobs; and (c) producer and consumer welfare through the company's price-decreasing effect and other potential indirect effects. Last, articles focusing on a broad spectrum of local conditions that could be affected by the company, including poverty rates, social capital, food insecurity, policy effectiveness, and obesity are reviewed. For each dimension, evidence is found of both positive and negative effects, suggesting that we are still far from truly understanding the net effect of WalMart on local economies, let alone the overall consequences in the long run.","[Bonanno, Alessandro] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, NERCRD, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Bonanno, A (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, 207-D Armsby Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",abonanno@psu.edu,,,,,,,67,16,19,0,69,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We confirm that on average, workers in denser areas are more skilled. There is also strong over-representation of workers with particularly high and low skills in denser areas. These features are consistent with patterns of migration including negative selection of migrants to less dense areas and positive selection towards denser areas. Nonetheless migration, even in the long-run, accounts for little of the skill differences between denser and less dense areas. Finally, we find marked differences across age groups and some suggestions that much of the skill differences across areas can be explained by differences between occupational groups rather than within.

It conducts this investigation in two phases. The paper first examines factors associated with pre-foreclosure outcomes for subprime mortgages in default. It then examines factors associated with different outcomes for loans that enter foreclosure. These factors include less understood elements such as mortgage product features and borrower demographics. The analysis is based on detailed loan-level data and employs multinomial logit models in a hazard framework. Results show that default resolutions vary with product features and borrower demographics. Adjustable rate and interest-only mortgages, and loans with low- or no-documentation are more likely to enter foreclosure proceedings, and, once in foreclosure, are more likely to become REO. The existence of junior liens increases the probability of the loan remaining in default. Owner-occupancy is associated with lower likelihood of foreclosure initiation and REO, and greater likelihood of curing default. Additionally, default outcomes are impacted by local legal, economic and housing market conditions, and the equity in the home.","[Voicu, Ioan; Jacob, Marilyn; Rengert, Kristopher] Off Comptroller Currency, Washington, DC 20219 USA; [Fang, Irene] Citigroup Inc, New York, NY USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; Citigroup Incorporated,"Voicu, I (通讯作者)，Off Comptroller Currency, 250 E St SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA.",Ioan.voicu@occ.treas.gov,,,,,,,20,14,19,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Findings illuminate the specific experiences of minority ethnic workers, as well as similarities with majority ethnic non-unionized workers and highlight the paucity of individual employment advice and a growing crisis for workers' rights with the decline in collective union representation.","[Holgate, Jane] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Work & Employment Relat Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Pollert, Anna] Univ W England, Bristol Business Sch, Ctr Employment Studies Res, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Keles, Janroj; Kumarappan, Leena] London Metropolitan Univ, Working Lives Res Inst, London, England",University of Leeds; University of West England; London Metropolitan University,"Holgate, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Work & Employment Relat Div, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",j.holgate@leeds.ac.uk,"Keles, Janroj Yilmaz/Y-5499-2019","Keles, Janroj Yilmaz/0000-0003-3525-9760",,,,,37,16,17,0,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The paper considers two different types of incentive budgets: exogenous, and endogenous. The exogenous case represents the condition in which an external decision maker determines the incentive budget that is to be distributed among potential participants in off-hour deliveries. In the case of an endogenous incentive budget, the entity distributing the incentives must raise the necessary funds using revenue generation mechanisms such as tolls and fines. The optimal incentives are obtained from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of a mathematical program that maximizes the number of truck trips shifted to the off-hours as a function of the incentives. The mathematical models developed in this paper provide guidelines about how to optimally distribute financial incentives to foster off-hour deliveries.

The key empirical results show that there tends to be a negative relationship between the spot exchange rate (domestic-currency price of foreign currency) and nominal interest rate differential (approximately the domestic interest rate minus the foreign interest rate) at the shortest timescales, while a positive relationship is more frequently found at the longest timescales. This indicates that among models of exchange rate determination using the asset approach, the sticky-price models are supported in the short run and flexible-price models in the long run.","[Hacker, R.

A key feature is a measurement equation that relates the realized measure to the conditional variance of returns. The measurement equation facilitates a simple modeling of the dependence between returns and future volatility. Realized GARCH models with a linear or log-linear specification have many attractive features. They are parsimonious, simple to estimate, and imply an ARMA structure for the conditional variance and the realized measure. An empirical application with Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks and an exchange traded index fund shows that a simple Realized GARCH structure leads to substantial improvements in the empirical fit over standard GARCH models that only use daily returns.

Transport services produced in the countries of origin and tourism services provided at the destination are highly complementary, so these economies also tend to face coordination failures between firms, which result in under-production. Moreover, the presence of foreign firms poses the question of how much profit is retained by the destination. This paper analyses the joint effects of these problems on the destination's welfare, and the policies implemented to address them. Direct selling and bundling by foreign tour operators emerge as possible market arrangements. Four main results are obtained. First, in the direct selling situation the optimal policy depends on the relative importance of the problems. Second, tour operators always lead to over-production. Third, the presence of a single tour operator is not the solution to congestion. Finally, the switch from several tour operators to a single one is welfare reducing.","[Hernandez-Martin, Raul] Univ La Laguna, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, San Cristobal la Laguna 38071, Spain; [Alvarez-Albelo, Carmen D.] Univ La Laguna, Dept Anal Econ, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, San Cristobal la Laguna 38071, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de la Laguna,"Hernández-Martín, R (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Campus Guajara, San Cristobal la Laguna 38071, Spain.",calbelo@ull.es; rahernan@ull.es,"HERNANDEZ-MARTIN, RAUL/H-2474-2019; Hernández-Martín, Raúl/AAB-6280-2022; Alvarez-Albelo, Carmen D./F-4141-2016","HERNANDEZ-MARTIN, RAUL/0000-0001-5360-1908; Hernández-Martín, Raúl/0000-0001-5360-1908; Alvarez-Albelo, Carmen D./0000-0003-4220-3175",,,,,19,9,10,0,21,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

While many empirical researches are backed up with solid statistical techniques, most of them do not fully consider the influence of scale underlying empirical quantitative investigations. Using fine-scale home-to-work commuting data for Wallonia (Belgium). this paper re-evaluates Breheny's (1995) assertion that urban structure should hold the characteristics of major cities if substantial energy savings are to be achieved. A local scale approach highlights efficient settlements in terms of transport energy consumption not only within major towns, but also within remote rural areas. Furthermore, results suggest that influencing the urban form following local energy efficient examples rather than regional ones could also yield significant gains, without an extreme policy stance of re-urbanisation in major cities.

For rules defined on this domain, and on several of its subdomains, we explore the implications of these strategy-proofness requirements on the maximum size of the rules' range. We show that when all single-dipped preferences are admissible, the range must contain two alternatives at most. But this bound changes as we consider different subclasses of single-dipped preferences: we provide examples of subdomains admitting strategy-proof rules with larger ranges. We establish exact bounds on the maximal size of strategy-proof functions on each of these domains, and prove that the relationship between the sizes of the subdomains and those of the ranges of strategy-proof functions on them need not be monotonic. Our results exhibit a sharp contrast between the structure of strategy-proof rules defined on subdomains of single-dipped preferences and those defined on subsets of single-peaked ones.","[Barbera, Salvador] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, MOVE, Barcelona GSE, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Berga, Dolors] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona 17071, Spain; [Moreno, Bernardo] Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Malaga 29071, Spain",Barcelona School of Economics; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universitat de Girona; Universidad de Malaga,"Barberà, S (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, MOVE, Barcelona GSE, Edifici B, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",salvador.barbera@uab.cat; dolors.berga@udg.edu; bernardo@uma.es,"Berga, Dolors/G-4597-2015; Moreno, Bernardo/K-4602-2014; Barbera, Salvador/B-6042-2011","Barbera, Salvador/0000-0001-6586-2398; Berga, Dolors/0000-0002-4873-7904",,,,,15,29,33,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2012,39.0,2-3,,,SI,,335,352,,10.1007/s00355-011-0624-4,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,968FR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305963200006,0

These results can be used to compare (k-)approval rules with respect to their manipulability. Analytical results are obtained for the case of two voters, specifically, the values of k for which the k-approval rule is minimally manipulable-has the smallest number of manipulable preference profiles-under the various preference extensions are determined. For the number of voters going to infinity, an asymptotic result is that the k-approval rule with k around half the number of candidates is minimally manipulable among all scoring rules. Further results are obtained by simulation and indicate that k-approval rules may improve on the approval rule as far as manipulability is concerned.","[Peters, Hans; Storcken, Ton] Univ Maastricht, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Roy, Souvik] Univ Caen, F-14032 Caen, France",Maastricht University; Universite de Caen Normandie,"Peters, H (通讯作者)，Univ Maastricht, Dept Quantitat Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",h.peters@maastrichtuniversity.nl; t.storcken@maastrichtuniversity.nl; souvik.roy@unicaen.nl,,,,,,,20,8,8,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2012,39.0,2-3,,,SI,,399,429,,10.1007/s00355-011-0621-7,0.0,,,31,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,968FR,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305963200009,0

We build up normative evaluation models in which comparisons are made taking distances from this reference point rather than from the origin to be ethically relevant, by focussing upon poverty gaps and not incomes. When poverty lines differ for different groups in a socially heterogeneous population, choosing poverty gaps instead of incomes as the relevant indicator brings in normatively appealing classes of poverty indices not previously accommodated, for which poverty comparisons are implemented through sequential poverty gap curves (or poverty gap distributions) dominance. These conditions are logically related to those suggested by Atkinson and Bourguignon (Arrow and the foundations of the theory of economic policy, Macmillan, London, 1987) and Bourguignon (J Econom 42:67-80, 1989) for welfare comparisons. However, the proportion of poor individuals in the society and their average poverty gap play a role in our comparisons, though they do not in the existing poverty dominance criteria for heterogeneous populations.","[Lambert, Peter J.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Zoli, Claudio] Univ Verona, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy",University of Oregon; University of Verona,"Lambert, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",claudio.zoli@univr.it; plambert@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2012,39.0,2-3,,,SI,,649,673,,10.1007/s00355-011-0601-y,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,968FR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305963200020,0

This minimises the expected time of arrival at the destination, and all intermediate nodes, where expectation is based on a pessimistic (or risk-averse) view of unknown link delays. This may also be regarded as a hyperpath version of the Chabini and Lan (2002) algorithm, which itself is a time-dependent A* algorithm. Links are assigned undelayed travel times and maximum delays, both of which are potentially functions of the time of arrival at the respective link. Probabilities for link use are sought that minimise the driver's maximum exposure to delay on the approach to each node, leading to the determination of a pessimistic expected time of arrival at the destination and all intermediate nodes. Since the context considered is vehicle navigation, the probability of link use measures link attractiveness, so a link with a zero probability of use is unattractive while a link with a probability of use equal to one will have no attractive alternatives. A solution algorithm is presented and proven to solve the problem provided the node potentials are feasible and a FIFO condition applies to undelayed link travel times. The paper concludes with a numerical example. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Bell, Michael G.

This paper analyses a specific wine tourism segment, Madeira wine tourism, in the global context of tourist consumer behaviour, through an examination of the perceptions of visitors to wineries. Specifically, the paper investigates the indirect influence of destination image construct on global tourist satisfaction, mediated by tourist wine involvement. A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach is used to develop and test conceptualized relationships between one exogenous and two endogenous constructs: tourist perceptions about the attractiveness of Madeira Island (destination image), tourist involvement in Madeira wine and global satisfaction constructs. The findings indicate that global tourist satisfaction is influenced directly by the tourists' level of wine involvement and indirectly by their image of Madeira Island. The policy implications of the results must be integrated into the international context of the wine tourism market segment in order to explore additional exchange profits from this economic activity, such as the impact of the country image and perceptions of the wine product on the promotion of wine tourism in Europe.","[Sampaio, Ana] Univ Evora, Dept Math, P-7000671 Evora, Portugal; [Sampaio, Ana] Univ Inst Lisbon, Business Res Unit, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Evora; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Sampaio, A (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, Dept Math, Rua Romao Ramalho 59, P-7000671 Evora, Portugal.",sampaio@uevora.pt,,,,,,,167,10,12,12,94,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

First, international trade in talent has increased markedly. Second, international competitions such as the Champions League have become much more important. Using a theoretical model, we study how these changes affect competitive balance within national competitions, and quality differences between national competitions. Introducing international trade in talent leads to a flow to large countries, as the returns to talent are higher there. Wages increase in small countries, but decrease in large ones. The wage increase in small countries hurts small teams more than large ones. Therefore, competitive balance decreases. The wage decrease in large countries benefits small teams more, so competitive balance increases. The introduction of a Champions League implies the possibility to win a large amount of prize money. This is relatively more important for small teams. Hence, competitive balance increases in all countries, and talent flows from large to small countries, provided international trade is possible. Wages increase. When looking at both changes combined, we find that talent flows from small to large countries. Hence, in this sense, the trade effect dominates the Champions League effect. Competitive balance increases in all but the very smallest countries.","[Haan, Marco A.; Koning, Ruud H.] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [van Witteloostuijn, Arjen] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp Ctr Evolutionary Demog, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Groningen; University of Antwerp,"Haan, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.a.haan@rug.nl; r.h.koning@rug.nl; Arjen.vanWitteloostuijn@ua.ac.be,"Haan, Marco/B-5328-2009","Koning, Ruud/0000-0002-3083-2284; Haan, Marco/0000-0003-2295-1854; van Witteloostuijn, A./0000-0002-0287-5965",,,,,15,7,7,2,28,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Second, dividend income constitutes the major part of total return and dividend distributions have a clear seasonal pattern. Third, the results highlight several drawbacks of the Drappier indices, especially an upward bias in expected equity performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the empirical results of the two methodologies, the neural network obtained a higher accuracy rate than the logit model in an in-sample test. However, when tested with a holdout sample for verification, both models achieved a 100% accuracy rate. The study found that 'total liabilities to total assets' was a significant variable based on the results of both the t-test and logic analysis. Since hospitality firms are known for being highly leveraged, the conclusion can be drawn that extensive debt financing, when not accompanied by the competitive market value of equity, could play a pivotal role in forcing firms to file for bankruptcy.","[Park, Soo-Seon; Hancer, Murat] Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Hotel & Restaurant Adm, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Hancer, M (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Hotel & Restaurant Adm, 210 HESW, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",pnarssi@gmail.com; murat.hancer@okstate.edu,,"Hancer, Murat/0000-0002-4356-7416",,,,,78,21,22,0,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The key objective of the investigation is to enhance our understanding on carsharing behaviour in the City of Toronto. Unlike other studies on carsharing, this paper intends to build a comprehensive understanding of the multiple dimensions of users' behaviour including attitude towards environment, attitude towards safety, frequency of usage, membership duration, vehicle type choice and monthly demand, in terms of total vehicle-kilometre and vehicle-hour travel. The paper uses both descriptive and econometric approaches for in-depth investigations. One of the key contributions of the paper is linking carsharing with carbon offsetting. Investigations reveal that carsharing members are in general environmentally conscious people and are willing to pay for carbon offsetting if given an option. However, having the carbon offsetting option also encouraged a higher amount of driving per month. Results show that carsharing is most often used for off-peak period travel or on weekends, when transit service is poor and traffic congestion is low. The majority of trips made by carsharing members are short-distance trips. It is clear that carsharing is providing a segment of the population with enhanced accessibility and mobility and thus playing an important role in providing a seamless, integrated transportation service in the City of Toronto.

Various tests have corroborated the validity of the characteristic fourfold pattern of risk attitudes implied by the combination of probability weighting and value transformation. But is it also safe to assume stable PT preferences at the individual level? This is not only an empirical but also a conceptual question. Measuring the stability of preferences in a multi-parameter decision model such as PT is far more complex than evaluating single-parameter models such as Expected Utility Theory under the assumption of constant relative risk aversion. There exist considerable interdependencies among parameters such that allegedly diverging parameter combinations could in fact produce very similar preference structures. In this paper, we provide a theoretic framework for measuring the (temporal) stability of PT parameters. To illustrate our methodology, we further apply our approach to 86 subjects for whom we elicit PT parameters twice, with a time lag of 1 month. While documenting remarkable stability of parameter estimates at the aggregate level, we find that a third of the subjects show significant instability across sessions.","[Zeisberger, Stefan; Vrecko, Dennis; Langer, Thomas] Univ Munster, Finance Ctr Munster, D-48143 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Zeisberger, S (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Finance Ctr Munster, Univ Str 14-16, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",stefan.zeisberger@uzh.ch,"Lott, Corey/B-9795-2012; Zeisberger, Stefan/AAM-7569-2020","Zeisberger, Stefan/0000-0002-8412-622X",,,,,63,63,71,0,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2012,72.0,3,,,,,359,386,,10.1007/s11238-010-9234-3,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,885IJ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299772100005,0

In this setting, financial development favors a better matching between individual motivation and occupation, thereby increasing entrepreneurial utility despite increasing competition and so reducing profits.","Univ Paris 09, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Bianchi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",,,,,,,,45,37,42,0,39,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Slow development of Croatian rural tourism lays in many reasons, among other things there are inefficiency of destination management, low size of investments in touristic infrastructure, a lack of accommodation and insufficient education in tourist and accommodation business. In this paper the authors try to point out the positive role of new declared Regional Park Mura-Drava and its role in sustainable tourist development as it might have. The survey which was conducted with directors of County Tourist Boards in whose territory The Park was declare is used for the current status analysis of touristic offer and development of destination management. The authors emphasize the possibilities of many different kinds of local cooperation and public-private partnerships with the aim of tourist development in the observed area. Among other things, this paper describes a case-study of local co-operation in Municipality of Pitomaca. The goal of this partnership is to develop a reference center for organic agriculture and sustainable tourism in the abandoned barracks nearby Hungarian border, now in Regional Park area of protection.

The long-run coefficients suggested that Malaysian share prices were influenced positively by money supply and interest rate and negatively by inflation. Additionally, the results from the error correction mechanism indicate that real returns are Granger caused by real money growth and real interest rate. This study also reveals that real interest rate is verified to be a proper indicator as significant relationship has been perceived.

This article considers whether developing countries exhibiting more labour rights violations are associated with higher risk ratings. It draws from existing literature on the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the relationship between labour rights and FDI to illuminate the ways in which labour repression may indicate increased risk for potential investors. It implements a set of time series of cross-sections models for 95 developing countries, from 1985 to 2003. These models present predictors of a long-established risk index, plus an additional latent risk measure created through factor analysis of three separate and distinct risk ratings. Results indicate a consistent association between increased labour rights violations and increased risk ratings. The article extends the analysis to highlight the heterogeneous nature of FDI and possible sector-specific relationships between labour rights and risk ratings. The paper argues that the economic profile of a country may condition the relationship between labour rights and risk ratings.","Tulane Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Tulane University,"Egan, PJW (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",,,,,,,,68,5,6,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Poverty is both more widespread and deeper in very small and small towns than in large or very large cities. This basic pattern is generally robust to the choice of poverty line. The paper shows, further, that for all eight countries, a majority of the urban poor live in medium, small or very small towns. Moreover, it is shown that the greater incidence and severity of consumption poverty in smaller towns is generally compounded by similarly greater deprivation in terms of access to basic infrastructure services, such as electricity, heating gas, sewerage and solid waste disposal. We illustrate for one country Morocco that inequality within large cities is not driven by a severe dichotomy between slum dwellers and others. Robustness checks are performed to assess whether the findings in the paper hinge on a specific definition of urban area; are driven by differences in the cost of living across city-size categories; by reliance on an income-based concept of well-being; or by the application of small-area estimation techniques for estimating poverty rates at the town and city level.","[Lanjouw, Peter] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Poverty & Inequal Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Lanjouw, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Poverty & Inequal Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",celinef@gmail.com; fferreira@worldbank.org; planjouw@worldbank.org,,"Lanjouw, Peter/0000-0002-4150-7890",,,,,38,47,49,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

The percentage explained variance varied between 17% and 29.5%. This study reveals strong support to the hypotheses that personality is related to learning capacities with respect to eeconomical and managerial learning. The facets of the domain dimension conscientious seem to be highly relevant for al those subjects or courses that demand knowledge reproductive cognitive capacities. Creative thinking (originating form the domain openness) seems to be negatively related, although openness for values seems to be relevant for those subjects that demand insight and logical reasoning. Cordiality (originating from the domain extraversion) is negatively related to basic accounting skills & financial reporting, courses which are characterized by the lack of social interaction and demanding knowledge reproductive cognitive capacities. These results offer interesting possibilities to assess learning and managerial learning capacities. This can be useful for any organization in which knowledge productivity, but also effective economic and managerial learning is important, but also for any organization in need of innovational capacities and knowledge productivity.

The project is a series of activities that together achieve clearly defined objectives in a specified period of time and with a clearly defined budget and sources of funding. Such an inflow of capital has an impact on the local economy but also to the society itself. During the early nineties projects mainly dealt with direct distribution of goods through various chains of humanitarian aid distribution. Free food and clothing had negative influence to the retail of these goods, being a direct and unfair competition. End of nineties transfers the focus to works. Various programs for reconstruction with secure funding caused the founding of numerous construction companies and associated businesses. After the peaceful reintegration of territories direct help shifts towards services. UNHCR (United Nation's High Commissioner for Human Rights) and various foundations financed civil associations specialized for offering various forms of legal aid. These associations point out to faults in public practices, institutions or even laws. Skill of writing projects is present in associations exclusively. Large number of associations is founded and civil society is growing. CARDS (Community Assistance For Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation) program started at 2000. Program focuses on administration and puts pressure to associations to turn to cooperation with public administration instead of being an informal opposition. Cross-sector cooperation is developing to deal with public problems. PHARE (Pologne et Hongrie - Aide a Restructuration Economique - Program for the Reconstruction of the Economy of Hungary and Poland), ISPA (Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession) and SAPARD (Special Pre-accession Assistance for Agriculture and Rural Development) programs bring concrete projects but also concrete rules for spending funds. Associations struggle to cope with complex procedures and face specialization or closing down while public administration is getting involved more. There is still a prevailing belief that complexity of these procedures makes national funding preferable. Consulting agencies for international funds are emerging. Project management relies to informal education and foreign consultants dominate. Reducing incentives in agriculture is putting pressure but adjustment to EU rules is upgrading production quality. IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession assistance) Program comes parallel with administrative reforms on the national level. Writing projects remains a problem. Regional development agencies are founded and adjusted development strategies made to deal with the problem. Project manager becomes an occupation and formal education necessity. Cooperation becomes an obligation. Upcoming period 2013-2020 will be emphasizing cross-border cooperation and multi-annual planning. Project managers will become consultants and associations will specialize or close. Preparation for this period will mean the difference between success and lagging behind.","[Lajos, Damir] Osijek Baranja Cty, Osijek, Croatia",,,damir.lajos@obz.hr,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,79,90,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600009,0

We contrast both with a novel optimizing thermostat that finds the optimal trade-off between comfort and cost. We compare the thermostats' performance both theoretically and via numerical simulations. The simulations show that, under plausible assumptions, the optimizing thermostat's advantage is economically large. Importantly, the electricity demand of the rigid thermostat (but not the optimizing thermostat) ceases to respond to electricity prices on precisely the days when the electricity grid tends to be near capacity. These are the times when demand response is the most socially valuable to avoid massive price spikes. The social benefits of the optimizing thermostat may provide incentives for utilities and regulators to encourage its adoption.","[Liang, Yong] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Levine, David I.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Walter A Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shen, Zuo-Jun (Max)] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Liang, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",yongliang@berkeley.edu,"Shen, Zuo-Jun Max/JXM-7549-2024","Shen, Zuo-Jun Max/0000-0003-4538-8312; Liang, Yong/0000-0002-7052-2248","Directorate For Engineering [1068862] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1068862] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",,,18,24,27,0,31,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2012,33.0,4,,,,,61,95,,10.5547/01956574.33.4.4,0.0,,,35,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,012QL,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309251500004,0

Application of the new Law on Tourism Communities and Promotion of Croatian Tourism (NN 152/2008.), in its part relating to the obligation of tourism master planning for the local level, should ensure the key development inputs and precede development of spatial plans at the level of tourist destinations. It is questionable whether in Croatia have been created the adequate legal and institutional frameworks for the effective activities of the tourist region of Slavonia and Baranja, since current legislation does not recognize the concept of regions and regionalization. The existing legal framework of joint activities and mutual partnership of the tourism sector of the region of Slavonia and Baranja is based on a voluntary basis, which is insufficient for more significant role and positioning of the region on the tourist market. As part of the strategic marketing plan for Croatian tourism for the period 2010th to 2014th operational plans of individual regions, not sufficiently developed, are set. The lack of a strategic marketing plan for tourism development for the region of Slavonia and Baranja inhibits stronger development of tourism in the region, which only as a whole can constitute a tourist destination that should be uniquely managed. In order to determine the attitudes of the individual tourist boards, amongst directors of tourist boards of the region was conducted the primary research with purpose to investigate opinion of respondents on the need for adoption of a unified master plan at the regional level, as well as supporting the idea of creating a unique tourist destination management organization, and a unique marketing program at the same level. The results showed that the region of Slavonia and Baranja could achieve significantly better tourist results, if moving away from the concept of developing own tourism products by certain counties without sufficient differentiation and recognition. In this respect, efforts should primarily focus on creating a recognizable tourist region with specific tourist subregions within, in which the role of the regional tourism organization (RTO) would be taken by destination management organization (DMO), in charge of promoting the tourism product of the region as a whole.","[Loncaric, Biljana] Tourist Board Slavonski Brod, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia; [Bolfek, Berislav] Univ Appl Sci Slavonski Brod, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,"Loncaric, B (通讯作者)，Tourist Board Slavonski Brod, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia.",info@tzgsb.hr; berislav.bolfek@gmail.com,"Bolfek, Berislav/AAZ-1763-2021; Rodrigues de Assis, Iracema/HJZ-4230-2023; BOLFEK, BERISLAV/GQA-4074-2022","Bolfek, Berislav/0000-0001-6968-2319;",,,,,7,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,194,200,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600021,0

One of the primary factors hindering the transition has been ambivalent public and professional perceptions of the effectiveness of the USE in addressing the problems associated with inequalities of access to higher education. This essay contributes to research in this area through a case study analysing the introduction of the USE in Ul'yanovsk Oblast'. It draws on survey data collected from pupils and parents of final year high school students about the USE reforms and explores the reasons why the transition to USE did not proceed as smoothly as its creators might have envisaged. Here the negative perceptions of the high-school graduates and parents reveal that the reforms have been judged to be largely ineffective with regard to reducing the role of material and regional inequalities in determining access to higher education, and in addressing how the differing institutional status of ordinary 'comprehensive' and elite, specialised schools continues to create inequalities in access to higher education in Russia.","Ulyanovsk State Univ, Res Ctr REG, Ulyanovsk 432063, Russia",Ulyanovsk State University,"Luk'yanova, E (通讯作者)，Ulyanovsk State Univ, Res Ctr REG, 4A Pushkin St,Rooms 116-118, Ulyanovsk 432063, Russia.",jenya_lukyanova@mail.ru,,,,,,,27,12,12,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,10,,,SI,,1893,1910,,10.1080/09668136.2012.717361,0.0,,,18,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,030ZD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310607800005,0

In 1900 almost a fifth of all persons born in French Canada lived in the U.S. These migrants exerted considerable efforts to maintain their language and to replicate their home country institutions, most notably the schooling system, in their new country. For decades, this resistance to assimilation generated considerable attention and concern in the U.S. The concerns are strikingly similar to those often invoked today in discussions of immigration from Hispanic countries, notably Mexico. Mexicans may not be assimilating into mainstream America as European immigrants did. We look at the convergence in the educational attainment of French Canadian immigrants across generations relative to native English-speaking New Englanders and to European Roman Catholic immigrants. The educational attainment of Franco-Americans lagged that of their fellow citizens over a long period of time. By the time of the 2000 Census, they appear to have largely achieved parity. The effects of World War II, especially military service, were very important in speeding up the assimilation process through a variety of related channels: educational attainment, language assimilation, marrying outside the ethnic group, and moving out of New England. Economic assimilation was very gradual because of the persistence of ethnic enclaves. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J,"McBride, S",,,,"McBride, Stephen",,,The Scope and Limits of a Public-Private Hybrid: Dispute Settlement under NAFTA Chapter 19,NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public-Private; Authority; Trade Disputes; NAFTA Chapter 19,,"Globalisation is often depicted as having led to an increase in private authority at the expense of that of the state. It is important to correctly specify the scope that private authority has achieved and the capacity of states to push back and limit that authority. This article grounds these theoretical issues in a discussion of the hybrid, public-private dispute settlement mechanism set up in the original Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (CUSTFA), and later extended into Chapter 19 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It finds that privatising the enforcement process did make a difference. Trade experts on panels saw things differently to judges and in ways that were more sympathetic to exporters. This favoured Canadian and Mexican interests. However, the arrangement lacked deep roots. It was a late-stage compromise in trade negotiations. This rendered it vulnerable to a US counterattack once panels began to rule in favour of Canadian and Mexican challenges to US trade determinations. The transfer of quasi-judicial authority to a public-private hybrid proved contingent, partly on the hegemonic state's ongoing level of comfort with the arrangement, as well as on a lack of business consensus within the United States.","McMaster Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",McMaster University,"McBride, S (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",mcbride@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,62,1,1,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This paper identifies and compares the factors that influence individuals and companies to adopt e-banking. The factors that hypothesized to affect the adoption of e-banking have been derived from theories such as the decomposed theory of planned behavior, technology acceptance model, and diffusion of innovation theory and relevant findings from empirical studies. Surveys were conducted on individuals and companies located in Romania. The results showed that technical resources, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, cost and compatibility are factors that influence both the individuals and companies to adopt e-banking. Interestingly, the study also found that security is an important determinant for individuals, not companies while accessibility is an important determinant for companies, not individuals. The results of the study provide in-depth understanding of factors that influence individuals and companies in adopting e-banking. Understanding these factors will provide better guides for banking institutions in designing strategies to promote e-banking adoption among their customers, who are individuals and companies.","[Moga, Liliana Mihaela] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati 800008, Romania; [Nor, Khalil Md] Univ Teknol Malaysia, UTM Skudai, Skudai 81310, Malaysia",Dunarea De Jos University Galati; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Moga, LM (通讯作者)，Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati 800008, Romania.",liliana.moga@gmail.com; kmdnor@fppsm.utm.my,"Moga, Liliana Mihaela/C-1389-2011",,"CNCSIS - UEFISCSU [1852/2008, 957/2009]",CNCSIS - UEFISCSU(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)),"This work was supported by CNCSIS - UEFISCSU, project number: PNLI IDEI 1852/2008, contract number 957/2009.",,21,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,840,+,,,,,,3,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700087,0

Such problems can be solved by choosing a feasible path among k shortest paths.
